Definitions
- This invention relates in general to communication systems, and more specifically to a method and apparatus for reducing peak power requirements in transmitters within such systems.
- Transmitters and particularly higher power transmitters specifically power amplifiers (PAs) are one of the more expensive and more highly stressed, from a power perspective, components of a communications system.
- PAs power amplifiers
- PAs power amplifiers
- transmitters or power amplifiers are subject to or often experience relatively higher failure rates than some system components.
- These higher power transmitters are typically found in base stations. Base stations, such as those found in cellular or like communications system are a key link in providing satisfactory service for hundreds and possibly thousands of customers.
- FTMs radio frequency Fourier Transform Matrices
- FIG. 1 depicts a simplified diagram of a portion of a communications system suitable for employing an embodiment according to the present invention
- FIG. 2 depicts a simplified block diagram of a preferred embodiment of a transmitter according to the present invention
- FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of a peak to average reduction apparatus suitable for use in the FIG. 2 transmitter in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 4 – FIG. 6 depict some operating waveforms and performance graphs of the FIG. 3 apparatus.
- the present disclosure concerns communications systems that utilize transmitters to provide service to communications units or more specifically user thereof operating therein. More particularly various inventive concepts and principles embodied in methods and apparatus for the reduction of peak power requirements for transmitters are discussed and disclosed.
- the communications systems of particular interest are those being deployed such as GSM, GPRS, EDGE, TETRA, iDEN, CDMA, W-CDMA, CDMA2000, 2.5G, or 3G systems that use modulation formats such as QPSK, DQPSK, OQPSK, BPSK, QAM, and spread spectrum or variations and evolutions thereof that require cost effective high availability transmitters.
- FIG. 1 shows a base station 101 inter-coupled to an antenna system 103 to provide coverage to users within the general coverage area 105 .
- the antenna system 103 depicted, is a sector gain system with 3 sectors 107 , 109 , 111 depicted, each covering, nominally, 120 degrees, although other arrangements such as 6 sectors, etc. would be appropriate.
- the base station will supply entirely different signals to each sector of the antenna and possibly multiple signals to one or more of the sectors. Even when an omni directional antenna is used the station will often need to supply multiple signals to the omni directional structure.
- the base station is further coupled at 113 to a base site controller and switch and eventually the Public Switched Telephone System typically via a dedicated link such as a T1 terrestrial link or the like.
- the base station handles the radio links to and from subscriber devices or users of portable or mobile equipment and the land or terrestrial based portions of the systems or networks.
- the base stations can be thought of as including and inter-coupled a communications and control function 119 , a receiver function 117 and a transmitter function 115 .
- Each of these functions can be quite complex in there own right and comprise redundant systems.
- the receiver and transmitter functions or blocks will inevitably include tens of receivers and transmitters.
- These stations and antenna systems are generally known and available from multiple suppliers, such as Motorola, etc., and when the transmitters are modified and constructed according to the principles and concepts disclosed herein improved performance and cost advantages can be realized.
- the FIG. 2 transmitter is a multi-channel transmitter having reduced peak power requirements.
- Multi-channel transmitter is used to describe a transmitter having multiple parallel paths and amplifier stages such as may be encountered or may be particularly well suited for amplifying signals produced by a Fourier Transform Matrix (FTM) or for driving a FTM.
- FTM Fourier Transform Matrix
- the reduced peak power requirement is accomplished by limiting the peak to average ratios (PARs) for the signals that are presented to the amplifiers, then amplified, and thus the amplified signals.
- the peak to average is limited at base band but rather than limiting the PAR of the input signals as is traditional they are first processed through a base band FTM.
- the multi-channel transmitter having reduced peak power requirements includes a peak to average reduction apparatus 201 .
- This apparatus includes a Fourier Transform Matrix (FTM) 203 coupled to at least one input signal and from there coupled to a processing unit 205 that limits peak values and provides peak limited output signals to a mixer 227 .
- the mixer converts these base band signals to a radio frequency and these signals are amplified by an amplifier 207 and then decomposed or perhaps more accurately re-composed at or by a radio frequency or analog FTM to provide at least one transmit signal.
- FTM Fourier Transform Matrix
- the FTM 203 preferably a digital FTM implemented in software via a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) or an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or combination thereof, is coupled to the at least one input signal 212 and preferably a plurality of such signals 211 – 214 and provides a plurality of FTM output signals 219 – 222 , where each of the FTM output signals comprises a combination of phase shifted versions of the at least one input signal and preferably plurality of input signals according to generally known FTM techniques.
- DSP Digital Signal Processor
- ASIC Application Specific Integrated Circuit
- the input signal or signals is preferably a base band signal or signals intended for transmission on one or more radio channels with a channel here being interpreted as one or more carriers intended to provide coverage in a particular coverage area.
- a typical example would be a plurality of input signals each comprising a code division, time division, or frequency division multiple access base band signal intended for transmission, on one or more carrier frequencies, within one sector of a plurality of sectors, such as 107 , 109 , or 111 .
- this may be typical the principles and concepts herein discussed will have application and be equally advantageous, regardless of the particular form of modulation and channel access employed provided of course that the modulation will withstand or to the extent that the modulation can withstand the inevitable distortion that results from the peak limiting action.
- base band signals used variously for GSM, GPRS, EDGE, TETRA, iDEN, CDMA, W-CDMA, CDMA2000, 2.5G, or 3G will work equally well.
- the processing unit 205 includes a plurality of base band processing functions (four depicted) that are each coupled to one of the plurality of FTM output signals.
- the processing unit operates to process the FTM signal in a manner that makes it more compatible with or less demanding on a linear power amplifier.
- One example of such processing is limiting a peak value or all peak values for each of the plurality of FTM output signals to provide a plurality of peak limited output signals 223 – 226 .
- a preferred approach for doing this limiting is through the use of a clipping function that operates to limit peaks of each of the FTM output signals.
- this clipping function is a so called windowed clipping function that operates to limit peaks according to a predetermined function that lowers the probability that a peak value will exceed a predetermined value for each of the output signals.
- the power amplifier 207 that has a plurality of amplifiers 233 – 236 coupled to a plurality of signals 229 – 232 , each amplifier having an input coupled to one of the signals where each of these signals correspond to one of the peak limited output signals and operable to provide an amplified output signal, wherein the plurality of amplifiers provide a plurality of amplified output signals 237 – 240 , respectively.
- a preferred approach for providing the signals includes a mixer 227 or plurality of mixers coupled to the plurality of peak limited output signals to convert the peak limited output signals to provide the plurality of signals for the amplifier inputs.
- Each of the peak limited output signals is converted from a base band frequency or bit rate of a few megabits per second to an analog signal at a transmission radio frequency of, for example, either 800 to 1000 MHz or 1.8 GHz to 2.2 GHz or more.
- the mixers include known digital to analog converters with appropriate filtering followed by a mixer driven by a local oscillator (none specifically shown).
- One last element of the transmitter is a radio frequency or analog FTM that is coupled to the plurality of amplified output signals 237 – 240 to provide at least one transmit signal 242 corresponding one to one with the at least one input signal 212 and preferably a plurality of transmitter signals 241 – 244 corresponding one to one with the input signals 211 – 214 .
- 241 is shown terminated while 242 – 244 provide signals for or to sector 1 –sector 3 of the antenna.
- the reversal in order is a result of going through two FTMs. Note that while this disclosure has been developed around the use of 4 ⁇ 4 matrices the principles and concepts disclosed and described apply to essentially any size matrix and the matrix need not be square as here.
- Analog FTMs are known and available in various dimensions such as here a 4 ⁇ 4 matrix from suppliers such as Anaren Microwave.
- the FTM is a series of hybrid combiners that combines the input signals at specific phase angles.
- the typical bandwidth for the matrix is 200 MHz with an insertion loss of 0.5 dB.
- the multi-channel transmitter is preferably arranged and constructed for transmitting code division, time division, or frequency division multiple access signals on multiple sectors.
- the input FTM is, preferably, a digital FTM with one or more base band input signals
- the processing unit includes, preferably, a windowed clipping function, and the radio frequency FTM that is an analog FTM.
- the base band signals are processed at base band in a form that represents the signals input to the plurality of radio frequency amplifiers in order to limit the demands on the plurality of power amplifiers thus reducing the peak power requirements for the multi-channel amplifier.
- the digital FTM appears to be an extra cost and also note that with the FTM depicted where basically 3 signals are input to a 4 ⁇ 4 matrix four mixer line ups are required in order to convert the composite or peak limited output signals to radio frequencies whereas in a conventional approach only one mixer per input signal would be required.
- the peak to average reduction apparatus 201 is for reducing peak power requirements of a multi-charnel transmitter and it does so by reducing Peak to Average Ratios (PARs) of signals that are representative in amplitude characteristics of the signals that will be applied to each power amplifier in the multi-channel transmitter.
- the apparatus includes the Fourier Transform Matrix (FTM) 203 , mentioned above, that is coupled to at least one input signal 212 and preferably a plurality of input signals 211 – 214 .
- FTM Fourier Transform Matrix
- the FTM is, preferably a digital FTM, for providing a plurality of output signals 219 – 222 where each comprises a combination of phase shifted versions of the one or more input signals.
- the processing unit 205 that is coupled to the plurality of output signals 219 – 222 that operates to or for limiting a peak value for each of the plurality of output signals in order to provide a plurality of peak limited output signals 223 – 226 .
- the peak limited output signals are suitable for generating using foe example the mixer discussed above, a plurality of signals or low-level signals for driving amplifiers in the multi-channel transmitter.
- the peak to average reduction apparatus is preferably coupled to a plurality of input signals each comprising a base band signal, such as a code division, time division, or frequency division multiple access base band signal, intended for transmission on a radio channel such as on one sector of a plurality of sectors or one sector antenna or a multiple sector antenna structure.
- a base band signal for CDMA can include pilot, paging, and sync signals, and as many as 61 voice or data payload signals for each of multiple carriers.
- a typical bit rate for a IS-95 base band signal is approximately 1.3 M bits per second and other versions of CDMA can go much higher.
- the apparatus or processing unit 205 preferably, includes a clipping function 301 comprising, but not limited to, four blocks or one per output signal, that operates to limit peaks of each of output signals.
- This clipping function 301 is preferably a windowed clipping function that operates to perform a relatively heavy clip to limit peaks according to a predetermined function that lowers the probability that peak values will exceed a predetermined value for each of the output signals.
- a filter 303 coupled to an output of each of the clipping functions 301 and operating to reduce undesired and higher frequency signals resulting from the clipping function.
- a second clipping function 305 coupled to an output of each of the filters 303 that operates to further limit peaks of each of the output signals 223 – 226 .
- the peak to average reduction apparatus 201 is suitable for implementation in an integrated circuit form as either a DSP or ASIC or combination of both as will be recognized by one of ordinary skill given the principles and concepts disclosed herein.
- a 4 ⁇ 4 digital FTM can be described by the following matrix:
- V out 1 0.5 ⁇ V in 1 ⁇ 0°+0.5 ⁇ V in 2 ⁇ 90°+0.5 ⁇ V in 3 ⁇ 90°+0.5 ⁇ V in 4 ⁇ 180°
- the crest factor of a signal is defined as the ratio of peak power to average power.
- PAR peak-to-average ratio
- CDF cumulative distribution function
- crest factor will be defined as the PAR at 0.01%. For example, a 10 dB PAR will imply that there is a 0.01% probability that a signal power will be greater than 10 dB above the average power.
- the windowed clipping algorithm is an excellent approach to satisfying these objectives.
- the clipping is implemented digitally in base band processing so that the data may be processed in non-real time.
- Various forms of windowed clipping algorithms will suit the purposes. Referring to FIG. 4 an algorithm is described that uses two thresholds to limit the peaks of the signal 401 .
- the soft clipping threshold is designated as Tclp while the hard clip threshold is called Tsat. The user determines the values of these thresholds experimentally based on a particular system set up.
- the first step in the window clipping algorithm is to scan the input waveform for peaks that exceed the clip thresholds. Once the peak of a signal exceeding the thresholds has been identified either a hard clip or soft clip will be applied.
- the peak index in FIG. 4 is designated as t max 407 .
- the peak portion of the waveform is convolved with an inverted Hanning window 403 .
- Various other types of windows will also work properly as those of ordinary skill in the art will realize.
- the equations below show the Hanning window, h j , the window clipping function, w j , and the window length, L.
- h j [1 ⁇ cos(2 ⁇ j /( L ⁇ 1))]/2
- w j ( n ) 1+( c ⁇ 1) ⁇ h j
- the filter 303 was implemented in DSP form to have the following characteristics.
- the filter should have a flat pass band to preserve the characteristics of other channel or pulse shaping filters. In addition a steep transition band and adequate attenuation are needed to ensure that the filtered waveform will meet channel specifications.
- the power spectral densities for the points marked 1 – 4 in FIG. 3 are shown.
- the first clipping function's threshold value is set to a low level to produce a heavy clip.
- the output of the first clipper is filtered to eliminate the splatter that is generated from the heavy clipping function. After filtering, the resultant signal is clipped again.
- the second clipping function's threshold is set to clip the signal very lightly. There will be some spectral re-growth due to the second clip but it should be acceptable since the clip is light.
- This method allows the user to increase the peak-to-average ratio reduction at the expense of a slight degradation in adjacent channel power (ACP) at the power amplifiers respective inputs.
- ACP adjacent channel power
- the power amplifier is operated at its rated power then it is likely that the non-linearities of the power amplifiers will produce adjacent channel splatter that exceeds that of there respective input signals. Therefore, the actual ACP performance seen at the antenna output may not be degraded at all by the inclusion of the second clipping function.
- the PAR reduction resulting from the second clipping function may result in an improved ACP at the antenna output even though the ACP at the power amplifier input is degraded.
- the waveform designated 1 Using the input to the first window clipper, the waveform designated 1 , as the reference, one can see how the standard IS-95 channel filter with a 3 dB corner frequency of 590 KHz and 45 dB of attenuation has shaped the spectrum prior to any window clipping or further filtering.
- the PAR at 0.01% of the original signal is 9.75 dB.
- Clipping the signal, using clipping function 301, from a 0.01% PAR of 9.75 dB down to 4.57 dB results in a rise of the out-of-band energy as shown by the waveform designated 2 .
- the clipped signal is then filtered with the resulting spectrum shown by the waveform designated 3 .
- the peak-to-average ratio has increased to 5.62 dB at 0.01%. Clipping the signal a second time brings the 0.01% PAR back down to 4.66 dB, but produces additional splatter as shown by the waveform designated 4 . Note that the splatter is still lower than the original noise floor established by the channel filter.
- FIG. 6 shows how the peak-to-average ratio changes throughout the processing chain. See the Table below for a summary of various information relevant to the waveforms of FIG. 6 .
- the changes in the peak-to-average ratio can be broken down into changes in the peak power and changes in average power, as shown in the table below.
- waveform 1 as the reference we can see that the clipping operation performed by clipping function 301 as depicted in waveform 2 greatly reduces the peak power of the signal while reducing the average power to a lesser extent.
- waveform 3 the average falls slightly due to attenuation in the pass band of the filter, but the peaks increase due to changes in the signal in the complex plane.
- the signal is clipped, albeit lightly, a second time. The result is another dB of reduction in the peak power while the average power remains relatively unchanged as shown in waveform 4 .
- This method includes coupling at least one input signal to a Fourier Transform Matrix (FTM), preferably a digital FTM, to provide a plurality of FTM output signals each comprising a combination of phase shifted versions of the one or more input signals. Then the method processes the plurality of FTM output signals by limiting a peak value for each of the FTM output signals to provide a plurality of peak limited output signals and then converts the peak limited output signals from a base band frequency to a transmission radio frequency to provide a plurality of radio frequency signals.
- FTM Fourier Transform Matrix
- Preferably coupling at least one input signal actually includes coupling a plurality of base band signals, such as code division, time division, or frequency division multiple access base band signals, intended for transmission on a radio channel, such as transmission within a sector of a plurality of sectors.
- Processing the FTM output signals further comprises clipping, preferably using a windowed clipping function as discussed above, each of the FTM output signals according to a predetermined function that lowers the probability that any peak value will exceed a predetermined value for each of the FTM output signals. This clipping is preferably followed by filtering each of the FTM output signals, as clipped, to reduce undesired signals resulting from the clipping.
- This method may be used advantageously for transmitting code division, time division, or frequency division, time division, or frequency division multiple access signals on multiple sectors or multiple carriers on multiple sectors.

Vout1 | Vout2 | Vout3 | Vout4 | ||
Vin1 | 0.5∠0 | 0.5∠−90 | 0.5∠−90 | 0.5∠−180 |
Vin2 | 0.5∠−90 | 0.5∠−180 | 0.5∠0 | 0.5∠−90 |

Vin4 | 0.5∠−180 | 0.5∠−90 | 0.5∠−90 | 0.5∠0 |
This can also be represented by the equations:
Vout1=0.5·Vin1∠0°+0.5·Vin2∠−90°+0.5·Vin3∠−90°+0.5·Vin4∠−180°
Vout2=0.5·Vin1∠−90°+0.5·Vin2∠−180°+0.5·Vin3∠0°+0.5·Vin4∠−90°
Vout3=0.5·Vin1∠−90°+0.5·Vin2∠0°+0.5·Vin3∠−180°+0.5·Vin4∠−90°
Vout4=0.5·Vin1∠−180°+0.5·Vin2∠−90°+0.5·Vin3∠−90°+0.5·Vin4∠0°
Either the matrix or the equations show the relationship between the output signals Vout and input signals Vin. It turns out to be reasonably straight forward to perform these calculations in a DSP.
Essentially, the CCDF is a plot of the PARs from 0 to 100%. It is convenient to work in terms of distribution functions since the peak level and the amount of time spent at and above the crest factor is important. Simply stated, the shape of the CCDF is important. For the purposes of this disclosure, crest factor will be defined as the PAR at 0.01%. For example, a 10 dB PAR will imply that there is a 0.01% probability that a signal power will be greater than 10 dB above the average power.

There will be some discontinuities around the peak region since only that portion of the signal is being filtered but they should be substantially less than those associated with a hard clip.
