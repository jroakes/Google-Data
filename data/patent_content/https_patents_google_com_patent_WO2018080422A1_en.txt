Description
POINT OF INTEREST SELECTION BASED ON A USER REQUEST
FIELD
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to geographic information systems.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Geographic information systems provide for the archiving, retrieving, and manipulating of data that has been stored and indexed according to geographic coordinates of its elements. Geographic information systems and other services can allow a user to request geographic imagery associated with an object or location of interest. For instance, a user may request imagery associated with a particular store, location, landmark, etc. The geographic information system can provide geographic imagery depicting the object or location of interest in response to the request to the user.
[0003] Geographic information systems can offer imagery of geographic regions of interest in a variety of different formats and from a variety of different view perspectives. For instance, geographic imagery can be provided as map imagery, satellite imagery, aerial imagery, interactive panoramic imagery presented from a perspective at or near ground level, and other imagery. Certain geographic information systems or services can provide interactive three-dimensional representations of a geographic area. Users can navigate a virtual camera to view the three-dimensional representations from a plurality of different perspectives.
[0004] Users of geographic information systems may wish to view information associated with locations or points of interest. Many conventional geographic information systems require a specific query of a location and/or a manual navigation to the location for information associated with the location to be presented to the user. Various mapping services offer "random" location selection techniques that allow a location to be selected randomly and for information associated with the location to be presented to the user.
However, such location selection techniques may not take into account potential user interest in a location when selecting the locations, and may select locations that are uninteresting or not noteworthy to a user. For instance, such location selection techniques may select the location based on a random selection of latitude, longitude coordinates. Further, such location selection techniques may unduly limit the potential locations that can be selected.
SUMMARY
[0005] Aspects and advantages of embodiments of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be learned from the description, or may be learned through practice of the embodiments.
[0006] One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer- implemented method of determining geographic location data. The method includes receiving, by one or more computing devices, data indicative of a request for location data associated with a geographic information system. The method further includes determining, by the one or more computing devices, a set of location constraints based at least in part on a predefined probability scheme associated with one or more attributes associated with a plurality of points of interest associated with the geographic information system. The method further includes identifying, by the one or more computing devices, a plurality of candidate points of interest from the plurality of points of interest, such that each candidate point of interest satisfies each constraint of the determined set of constraints. The method further includes selecting, by the one or more computing devices, a point of interest for presentation to a user from the plurality of candidate points of interest. The method further includes providing, by the one or more computing devices, data associated with the selected point of interest to a user device associated with the geographic information system.
[0007] Other example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems, apparatus, tangible, non-transitory computer-readable media, user interfaces, memory devices, and electronic devices for providing location data to users.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0015] Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the embodiments, not limitation of the present disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that aspects of the present disclosure cover such modifications and variations.
[0016] Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing geographic location data to a user. For instance, a request for viewing location data for an unspecified point of interest (POI) within a user interface associated with a geographic information system (GIS) can be received. The user interface can be associated with a virtual mapping environment. A POI can be any suitable location, feature, entity, etc. associated with one or more locations. For instance, in some implementations, a POI may refer to a particular location such as a restaurant, landmark, etc. In some implementations, a POI may refer to a geographic area, such as a country, city, county, town, region, municipality, etc. The request can be a request to view information associated with a "randomly selected" (e.g. selected according to example aspects of the present disclosure in response to receiving the user request for the location data) POI. Upon receiving the request, a set of location constraints can be determined based at least in part on a predefined probability scheme associated with one or more attributes associated with a plurality of POIs. The set of constraints can define attribute values and/or attribute value ranges required to satisfy the set of constraints. A plurality of candidate POIs can be identified having attribute values that satisfy the set of
constraints. A POI can be selected (e.g. uniformly selected at random) from the plurality of candidate POIs, and information associated with the selected POI can be provided to the user.
[0017] More particularly, the request for viewing location data can be made responsive to a user interaction with a POI selection user interface element within the virtual mapping environment. The virtual mapping environment can be implemented, for instance, on a user device associated with the user. The user device can be any suitable user device, such as a smartphone, tablet, wearable computing device, laptop, desktop, mobile device, device capable of being carried by a user while in operation, display with one or more processors, vehicle system, navigation system, or other user device. The virtual mapping environment can be configured to display visual content associated with a geographic area. In some implementations, the virtual mapping environment can include a representation of a three- dimensional body (e.g. globe, planet, geoid, or other spheroid). In this manner, the visual content can be associated with the representation of the three-dimensional body. Such virtual mapping environment can allow a user to navigate the representation of the three-dimensional body to view various suitable locations associated with the three-dimensional body.
[0018] The POI selection element can be displayed within the virtual mapping
environment. The POI selection element can be configured to facilitate a provision of information associated with an unspecified, (e.g. non-predetermined) POI to the user. An unspecified POI can be a POI that is selected from a plurality of POIs subsequent to the user interaction with the POI selection element. For instance, the user can interact with the POI selection element of the virtual mapping environment as displayed by the user device. In this manner, the user interaction with the POI selection element can facilitate a selection of a POI from a plurality of POIs according to example aspects of the present disclosure, and a provision to the user of information associated with the selected POI.
[0019] In response to the user interaction, the user device can provide a request for location data to a remote computing device (e.g. server) associated with the virtual mapping environment. The server can be configured to determine a set of location constraints for selecting a POI. The location constraints can impose conditions that must be met by selected POI. The set of constraints can be determined using a probability scheme associated with one or more attributes of a plurality of points of interest. The plurality of POIs can include at least a subset of POIs stored in a POI database associated with the virtual mapping environment. Each POI in the plurality of POIs can have associated attribute data. The attribute data can specify one or more attributes, features, and/or characteristics associated
with the POL For instance, the attributes associated with the POIs can include a POI category attribute, a location attribute, a popularity attribute, and/or other suitable attribute. In some implementations, the attributes associated with the POIs can include one or more attributes associated with imagery depicting the POI. For instance, such imagery attributes can include attributes associated with a quality of such imagery, attributes associated with a date at which the imagery was captured, etc. Each attribute can have one or more associated attribute values. For instance, the attribute values for the POI category attribute can be a tourist attraction, geographical feature, historical location, business, restaurant, museum, theatre, landmark, country, city, county, neighborhood, district, or other suitable POI category. The attribute value for the location attribute can be, for instance, latitude and longitude coordinates of the POI. The attribute value for the popularity attribute can be a numerical or other representation of the popularity of the POI as determined by various suitable techniques. It will be appreciated that various other suitable attributes can be used having various other suitable attribute values.
[0020] The probability scheme can be a predefined probability scheme. In some implementations, the probability scheme can be set by the user, for instance, through an interaction with the virtual mapping environment. The probability scheme can assign probabilities to attribute values or value ranges for one or more attributes associated with the POIs. For instance, for the POI category attribute, the probability scheme can assign a probability of 50% to tourist attraction, 40% to geographical feature, and 10% to museum. For the popularity attribute, the probability scheme can assign a probability of 30% to a popularity score falling within a first popularity score range, and a probability of 70% to a popularity score falling within a second popularity score range. It will be appreciated that various other suitable probability schemes can be used.
[0021] The set of constraints can include one or more constraints that must be satisfied to be selected as the selected POI. The set of constraints can be determined based at least in part on the probability scheme. In particular, the set of constraints can be chosen randomly in accordance with the probabilities specified in the probability scheme. In this manner, the set of constraints can include attribute values and/or attribute value ranges for the one or more attributes. For instance, in continuing the above example, the set of constraints can be selected such that, for the POI category attribute, there is a 50% chance that the set of constraints will include a tourist attraction constraint, a 40% chance that the set of constraints will include a geographical feature constraint, and a 10% chance that the set of constraints
will include a museum constraint. Further, the set of constraints can be selected such that, for the POI popularity attribute, there is a 30% chance that the set of constraints will include a constraint of a popularity score within the first range and a 70% chance that the set of constraints will include a constraint of a popularity score within the second range.
[0022] Once the set of constraints is determined, a plurality of candidate POIs can be identified that satisfy the set of constraints. For instance, at least a subset of the POIs stored within the POI database can be analyzed to determine a plurality of candidate POIs having attribute values that satisfy the set of constraints. In continuing the above example, if the determined set of constraints includes a tourist attraction constraint and a constraint of the first range of popularity scores, each candidate POI must be a tourist attraction having a popularity score within the first popularity score range (as specified by the attribute values associated with the candidate POIs). In some implementations, the set of constraints can be implemented as filters, such that the candidate POIs can include one or more POIs from the plurality of POIs that are not removed by the filters. For instance, each constraint of the set of constraints can be associated with a filter. The plurality of POIs in the POI database can be searched to identify the POIs that match the filters.
[0023] In some implementations, a threshold can be implemented for the candidate POIs. In such implementations, the threshold amount of candidate POIs can be identified. For instance, the plurality of POIs in the POI database can be analyzed until the threshold number of candidate POIs have been identified. Once the threshold is reached, the identification of the candidate POIs can cease.
[0024] Once the candidate POIs have been identified, one of the candidate POIs can be selected as a selected POI. Such POI can be selected, for instance, randomly from the candidate POIs, based on an order of the candidate POIs, and/or using various other suitable selection techniques. Upon a selection of the selected POI, contextual information associated with the selected POI can be retrieved, and presented to the user within the virtual mapping environment. Such contextual information can describe or explain one or more
characteristics, facts, aspects, etc. associated with the selected POI. In some
implementations, the virtual mapping environment can be configured to navigate to the selected POI, such that visual content representing the selected POI is provided for display within the virtual mapping environment. For instance, the visual content representing the selected POI can include two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional imagery depicting the selected POI and/or a geographic region in which the selected POI is located. For instance,
the information associated with the selected POI can be displayed in conjunction with the visual content representing the selected POI within the virtual mapping environment.
[0025] As indicated, in some implementations, the set of constraints, and thereby the candidate POIs can be determined in response to a user request for location data (e.g. via user interaction with the POI selection interface element). In some implementations, the set of constraints and/or the candidate POIs can be determined prior to the user request. In this manner, upon a user request for location data, a POI can be selected from the predetermined candidate POIs. For instance, the selected POI can be selected at random, or based on a sequence of the candidate POIs. In such implementations, the predetermined candidate POIs can be stored at the server or on the user device.
[0026] Embodiments described herein enable users to expand the range of locations about which they can obtain information in the virtual mapping environment, without the user requiring prior knowledge of those locations. Embodiments can be contrasted with conventional methods, which specify purely random locations in the virtual mapping environment and which will frequently return results of little significance (for example, geographic coordinates that lie far from any real point of interest). When using such conventional methods, the user may be compelled to enter additional search criteria to refine the parameters of the search, so as to avoid being directed to locations of little geographic significance. Embodiments described herein can meanwhile ensure that the user is always presented with a genuine point of interest, without the need to specify such additional search criteria.
[0027] With reference now to the figures, example aspects of the present disclosure will be discussed in greater detail. For instance, FIG. 1 is directed to an overview of an example system 100 of providing location data to a user. The system 100 includes a server 102. The server 102 can host a geographic information system (GIS) 104. The server 102 can communicate with a user device 106, for instance, via a network 108. The user device 104 can be any suitable computing device, such as a desktop, laptop, smartphone, mobile device, tablet, wearable computing device, navigation system, display with one or more processors, etc. The GIS 104 can implement a mapping application, a virtual globe application, or any other suitable GIS. The GIS 104 can provide for the archiving, retrieving, and manipulation of geospatial data that has been indexed and stored according to geographic coordinates, such as latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates, associated with the geospatial data. The GIS 104 can combine satellite imagery, photographs, maps, models, and other geographic data,
and Internet search capability so as to enable a user to view imagery of the planet (e.g. as a portion of a virtual globe or other spheroid) and related geographic information (e.g., locales such as islands and cities, and points of interest such as local restaurants, hospitals, parks, hotels, and schools). The GIS 104 further allows the user to conduct local searches and/or to get travel directions to a location or between two locations. The user can virtually fly from space (e.g., some vantage point above the Earth) to and around an entered target address or location, such as a neighborhood or other area of interest. Results can be displayed in a three- dimensional representation of the area of interest. The user can pan, tilt, and rotate the view to see three-dimensional terrain and buildings.
[0028] The GIS 104 can further allow a user to annotate maps, and/or enable data layers to show, for example, parks, schools, hospitals, airports, shopping, and other points of interest or locales. The GIS 104 can further allow the user to layer multiple searches, save results to folders, and share search results and maps with others. An exemplary graphical user interface allowing the user to interact with the system will be discussed with reference to FIG. 2.
[0029] The user device 106 can include a geospatial browser 110 (or other suitable viewer) that acts as an interface between the user device 106 and the GIS 104. A user of the user device 106 can interact with the geospatial browser 110 to facilitate interactions between the user device 106 and the GIS 104. The geospatial browser can implement a user interface for viewing geographic data. The user interface can include a plurality of user interface elements with which the user can interact to facilitate communications between the user device 106 and the GIS 104.
[0030] According to example aspects of the present disclosure, the user interface can include a POI selection element that, when interacted with by the user, facilitates a selection of a POI from a plurality of POIs according to example embodiments of the present disclosure, and a provision of contextual information associated with the selected POI. In particular, in response to a user interaction with the POI selection element, the user device 106 can provide data indicative of the interaction to the GIS 104.
[0031] The GIS 104 can include a constraint generator 112 and a POI selector 114. The constraint generator 112 can be configured to determine a set of constraints to be used in the selection of a selected POI. The set of constraints can be determined based at least in part on a predefined probability scheme. In this manner, the GIS 104 can access a probability scheme 116 and use the probability scheme 116 in determining the set of constraints. The probability scheme 116 can specify probabilities associated with various attribute values for
one or more attributes associated with the plurality of POIs. The plurality of POIs can be stored in a POI database 118. The POI database 118 can further store attribute data associated with the plurality of POIs. The attribute data can specify characteristics or attributes associated with the plurality of POIs. For instance, for a particular POI of the plurality of POIs, the attribute data can specify a category under which the POI falls, a location associated with the POI, a popularity of the POI, or other suitable characteristic of the POI.
[0032] Each attribute can have one or more associated possible attribute values. For instance, the possible attribute values for the POI category attribute can include various categories under which a POI may fall, such as tourist attraction, geographical feature, historical location, business, restaurant, museum, theatre, landmark, country, city, county, neighborhood, district, or other suitable category. In this manner, the POI category attribute value(s) for a particular POI can include one or more such categories. As another example, the possible attribute values for the POI location attribute can include geographic coordinate system values, such as latitude, longitude, and/or altitude values. In this manner, the POI location attribute value(s) associated with a particular POI can include one or more coordinate values representing a location of the POI. As yet another example, the possible attribute values for the POI popularity attribute can include possible popularity values. In this manner, the POI popularity attribute value(s) associated with a particular POI can include one or more values on a popularity score scale. As indicated, the popularity score can be a numerical or other representation indicative of the popularity of a POI.
[0033] The probability scheme can assign probabilities to one or more possible attribute values for one or more attributes. For instance, for a first attribute, the probability scheme can assign a first probability to a first attribute value, a second probability to a second attribute value, etc. In implementations wherein the attribute values associated with an attribute are numerical values (e.g. coordinate values, popularity score values, etc.), the probability scheme can assign probabilities to one or more attribute values and/or to one or more attribute value ranges. For instance, for such an attribute, the probability scheme can assign a first probability to a first value range, a second probability to a second value range, etc.
[0034] In this manner, the probability scheme can indicate one or more attributes to be accounted for in determining a set of constraints. As indicated, constraint generator 112 can determine the set of constraints based at least in part on the probability scheme 116. For
instance, the constraint generator 112 can select the set of constraints randomly in accordance with the probabilities specified in the probability scheme. In this manner, constraints associated with one or more attributes can be determined based at least in part on the probabilities specified in probability scheme. The set of constraints can include one or more attribute values or value ranges associated with the one or more attributes to which probabilities are assigned in the probability scheme.
[0035] Upon a determination of the set of constraints, the POI selector 114 can be configured to select a POI to be presented to the user based at least in part on the constraints. In particular, the POI selector 114 can determine a plurality of candidate POIs based at least in part on the set of constraints. The plurality of candidate POIs can be selected from the POI database 118, and can include at least a subset of the plurality of POIs stored in the POI database 118. In particular, the POI selector 114 can search through the POI database 118 to determine one or more candidate POIs that satisfy the set of constraints. In this manner, each candidate POI can have associated attribute values that satisfy the set of constraints. For instance, the set of constraints can specify a POI category of geographical feature, a POI popularity within a first popularity score range, and/or a POI location within a first coordinate range. The POI selector 114 can search the POI database 118 to identify candidate POIs tagged as geographical features, having popularity scores within the first popularity score range, and having locations within the first coordinate range.
[0036] In some implementations, the POI selector can 114 can identify a threshold number of candidate POIs. For instance, the POI selector 114 can search the POI database 118 for candidates POIs until the threshold number of candidate POIs have been identified.
[0037] Once the plurality of candidate POIs have been identified, the POI selector 114 can determine a selected POI from the plurality of candidate POIs. For instance, the POI selector 114 can randomly select the selected POI from the plurality of candidate POIs.
[0038] Upon a selection of the selected POI, the GIS 104 can access mapping data associated with the selected POI. The mapping data can be stored in the POI database 118 or other suitable location, and can be data (e.g. satellite data, street-level photographs, aerial photographs, digital maps, elevation data, longitude/latitude data, GPS coordinates, etc.) for displaying imagery associated with the selected POI and/or a geographic area proximate the selected POI. The GIS 104 can further access contextual data associated with the selected POI. The contextual data can include relevant information associated with the selected POI, such as historical information, demographic information, interesting facts, geographical
information, and/or any other suitable information that may be considered noteworthy or relevant associated with the selected POL The server 102 can provide the mapping data and the contextual data to the user device 106. The geospatial browser 110 can render the data and can present the data in a suitable format within a user interface of the geospatial browser.
[0039] As indicated above, in some implementations, the candidate POIs can be predetermined (e.g. determined prior to a corresponding request for location data by a user) and stored locally on the user device 106. For instance, the plurality of candidate POIs can be determined by the GIS 104 according to example aspects of the present disclosure, and provided to the user device 106 independent of a request for location data by the user. In this manner, upon a request for location data by the user, the user device 104 can access the plurality of candidate POIs and can select one of the candidate POIs for presentation to the user. For instance, the user device 104 can select the POI randomly from the plurality of candidate POIs. The user device 106 can then request suitable mapping data and/or contextual data from the server 102, which can retrieve the requested data and provide the data to the user device 106 for rendering and presentation to the user.
[0040] FIGS. 2 and 3 depict example user interfaces for providing location data to a user according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. In particular, FIG. 2 depicts example user interface 120. The user interface 120 includes a display area 122 for presenting visual content. As shown in FIG. 2, the user interface 120 includes a three-dimensional representation of a virtual globe 124 displayed within the display area 122. The user interface 120 can be an interactive user interface, and can allow a user to pan, tilt, rotate, and/or zoom with respect to the virtual globe 124. The user interface 120 can be displayed, for instance, within a geospatial browser by a user device, such as user device 106 depicted in FIG. 1. The user device 102 can generate the virtual globe 124 using various suitable rendering techniques. For instance, the user device 102 can receive mapping data associated with the virtual globe 124 from a GIS, such as GIS 104 depicted in FIG. 1. In some implementations, the mapping data can include vector data, raster data partitioned into "tiles" of a fixed size, a combination of vector data and raster data, and/or any other suitable data format.
