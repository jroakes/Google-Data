- the cloud system may provide storage services for at least a portion of the data transmitted between components of system 100 .
- System 100 also includes a vehicle cloud database 140 , which may include a cloud database or a database managed by a database management system (DBMS).
- a DBMS may be implemented as an engine that controls organization, storage, management, and retrieval of data in a database. DBMSs frequently provide the ability to query, backup and replicate data, enforce rules, provide security, do computation, perform change and access logging, and automate optimization.
- a DBMS typically includes a modeling language, data structure, database query language, and transaction mechanism. The modeling language is used to define the schema of each database in the DBMS, according to the database model, which may include a hierarchical model, network model, relational model, object model, or some other applicable known or convenient organization. Data structures can include fields, records, files, objects, and any other applicable known or convenient structures for storing data.
- a DBMS may also include metadata about the data that is stored.
- the vehicle cloud database 140 may store vehicle setting data that may be specific to a particular vehicle make and model, specific to a particular driver, specific to a particular vehicle, or may be abstract vehicle setting values associated with a particular driver profile.
- the vehicle cloud database 140 may maintain vehicle setting data categorized by driver, driver profile, or by vehicle make and model.
- Vehicle settings may include mirror positions, seat position, steering wheel position, foot pedal positions, radio station presets, radio stations tuned into by the driver, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) settings, lighting preferences, e.g., fog lights on or off, internal light settings, wiper speed settings, navigation settings, camera bumper settings, safety alert settings, e.g., low fuel alerts, blind spot alerts, child lock settings, and window lock settings.
- HVAC heating, ventilation, air conditioning
- lighting preferences e.g., fog lights on or off
- internal light settings e.g., wiper speed settings, navigation settings, camera bumper settings
- safety alert settings e.g., low fuel alerts, blind spot alerts, child lock settings, and window lock settings.
- the vehicle settings may include any driver or passenger-configurable option or setting in a vehicle.
- Vehicle settings specific to a vehicle may have a range of values and corresponding limits for a particular vehicle setting.
- the vehicle cloud database 140 may store a first range of positions that a driver seat position can be adjusted in one vehicle and a second range of positions that a driver seat position can be adjusted in another vehicle. Accordingly, the vehicle cloud database 140 may maintain a record of different vehicles, and for each vehicle, the vehicle options, specifications, and the range of particular settings within the vehicle.
- different vehicles may have different settings and operation modes. For example, one vehicle may be configured to operate in a sports mode and may have vehicle setting values applicable or selected for the sports mode. Another vehicle may be configured to operate in a highway mode and may have vehicle setting values applicable or selected for the highway mode.
- the vehicle cloud database 140 may store driver identification data that includes, for example, one or more of a user name or identification, password, driver's license data, or biometric data of the driver.
- the vehicle cloud database 140 may also store information associated with vehicles the driver has previously driven and vehicle setting values the driver utilized in the respective vehicles. For example, the vehicle cloud database 140 may store a first foot pedal position that the driver used in a one car and a second foot pedal position that the driver used in another vehicle. The first foot pedal and the second foot pedal position may be the same in some cases and different in other cases.
- the vehicle cloud database 140 may maintain a driver profile and store the driver identification data and the information associated with vehicles the driver has previously driven in the driver profile.
- the driver profile may also include vehicle setting data that has been abstracted and is associated with the driver.
- the driver profile may include a likely physical profile of the driver, which includes data indicating various physical characteristics of the driver such as, for example, height, arm length, and leg length.
- the various physical characteristics of the driver can be estimated based on average vehicular setting values used by a driver or, in some cases, vehicular settings for a car most frequently driven by the driver. For example, if a driver generally sets the driver car seat position at a position close to the steering wheel in multiple cars or in a car the driver most frequently drives, the likely height of the driver may be determined to be, for example, less than 5′6′′. In another example, if a driver generally sets the driver car seat position at a maximum distance away from the steering wheel in multiple cars, the likely height of the driver may be determined to be, for example, at least 6′.
- a reference table may be used to determine a corresponding driver height from a seat position or distance from the steering wheel of a particular vehicle.
- a driver may be requested through the vehicle navigation system or the driver's portable electronic device to provide information on the driver's physical characteristics.
- an alignment or orientation of mirrors may be used to determine the likely location of a driver's head and a likely height of the driver.
- the driver profile may also include data indicative of personal preferences of the driver. For example, data indicating the ambient temperature within a car, radio station presets, lighting settings, safety alert settings, child lock settings, or window lock settings preferred by the driver may be stored in the driver profile.
- the driver's preferences may also include: data identifying a social network with which one or more portions of the driver's vehicle setting data can be shared with; data identifying a contact in a social network who can receive one or more portions of the driver's vehicle setting data; data indicative of one or more rules designated by the particular driver for processing the driver's vehicle setting data; data indicating whether all portions of the vehicle setting data or only one or more portions selected by particular driver can be shared; and data indicative of a selection by the driver to abstract the driver's vehicle setting data.
- the rules designated by the driver may include various suitable rules such as rules indicating when or how often the vehicle setting data can be obtained or shared, rules indicating one or more types or names of destinations that can receive the vehicle setting data to, rules indicating how the vehicle setting data can be shared or transmitted, and rules indicating privacy selections of the driver.
- a driver may be provided with controls allowing the driver to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs or features described herein may enable collection of driver information (e.g., physical characteristics, information about a driver's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a driver's preferences, or a driver's current location), and if the driver is sent content or communications from a server.
- driver information e.g., physical characteristics, information about a driver's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a driver's preferences, or a driver's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a driver's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the driver, or a driver's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a driver cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the driver may have control over what information is collected about the driver, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the driver.
- the process for removing personally identifiable information from the vehicle setting data results in abstracted vehicle setting data.
- the abstracted vehicle setting data may include general driver profile data of the driver without any identification information.
- vehicle 110 and vehicle 120 may be one of an automobile, rickshaw, moped, motor cycle, bicycle, snowmobile, truck, Segway, etc.
- Vehicle 110 and vehicle 120 may each correspond to one of various suitable makes and models including, for example, a Hyundai Civic, Hyundai Accord, Toyota Camry, Volkswagen Beetle, Mercedes Benz CLK, BMW 5 series, Chevrolet Corvette, etc.
- vehicle 110 and vehicle 120 may each include a vehicle control module to control one or more operations of vehicle 110 and vehicle 120 , respectively.
- the vehicle control module is configured to communicate directly or indirectly through system 100 to communicate with other system 100 elements such as the one or more network servers 130 , user device 115 , vehicle cloud database 140 , other vehicles, one or more vehicle manufacturers 150 , and the driver social network 160 .
- the vehicle control module may communicate with user device 115 to obtain information about a driver carrying the user device 115 or to send information about the vehicle.
- the vehicle control module may also be connected to various components and sensors of the vehicle to implement commands and operations or to determine a status of the components and sensors in the vehicle. Accordingly, the vehicle control module may provide status information about a component or sensor in the vehicle to system 100 elements such as the one or more network servers 130 or the user device 115 .

Abstract
Description
- This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/330,664, filed May 2, 2016, which is incorporated herein by reference.
- This disclosure generally relates to automobiles.
- Vehicle setting values are often specific to a particular driver. Data for vehicle setting values used by drivers is often unavailable to parties that may be interested in learning more about one or more drivers' vehicle setting values.
- This disclosure generally describes a system and method for sharing vehicle setting data.
- According to implementations, vehicle setting data and driver preferences are received from a vehicle. The vehicle setting data is processed according to the driver preferences. The processed vehicle setting data can be shared with various third-parties. For example, in some implementations, the processed vehicle setting data can be shared in an anonymous manner with vehicle manufacturers so that the manufacturers can be made aware of typical vehicle settings preferred by drivers of the manufacturers' vehicles. In some implementations, an individual, such as a race car driver, may opt to share vehicle setting values with fans through one or more social media networks specified in the driver preferences. Fans may also compare their vehicle settings with the race car driver to see how closely their own vehicle setting values match the race car driver's vehicle setting values.
- Innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification include, in some implementations, a computer-implemented method to perform actions. The actions include receiving (i) vehicle setting data for one or more vehicles associated with a particular driver, and (ii) vehicle setting preference information for the particular driver. The vehicle setting data is processed by one or more processors based on the vehicle setting preference information for the particular driver and stored, by the one or more processors, in a cloud-based server. The processed vehicle setting data is transmitted to one or more third parties based on the vehicle setting preference information.

FIG. 1 depicts a vehicle settingsdata sharing system 100 that includesvehicle 110,user device 115,vehicle 120, one ormore network servers 130, avehicle cloud database 140, one ormore vehicle manufacturers 150, and a driversocial network 160. It should be understood that although twovehicles system 100, any suitable number of vehicles may be present in thesystem 100 at any time. -
System 100 may include one or more networks that are configured to provide network access, data transport, and other services to any interface connected to the one or more networks. In general, the one or more networks may include and implement commonly-defined network architectures including those defined by standards bodies, such as the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) Association, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) forum. For example, the one or more networks may implement one or more of a GSM architecture, a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) architecture, a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) architecture, and an evolution of UMTS referred to as Long Term Evolution (LTE). The one or more networks may implement a WiMAX architecture defined by the WiMAX forum or a Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) architecture. The one or more networks may include, for instance, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, a virtual LAN (VLAN), an enterprise LAN, a layer 3 virtual private network (VPN), an enterprise IP network, or any combination thereof. - The one or more networks may include access points, storage systems, cloud systems, modules, one or more databases including
vehicle cloud database 140, and servers including one ormore network servers 130. The one ormore network servers 130 may include any suitable computing device coupled to the one or more networks, including but not limited to a personal computer, a server computer, a series of server computers, a mini computer, and a mainframe computer, or combinations thereof. The one ormore network servers 130 may also include a web server, or a series of servers, running a network operating system, examples of which may include but are not limited to Microsoft® Windows® Server, Novell® NetWare®, or Linux®. The one ormore network servers 130 may be used for and/or provide cloud and/or network computing. Although not shown in the figures, the server may have connections to external systems providing messaging functionality such as e-mail, SMS messaging, text messaging, and other functionalities, such as advertising services, search services, etc. - In some implementations, the one or
more network servers 130 may send and receive data using any technique for sending and receiving information including, but not limited to, using a scripting language, a remote procedure call, an email, an application programming interface (API), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) methods, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), REST (Representational State Transfer), any interface for software components to communicate with each other, using any other known technique for sending information from a one device to another, or any combination thereof. - In some implementations, the one or more networks may include a cloud system that may provide Internet connectivity and other network-related functions. For example, the cloud system may provide storage services for at least a portion of the data transmitted between components of
system 100. -
System 100 also includes avehicle cloud database 140, which may include a cloud database or a database managed by a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS may be implemented as an engine that controls organization, storage, management, and retrieval of data in a database. DBMSs frequently provide the ability to query, backup and replicate data, enforce rules, provide security, do computation, perform change and access logging, and automate optimization. A DBMS typically includes a modeling language, data structure, database query language, and transaction mechanism. The modeling language is used to define the schema of each database in the DBMS, according to the database model, which may include a hierarchical model, network model, relational model, object model, or some other applicable known or convenient organization. Data structures can include fields, records, files, objects, and any other applicable known or convenient structures for storing data. A DBMS may also include metadata about the data that is stored. - In some implementations, the
vehicle cloud database 140 may store vehicle setting data that may be specific to a particular vehicle make and model, specific to a particular driver, specific to a particular vehicle, or may be abstract vehicle setting values associated with a particular driver profile. Thevehicle cloud database 140 may maintain vehicle setting data categorized by driver, driver profile, or by vehicle make and model. - Vehicle settings may include mirror positions, seat position, steering wheel position, foot pedal positions, radio station presets, radio stations tuned into by the driver, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) settings, lighting preferences, e.g., fog lights on or off, internal light settings, wiper speed settings, navigation settings, camera bumper settings, safety alert settings, e.g., low fuel alerts, blind spot alerts, child lock settings, and window lock settings. In general, the vehicle settings may include any driver or passenger-configurable option or setting in a vehicle.
- Vehicle settings specific to a vehicle may have a range of values and corresponding limits for a particular vehicle setting. For example, the
vehicle cloud database 140 may store a first range of positions that a driver seat position can be adjusted in one vehicle and a second range of positions that a driver seat position can be adjusted in another vehicle. Accordingly, thevehicle cloud database 140 may maintain a record of different vehicles, and for each vehicle, the vehicle options, specifications, and the range of particular settings within the vehicle. It should also be appreciated that different vehicles may have different settings and operation modes. For example, one vehicle may be configured to operate in a sports mode and may have vehicle setting values applicable or selected for the sports mode. Another vehicle may be configured to operate in a highway mode and may have vehicle setting values applicable or selected for the highway mode. - In some implementations, the
vehicle cloud database 140 may store driver identification data that includes, for example, one or more of a user name or identification, password, driver's license data, or biometric data of the driver. Thevehicle cloud database 140 may also store information associated with vehicles the driver has previously driven and vehicle setting values the driver utilized in the respective vehicles. For example, thevehicle cloud database 140 may store a first foot pedal position that the driver used in a one car and a second foot pedal position that the driver used in another vehicle. The first foot pedal and the second foot pedal position may be the same in some cases and different in other cases. - In some implementations, the
vehicle cloud database 140 may maintain a driver profile and store the driver identification data and the information associated with vehicles the driver has previously driven in the driver profile. The driver profile may also include vehicle setting data that has been abstracted and is associated with the driver. - In some implementations, the driver profile may include a likely physical profile of the driver, which includes data indicating various physical characteristics of the driver such as, for example, height, arm length, and leg length. The various physical characteristics of the driver can be estimated based on average vehicular setting values used by a driver or, in some cases, vehicular settings for a car most frequently driven by the driver. For example, if a driver generally sets the driver car seat position at a position close to the steering wheel in multiple cars or in a car the driver most frequently drives, the likely height of the driver may be determined to be, for example, less than 5′6″. In another example, if a driver generally sets the driver car seat position at a maximum distance away from the steering wheel in multiple cars, the likely height of the driver may be determined to be, for example, at least 6′.
- Various different and suitable methodologies may be used to determine the likely physical characteristics of a driver. For example, in some implementations, a reference table may be used to determine a corresponding driver height from a seat position or distance from the steering wheel of a particular vehicle. In some implementations, a driver may be requested through the vehicle navigation system or the driver's portable electronic device to provide information on the driver's physical characteristics. In some implementations, an alignment or orientation of mirrors may be used to determine the likely location of a driver's head and a likely height of the driver.
- In addition to the likely physical characteristics of a driver, the driver profile may also include data indicative of personal preferences of the driver. For example, data indicating the ambient temperature within a car, radio station presets, lighting settings, safety alert settings, child lock settings, or window lock settings preferred by the driver may be stored in the driver profile.
- In some implementations, the driver's preferences may also include: data identifying a social network with which one or more portions of the driver's vehicle setting data can be shared with; data identifying a contact in a social network who can receive one or more portions of the driver's vehicle setting data; data indicative of one or more rules designated by the particular driver for processing the driver's vehicle setting data; data indicating whether all portions of the vehicle setting data or only one or more portions selected by particular driver can be shared; and data indicative of a selection by the driver to abstract the driver's vehicle setting data.
- The rules designated by the driver may include various suitable rules such as rules indicating when or how often the vehicle setting data can be obtained or shared, rules indicating one or more types or names of destinations that can receive the vehicle setting data to, rules indicating how the vehicle setting data can be shared or transmitted, and rules indicating privacy selections of the driver.
- For example, a driver may be provided with controls allowing the driver to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs or features described herein may enable collection of driver information (e.g., physical characteristics, information about a driver's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a driver's preferences, or a driver's current location), and if the driver is sent content or communications from a server. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a driver's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the driver, or a driver's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a driver cannot be determined. Thus, the driver may have control over what information is collected about the driver, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the driver.
- The process for removing personally identifiable information from the vehicle setting data results in abstracted vehicle setting data. The abstracted vehicle setting data may include general driver profile data of the driver without any identification information.
- Each of
vehicle 110 andvehicle 120 may be one of an automobile, rickshaw, moped, motor cycle, bicycle, snowmobile, truck, Segway, etc.Vehicle 110 andvehicle 120 may each correspond to one of various suitable makes and models including, for example, a Honda Civic, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Volkswagen Beetle, Mercedes Benz CLK, BMW 5 series, Chevrolet Corvette, etc. In some implementations,vehicle 110 andvehicle 120 may each include a vehicle control module to control one or more operations ofvehicle 110 andvehicle 120, respectively. - The vehicle control module is configured to communicate directly or indirectly through
system 100 to communicate withother system 100 elements such as the one ormore network servers 130,user device 115,vehicle cloud database 140, other vehicles, one ormore vehicle manufacturers 150, and the driversocial network 160. For example, the vehicle control module may communicate withuser device 115 to obtain information about a driver carrying theuser device 115 or to send information about the vehicle. - In some implementations, the vehicle control module may also be connected to various components and sensors of the vehicle to implement commands and operations or to determine a status of the components and sensors in the vehicle. Accordingly, the vehicle control module may provide status information about a component or sensor in the vehicle to
system 100 elements such as the one ormore network servers 130 or theuser device 115. For example, the vehicle control module can provide a notification if a door is not locked or information indicating the ambient temperature in the vehicle based on data received from components and sensors in the vehicle. - The
user device 115 may be any suitable portable electronic device. Examples of a portable electronic device include, but are not limited to, a computer, lap top, personal digital assistant, electronic pad, electronic notebook, telephone, smart phone, television, smart television, a watch, smart glasses, or any electronic device that is connected to a network and has a display. Theuser device 115 may be any combination of hardware and software and may execute any suitable operating system such as an Android® operating system. - The
user device 115 may refer to any portable electronic device that is owned, rented, or possessed by a driver ofvehicle 110. The driver of thevehicle 110 may be a renter, owner, or passenger ofvehicle 110. Theuser device 115 may include an application that allows theuser device 115 to communicate withvehicle 110 and one ormore network servers 130. For example, in some cases, an application on theuser device 115 may control theuser device 115 to communicate with a vehicle control module invehicle 110 and to obtain driver vehicle setting values used by a driver who is in possession of theuser device 115 and is driving or has drivenvehicle 110. The obtained driver vehicle setting values or data may be transmitted to networkservers 130 and subsequently stored invehicle cloud database 140. - The one or
more network servers 130 may be configured to communicate with the various elements ofsystem 100 including one ormore vehicle manufacturers 150 and one or moresocial networks 160 associated with the driver. The vehicle manufacturers 150 may include any vehicle manufacturer such as Toyota, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, etc. In some implementations, thevehicle manufacturers 150 may also include suppliers of vehicle parts. Thesocial networks 160 may include any suitable network such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and may also include social network websites and blogs. Thesocial networks 160 may include friends, family, or followers of a driver. In some implementations, thesocial networks 160 may also include additional third party networks and organizations, such as corporations and ride sharing service providers. - Communications with the one or
more vehicle manufacturers 150 and one or moresocial networks 160 associated with the driver are conducted in accordance with the driver's preferences and rules. For example, vehicle setting data may be transmitted tomanufacturers 150 orsocial networks 160 that the driver has selected, consented to, or waived an objection to. In some implementations, the driver may select a particular social network or one or more contacts, friends, or peers in a social network. - As shown in
FIG. 1 ,network servers 130 may communicate directly with avehicle 120 or may communicate with avehicle 110 through auser device 115. In some implementations, the communication betweennetwork servers 130 andvehicles vehicles vehicles 110 and 120) the abstracted vehicle setting data is received from, and values of vehicle settings being used invehicles - In some implementations, if the drivers of
vehicles servers 130 along with the abstracted vehicle setting data. The anonymized driver profile information does not include any identification information of the driver. - The
network servers 130 may store the abstracted vehicle setting data invehicle cloud database 140 in various suitable manners. For example, in some cases, the abstracted vehicle setting data may be categorized according to the type of vehicle make and model. In some cases, the abstracted vehicle setting data may be categorized according to a type of driver profile. In some implementations, thevehicle cloud database 140 maybe implemented as a part of thenetwork servers 130. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary implementation of anetwork server 200. As shown inFIG. 2 , anetwork server 200 may include a transceiver 210, aprocessor 220, a compliance engine 230, astorage unit 240, and a user interface 250. Theprocessor 220 may include one or more neural networks. - A transceiver 210 includes a transmitter and a receiver and may be utilized to communicate with other devices. The transceiver 210 may include amplifiers, modulators, demodulators, antennas, and various other components. The transceiver 210 may communicate with vehicles, vehicle cloud databases, vehicle manufacturers, and driver social networks. The transceiver 210 may direct data received from other devices to other components of the
network server 200 such as the processor 230 andstorage unit 240. The transceiver 210 may also direct data received from components of thenetwork server 200 to other devices. - The user interface 250 may include a display unit, input unit, and one or more sensors. The sensors may include an optical sensor, capacitive sensor, charge- coupled device sensor, gyroscope, microphone, altimeter, impact sensor, piezoelectric sensor, motion sensor, biosensor, active pixel sensor, and various other sensors that may detect one or more conditions or receive inputs. The input unit may include various devices that are configured to receive one or more inputs. For example, the input unit may include a mouse, touch pad, or keyboard for receiving alphanumeric text.
- The display unit in the user interface 250 may display various data. The display unit may be implemented through suitable displays including, for example, a projection display, a liquid crystal display (LCD), or light emitting diode (LED) display. In some implementations, the display unit, input unit, and one or more sensors may be combined into a single integrated component, and, in some implementations, the display unit, input unit, and one or more sensors may be multiple components.
-
Storage unit 240 may include one or more mass storage devices, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, optical disks, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory devices, and may be implemented as internal hard disks, removable disks, magneto optical disks, CD ROM, or DVD-ROM disks for storing data. Thestorage unit 240 may store rules for training neural networks and rules received from drivers for processing vehicle setting data respectively received from the drivers. - The
processor 220 may be coupled to all components of thenetwork server 200, and may control the operations of thenetwork server 200. Theprocessor 220 may include various logic circuitry and programs to execute the various implementations described herein. - In some implementations, the
processor 220 may include neural network classifiers to classify one or more patterns in vehicle setting data collected from one or more vehicles and drivers. In general, the neural networks may be trained to classify various suitable patterns including, for example, patterns indicative of vehicle setting values associated with a particular demographic group of drivers, patterns indicative of vehicle setting values associated with a particular vehicle make and model, and patterns indicative of vehicle setting values associated with a particular driver profile. - In general, vehicle setting data patterns may be classified in various suitable ways using various suitable methods. For example, the vehicle setting data may be classified according to patterns of vehicle setting data associated with a particular driver, one or more driver profiles, or one or more vehicles' make and model. In some implementations, the processor 230 may aggregate data for a particular driver, one or more driver profiles, or one or more vehicles' make and model.
- In some implementations, the
processor 220 may process vehicle setting data received from a plurality of drivers or vehicles to generate one or more driver profiles or one or more vehicle make and model profiles. For example, the processor may generate a profile of drivers having a height above or below a particular height and the most frequently used vehicle setting values or average vehicle setting values associated with the height. - In some implementations,
network server 200 may also implement a ratings system. The ratings system may compare a particular driver to another driver, a particular driver to a driver profile, a particular driver profile to another driver profile, or a particular vehicle make and model to another vehicle make and model. For example,processor 220 may compare vehicle setting data received from a plurality of sources through transceiver 210, and provide a value indicative of the similarity or difference in the received vehicle settings data from two or more sources. - The compliance engine 230 ensures that the vehicle setting data received from drivers and vehicles are processed according to the preferences and rules of the drivers. When processing vehicle setting data for a particular driver, the compliance engine 230 may obtain the preferences and rules provided by the driver or the driver's vehicle and send instructions to processor 230 to process the driver's vehicle setting data in accordance with the obtained preferences and rules.
- For example, if a particular driver has indicated that the driver's vehicle setting data should be abstracted and only shared to a particular social network, the compliance engine 230 will generate instructions for the processor 230 to remove any personally identifiable information from the driver's vehicle setting data and to transmit the abstracted vehicle setting data to the particular social network through transceiver 210.
- The compliance engine 230 may also communicate with a vehicle cloud database and
storage unit 240 to ensure that data stored in the vehicle cloud database andstorage unit 240 complies with the rules and preferences and rules of the drivers. - Although various operations and functions have been described as being performed by
processor 220 and compliance engine 230 innetwork server 200, it should be appreciated that these operations and functions may be performed in any various parts of thesystem 100. In some implementations, one or more features of thenetwork server 200, such as the compliance engine 230 or operations of theprocessor 220, can be implemented in a portable electronic device, e.g.,user device 115, associated with the driver. For example, an application installed on a driver's portable electronic device can implement operations of the compliance engine 230,processor 220, or other components and modules in the portable electronic device. -
FIG. 3 depicts exemplary operations executed by a network server 330 to share vehicle setting data with one or more third parties, such as one or moresocial networks 350, one ormore vehicle manufacturers 360, and one or more devices 340. The network server 330 may receive vehicle setting data from auser device 320 associated with a driver ofvehicle 310 or from a vehicle 310 (operation 372). For the purposes of describing the implementations depicted inFIG. 3 , references to vehicle setting data transmitted to the network server 330 from thevehicle 310 include data being transmitted from a vehicle control module invehicle 310 or from theuser device 320 associated with the driver ofvehicle 310 to the network server 330. The vehicle setting data may include metadata identifying a make and model of thevehicle 310, values of vehicle settings used invehicle 310, and driver information. - As noted above, the values of vehicle settings used in
vehicle 310 may include values of one or more of mirror positions, a driver seat position, steering wheel position, foot pedal positions, radio station presets, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) settings, vehicle lighting preferences, wiper speed settings, navigation settings, camera bumper settings, safety alert settings, child lock settings, and window lock settings. Driver information may include one or more of the likely physical characteristics of the driver ofvehicle 310 and data indicative of personal preferences of the driver, which may include driver designated rules for sharing the vehicle setting data. - In some implementations, the vehicle setting data may also include location data indicative of a location of
vehicle 310. The location data may be provided in various suitable formats such as global positioning system (GPS) coordinates, street, city, and state address, or latitude-longitude coordinates. - The network server 330 processes the received vehicle setting data according to the preferences of the driver (operation 374). The processing operation may include one or more of identifying a make and model of
vehicle 310 using the metadata received in the vehicle setting data, identifying a location at whichvehicle 310 is located at thetime vehicle 310 sent the vehicle setting data, and identifying the driver ofvehicle 310 if the driver chooses not to remain anonymous. If location data is not provided in the received vehicle setting data, the location of thevehicle 310 at thetime vehicle 310 sent the vehicle setting data may be determined using one or more of various location determining methods such as location triangulation and GPS-based methods. - In some implementations, if the driver information has not been abstracted by an application executed on
user device 320 and the driver has indicated that vehicle setting data should be abstracted, the network server 330 may anonymize the received vehicle setting data to remove data that identifies the driver. - In addition, in some implementations, if the driver has specified which third parties, such as social networks, manufacturers, individuals, or organizations, the driver's vehicle setting data may be shared with in the driver information, the network server 330 may determine whether information, for example, address information such as an email address, IP address, phone number, associated with these third parties is available to transmit vehicle setting data to the third parties.
- If the information regarding the third parties is not available, the network server 330 may obtain this information by querying the driver for more information or by searching various sources such as public databases and the Internet. If this information cannot be obtained, the network server 330 may transmit a message to
vehicle 310 oruser device 320 indicating particular destinations for sharing vehicle data that cannot be reached. - In some implementations, in compliance with the driver's rules, the network server 330 may determine or create a driver profile (operation 376). The driver profile may include the likely physical profile of the driver, one or more vehicles driven by the driver, vehicle settings preferred by the driver for each of the one or more vehicles, and various other information the driver has given authorization for. The likely physical profile of the driver may include data indicating various physical characteristics of the driver such as, for example, height, arm length, and leg length.
- If information regarding the driver's physical characteristics is not available, the various physical characteristics of the driver can be estimated based on average vehicular setting values used by a driver or, in some cases, vehicular settings for a car most frequently driven by the driver. For example, as noted above, a reference table may be used to determine a corresponding driver height from a seat position or distance from the steering wheel of the vehicle most frequently driven by the driver.
- In some implementations, if the driver elects to share the driver's identity, the driver profile may also include driver identification information. In some implementations, the driver profile may also include one or more destinations that the driver has approved to share the driver's vehicle settings data with. For example, a driver may have authorized sharing the driver's vehicle setting data with a particular family member, with one or more friends, with a particular social network, or a manufacturer of
vehicle 310. A destination that has been approved by the driver is designated by the network server 330 as an authorized receiver of the driver's vehicle setting data - The network server 330 may also classify and store the vehicle setting data (operation 378). In particular, the network server 330 may communicate with a vehicle cloud database to classify and store vehicle setting data for multiple drivers and vehicles. The vehicle cloud database includes one or more databases corresponding to particular vehicle make and models and particular driver profiles. For example, the vehicle cloud database may have a database for a particular vehicle make and model and a database of particular driver profiles such as drivers that have a height less than 5′5″ within or separate from the particular vehicle make and model database. In general, various types of databases may be created and included in the vehicle cloud database.
- The network server 330 may continuously update the vehicle cloud database as vehicle setting data is received from multiple vehicles and user devices. Accordingly, the vehicle cloud database may accumulate the processed vehicle setting data received from various vehicles and user devices.
- In some implementations, the network server 330 may maintain respective counts for different vehicle settings. For example, the network server 330 may maintain a record of how many times a particular vehicle setting is applied in a particular vehicle or by a particular driver profile. This record may be updated each time vehicle setting data is received from a vehicle indicating that the particular vehicle setting is being applied. The network server 330 may then determine a frequency of use or a percentage of use of the particular vehicle setting.
- In some implementations, the network server 330 may execute a driver rating operation (operation 380). For example, as noted above, the network server 330 may compare the vehicle setting values of a particular driver to the vehicle setting values of (i) a driver profile similar to the particular driver's profile, (ii) a driver profile different from the particular driver's profile, (iii) profiles of drivers driving the same vehicle make and model as the particular driver, or (iv) drivers in the same geographical area as the particular driver. The network server 330 may provide a value indicative of the similarity or difference in the received vehicle setting data. The rating operation may be performed in response to requests received from a driver of
vehicle 310. - The network server 330 may share processed vehicle setting data of
vehicle 310 or a driver of thevehicle 310 with one or more third parties (operation 382). The sharing may be performed in accordance with the preferences of a driver ofvehicle 310, upon receiving a request from a third party, or in accordance with a predetermined sharing policy. - For example, as noted above, the vehicle setting data received from
vehicle 310 may include an indication of which third parties the driver ofvehicle 310 would like to share vehicle setting data with. In some cases, the driver profile of the driver ofvehicle 310 may also store an indication of the third parties the driver ofvehicle 310 would like to share vehicle setting data with. In addition to the third party information, in some cases, received vehicle setting data or driver profile may also include information on the specific types or portions of vehicle setting data the driver ofvehicle 310 has authorized to share. The network server 330 may transmit the authorized portions of vehicle setting data based on the preferences of the driver ofvehicle 310. - In one example with reference to
FIG. 3 , driver ofvehicle 310 may have indicated one or more friends to share the driver's vehicle setting data such as only the driver's favorite radio stations with the driver's friends. The network server 330 may then transmit data indicative of the driver's favorite radio stations to devices 340 associated with the driver's friends. The devices 340 may include any device with one or more electronic components that is capable of communicating wirelessly over a wireless network. The devices 340 may include, but is not limited to, a smart phone, a laptop, an electronic pad, and a vehicle. - In another example, a celebrity race car driver may have provided authorization for his vehicle settings to be shared with his fans or his fan page on a social network. However, the celebrity race car driver may have elected to abstract his location information so that his location cannot be determined or tracked by the network server 330 or his fans. After processing the race car driver's vehicle setting data, the network server 330 may transmit a message to the social network hosting the fan page with information on the celebrity race car driver's latest vehicle settings.
- In another example, a driver in Seattle, Wash., may have given authorization for her vehicle settings to be shared with ride sharing service providers, so that any vehicles offering rides in Seattle, Wash., through the ride sharing service providers may be made aware of the driver's vehicle settings. The network server 330 may then transmit a message including the driver's vehicle setting data to one or more servers associated with ride sharing ride sharing service providers in Seattle, Wash.
- In some implementations, the network server 330 may receive a request from a third party such as the
vehicle manufacturer 360 to provide vehicle setting data for a particular vehicle make and model. If thevehicle manufacturer 360 is an authorized recipient, anonymized and aggregated vehicle setting data may be transmitted to thevehicle manufacturer 360. For example, if the driver ofvehicle 310 has authorized the manufacturer ofvehicle 310 to receive vehicle setting data, the network server 330 may provide anonymized portions of the vehicle setting data associated with vehicle 330 or the driver ofvehicle 310 to the vehicle manufacturer. In another example, anonymized and aggregated data stored in the vehicle cloud database for the particular make and model ofvehicle 310 may be obtained by the network server 330 and provided to the vehicle manufacturer. - In some implementations, an administrator of the network server 330 may have a predetermined sharing policy or agreement to share anonymized vehicle setting data with one or more third parties. For example, the administrator of the network server 330 may have an agreement or policy to share anonymized vehicle setting data with one or more
social networks 350 or a ride sharing service provider. The network server 330 may then transmit anonymized vehicle setting data to thesocial networks 350 or ride sharing service provider according to the terms of the agreement or policy. - In some implementations, the driver of
vehicle 310 may request information associated with the driver's vehicle setting data from the network server 330. For example, the driver may request the network server 330 to rank the driver's vehicle setting data by, for example, comparing the driver's vehicle setting values with another driver's vehicle setting values. The other driver may be any person who the network server 330 maintains a driver profile for. The other driver may include, for example, an acquaintance of the driver, a member of the driver's social network, or a professional race driver. The network server 330 may rank the driver's vehicle setting data, as described above, and transmit the ranking information back to thevehicle 310. In some implementations, vehicle setting data may be transmitted from the network server 330 back to thevehicle 310 in response to receiving a request for the vehicle setting data from the driver. -
FIG. 4 depicts a flowchart of exemplary operations executed by avehicle 410, anetwork server 430, andother devices 440 so a driver may share vehicle settings with one or more third parties. AlthoughFIG. 4 shows avehicle 410 executing the operations 452-456, these operations may also be executed by a user device associated with a driver ofvehicle 410. - Referring to
FIG. 4 ,vehicle 410 may determine whether a condition for reporting vehicle setting data is satisfied (operation 452). The condition for reporting vehicle setting data may include one or more of receiving a request from a driver ofvehicle 410 to report vehicle setting data, detecting a change in the vehicle setting values ofvehicle 410, and determining that a time for reporting vehicle setting data has arrived according to a schedule set by the driver or manufacturer ofvehicle 410. A driver may select one or more of the above-noted conditions as the condition that triggers the operations illustrated inFIG. 4 . - In response to determining that a condition for reporting vehicle setting data is satisfied, the vehicle control module in
vehicle 410 obtains vehicle setting values from various vehicle components, e.g., lights, gear, mirrors (operation 454). In some implementations, the vehicle control module may also obtain vehicle location information from a navigation system or may use any suitable location determining method such as location triangulation and GPS to obtainvehicle 410's location. In some implementations, thevehicle 410 may request the driver to provide information regarding who the driver would like to share the vehicle setting data with. - The
vehicle 410 may then generate and transmit a message to thenetwork server 430 with the vehicle setting data (operation 456). The message includes one or more of vehicle setting values, and optionally vehicle location data identifying a location ofvehicle 410 and data identifying one or more third parties the driver would like to share the vehicle setting data with. As noted above, various suitable messaging and communication methods may be used to transmit data to and from a network server. - When the
network server 440 receives the vehicle setting data, thenetwork server 440 manages the vehicle setting data byexecution operations FIG. 3 . Thenetwork server 440 may then transmit one or more portions of the vehicle setting data to adevice 440 of an authorized third party, as described in operation 382. -
FIGS. 5A, 5B, and 5C illustrate examples of sharing vehicle setting data. Referring toFIG. 5A , a message received from a network server may be displayed in the navigation display of a vehicle. The message communicates to the driver of the vehicle that “YOU ARE DRIVING LIKE A F1 DRIVER!!! 90% OF YOUR SETTINGS MATCH THE AVERAGE F1 DRIVER!.” - As described above, a network server may implement a ratings system which may compare vehicle setting values of a driver with vehicle setting values from another drive profile. In the illustrated example, the network server has stored information on the average vehicle setting values of Formula 1 (F1) drivers. When the network server receives vehicle setting data from the vehicle, the ratings system in the network server compares the vehicle setting values used in the vehicle with vehicle setting values associated with one or more driver profiles such as a F1 driver profile. The ratings system then communicates comparison outcome information to the vehicle indicating that the vehicle settings value in the vehicle has a strong correspondence, for example a 90% similarity, with the vehicle setting values used by the average F1 driver.
- The comparison outcome information may be transmitted using various suitable means and in any suitable manner. For example, the comparison outcome information may be transmitted via SMS, e-mail, or data transmitted through any wireless signal. In
FIG. 5A , the comparison outcome information is transmitted to the vehicle control module of the vehicle, which then displays the received information on a navigation display. In some cases, the comparison information may be transmitted to a portable electronic device associated with the user. - In some implementations, the ratings system will transmit comparison outcome information to a vehicle or driver if the match between the vehicle setting values is greater than a particular threshold, for example, 70%. In some implementations, the ratings system will transmit comparison information for the highest matching profile, driver, or vehicle make and model.
- Referring to
FIG. 5B , a driver or celebrity, Jon, has indicated that he would like to share his vehicle setting data with his friends, followers, and family. Thus, after collecting information from Jon's vehicle, thesystem 100 publishes information regarding Jon's vehicle settings to Jon's social network including friends, followers, and family that he has designated to receive his vehicle setting information. - In the illustrated example in
FIG. 5B , the neural networks in the network server determined a pattern in Jon's vehicle setting data. In particular, the neural networks determined that Jon lowers his windows after 6 PM every day when he drives. After determining this pattern, the network server shares this information with Jon's social network per Jon's preference. -
FIG. 5C illustrates a computer monitor in an automobile manufacturing facility that has received vehicle setting data from the network server. The received vehicle setting data indicates to the automobile manufacturer that 83% of California drivers that drive one of the manufacturer's vehicles, for example, Genesis, turn off the internal LED ambient lights. This information could indicate to the manufacturer a particular dislike among a certain demographic group of a particular vehicle setting in one of the manufacturer's cars. As discussed above, patterns in vehicle setting data can be determined by neural networks in the network server. - Implementations described above provide a comprehensive, effective, and efficient method of processing vehicle setting data from drivers and vehicles, and sharing the vehicle setting data in a controlled and desirable manner. For example, vehicle manufacturers may receive feedback regarding their vehicles without having to conduct an extensive market survey. Customers are protected because their identities are not shared with the vehicle manufacturers, but, simultaneously, they can provide information to vehicle manufacturers that can help the manufacturers make improvements in existing and future models.
- Additionally, the described implementations provide an effective method for drivers to share vehicle setting data with their social network and for fans or followers to receive information about the vehicle settings of drivers they would like to follow or learn more about.
