Embodiment
This paper describes the establishment and the propagation of the sales promotion information on the social networks generally.More specifically, this paper describes and to be used for creating sales promotion information and being used for propagating to other user of social networks technology, method, system and the mechanism of the sales promotion information of being created based on the User Activity on the third party website.
For example, after go up buying the new footwear of a pair of in third party website (for example on-line shop), the chance of the shared information about this purchase of the user that can give social networks and the good friend of this user on social networks (for example button or link or the like).If the user selects this chance, can create the sales promotion information of buying for these new footwear (for example advertisement) so.The characteristic of this sales promotion information can be about the classification of this purchase detailed; Like the title of the description of shoes and image, third party website and the network address, buy the user's of these shoes name (for example user name, Real Name or the like) about the details of this purchase (for example price, current supplier, sell duration or the like), (for example " I am delithted with these shoes from this user's the personalization message about this purchase.Clicking here, it is more to check.") like that.Can store the sales promotion information of this establishment and be shown to the good friend of this user on social networks.For example, when the good friend of user on social networks checks the page (for example good friend's login page) on the social networks, can present the sales promotion information of buying about this user's shoes to the good friend.
The sales promotion information server can be used for creating, stores and propagates sales promotion information from a plurality of third parties website to a plurality of social networks.The sales promotion information server can be used as intermediary, is used to allow to create and propagate the sales promotion information from a plurality of third parties website through a plurality of social network sites.For example can propagate sales promotion information based on (for example online shoes purchase, news review or the like) establishment of the User Activity on online shoes store website and/or the news website and through social networks A and social networks B by the sales promotion information server.Can select to share information from the user of social networks A with from the user of social networks B about their activity on this shoes store website and news website.Select based on these users, the sales promotion information server can generate sales promotion information and propagate this sales promotion information to the user of social networks A and the user of social networks B.
Through the third party website is connected with a plurality of social network sites, the sales promotion information server can provide the centralization service on a plurality of social network sites, to distribute sales promotion information for the third party website.In addition, through social network sites is connected with a plurality of third parties website, promotion server can provide the centralization service from receiving sales promotion information in a plurality of third parties website so that be shown to the user of social networks for social network sites.
Sales promotion information can be created into multiple form (for example text, image, video, interactive application, recreation or the like) and can be used for multiple purpose (for example product advertising, public service announcement, news, event notice (for example meeting, ball match), recommendation of websites or the like).Before the establishment of sales promotion information, the third party website can be provided for the content (for example template) of sales promotion information and/or be used to show the standard of this sales promotion information to the sales promotion information server.For example, the third party website can be to the sales promotion information server identification should only the social networks user between 18 years old to 35 years old propagates specific sales promotion information to the age.
Social network sites can be from sales promotion information server requests sales promotion information so that be shown to the user of social networks.Based on this request, the sales promotion information that the sales promotion information server can be selected to be created is so that the social networks demonstration.The request that the sales promotion information server has been done can comprise various details, comprises the information (for example friendship, retinue, fan, acquaintance or the like) about other user's on user and the social networks interpersonal relation.Use is from the details of this request, and the sales promotion information server can be propagated sales promotion information between the user with interpersonal relation of this social networks.
For example, first user and second user who supposes social networks has the advertisement that interpersonal relation and sales promotion information server have been created the purchase of making about first user.When the page on the second user capture social networks (for example second user's login page), social networks can be from sales promotion information server requests sales promotion information to be shown to second user.Based on second user with interpersonal relation, the sales promotion information server can select advertisement about first user's purchase to be shown to second user.
The sales promotion information server can also confirm to show which sales promotion information to the user of social networks based on the bid of being made by the third party website.The third party website can show that the chance of his sales promotion information bids for the user to social networks.Selecting sales promotion information when being shown to the user among the admissible multiple factor, the sales promotion information server can carry out his selection based on the number by the bid of third party website at least in part.For example; If 0.25 dollar of online shoes store bid and 0.30 dollar of user's display ads that comes to social networks of online record shop bid; Suppose that other all situations is all impartial; Sales promotion information can be selected to show the sales promotion information from online record shop so, because the bid of this record shop is higher than the bid of this shoes store.
Propagate sales promotion information through being based in part on interpersonal relation at least, the sales promotion information server can be created " oral propaganda " advertisement between the user of social networks.Because " oral propaganda " advertisement is a kind of in the advertisement form the most effectively, so the sales promotion information created by this sales promotion information server can more be paid attention to than the advertisement of other form in the third party website.Like this, compare with the bid for the advertisement of other form, the third party website bigger quantity of can bidding shows the sales promotion information of being created by the sales promotion information server.
Can provide excitation to share their activity on the third party website to the user of social networks so that create sales promotion information.For example, the user can receive because the sales promotion information that is associated the user of social networks the part of the income that demonstration produced of the advertisement of the nearest purchase made by this user (for example about).In addition, social networks can receive the income that shows sales promotion information owing to the user to him.
Figure 1A-Fig. 1 C is the concept map that is used to create and propagates to the user of social networks the example system of sales promotion information.Figure 1A has described and has been used to use sales promotion information server 108 to create the example system 100 of sales promotion information 102 based on the User Activity on the third party website 106 104.Example system 100 has also been described other user of sales promotion information 102 from sales promotion information server 108 to social networking service device 110 who is created propagation.
Shown in steps A, by the user A click 104 link 112c of social networks.The click of being carried out by user A 104 is examples of the User Activity of that establishment that triggers sales promotion information on third party website 106.Through being embedded in code and/or the widget (for example using) in the third party website 106, to 108 transmission of sales promotion information server about the information of the click 104 of user A (for example discerning the information of user A and performed action).In this example, can independently check third party website 106 on the computing machine (the for example equipment of desk-top computer, portable computer, mobile phone, internet-enabled (for example TV, game console), miscellaneous equipment or the like) with sales promotion information server 108 by user A.
As shown in step B, sales promotion information server 108 can be created sales promotion information 102 when the information that receives about the activity (clicking 104) of user A on third party website 106.Sales promotion information (for example advertisement, news or the like) can relate to various contents (for example product, news, incident, online Media content (video, blog or the like) service or the like) and can be created into multiple media formats (for example text, image, video, interactive application, recreation or the like) in said example, and sales promotion information 102 comprises from the image 112b of third party website 106 and sales promotion text " user A recommends the film in movie theatre now ".
Sales promotion information server 108 can be from the template establishment sales promotion information 102 that is provided by third party website 106.This template can comprise and being used for about on the third party website 106 of the establishment that triggers sales promotion information 102, carrying out the placeholder of user (user A) information of action (for example agreeing sales promotion, product purchase or the like).For example, be used for from its template of creating sales promotion information 102 can be have text " _ recommend now at movie theatre film _ " image 112b, wherein " _ " is the placeholder of the name (for example user A) that is used for the user.
Sales promotion information server 108 can be stored in sales promotion information 102 in the sales promotion information reservoir 114.Sales promotion information reservoir 114 can be worked as persistent storage sales promotion information 102 when social networks receives the request for sales promotion information, shows sales promotion information 102 to other user of social networks.Can sales promotion information 102 be stored the duration of being confirmed by third party website 106, social networking service device 110, sales promotion information server 108 and/or user A enduringly.
Through with sales promotion information 102 persistent storage in sales promotion information reservoir 114, can obtain action, so that the outstanding user who is shown to social networks from the active flow that is associated with the user A that relates to third party website 106.The active flow of user A can be user-dependent and/or have the tabulation of other user-dependent activity in the social networks of interpersonal relation with this user with this.For example; Can to be user A fall permutation table (for example 12:01PM-have lunch in new dining room doing and so on time sequencing the active flow of user A; 12:45PM-gets back to the grindstone; 3:00PM-user B (good friend of user A) reads lastest news on www.newssite.com, 5:30PM-buys new running shoes on www.website.com, like that).
Can in user's social network page (for example user's the personal information page), present the clauses and subclauses in user's the active flow according to chronological order.Can wherein, present nearest clauses and subclauses at the top of this stream and present the oldest clauses and subclauses according to enumerating this clauses and subclauses to the oldest clauses and subclauses from nearest clauses and subclauses in the bottom of stream.Nearest clauses and subclauses in active flow can be described to the most outstanding clauses and subclauses---and compare with the old clauses and subclauses of the bottom that is presented on active flow, visit has the nearest clauses and subclauses that the user of the page of active flow possibly more likely check the top that is presented on this active flow on the social networks.Though the clauses and subclauses in user's the active flow possibly be associated with the third party website (the for example exemplary entries in the paragraph before 3:00PM and 5:30PM are presented on), add in this active flow near the position (for example the bottom in active flow) that can these clauses and subclauses cannot be pushed to outstandingly near outstanding position (for example the top of active flow) to along with new clauses and subclauses.
Through create sales promotion information 102 and with its persistent storage in sales promotion information reservoir 114, the activity from the active flow of the user A relevant with third party website 106 of can obtaining is so that give prominence to other user who is shown to social networks.Even the bottom (or outside) that activity has been pushed to the active flow of user A afterwards, also can be to the outstanding sales promotion information 102 that shows of other user.For example, suppose that the recommendation 112a of the film of user A on Monday appears at the active flow (for example " I recommend film ") of user A and in the good friend's of user A active flow (for example " user A recommends film ").To next Monday, maybe be pushed out extrusion position to the clauses and subclauses of the recommendation 112a of film and to the bottom of the good friend's of user A and user A active flow (or outside) about user A.Yet, even in next Monday, can be also the good friend's of user A extrusion position continue to show created and by the sales promotion information 102 of persistent storage in sales promotion information reservoir 114.In case create sales promotion information 102, the influence that it can not correspond to the active flow that is used for user A or receives the active flow that is used for user A.
Illustrated like additional sales promotion information 116a-116b, sales promotion information server 108 can be created sales promotion information from the action of carrying out in a plurality of third parties website.In addition, sales promotion information reservoir 114 can persistent storage add the user that sales promotion information 116a-116b just is shown to social networks.For example, add the membership qualification of organizing Z that sales promotion information 116a adds about user Y about news article and sales promotion information 116b by user X recommendation recently.
Except creating the sales promotion information in the action of carrying out on the third party website based on the user by social networks, sales promotion information server 108 can be propagated created and sales promotion information persistent storage to other user of social networking service device 110.Represent social networking service device 110 by social figure 118 in this example, social figure 118 has been described the interpersonal relation between the some of them user of social networking service device 110.In social figure 118, each node representes that the altitude that user (user A-F) and each connect two nodes representes two interpersonal relations between the user.For example, user A has the interpersonal relation with user B, E and F.
Social networking service device 110 can send the request that is used for sales promotion information so that be shown to the user.Can trigger social networking service device 110 so that send request in every way; For example ask the page (for example user's the personal information page, another user's the personal information page, Community Page or the like) of social networking service device 110 through the user, perhaps before the user asks the page of social networking service device 110 (for example when the user current on social networks pre high speed buffer store sales promotion information when movable).
In various realizations, the request that is used for sales promotion information can be initiated from the client computer (for example desk-top computer, notebook, mobile phone, portable computing device or the like) of the page that is used to check social networks by the user.For example, the user of social networks can receive and has embedded widget (for example using) or be used for expressing the social network page of the code of request to sales promotion information server 108.
In said example, at step C, social networking service device 110 sends the request 120 that is used for showing to user B sales promotion information to sales promotion information server 108.Described in social figure 118, user B has the interpersonal relation with user A and user C.Social networking service device 110 can transmit the information about the characteristic of the interpersonal relation of user B and/or user B (for example age, sex, geographic position, interest or the like).
Can confirm be presented at which sales promotion information of being stored in the reservoir 114 to user B in response to receiving request 120 sales promotion information servers 108.Should confirm can be based on multiple factor.For example should confirm can based on have which user with the interpersonal relation (for example friend, colleague, relative or the like) of user B also have created and be stored in the sales promotion information (for example user A) in the sales promotion information reservoir 114.Propagation via the sales promotion information of interpersonal relation can be created " oral exploitation " on social networks.
In another example, this confirms whether to be complementary with the preferred feature that is directed against concrete sales promotion information defined by the third party website based on the characteristic of user B.If for example third party website 106 regulation should the user between 18 years old to 35 years old show sales promotion information 102, and user B is 28 years old, can show sales promotion information to user B so.In another example, this is confirmed can be based on the bid of being made by the third party website that is used for showing to the user of social networking service device 110 sales promotion information of being created.For example; If third party website 0.20 dollar of each user to social networks of 106 bids shows sales promotion information 102 and 0.15 dollar of sales promotion information that shows him of another third party website bid, sales promotion information server 108 can be confirmed to show sales promotion information 102 to user B so.
In said example, sales promotion information server 108 is selected to show the sales promotion information of creating from the activity of user A on third party website 106 102 to user B.At step D, sales promotion information server 108 returns sales promotion information 102 to social networking service device 110.Social networking service device 110 can come the sales promotion information 102 that receives to user B transmission so that be presented at (for example desk-top computer, notebook, mobile phone, portable computing device or the like) on the client computer as the part of the page 124 of social networks.Can near the extrusion position in the transmits page 124 126 (for example the page top), show sales promotion information 102.
Receive the various realizations of request from the client computer that is associated with user B at sales promotion information server 108, sales promotion information server 108 can return sales promotion information 102 to client computer.In this is realized, be embedded into widget (for example using) and/or code in the webpage of ask this sales promotion information 102 can the extrusion position on the page near (for example page top) demonstration sales promotion information 102.
Figure 1B has described and has been used to use sales promotion information server 144 to propagate the example system 140 of the sales promotion information of being created from a plurality of third parties website 142a-142d establishment sales promotion information and to a plurality of social networks 146a-146d.In example system 140; Sales promotion information server 144 allows a plurality of third parties website 142a-142d to create on a plurality of social networks 146a-d based on User Activity and shows sales promotion information, and any of need not among direct and a plurality of social networks 146a-146d is docked.In addition, sales promotion information server 144 allows a plurality of social networks 146a-146d to receive and shows " oral propaganda " advertisement that is based on the User Activity on any among a plurality of third parties website 142a-142d to the user.
Among a plurality of third parties website 142a-142d each can be to sales promotion information server 144 transmission information 148.Information 148 can comprise sales promotion information template (as above described with reference to Figure 1A), be used for showing to the user of social networks the bid and/or the User Activity on the 142a-142d of third party website of the sales promotion information of being created.Can trigger sales promotion information server 144 from any one user's among a plurality of social networks 146a-146d on any among a plurality of third parties website 142a-142d action and create sales promotion information.Sales promotion information server 144 can with above with reference to third party website 106 and the 108 described establishments of sales promotion information server similarly, create each the sales promotion information that is used for a plurality of third parties website 142a-142d.
One or more that can be in a plurality of social networks 146a-146d propagated each among sales promotion information 152a-152d.For example, the user U1 for social networks W 146a creates propagation sales promotion information 152a and can propagate sales promotion information 152a to single social networks W 146a.In another example, create sales promotion information 152b and can be to social networks X 146b and social networks Y146c propagation sales promotion information 152b for the user U5 of social networks X 146b and Y 146c.
Among a plurality of social networks 146a-146d each can be to the request (with above with reference to Figure 1A described request similar) of sales promotion information server 144 transmissions for sales promotion information.As response, sales promotion information server 144 can confirm be stored in which sales promotion information in the reservoir 150 to social networks 146a-146d transmission.Except above about the factor that Figure 1A discussed, can be by confirming of being done of sales promotion information reservoir 114 based on the social networks that this request was derived from.For example, in response to the request from social networks X 146b, sales promotion information reservoir 114 can make that this is definite through considering sales promotion information 152b and 152d (the two all calculate user by social networks X 146b create).
Making after this confirms, sales promotion information reservoir 114 transmits determined sales promotion information 154 to social networks 146a-d.Though 146a-146d describes as cohort with social networks, social networks 146a-146d request of can sending independently of one another and reception sales promotion information.Similarly, sales promotion information reservoir 114 is created sales promotion information independently and is handled the request from social networks 146a-146d independently among the 142a-142d of third party website each.
Among the social networks 146a-146d each can be in order to the last sales promotion information 154 that shows reception about the similar mode of the described mode of Figure 1A to the user.
Fig. 1 C has described based on confirming that for showing from user from the bid of the sales promotion information of third party website to social networks shows the example system 160 of sales promotion information.As above described with reference to Figure 1A, the third party website can be submitted for the bid that shows the chance of the sales promotion information that generates from the third party website to the user of social networks.
Steps A like example system 160 is said, and the client computer 162 that is used for the user U4 of social networks sends the request 164 for the personal information page (the for example personal information page of user U4) to social networking service device 166.User U4 at least a portion as its member's social networks can handled and keep to social networking service device 166.Can be through representing these social networks with social figure 118 similar social figures 168.Described in exemplary social figure 168, user U4 has the interpersonal relation with user U1, U2 and U7.
At step B, social networking service device 166 can send request 170 so that sales promotion information is shown to user U4 as the part of the personal information page of being asked to sales promotion information server 172.At step C, sales promotion information server 172 can be made to definite 174 of user U4 demonstration sales promotion information based on the bid that receives from the third party website.
Can the bid that receive from the third party website be stored in the bid reservoir 176.As described in the form 177 of the 178a-178f that bids; Bid reservoir 176 can be stored about receiving the multiple information of bid, like the third party website that is associated with sales promotion information, the social networks that is associated with sales promotion information, the user who is associated with sales promotion information, from the bid quantity of the third party website that is associated, for the click probability of sales promotion information and/or for the expectation value of sales promotion information.When creating sales promotion information, (for example create sales promotion information carrying out action on the third party website) and can set up related between sales promotion information and third party website, user and the social networks by the user of social networks.
Can receive bid quantity from the third party website.Bid quantity can relate to when the sales promotion information that is used for this third party website is clicked and/or checked this third party website and be ready the quantity paid.Third party website can be provided for the bidding variable dimension of quantity.For example, the third party website can stipulate that for about wanting the sales promotion information of event in the near future, bid quantity should increase by 10% weekly till the date of this incident.Can also be with bid quantity and the budget coupling that is used for this sales promotion information.Budget can be that periodic (for example monthly budget) or its can be master budget (for example after budget exhausts, no longer showing this sales promotion information to the user).Budget can relate to each sales promotion information of creating or relate to together from the cohort of the sales promotion information of single template establishment.
Click probability and can be the probability that the user that checks sales promotion information will click at this sales promotion information.Clicking probability can be that all sales promotion information servers 172 and/or social networking service device 166 give the empirical data number that (for example clicking rate before the clicking rate before this sales promotion information, the similar sales promotion information or the like) generates.Expectation value can be that bid quantity multiply by and clicks probability and can represent if show the income quantity that this sales promotion information is desired to the user.
Sales promotion information server 172 can be based on the interpersonal relation of user U4 and each the expectation value that is used for sales promotion information 178a-178f, confirms to show which of sales promotion information 178a-178f to user U4.Based on the user U4 that has with the interpersonal relation of user U1, U2 and U7, sales promotion information server 172 can be considered (creating about the action of product P 1 on the website A from user U1) sales promotion information 178a, (creating about the action of news N1 on the website C from user U2) sales promotion information 178c and (on website F, creating about the action of incident E1 from user U2) sales promotion information 178d.

In step 380, receive the sales promotion information that will be shown to second user from the sales promotion information server.Along with transmitting requested page, can add the sales promotion information that is received in the requested page (step 382) to second user.
Fig. 4 describes timeline 400 from the exemplary techniques of sales promotion information to the user of social networks that be used to create and propagate.This exemplary techniques has been explained the establishment and the propagation of the sales promotion information that uses a plurality of third parties website and a plurality of social networks.A plurality of third parties website comprises third party website A 402 and third party website B 404.Can be with sales promotion information server 406 third party website A 402 and the third party website B 404 of being connected to Network Based.A plurality of social networks comprise social networks X 408 and social networks Y 410.Equally with social networks X 408 and the social networks Y 410 sales promotion information servers 406 that are connected to Network Based.
In the time 412, third party website A 402 sends the first sales promotion information template and first bid that is associated to sales promotion information server 406.In the time 414, sales promotion information server 404 is stored first template and first bid that is associated based on this first template establishment sales promotion information and use before first bid propagates the sales promotion information created.
In the time 416, third party website B 404 sends the second sales promotion information template and second mark that is associated to sales promotion information server 406.In the time 418, sales promotion information server 404 is stored second template and second bid that is associated based on this second template establishment sales promotion information and use before second bid propagates the sales promotion information created.
In the time 420, the user U1 of social networks X 408 carries out action on third party website A 402, and in the time 422, the user U3 of social networks Y 410 carries out action on third party website A 402.In described example, will be associated with first template by the action that user U1 and U3 carry out.Third party website A 402 sends the information (for example carrying out the user's of action identity, the action of execution, sign of first template or the like) about the execution of these actions to sales promotion information server 406.
In the time 424, first sales promotion information of the action that sales promotion information server 406 is used for from first template establishment being carried out by the user U1 of social networks X 408.Second sales promotion information of the action that sales promotion information server 406 also is used for being carried out by the user U3 of social networks Y 410 from first template establishment.To being inserted into information in first template, that be used to discern user U1 and U3, first sales promotion information can be different with second sales promotion information.
In the time 426, the user U5 of social networks X 408 can carry out action on third party website B 404, and in the time 428, the user U2 of social networks Y 410 can carry out action on third party website B 404.In said example, will be associated with second template by the action that user U5 and U2 carry out.Third party website B 404 sends the information (for example carrying out the user's of action identity, the action of execution, sign of first template or the like) about the execution of these actions to sales promotion information server 406.
In the time 430, the 3rd sales promotion information of the action that sales promotion information server 406 is used for from second template establishment being carried out by the user U5 of social networks X 408.The 4th sales promotion information of the action that sales promotion information server 406 also is used for being carried out by the user U2 of social networks Y 410 from second template establishment.To being inserted into information in second template, that be used to discern user U5 and U2, the 3rd sales promotion information can be different with the 4th sales promotion information.
Generally speaking, in the ending of time 430, sales promotion information server 406 has been created the first, second, third and the 4th sales promotion information.The content that first sales promotion information of creating from first template is identical with the sensing of second sales promotion information still is used for the different user (user U1 and U3) on the different social networks (social networks X and Y).Similarly, but the 3rd sales promotion information points to identical content with the 4th sales promotion information is used for the different user (user U5 and U2) on the different social networks (social networks X and Y).
For example; Suppose that third party website A 402 is online shoes retailers; Third party website B404 is online news site, and social networks X 408 is that the social networks (for example FACEBOOK, ORKUT or the like) and the social networks Y 410 that point to friends point to commercial social networks (like LINKEDIN or the like) of networking.First and second sales promotion information can be the advertisements of the shoes that are used for just on online shoes retailer website, selling.First sales promotion information can comprise by user U1 recommends (for example " user U1 recommends these shoes---on online shoes retailer, check ") to the shoes that other user of friends network gives directions.Second sales promotion information can comprise by user U3 recommends (for example " user U3 buys these shoes recently---bought a pair of online shoes retailer today ") to other user's of commercial network shoes.The news article of third and fourth sales promotion information on can the sales promotion news site.The 3rd sales promotion information can comprise by user U5 recommends (for example " user U5 thinks that this news article is interesting---Click here now and read ") to the news article that other user of friends network carries out.The 4th sales promotion information can comprise by user U2 recommends (for example " colleagues, this news article comprises some valuable opinions---the user U2 for current economic situation ") to the news article that other user of commercial network carries out.
Send the request that is used for showing sales promotion information at times 432 social networks X 408 to sales promotion information server 406 to the user U7 of social networks X 408.In this example, user U7 have with social networks X 408 on user U1 and the interpersonal relation of U5.Among first sales promotion information (user U1 and third party website A 402) and the 3rd sales promotion information (user U5 and third party website B 404), confirm and show first sales promotion information to user U7 at times 434 sales promotion information server 406.As above described about Figure 1A-Fig. 1 C, can comprise A 402 and the bid of third party website B 404 clearing and the characteristic of user U7 based on multiple factor from the third party website, make this and confirm.In case make definitely, can return first sales promotion information so that be shown to user U7 to social networks X 408 by sales promotion information server 406.
For example, sales promotion information server 406 can surpass the bid from third party website B 404 based on the bid from third party website A 402, shows first sales promotion information to user U7.Bid from third party website A 402 and third party website B 404 can overall applicability perhaps be social networks X 408 customizations in whole social networks specially.
Send the request that is used for showing sales promotion information at times 436 social networks Y 410 to sales promotion information server 406 to the user U8 of social networks Y 410.In this example, user U8 have with social networks Y 410 on user U3 and the interpersonal relation of U2.Among second sales promotion information (user U3 and third party website A402) and the 4th sales promotion information (user U2 and third party website B 404), confirm and show the 4th sales promotion information to user U8 at times 438 sales promotion information server 406.In case make definitely, can show that to social networks Y 410 the 4th sales promotion information is so that be shown to user U8 by sales promotion information server 406.
(even first template of A 402 draws from the third party website) the first and the 3rd sales promotion information be similarly and (second template of B 404 draws from the third party website) the second and the 4th sales promotion information be similarly, also maybe difference (for example the sales promotion information of first template establishment of A 402 will be more preferred than the sales promotion information of second template establishment of B 404 from the third party website always from the third party website) by confirming of making of sales promotion information server 406.As above described about Figure 1A-C, this is confirmed can be based on multiple factor.For example, user U8 can have the characteristic (for example age, sex, interest or the like) that third party website B 404 and user U7 are lacked.In another example; Compare with the user of social networks X 408, third party website B 404 possibly bid much more more to come the user to social networks Y 410 to show sales promotion information (for example third party website B 404 is that business travel and social networks Y 410 point to commercial networking).In other example,, be used to show that budget and/or the time frame from the sales promotion information of third party website A 402 possibly exhausted to the time 438.
