FIG. 7 is a diagram of components of the concierge server. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein enable an online content system to record an interaction signal from a user device representing an interaction between the user device and a primary online content item (e.g., an advertisement), access at least one concierge rule stored in memory based on the interaction signal, and serve a secondary online content item to the user device for display on the user device based on the at least one concierge rule. As used herein, a concierge rule is a rule configured to interpret a user interaction with an item of online content to provide secondary online content to the user that relates to the primary online content. Also, as used herein, secondary online content item refers generally to follow-up advertising content and/or non-advertising information related to a determined entity and delivered to the user.
- An online content management system (OCMS) server provides online publications (e.g., web pages, documents, videos, audio files, etc.) and online content items (e.g., advertisements) to user devices. In some cases, the online content items are served to the user device along with the online publications. In other cases, the online content items may be served to the user device in response to a search query.
- Online content can be provided to user computer devices, tablets or mobile devices. Online content that is provided to mobile devices have lower click-through rates as compared to other computer devices. One possible reason for the lower click-through rates is that such online content interrupt users, requiring them to stop what they are doing, leave an existing website, and visit a new website. So unless users are really interested in the online content, most users will not click on the online content.
- To address this problem, the system described herein includes the OCMS with an assistant component (the “system”). The system also includes a keeper application, which may be stored on the user device or may be stored separately on a separate content server. The assistant component is configured to interact with the keeper application. The keeper application enables a user to save or “keep” online content displayed on their device, which is served to the user device by the OCMS, for future review. For example, if a user is interested in online content displayed on their device, but is not ready to purchase the item included within the online content, the user is able to click on a virtual button included with the online content to save or keep the online content (e.g., the ad) for later viewing without stopping what they are currently doing. The saved online content is saved and managed within the keeper application. The saving of the online content, also referred to herein as the primary online content item, is a user interaction that causes an interaction signal to be sent to the system. The interaction signal is then processed by the assistant component, which is configured to retrieve and send a secondary online content item to the user device based at least in part on concierge rules associated with the primary online content item. The secondary online content item is served to the user via the keeper application.
- More specifically, the system is configured to provide secondary online content to a user device based on a user interaction with primary online content. The system is configured to: (a) receive a primary content file including a primary content item, and a primary content item identifier; (b) associate at least one concierge rule with the primary content file; (c) store the primary content file and the associated concierge rule within memory; (d) receive a content request requesting the primary content item for display on the user device; (e) provide the primary content item to the user device for display on the user device in response to the content request; (f) record a first interaction signal representing a first interaction between the user device and the primary content item, the first interaction signal including a user device identifier and the primary content item identifier; (g) access the at least one concierge rule stored in the memory based on the first interaction signal; (h) retrieve a secondary online content item based at least in part on the at least one concierge rule; and (i) automatically serve the secondary online content item to the user device for display on the user device.
- In the example embodiment, concierge rules can be embedded in the meta-information of the primary content item, or can be created by the content server and linked within the memory to the primary content item.
- In the example embodiment, the primary content item is a first advertisement, and the secondary online content item includes information relating to the first advertisement. For example, the primary content item could be an advertisement for tickets to a professional baseball game, and the secondary online content item could be a weather report for the day of the game.
- In the example embodiment, the online content request is received from the user device and requests the first advertisement be served to the user device. It can also be received from the user device as part of a request to serve a publication item along with the first advertisement to the user device.
- In the example embodiment, the first interaction signal is received from the user device after the primary content item is displayed on the user device. The first interaction includes a save command inputted by the user with respect to the primary content item. The save command is configured to save the primary content item to a keeper application stored on the user device. The system parses the primary content item identifier from the first interaction signal, retrieves a plurality of concierge rules stored in the memory based on the primary content item identifier, and automatically serves a plurality of secondary online content items to the user device for display on the user device based on the plurality of concierge rules with at least some of the plurality of secondary online content items being served at different times.
- In the example embodiment, the concierge rules can be a location-based rule, wherein the secondary online content item is served to the user device when the user device is located in a predefined area. The concierge rule can also be an inventory-based rule, wherein the secondary online content item is served to the user device when a level of inventory of an item associated with the primary content item reaches a predetermine threshold amount.
- In the example embodiment, the concierge rule is configured to instruct the system to create a search query based on the at least concierge rule, execute the search query, retrieve search results in response to the search query, and automatically provide one of the search results to the user device.
- In the example embodiment, the first interaction signal includes a save command inputted by the user with respect to the primary content item, the save command is configured to save the primary content item to a keeper application. The system is further configured to record a second interaction signal representing a second interaction between the user device and the saved primary content item wherein the second interaction includes a purchase of an item associated with the saved primary content item, and accesses a second concierge rule of the plurality of concierge rules based on the second interaction
- The methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) receive a primary content file including a primary content item, and a primary content item identifier; (b) associate at least one concierge rule with the primary content file; (c) store the primary content file and the associated concierge rule within memory; (d) receive a content request requesting the primary content item for display on the user device; (e) provide the primary content item to the user device for display on the user device in response to the content request; (f) record a first interaction signal representing a first interaction between the user device and the primary content item, the first interaction signal including a user device identifier and the primary content item identifier; (g) access the at least one concierge rule stored in the memory based on the first interaction signal; (h) retrieve a secondary online content item based at least in part on the at least one concierge rule; and (i) automatically serve the secondary online content item to the user device for display on the user device.
