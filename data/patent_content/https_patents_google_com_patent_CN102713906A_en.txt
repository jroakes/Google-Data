Embodiment
This document has been described location-based search generally.Mobile computing device can the request server system provide the content corresponding to this computing equipment geographic position, and as response, receives this content to be used for demonstration.In various examples, this content is not to provide in response to explicit user input text inquiry or speech polling.For example; This content can get into certain geographic area in response to equipment, equipment is unlocked; Perhaps the change in the physical region is (for example around this equipment for apparatus senses; The sound that microphone detects around the equipment changes, and perhaps accelerometer detects equipment or its user has changed pattern, becomes pattern on foot such as Move Mode never) and provide.
Can come to be this mobile device chosen content based on the geographic position of mobile device indirectly.For example, can confirm region of search, and can the part of the region of search of confirming as inquiry be provided to search engine corresponding to the geographic position.Can return the content that is directed against in response to the most relevant rank Search Results of this inquiry to this mobile computing device.
In more detail, individuality can use mobile computing device, and this mobile computing device can be confirmed the estimation (" geographic position " of equipment hereinafter referred to as) in its own geographic position.For example, mobile computing device can be through near Wi-Fi router or the cellular tower the identification, perhaps through to carrying out triangulation from cellular tower or based on the signal of the Navsat in space, confirms the geographic position of this mobile computing device.Mobile computing device can provide the geographic position to server system, for example, as periodic location update, perhaps with the request to the search result content that will discern based on the geographic position (for example, with search inquiry) is provided.
Server system can receive the geographic position, and selects one of some " regions of search " corresponding to this geographic position.For example, can be those regions of search that comprise the geographic position corresponding to the region of search in geographic position, or those regions of search of on geography, closing on this geographic position.Explain that as principle the geographic position can be corresponding to 7 nested each other on geographic position regions of search, just as Russia cover baby.Nested region of search example collection comprises continent, country, state, prefecture, city, neighborhood, shopping center and shop designator.Therefore; Each region of search in the nested sets (except " top " region of search) can spatially comprise the region of search of higher level, and each region of search in the nested sets (except " minimum " layer region of search) can spatially comprise other region of search of even lower level.
First region of search can be nested in second region of search on geography fully.For example, any part of first region of search all can not be outside second region of search.First region of search can be on geographical top be nested in second region of search.For example, the part of first region of search can be in the outside of second region of search, and the part of first region of search can be in the inside of second region of search.
Because a plurality of regions of search can be corresponding to the geographic position (for example; Because the geographic position is arranged in the inside of each region of search, some regions of search); Various factors can be used for " marking " is carried out in each region of search; And thus, various factors can be used for selecting the region of search of relevant marking.Various factors comprises the accuracy in definite geographic position, and user and corresponding to mutual (will run through this document more describes in detail) of the Search Results of region of search.
Although the geographic position of estimating can be limited geographic coordinate; But the region of search of selecting can identify the area that can limit by means of the frame set of geographic coordinate (for example, the non-circular border in city or the neighborhood that limited a dozen geographic coordinate).
Search engine can be submitted in the region of search of selecting.The region of search of selecting can be associated with the descriptive vocabulary of human language.For example, the region of search that is used for the city of san francisco city can receive representative in response to this server system from mobile device by server system and be positioned at the position coordinates of city of san francisco city or combination area of city and country's regional extent and select.In case the city of san francisco city has been selected as region of search (for example, from the region of search set that comprises " zone, bay " and " California "), vocabulary " city of san francisco " can be used as the descriptive vocabulary of the human language that is used for city of san francisco and obtains.
In some example, descriptive vocabulary is submitted to search engine, to substitute geographic coordinate.For example, the search engine at the server system place can receive descriptive vocabulary " city of san francisco ", and uses vocabulary " city of san francisco " to carry out search.In various examples, search engine does not receive geographic coordinate and in search, does not use this geographic coordinate.In various examples, descriptive vocabulary is the unique content of search inquiry.Search engine can be the same search engine that receives text query through the text box on the web page from the Internet user.Thus, mobile computing device can be carried out inquiry through coordinate (it is converted into the human language inquiry) is provided, and can receive and can in text box, key in the identical one or more Search Results of human language inquiry with the user.
In various examples, mobile computing device is automatically asked Search Results in response to request is used for the resource of the specific web page.For example, the user possibly key in the unified resource identifier (URI) that is used for search engine web site, and selects " going to " button.Computing equipment can transmit this request through the internet, and in response, receives the resource that is used to generate specific web page demonstration.The specific web page can dispose the indication that is used to show the single Search Results related with the mobile computing device geographic position.For example, the web page can be the web page that in Fig. 8, shows, and the indication of single Search Results can be a graphical user interface element 810.
In various examples, (for example, JavaScript) draw the web page according to the executable code of the sign that is used to ask single Search Results.In other examples; Server system is provided for the request of the resource of the web page in response to reception; The geographic position of identification mobile computing device; Confirm the region of search, confirm Search Results, and the resource that is used to generate the demonstration of the web page provides the indication of Search Results in response to this region of search.Thus; The user can ask the web page of Fig. 8 to show; And this web page can to the request of web page resource (for example submitted to; Select above-mentioned " going to " button, perhaps select to be used for the bookmark of the web page) occur afterwards to mobile computing device the Any user input being provided and need not the user so that show.
In various examples, the web page possibly not be in response to that the user submits search engine inquiry to and the web page that shows.In various examples, the indication of the single Search Results related with the mobile computing device current location may be displayed in the web page, even not input text inquiry or sound inquiry of user.The inquiry that is committed to search engine in this case can be based on the geographic position of mobile computing device, and is generated by server system.
Search Results can be selected from the Search Results storage vault by search engine.In various examples, each Search Results identification in the storage vault by the information service provider's master control on the internet and climb by traversal website and the search engine of discerning the web site contents and to get the web page that device is designated Search Results.For example, graphic interface element 810 sign " 16th century " cinemas.The selection of graphic interface element 810 can cause that mobile computing device navigates to the web page by master control on the territory this company of cinema master control and control and company's selection at the cinema.
In other examples, Search Results storage vault sign is by a plurality of web pages of single informant's master control.Each web page in this set can carry out similar format, and each identifies single place, and (for example, each page can be to run through " PLACE PAGE (the place page) " that this document is described.Thus, single informant can be on hundreds of individual, thousands of and even millions of geographic position the set of storage web website.
In the example of storage vault identification by the web page of single informant's master control, the data of storing to each web page can be structured to the content that comprises to each information category in some information categories.For example, the graphical user interface element in response to the user has selected to be used for " 16th century " cinema shows that the page of the additional content that is used for 16th century cinema can be presented to the user.This page can comprise the picture of cinema, the map of sign cinema position, the telephone number of cinema and address, and the user comment that is directed against this cinema.
Additionally, the page that is used for this cinema can show the region of search corresponding to this cinema position.For example, cinema can be positioned on geography in region of search " Mountain View, CA (Mountain View, California) ", " Bay Area (Gulf Area) " and " California (California) ".The link of thus, going to each region of search in these regions of search may be displayed in the demonstration of the web page that is used for this cinema.The user can cause the navigation of going to the content demonstration in association search zone to the selection of the graphical user interface element in one of relevant search zone.The summary information that for example, can present relevant region of search.In some example, can show to selected region of search to be confirmed as the web website of relevant rank.
The user can be used to revise the significance of selected region of search to the selection of region of search on the web page that is used for this cinema, perhaps revises to be provided for search engine so that the significance of the region of search of identification " 16th century " cinema's Search Results.For example; If the user of mobile device selects " 16th century " cinema's button 810; And select to go to link then corresponding to the view content of " Gulf Area ", then can indicate selected region of search and dissatisfied to the Search Results of selected region of search the selection of the link of " Gulf Area ".Thus, " zone, bay " more important place weighting of region of search, and the not important place weighting so of " Mountain View, CA " region of search.Weighting can be used for the geographic area around the mobile computing device, perhaps can be based on the corresponding minimum rank (for example, Mountain View, CA region of search) in the geographic position of mobile device.
The web page that in Fig. 8, shows can also comprise interface element 825, and its sign is used to select the region of search of Search Results (for example, Search Results) related with interface element 810.In other words, this web page shows the region of search indication that is used for confirming Search Results.In various examples, the user can be for example through selecting " optimization position " link 830 or changing the region of search through selection to the text that region of search 825 shows.
In response to selecting " optimization position " link 830, can show other region of search tabulations to the user corresponding to the mobile computing device geographic position.Select one of other regions of search in response to the user, region of search text 825 can upgrade, and identifying the region of search of new selection, and interface element 810 can upgrade, to show the new search result who the region of search of new selection is made response.
In various examples, server system safeguard as user's input results, to the staqtistical data base of the change of region of search.Change from first region of search to second region of search can cause that the weight that is used for second region of search increases, and the weight that is used for first region of search reduces.Can be general to the correction weight of arbitrary region of search in the region of search as far as all selections of region of search; Perhaps can be specific to selection to regional as follows region of search, wherein this area is associated with definite geographic position of confirming first region of search from it.The area that is associated with the geographic position of confirming can be corresponding minimum rank region of search, geographic position.
In some example, the web page that can show in response to the selection of user's docking port element 810 can select to be used to submit to the graphic interface element of inquiry the user, when the inquiry input text frame that is associated does not receive the Any user input, shows.For example; If graphic interface element 860 is submitted near the inquiry that the user selects the present search engine inquiry input text frame 850 to; But not when inquiry input text frame 850 input texts, mobile device can show with the user has selected the identical page of interface element 810 simply.
In various examples; The user can select inquiry to submit to interface element 860 to cause and navigate to the web page, submits to this web page of interface element 860 not comprise text display, the interface element 810 of region of search 825 and links any combination of 830 even show inquiry.In various examples and in response to the selection of inquiry being submitted to interface element 860, the content of the Search Results that sign is confirmed is displayed on from the drop-down frame of inquiry input text frame 850.
In various examples, combobox comprises the popular query suggestion to present region of search.In various examples, combobox comprises to the present region of search search result list of relevant rank.In various examples, combobox comprises the region of search tabulation relevant with current position.The user selects the region of search can cause that mobile device navigation to the web page relevant with the region of search shows, perhaps navigates to the single the most relevant rank web page to the region of search from combobox.

Fig. 3 C is shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, carries out the system 100 of location-based search and another more detailed implement of 200 parts.According to a realization, Fig. 3 C has described mobile device 110 and location finding server 250, and mobile device 110 comprises mobile search application 2 10 and position determiner 330.In the realization shown in Fig. 3 C, mobile search application 2 10 comprises display 320 and searching request device 325, and location finding server 250 comprises region of search determiner 340.As illustrate here, being depicted as the parts that are included on the particular device (for example, mobile device 110 and location finding server 250) can be placed on arbitrary equipment based on demands of applications generally, in addition can be between two equipment the execution of dividing function.In the realization shown in Fig. 3 C, region of search determiner 340 is included on the location finding server 250.Realize that at another in (not shown), each in mobile device 110 and the location finding server 250 has region of search determiner 360, and this function is cut apart between the two at this according to required.
In a broad sense; Described like hereinafter; In the realization that Fig. 3 C describes, position determiner 330 is confirmed the geographic position 332 of mobile device 110, and will be sent to the region of search determiner 340 on the location finding server 250 corresponding to the value in this geographic position of confirming 332.In this realized, region of search determiner 340 was confirmed potential region of search based on geographic position 332, and sent back the value corresponding to region of search tabulation 333 to mobile device 110.Shown on display 320 after the region of search tabulation 333 that mobile device 110 allows users to select the particular search zone, and be transferred back to location finding server 250 corresponding to the value of the region of search 334 of this selection.Shown in Fig. 3 C, most probable region of search can be set to default to the user, and can allow this user the region of search to be changed into one of reception value of in region of search tabulation 333, listing.Realize using the region of search of selecting 334 to form the part of the inquiry that is committed to location finding server 250 then.Location finding server 250 is return results item 352 then, and mobile search application 2 10 is display result item 352 on display 320.
Region of search determiner 340
Like what Fig. 4 described, the geographic position can be embodied in every way.During some that describe herein realizes, " region of search " expression abstraction level corresponding with the geographic position of search subscriber.For example, in Fig. 4, user 405 is 450 outsides in the shop just in time, and this shop is located in a business center 440, in the neighborhood 430,420 Hezhou 410, cities and towns.Commercial center 440 also is positioned near the point of interest (state park) of non-commercial.In the item 450,440,430,420 and 410 each is corresponding to the sample abstraction level, or the region of search.Realize that at other the region of search can be the granularity rank of confirming in (not shown), for example, with what measure apart from the distance in the geographic position of confirming.In other were realized, the region of search can be abstract concept and granularity association of ideas.
Region of search determiner 340 can use definite geographic position, and uses the mapping resource to confirm corresponding search zone 342.For example, GOOGLE MAPS can return the various regions of search corresponding to the geographic position.Other technologies also can be used for confirming different regions of search according to given geographic position.
Permission was characterized by the location-based Search Results that the region of search can promote to provide to the user usefulness with the geographic position before search.For example, user 405 physical location can be positioned at outside the specific electron shop 450, in commercial center 440.Based on this geographical position, can generate two different exemplary useful consequences in response to location-based search:
As a result 1: the result items that links to shop 450web website
As a result 2: the result who lists other shops in the commercial center 440
Different result items (such as, those shown in the preceding text) can provide based on the user search zone of selecting.If the region of search is set to e-shop 450, then result 1 possibly be the result items of selecting, and if the region of search be set to shopping center 440, then result 2 possibly be the result items of selecting.Through the notion of region of search and geographic area is separated, realization described herein allows the user to lock its location-based Search Results better.
In realization, can use additional convergent-divergent and description rank to realize with " zone " of carrying out search therein.For example:
A1: in particular super market, for example " food court ".
A2: in particular business in the heart, for example, shopping square, for example " Ka Ermo square ".
A3: in particular neighborhood, for example, " lakeside ".
A4: in specific " cities and towns part ", for example, " western part ".
A5: in the town, for example, " Fairfax, VA ".
A6: the area, for example, the Middle Atlantic area.
Above-mentioned all regions of search characterize and can comprise single geographic position.These examples A1-A6 is schematically, and is not used in restriction.Can use other regions of search to characterize.
In case the potential region of search of having discerned to specific geographic area characterizes, then realize to be provided in every way the region of search of location finding.As discussed above, in conjunction with Fig. 3 A-Fig. 3 C, in realization, the region of search can be confirmed automatically, is selected by the user, perhaps uses the combination of these modes.
As shown in Figure 5, realization can the use error amplitude (or predetermined, or derive), with assisted Selection particular search zone.For example; Be sitting in the supermarket if certain individuals is confirmed to illustrate in specific geographic position, but error span 510A is set to 1.5 miles, then can select neighborhood rank region of search; Perhaps in another was realized, the region of search can be set to half mile granularity.Alternatively, if be provided with relatively little error span 510B, then can use the region of search that comprises this shop 450 such as 500 feet.
Discussed to Fig. 3 C as above, is realized that employed another technology that is used for the optimization searching zone is to allow the user after having estimated the geographic position but before carrying out search, tabulate from the region of search of confirming and select 333.For example, above-mentioned A1-A6 tabulation can be presented to the user, and the user can therefrom select optimal region of search for its search of hoping to carry out.In alternative, additional realization can be selected " the best " region of search to specific user or search by usage criteria.As combine Fig. 8 to be discussed hereinafter, can allow to show this tabulation, and the user can select different regions of search to the user.
The variant that the region of search that above-mentioned user selects is selected comprises that the location finding appointment that allows the user to be directed against all execution to other preference of particular search region class, for example, to all search, illustrates neighborhood rank region of search.
The realization of location finding server 250 receives to the request of search, corresponding to the value of region of search, and corresponding to the value of classification, and produces one or more result items in response to these inputs.Result items can be selected by location finding server 250 in every way.Some realization can select technology (for example, the popularity and the degree of correlation) and disclosed principle here (such as, region of search) to combine known search terms.The example results selection factor comprises:
S1. to the correlated results item of given region of search.
S2. be directed against the most popular result items of given region of search.
S3. based on different mode of progressions, for example, walk, utilize automobile to advance and by bike, additional immediate result items in given region of search.The method of being considered can be based on the characteristic of region of search and is changed, and for example, it possibly be impossible for the position in the shopping plaza region of search that automobile is advanced.
S4. with the result items of the user profiles of result items preference coupling.
S5. the search one day in time.Different realizations can be considered the time with other factors (comprising the region of search), so that select Search Results.For example, the eye-catching Search Results of hiring a car with the restaurant that demonstrates can be provided, because these are the results that expect usually in that time to the users of 5 location-based search of execution in the afternoon.
S6. the search of carrying out by same user before.Different realizations can be considered user's search history.For example, if the user before selected Search Results when searching for to certain restaurant, and this user carries out location-based search after a while near this restaurant the time, then this result can be raised in location-based search.
S7. other data of being used by the user are used.Different realizations can utilize the information that is stored in other addressable application.For example, if just storage appointment in calendar application (such as, the GOOGLE CALENDAR that is provided by Google company) of user, then location finding server 250 can be visited this information, and uses this information to influence the selection of location-based Search Results.If for example the user is carrying out location-based search when being stored in the position in this user's calendar appointment, then can be preferably the position result items of being correlated with therewith.
Above-mentioned all examples are different modes of selection result item.Realization can use the combination of above-mentioned technological S1-S7 to come the selection result item.This example of characteristic S1-S7 is schematically, and can also use other realizations in due course.
Result items 352
As discussing at preceding text about Fig. 3 A-Fig. 3 C, realization can be listed, show and otherwise present various result items.The realization of location-based search described herein at least the return-list form URL, need not further user input and be shown as URL and other standard search engine results items of the web page.
The web page that is shown as result items can be like traditional web page of in above-mentioned S1-S4 factor, describing, selecting based on region of search combination web search criteria.For example, the result items of selecting to the store level region of search can be the main web page in this shop.The result items that will present in one example, the URL that goes to " electrical equipment of Joe " web page to the user of visit " electrical equipment of Joe ".In institute's result displayed item tabulation, the project of listing that is used for this example can also be included in the comment of the specific products of " electrical equipment of Joe " sale, and has " Better Business Bureau (BBB) " page about the commercial management warning of Joe.
Realization shown in Fig. 6 A and that also discuss herein can be returned the URL that is selected from unique URL set on the individual domain; Each URL in this unique URL set describes the different geographic place; For example, the Google PLACE PAGE (the place page) that provides by Google company.The single URL that shows to particular search zone 610 (for example, the airport) can be the ensemble of communication about the locality, comprises the web link of going to related urls, about the descriptive information (for example, textual description, map and picture) in this place.As a result of the PLACE PAGE of item can be by being presented in the tabulation like the realization among Fig. 6 B, and perhaps shown in Fig. 6 C, it can be shown as single result, and need not the further user input.
Classification determiner 360
Shown in Fig. 6 D and Fig. 7 B, and combine Fig. 3 C to discuss, realize allowing the user from selecting so that show the list of categories as a result at preceding text.As discussing at preceding text, realize that use classes determiner 360 generates list of categories to Fig. 3 C.In realization, the tabulation of this classification shows and from this tabulation, selects being supported in of classification to appear in the realization after the searching request to the user, but before display result is tabulated.
The realization of classification determiner 360 can generate list of categories in every way:
C1: tabulate based on standard category
C2: based on the configurable tabulation of user
C3: based on the region of search 334 of region of search 342 that receives or selection.Utilize the realization of this mode to check the region of search abstraction level, and the classification as response is provided.For example,,, then can send the classification relevant with shop and products thereof if user 405 has selected the region of search in shop 450 with reference to the region of search of figure 4, for example, product type, about the information in shop, and other relevant informations.Alternatively, if user 405 elects commercial center 440 as its region of search, then can send with the shopping center in other shopping machine meetings, map, the picture classification relevant with other relevant informations.If the user has selected non-commercial point of interest 460 (for example, state park), then the non-commercial classification around amusement and park amusement can appear with the business category to present shop, park and food.
C4. carry out the classification popularity of similar search based on other similar consumer positionings.
C5. the search one day in time.Different realizations can be considered the time with other factors (comprising the region of search), so that select classification.For example, the eye-catching classification of hiring a car with the restaurant that demonstrates can be provided, because these are the results that expect usually in that time to the users of 5 location-based search of execution in the afternoon.
The example of these classification generating modes C1-C5 is schematically, and the combination that other realizations can be used above-mentioned technological C1-C5 perhaps can also be used other this modes to select classification.
In realization, in case selected classification, the set of suitable subclass can be shown, perhaps the user can be directed to the tabulation of following result item.The realization that shows subclass can use the variant of the above-mentioned classification generating mode C1-C5 that enumerates to select.
The demonstration of result items
Shown in Fig. 6 B and Fig. 6 E, realization can show the result items tabulation of above-mentioned discussion immediately, or PLACE PAGE 650A-C, or URL 622A-C.Can carry out rank and filtration to project in every way, for example comprise traveling time by means of the degree of correlation, the degree of approach and estimation.
Shown in Fig. 6 C and Fig. 6 F, the other type of realize using visual display of display result item immediately after search, and need not the additional user input, for example, carry out search for after, display result item on user display immediately.Be used to use the exemplary search of this realization of display mode immediately can not have customer-furnished information, for example, search terms, and only have for example searching request through selecting search button to show.This no user provides the realization of information request to be called " scale-of-two request (binary request) ".
Exemplary realization
Fig. 7 A-Fig. 7 C is based on the searching graphic user interface example of shift position.In the exemplary operations of using the realization of GUI shown in Fig. 7 A, the user can ask position determiner 330 to upgrade user's position through the renewing button 710 of pushing on the GUI.This uses determiner 330 positions of request through upgrading from the position then.Position determiner 330 returns the geographic position then, and this geographic position can be shown on the GUI at 735 places then.Alternatively, in the described realization of the process flow diagram of Fig. 9 B, position determiner 330 can more newly-installed automatically geographic position, and need not above-mentioned user's request.In another realization, the value that shows at 735 places is based on the region of search that the geographic position is confirmed.
The user can push GUI button 740 then and ask search, and this button 740 for example is depicted as on Fig. 7 A and is marked with " now, near me ".As discussed above, will carry out different step the different this moments that are implemented in.A realization shown in Fig. 7 B will advance to and be presented at the list of categories that process described herein produces, and support that the user selects classification.Some realizes using this kind to select search result items.As some that illustrates on Fig. 7 B realize with classification with allow to show immediately the button (for example, being labeled as the button 750B of " searching herein ") of unfiled result items to list together.In realization, button click 750B will cause the demonstration shown in Fig. 7 C.Fig. 7 C further shows the user can selector button 780 (being labeled as " more results are shown "), to check additional Search Results.In realization, for example, if selected button 770, the URL that then describes selected project (" taxi service ") can be shown.
Substitute button click 750B, in realizing shown in Fig. 7 B, the user can select the classification listed, for example, and 750C-750F, and will be listed corresponding to this type of other result.In realization, the button 751 that is labeled as " browsing more multi-class " will present additional classification to the user.
Fig. 8 is based on the search GUI example of shift position.Realize shown in Fig. 8 is last and different for example being of realization shown in Fig. 7 A goes up that value 825 shows user's current geographic position, and button 810 dynamically labeled be default definite region of search, be directed against like preceding text that Fig. 3 C discusses.In realization, indicator 810 is illustrated, so that selected the region of search to user's indication.In additional the realization, for example, the shape of indicator 810 or color can be indicated to the user and introduced the error span of confirming the region of search, as to Fig. 5 discussed.In other were realized, the shape of indicator 810 and color can convey a message to the user.
Also as at preceding text discussed to Fig. 3 C, in the realization that Fig. 8 describes, the user can select " optimization position " link 830; And from the tabulation of other potential regions of search, select, for example, 16th century square; The Barcroft neighborhood; Falls Church, VA, or Washington D.C. zone.Also in this realizes, selector button 810 causes that location-based search carries out, and will carry out to Fig. 7 A-Fig. 7 C partly and the similar step described of other parts of this paper.
