Definitions
- This document relates to measuring the effectiveness of online advertisements.
- content items can be identified to a user by a search engine in response to a query submitted by the user.
- search engine is the GoogleTM search engine provided by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., U.S.A.
- the query can include one or more search terms, and the search engine can identify and, optionally, rank the content items based on the search terms in the query and present the content items to the user (e.g., according to the rank).
- the query can also be an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, it is possible to provide targeted advertisements to the user.
- advertisement syndication Another form of online advertising is advertisement syndication, which allows advertisers to extend their marketing reach by distributing advertisements to additional partners.
- third party online publishers can place an advertiser's text or image advertisements on web pages that have content related to the advertisement. As the users are likely interested in the particular content on the publisher webpage, they are also likely to be interested in the product or service featured in the advertisement. Accordingly, such targeted advertisement placement can help drive online customers to the advertiser's website.
- the serving of the advertisements can be further optimized by evaluating the effectiveness of the advertisements.
- One technique for evaluating the effectiveness of an advertisement is to survey an audience for advertisement recognition and brand linkage.
- the measure of advertisement recognition can, for example, be based on the percentage of a survey audience that recognizes the advertisement, and the measure of brand linkage can, for example, be based on the percentage of the survey audience that correctly identifies the featured product and/or brand of the advertisement.
- An advertisement can be brand obfuscated, i.e., branding and/or product information can be removed from the advertisement, and an audience can be surveyed to measure the brand linkage and advertisement recognition.
- Such surveys are typically conducted after an advertising campaign has run. Additionally, such surveys are typically context-independent, i.e., the surveys do not measure how effective an advertisement may be in the various contexts in which the advertisement may be presented.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of generating an evaluation version of an advertisement, the evaluation version of the advertisement including an evaluation tool for collecting evaluation results; serving the evaluation version of the advertisement for presentation in each of a plurality of contexts; for each serving of the evaluation version of the advertisement: determining the context in which the evaluation version of the advertisement is presented; receiving advertisement evaluation results for an evaluation conducted using the evaluation tool; and associating the advertisement evaluation results with the context in which the evaluation version of the advertisement is presented; and generating engagement rates for the evaluation version of the advertisement and the advertisement, each engagement rate being associated with at least one corresponding context of the plurality of contexts, each engagement rate being a measure of a rate of audience participation in evaluating the advertisement for the corresponding context using the evaluation tool, and each engagement rate being determined independent of a performance rate of the advertisement.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of generating evaluation versions of advertisements in an advertising campaign, each evaluation version including an evaluation tool for collecting evaluation results; serving the evaluation versions of the advertisements for presentation in each of a plurality of contexts; for each serving of an evaluation version of an advertisement, determining the context in which the evaluation version of the advertisement is presented; receiving advertisement evaluation results for an evaluation conducted using the evaluation tool; and generating engagement rates, each engagement rate being associated with an advertisement in the advertisement campaign and the corresponding evaluation version of the advertisement, and further associated with a corresponding context of the plurality of contexts, each engagement rate being a measure of a rate of participation in evaluating advertisement in the corresponding context, and each engagement rate being determined independently of performance rates of the advertisements.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving an advertisement request for presentation of an advertisement in an identified context, the identified context being one of a plurality of contexts; receiving auction bids for advertisements in response to the advertisement request, the auction bids including contextual bids, each contextual bid being based on one or more performance parameters for a corresponding advertisement and an effectiveness measure associated with the corresponding advertisement and the identified context; and selecting one or more advertisements based on the auction bids and serving the selected one or more advertisements in response to the advertisement request; wherein each corresponding advertisement can be served in a plurality of contexts, and each corresponding advertisement has a corresponding effectiveness measure for each of the plurality of contexts, each effectiveness measure determined from evaluation results received from evaluations conducted in the plurality of contexts.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying advertisements in an advertisement campaign; generating evaluation versions of the advertisements; serving the evaluation versions of the advertisements for presentation in a plurality of contexts; for each serving of an evaluation version of an advertisement: determining the context in which the evaluation version of the advertisement is presented; and determining whether a user selects the evaluation version of the advertisement in the context; receiving evaluation results for evaluation conducted from the evaluation version the advertisements; and generating an evaluation value for the advertisement for each of the plurality of contexts, the evaluation values including one or more of a brand linkage value, and advertisement likeability value, and an advertisement recognition value.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving an advertisement request for presentation of an advertisement in an identified context; receiving contextual bids for corresponding advertisements in response to the advertisement request, each contextual bid being based on one or more evaluation values associated with a corresponding advertisement and the identified context; and selecting one or more advertisements based on the contextual bids and serving the selected one or more advertisements in response to the advertisement request; wherein the corresponding advertisements each have a corresponding plurality of evaluation values for a corresponding plurality of contexts, each evaluation value determined from evaluation results received from evaluations conducted in the plurality of contexts; and the identified context is one of the plurality of contexts.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- engagement rates are a signal of how effective or ineffective the advertisement is in different contexts.
- the engagement rates can, in turn, be combined with other measurements obtained from evaluation results, such as brand linkage values, advertisement likeability values, and advertisement recognition values, to determine an advertisement effectiveness measure for each context.
- the engagement rate and/or advertisement effectiveness measure can be used, for example, to adjust an advertisement campaign or bidding parameters for an advertisement auction. Such adjustments can increase advertisement performance, and/or identify diminishing returns or negative impact due to overexposure of an advertisement.
- Additional features can include an in situ evaluation that is conducted without redirection or invasive pop-ups, and scalability of the evaluation from a single advertisement to an entire campaign.
- Brand X baseball equipment may have a very high engagement rate on college sports related web sites, and a very low engagement rate on professional sports related websites.
- the advertiser e.g., Brand X Company
- Brand X Company decides to place the advertisement on professional sports related web sites, Brand X Company can be required to offer a higher minimum bid than required for the college sports related web sites, as the advertisement is less effective in the context of professional sports.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online environment 100 .
- the online environment 100 can facilitate the identification and serving of content items, e.g., web pages, or advertisements, to users.
- a computer network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects advertisers 102 a and 102 b , an advertisement management system 104 , publishers 106 a and 106 b , user devices 108 a and 108 b , and a search engine 112 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- search engine 112 a search engine
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of advertisers, publishers and user devices.
- one or more advertisers 102 a and/or 102 b can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track advertisement information in the advertising management system 104 .
- the advertisements can be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, or advertisements combining one of more of any of such components, or any other type of electronic advertisement document 120 .
- the advertisements may also include embedded information, such as a links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions, such as HTML or JavaScriptTM.
- a user device such as user device 108 a , can submit a page content request 109 to a publisher or the search engine 112 .
- the page content 111 can be provided to the user device 108 a in response to the request 109 .
- the page content can include advertisements provided by the advertisement management system 104 , or can include executable instructions, e.g., JavaScriptTM instructions, that can be executed at the user device 108 a to request advertisements from the advertisement management system 104 .
- Example user devices 108 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and television set-top boxes.
- Advertisements can also be provided from the publishers 106 .
- one or more publishers 106 a and/or 106 b can submit advertisement requests for one or more advertisements to the system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending the advertisements to the requesting publisher 106 a or 106 b for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content).
- the advertisements can include embedded links to landing pages, e.g., pages on the advertisers' 102 websites, that a user is directed to when the user clicks an ad presented on a publisher website.
- the advertisement requests can also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, and arts-music.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, and mixed media), and geo-location information.
- content itself
- a category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, and arts-music.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, and mixed media
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information.
- a publisher 106 can combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104 .
- This combined page content request 109 and advertisements can be sent to the user device 108 that requested the content (e.g., user device 108 a ) as page content 111 for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a web browser or other content display system).
- the publisher 106 can transmit information about the advertisements back to the advertisement management system 104 , including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- Publishers 106 a and 106 b can include general content servers that receive requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, and information feeds), and retrieve the requested content in response to the request.
- content servers related to news content providers, retailers, independent blogs, social network sites, or any other entity that provides content over the network 110 can be a publisher.
- Advertisements can also be provided through the use of the search engine 112 .
- the search engine 112 can receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine 112 can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages). Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search engine 112 can also submit a request for advertisements to the system 104 .
- the request may include a number of advertisements desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, and the size and shape of the advertisements.
- the request for advertisements may also include the query (as entered, parsed, or expanded), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, and feature vectors of identified documents.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores.
- the search engine 112 can combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the user device 108 that requested the content as the page content 111 .
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the advertisements, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and search results.
- the advertisers 102 , user devices 108 , and/or the search engine 112 can also provide usage information to the advertisement management system 104 .
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served, such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or a selection related to an advertisement has occurred.
- the system 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- Such usage information can also be processed to measure performance metrics, such as a click-through rate (“CTR”), and conversion rate.
- CTR click-through rate
- a click-through can occur, for example, when a user of a user device, selects or “clicks” on a link to a content item returned by the publisher or the advertising management system.
- the CTR is a performance metric that is obtained by dividing the number of users that clicked on the content item, e.g., a link to a landing page, an advertisement, or a search result, by the number of times the content item was delivered. For example, if a link to a content item is delivered 100 times, and three persons click on the content item, then the CTR for that content item is 3%. Other usage information and/or performance metrics can also be used.
- a “conversion” occurs when a user consummates a transaction related to a previously served advertisement. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Website, viewing at least a certain number of Web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Website or Web page, or registering on a Website. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- the advertisements can also be selected from an auction.
- the advertisement management system 104 includes an auction process.
- Advertisers 102 may be permitted to select, or bid, an amount the advertisers are willing to pay for each click of an advertisement, e.g., a cost-per-click amount an advertiser pays when, for example, a user clicks on an advertisement.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay for each click of advertisement based on a keyword.
- advertisers A, B, and C all select, or bid, a maximum cost-per-click of $0.50, $0.75, and $1.00, respectively.
- the maximum amount advertiser A will pay for a click is $0.50
- the maximum amount advertiser B will pay is $1.00
- the maximum amount advertiser C will pay is $0.75.
- the rank of an advertisement that is displayed can be determined by multiplying the maximum cost-per-click for the advertisement by a quality score of the advertisement.
- the advertisement can then be placed among other advertisements in order of increasing or decreasing rank. For example, suppose the quality score of advertisers A, B, and C are “3,” “1,” and “1,” respectively.
- the rank of advertiser A, B, and C can be determined as follows:
- the advertisers can be ranked as follows:
- An advertisement can also be associated with an actual cost-per-click.
- the actual cost-per-click of the advertisement can be determined by the maximum cost-per-click of the advertisement, quality score of the advertisement, and by the amount selected or bid by the advertiser directly below.
- the actual cost-per-click can be the price that is necessary to keep the advertisement's position above the next advertisement.
- the system 104 can determine how much the advertiser in position 1 would have to pay to give them a rank equal to the advertiser in position 2 , and then the system 104 adds a unit amount, e.g., $.01, to this determined amount.
- the rank of position 2 can be divided by the quality score of position 1 and $.01 can be added to that amount.
- the last advertiser in the list can pay a minimum cost-per-click to hold the position in the list. For example, suppose the minimum cost-per-click is $0.20.
- the actual cost-per-click of advertisers A, B, and C can be determined as follows:
- advertiser A would only have to pay $0.34 to hold the first position in the list of advertisements.
- C would have to pay $0.76 to hold the second position.
- Advertiser B would be required to pay the minimum cost-per-click amount of $0.20.
- the advertisements, associated usage data, and bidding parameters described above can be stored as advertisement data in an advertisement data store 114 .
- An advertiser 102 can further manage the serving of advertisement by specifying an advertising campaign.
- the advertising campaign can be stored in campaign data in a campaign data store 116 , which can, for example, specify advertising budgets for advertisements, when, where and under what conditions particular advertisements may be served for presentation.
- a computer company may design an advertising campaign for a new laptop computer that is scheduled to be released on November 20.
- the advertising campaign may have a budget of $500,000, and may have 30 different advertisements that are to be served for presentation during the month of November.
- Such data defining the advertisement campaign can be stored in the campaign data 116 .
- the advertising management system 104 permits the serving of advertisements targeted to documents served by the publishers 106 and the search engine 112 . Additionally, the usage information and quality factors described above can be used by the advertisement management system 104 to serve higher performing advertisements that are more likely to elicit a response from users of the user devices 108 a and 108 b.
- the serving of the advertisements can be further optimized by evaluating the effectiveness of the advertisements.
- One technique for evaluating the effectiveness of an advertisement is to have an audience, e.g., users of the user devices 108 , evaluate the advertisement for advertisement recognition and brand linkage.
- the evaluation can be used to collect evaluation results that can be used to generate evaluation values that measure various advertisement features of advertisement effectiveness. For example, a measure of advertisement recognition can be based on the percentage of an evaluating audience that recognizes the advertisement, and the measure of brand linkage can, for example, be based on the percentage of the evaluating audience that correctly identifies the featured product and/or brand of the advertisement.
- the advertisement management system 104 includes a contextual evaluation subsystem 130 .
- the contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can also measure how effective an advertisement is in the various contexts in which the advertisement may be presented.
- Such contexts can include, for example, content dependent contexts, time dependent contexts, visually dependent contexts, or other contexts.
- An example of a content dependent context is a context defined by the publisher content in which the advertisement is presented. For example, an advertisement presented on a sports-related web page is presented in a sports context, and the same advertisement presented on a financial news-related web page is presented in a financial context.
- Such content contexts can, for example, be identified by meta-data related to the web page in which the advertisement is presented; by mining text of the web page to identify keywords associated with particular content types; or by identifying a predefined category to which the web page belongs. Other processes for identifying a content context can also be used.
- time dependent contexts can be defined by the local time of the user device 108 to which the advertisement is served, or defined by a reference to a standard time, such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
- GTT Greenwich Mean Time
- visually dependent contexts can, for example be defined by a visual aspect of the advertisement, such as a different font sizes or styles; and different images. Other parameters or features that can define a context in which the advertisement is presented can be used.
- the search context is a context in which the advertisement is presented in response to identification of a search query for which the advertisement is determined to be relevant.
- advertisements presented in conjunction with search results from the search engine 112 are presented in the search context.
- the content context is a context in which the advertisement is presented in response to identification of publisher content for which the advertisement is determined to be relevant.
- a sporting equipment advertisement that is deemed relevant to the content of a sports-related web site may be selected for presentation with a web page for the sports-related web site. Such a presentation with the web page is a presentation in the content context.
- the advertiser can learn in which context the advertisement is most effective. Accordingly, advertisement placement, budgeting, and other advertising and/or campaign related factors can be adjusted to facilitate a more efficient use of the advertiser's resources.
- the contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can generate an evaluation version 122 of the advertisement 120 .
- the evaluation version 122 of the advertisement 120 can, for example, be generated by embedding an advertisement evaluation tool 132 in the advertisement 120 .
- the advertisement evaluation tool 132 can be computer instructions, e.g., HTML, JavaScriptTM, or some other instructions executable by a computer device, such as a user device 108 .
- the advertisement 120 can be brand obfuscated, i.e., a brand name or product identifier can be removed from the advertisement. For example, an advertisement image from a still advertisement or a key frame from a video advertisement can be used to generate a debranded version of the advertisement 120 .
- the advertisement 120 can be served for presentation in a plurality of contexts C 1 , C 2 , C 3 . . . Cn in response to a corresponding plurality of advertisement requests. For example, as requests for advertisements are received from the publishers 102 a and 102 b , and/or the user devices 108 a and 108 b , and/or the search engine 112 , the advertisement 120 may be served for presentation.
- the contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can serve the evaluation version 122 of the advertisement 120 in response to a subset of the advertisement requests, e.g., for every n th request, the advertisement management system 104 can serve the evaluation version 122 of the advertisement.
- Other selection processes can also be used to serve the evaluation version 122 of the advertisement 120 , e.g., a random selection process, a contextual balancing process that proportionally serves the evaluation versions 122 according to contexts.
- the contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can determine the context in which the evaluation version 122 of the advertisement 120 is presented. The determination can, for example, be made based on the content of a presentation environment, e.g., a sports web page, or news web page; or the determination can be made based on the web address of a requesting publisher; or by processing any other relevant information indicative of context in which the evaluation version 122 is presented.
- a presentation environment e.g., a sports web page, or news web page
- processing any other relevant information indicative of context in which the evaluation version 122 is presented e.g., a sports web page, or news web page.
- the evaluation tool 132 can be presented to a user as a survey or some other assessment opportunity by which the user can evaluate the advertisement by use of the evaluation tool 132 .
- the contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can determine whether a user selects the advertisement evaluation tool 132 presented in the context, and can receive advertisement evaluation results QR 1 , QR 2 , QR 3 . . . QRn for evaluations conducted using the advertisement evaluation tool 132 .
- advertisement evaluation results QR 1 , QR 2 , QR 3 . . . QRn for evaluations conducted using the advertisement evaluation tool 132 .
- approximately 50% of the evaluation versions 122 of the advertisement 120 are selected for conducting an evaluation, as illustrated by unselected white impression circles and selected shaded impression circles.
- approximately 25% of the evaluation versions 122 are selected in the context C 2 ; almost none are selected in the context C 3 ; and nearly all are selected in the context Cn.
- the corresponding evaluation results for the evaluations conducted can be provided to the advertising management system 104 and stored as the evaluation data 134 .
- the contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can generate engagement rates for the evaluation version 122 and the advertisement 120 .
- Each engagement rate ER 1 , ER 2 , ER 3 . . . ERn is associated with the corresponding context C 1 , C 2 , C 3 . . . Cn of the plurality of contexts.
- Each engagement rate ER 1 , ER 2 , ER 3 . . . ERn is a measure of a rate of participation of use of the advertisement evaluation tool 132 for the corresponding context C 1 , C 2 , C 3 . . . Cn.
- Each engagement rate can be determined independently of a performance rate of the advertisement 120 , e.g., the engagement rate can be determined independent of an overall click-through rate of the advertisement 120 , or some other measure of performance of the advertisement when the advertisement is presented without the evaluation tool 132 .
- each engagement rate ER is indicative of a level of user interaction with the advertisement evaluation tool 132 in a corresponding context C, which, in turn, is an indirect signal of an audience response to the advertisement 120 .
- the engagement rate signal can either be a negative signal, e.g., audience dislike, or a positive signal, e.g., audience acceptance.
- the engagement rate alone may not necessarily indicate the effectiveness of the advertisement 120 .
- an evaluation version 122 of an advertisement 120 may have a particularly high engagement rate ER in a corresponding context C.
- the engagement rate ER may be particularly high in that context C because users in that context C may dislike the advertisement and desire to make their displeasure known to the advertiser.
- the engagement rate ER is combined with other data to generate advertisement effectiveness measures.
- the engagement rates ER 1 , ER 2 , ER 3 . . . ERn and the evaluation results QR 1 , QR 2 , QR 3 . . . QRn can be used to generate the advertisement effectiveness measure for each of the contexts C 1 , C 2 , C 3 . . . Cn.
- each advertisement effectiveness measure can be based on the advertisement recognition value, the brand linkage value, and the engagement rate ER associated with the context C.
- the evaluation values of advertisement recognition value, brand linkage value and engagement rates are percentage values
- each advertisement effectiveness measure can be a product of the three values, e.g.,
- AR is the percentage of the evaluating audience in all contexts C 1 , C 2 , C 3 . . . Cn that recognized the advertisement
- BL is the percentage of the evaluating audience in all contexts C 1 , C 2 , C 3 . . . Cn that recognized the brand linkage
- ERx is the engagement rate of a particular context Cx.
- the advertisement recognition values and the brand linkage values can be associated with each context, and each advertisement effectiveness measure can be a product of the three values for each context, e.g.,
- ARx is the percentage of the evaluating audience in a particular context Cx that recognized the advertisement
- BLx is the percentage of the evaluating audience in a particular context that recognized the brand linkage
- ERx is the engagement rate of the particular context Cx.
- an additional advertisement likeability value L can also be included.
- the likeability value L can be determined by qualitative evaluation results, e.g., a Likert scale of ratings of 1-5, with 1 indicative of a low degree of likeability and 5 indicative of a high degree of likeability, and the overall value normalized to 1.
- the effectiveness measure for a context can be the product of four values, e.g.,
- Lx is a likeability value for a particular context.
- the effectiveness measure for a context can be determined independent of an engagement rate for the context.
- an effectiveness measure for a context can be equal to the brand linkage value for that context.
- the contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can determine advertisement effectiveness measures based on the number of evaluation questions answered for each evaluation, and based on other values instead of percentages.
- the advertisement evaluation tool 132 may include hierarchal evaluation questions that are presented in response to receiving a response to a first hierarchal evaluation question or a previous hierarchal evaluation question, and the evaluation results can include data indicating a quantity of hierarchal evaluation questions presented, e.g., answered.
- the engagement rates ER 1 , ER 2 , ER 3 . . . ERn for the advertisement can be generated by weighing each engagement rate ER according to the quantity of hierarchal evaluation questions presented in corresponding advertisement evaluations 132 .
- an advertisement evaluation may include six hierarchal questions, e.g., questions that are presented conditioned on an answer to a previously presented or first question.
- an engagement count can be generated, e.g., a count value of 1.
- the count value can be weighted by a factor of 1/2, e.g., 3/6.
- the count value can be weighted by a factor of 1/3, i.e., 2/6.
- Such a weighting can result in an engagement rate that is based on both an actual engagement of the evaluation tool 132 and a degree of engagement, i.e., questioning depth, of the evaluation tool 132 .
- the weighted engagement rates can thus be used to generate the advertisement effectiveness measures as described above.
- the contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can determine advertisement effectiveness measures based on qualitative data provided in the evaluation results.
- the advertisement evaluation tool 132 may include questions that measure an audience's rating of the advertisement 120 , e.g., “Rate this advertisement on a scale of 1-5 (1 being the worst rating, 5 being the best rating).”
- the contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can generate an advertisement effectiveness measure for a particular context C. For example, a central tendency of the evaluation results can be determined, e.g., an average. An average value of three can be determined to be neutral and result in an effectiveness measure that is proportional to the engagement rate; an average value of less than three can be determined to be negative and result in an effectiveness measure that is a negative multiple of the engagement rate; and an average value greater than three can be determined to be positive and result in an effectiveness measure that is a positive multiple of the engagement rate. Other processes for generating an effectiveness measure based on qualitative data can also be used.
- the contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can identify advertisements in an advertisement campaign, and generate evaluation versions 122 of the advertisements, as indicated by the ellipses trailing the advertisement 120 .
- Each evaluation version 122 of the advertisements 120 can be served as described above, and the evaluation results QR 1 , QR 2 , QR 3 . . . QRn for each context C 1 , C 2 , C 3 . . . Cn can likewise be processed for each evaluation version 122 .
- Engagement rates ER 1 , ER 2 , ER 3 . ERn the advertisement 120 in the advertisement campaign and the corresponding evaluation versions 122 can be generated in a similar manner as described above.
- the engagement rates ER 1 , ER 2 , ER 3 . . . ERn, evaluation results QR 1 , QR 2 , QR 3 . . . QRn and the advertisement effectiveness measures can be stored in the evaluation data store 134 . Additionally, the engagement rate and/or the advertisement effectiveness measure for each context C 1 , C 2 , C 3 . . . Cn can be used to adjust advertisement placement, budgeting, and other advertising and/or campaign related factors to facilitate a more efficient use of the advertiser's resources. For example, a particular image associated with the advertisement 120 may be adjusted and the adjustment persisted to the advertisement data store 114 . Likewise, an advertising budget, run rate, and/or placement parameters may be adjusted and persisted to the campaign data store 116 .
- the advertisement evaluation tool 132 can include computer instructions that generate an in situ evaluation.
- the advertisement evaluation tool 132 upon execution by a user device 108 , can generate the in situ evaluation substantially within the display region that would be normally occupied by the advertisement 120 , i.e., the display region occupied by the evaluation version 122 .
- the in situ evaluation is an evaluation having an evaluation environment substantially within the display area of the evaluation version 122 of the advertisement, i.e., engagement of the evaluation tool does not redirect a web browser to a separate evaluation landing page or open a new browser window directed to the evaluation landing page.

- a first in situ evaluation environment 230 presents questions related to advertisement recognition and likeability.
- a user selection of “No” indicates a lack of advertisement recognition; conversely, a selection of one or “Yes—Like it” or “Yes—Dislike it” indicates both advertisement recognition and a corresponding likeability factor.
- questions to measure likeability can also be used.
- the questions can be directed to rating the advertisement, e.g., on a scale of 1-5, ratings of 1-5, with 1 indicative of a low degree of likeability and 5 indicative of a high degree of likeability; or presenting a broader range of “yes” responses, such as “Yes, and I love it!,” “Yes, and it's okay.” and “Yes, and I can't stand it!”
- FIG. 2C illustrates a screen shot 204 depicting the displayed evaluation version 222 of the advertisement 220 .

Description
- This Application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119 of the filing date of U.S. Patent Application No. 60/980,725, entitled “Measuring Online Advertisement Effectiveness,” filed on Oct. 17, 2007, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
- This document relates to measuring the effectiveness of online advertisements.
- The rise of the Internet has enabled access to a wide variety of content items, e.g., video and/or audio files, web pages for particular subjects, and news articles. Such access to these content items has likewise enabled opportunities for targeted advertising. For example, content items can be identified to a user by a search engine in response to a query submitted by the user. One example search engine is the Google™ search engine provided by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., U.S.A. The query can include one or more search terms, and the search engine can identify and, optionally, rank the content items based on the search terms in the query and present the content items to the user (e.g., according to the rank). The query can also be an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, it is possible to provide targeted advertisements to the user.
- Another form of online advertising is advertisement syndication, which allows advertisers to extend their marketing reach by distributing advertisements to additional partners. For example, third party online publishers can place an advertiser's text or image advertisements on web pages that have content related to the advertisement. As the users are likely interested in the particular content on the publisher webpage, they are also likely to be interested in the product or service featured in the advertisement. Accordingly, such targeted advertisement placement can help drive online customers to the advertiser's website.
- The serving of the advertisements can be further optimized by evaluating the effectiveness of the advertisements. One technique for evaluating the effectiveness of an advertisement is to survey an audience for advertisement recognition and brand linkage. The measure of advertisement recognition can, for example, be based on the percentage of a survey audience that recognizes the advertisement, and the measure of brand linkage can, for example, be based on the percentage of the survey audience that correctly identifies the featured product and/or brand of the advertisement. An advertisement can be brand obfuscated, i.e., branding and/or product information can be removed from the advertisement, and an audience can be surveyed to measure the brand linkage and advertisement recognition.
- Such surveys, however, are typically conducted after an advertising campaign has run. Additionally, such surveys are typically context-independent, i.e., the surveys do not measure how effective an advertisement may be in the various contexts in which the advertisement may be presented.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of generating an evaluation version of an advertisement, the evaluation version of the advertisement including an evaluation tool for collecting evaluation results; serving the evaluation version of the advertisement for presentation in each of a plurality of contexts; for each serving of the evaluation version of the advertisement: determining the context in which the evaluation version of the advertisement is presented; receiving advertisement evaluation results for an evaluation conducted using the evaluation tool; and associating the advertisement evaluation results with the context in which the evaluation version of the advertisement is presented; and generating engagement rates for the evaluation version of the advertisement and the advertisement, each engagement rate being associated with at least one corresponding context of the plurality of contexts, each engagement rate being a measure of a rate of audience participation in evaluating the advertisement for the corresponding context using the evaluation tool, and each engagement rate being determined independent of a performance rate of the advertisement. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of generating evaluation versions of advertisements in an advertising campaign, each evaluation version including an evaluation tool for collecting evaluation results; serving the evaluation versions of the advertisements for presentation in each of a plurality of contexts; for each serving of an evaluation version of an advertisement, determining the context in which the evaluation version of the advertisement is presented; receiving advertisement evaluation results for an evaluation conducted using the evaluation tool; and generating engagement rates, each engagement rate being associated with an advertisement in the advertisement campaign and the corresponding evaluation version of the advertisement, and further associated with a corresponding context of the plurality of contexts, each engagement rate being a measure of a rate of participation in evaluating advertisement in the corresponding context, and each engagement rate being determined independently of performance rates of the advertisements. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving an advertisement request for presentation of an advertisement in an identified context, the identified context being one of a plurality of contexts; receiving auction bids for advertisements in response to the advertisement request, the auction bids including contextual bids, each contextual bid being based on one or more performance parameters for a corresponding advertisement and an effectiveness measure associated with the corresponding advertisement and the identified context; and selecting one or more advertisements based on the auction bids and serving the selected one or more advertisements in response to the advertisement request; wherein each corresponding advertisement can be served in a plurality of contexts, and each corresponding advertisement has a corresponding effectiveness measure for each of the plurality of contexts, each effectiveness measure determined from evaluation results received from evaluations conducted in the plurality of contexts. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying advertisements in an advertisement campaign; generating evaluation versions of the advertisements; serving the evaluation versions of the advertisements for presentation in a plurality of contexts; for each serving of an evaluation version of an advertisement: determining the context in which the evaluation version of the advertisement is presented; and determining whether a user selects the evaluation version of the advertisement in the context; receiving evaluation results for evaluation conducted from the evaluation version the advertisements; and generating an evaluation value for the advertisement for each of the plurality of contexts, the evaluation values including one or more of a brand linkage value, and advertisement likeability value, and an advertisement recognition value. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving an advertisement request for presentation of an advertisement in an identified context; receiving contextual bids for corresponding advertisements in response to the advertisement request, each contextual bid being based on one or more evaluation values associated with a corresponding advertisement and the identified context; and selecting one or more advertisements based on the contextual bids and serving the selected one or more advertisements in response to the advertisement request; wherein the corresponding advertisements each have a corresponding plurality of evaluation values for a corresponding plurality of contexts, each evaluation value determined from evaluation results received from evaluations conducted in the plurality of contexts; and the identified context is one of the plurality of contexts. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Various optional advantages and features can include the determination of engagement rates for many different contexts. Such engagement rates are a signal of how effective or ineffective the advertisement is in different contexts. The engagement rates can, in turn, be combined with other measurements obtained from evaluation results, such as brand linkage values, advertisement likeability values, and advertisement recognition values, to determine an advertisement effectiveness measure for each context. The engagement rate and/or advertisement effectiveness measure can be used, for example, to adjust an advertisement campaign or bidding parameters for an advertisement auction. Such adjustments can increase advertisement performance, and/or identify diminishing returns or negative impact due to overexposure of an advertisement. Additional features can include an in situ evaluation that is conducted without redirection or invasive pop-ups, and scalability of the evaluation from a single advertisement to an entire campaign.
- For example, consider evaluation versions of advertisements for Brand X baseball equipment may have a very high engagement rate on college sports related web sites, and a very low engagement rate on professional sports related websites. The advertiser, e.g., Brand X Company, may determine that instead of a 50/50 split between professional and college advertisement placement, a better campaign strategy might be a 10/90 split between professional and college advertisement placement, as the viewers on the college sports related websites are much more responsive. Additionally, if Brand X Company decides to place the advertisement on professional sports related web sites, Brand X Company can be required to offer a higher minimum bid than required for the college sports related web sites, as the advertisement is less effective in the context of professional sports.
- These various optional advantages and features can be separately realized and need not present in any particular embodiment. The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

The advertisements can be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, or advertisements combining one of more of any of such components, or any other type ofelectronic advertisement document 120. The advertisements may also include embedded information, such as a links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions, such as HTML or JavaScript™. - A user device, such as
user device 108 a, can submit apage content request 109 to a publisher or thesearch engine 112. In some implementations, thepage content 111 can be provided to theuser device 108 a in response to therequest 109. The page content can include advertisements provided by theadvertisement management system 104, or can include executable instructions, e.g., JavaScript™ instructions, that can be executed at theuser device 108 a to request advertisements from theadvertisement management system 104. Example user devices 108 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and television set-top boxes. - Advertisements can also be provided from the publishers 106. For example, one or
more publishers 106 a and/or 106 b can submit advertisement requests for one or more advertisements to thesystem 104. Thesystem 104 responds by sending the advertisements to the requestingpublisher - In some implementations, a publisher 106 can combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the
system 104. This combinedpage content request 109 and advertisements can be sent to the user device 108 that requested the content (e.g.,user device 108 a) aspage content 111 for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a web browser or other content display system). The publisher 106 can transmit information about the advertisements back to theadvertisement management system 104, including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScript™). -
Publishers network 110 can be a publisher. - Advertisements can also be provided through the use of the
search engine 112. Thesearch engine 112 can receive queries for search results. In response, thesearch engine 112 can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages). Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results. - The
search engine 112 can also submit a request for advertisements to thesystem 104. The request may include a number of advertisements desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, and the size and shape of the advertisements. The request for advertisements may also include the query (as entered, parsed, or expanded), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results. Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, and feature vectors of identified documents. In some implementations, IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores. - The
search engine 112 can combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by thesystem 104. This combined information can then be forwarded to the user device 108 that requested the content as thepage content 111. The search results can be maintained as distinct from the advertisements, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and search results. - The advertisers 102, user devices 108, and/or the
search engine 112 can also provide usage information to theadvertisement management system 104. This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served, such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or a selection related to an advertisement has occurred. Thesystem 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information. Such usage information can also be processed to measure performance metrics, such as a click-through rate (“CTR”), and conversion rate. - A click-through can occur, for example, when a user of a user device, selects or “clicks” on a link to a content item returned by the publisher or the advertising management system. The CTR is a performance metric that is obtained by dividing the number of users that clicked on the content item, e.g., a link to a landing page, an advertisement, or a search result, by the number of times the content item was delivered. For example, if a link to a content item is delivered 100 times, and three persons click on the content item, then the CTR for that content item is 3%. Other usage information and/or performance metrics can also be used.
- A “conversion” occurs when a user consummates a transaction related to a previously served advertisement. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. A conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Website, viewing at least a certain number of Web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Website or Web page, or registering on a Website. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- In addition to the advertisements being selected based on content such as a search query or web page content of a publisher, the advertisements can also be selected from an auction. In some implementations, the
advertisement management system 104 includes an auction process. Advertisers 102 may be permitted to select, or bid, an amount the advertisers are willing to pay for each click of an advertisement, e.g., a cost-per-click amount an advertiser pays when, for example, a user clicks on an advertisement. The cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay for each click of advertisement based on a keyword. For example, advertisers A, B, and C all select, or bid, a maximum cost-per-click of $0.50, $0.75, and $1.00, respectively. The maximum amount advertiser A will pay for a click is $0.50, the maximum amount advertiser B will pay is $1.00, and the maximum amount advertiser C will pay is $0.75. - The rank of an advertisement that is displayed can be determined by multiplying the maximum cost-per-click for the advertisement by a quality score of the advertisement. The advertisement can then be placed among other advertisements in order of increasing or decreasing rank. For example, suppose the quality score of advertisers A, B, and C are “3,” “1,” and “1,” respectively. The rank of advertiser A, B, and C can be determined as follows:
- A: Rank=quality score×maximum cost-per-click=3.0×$0.50=1.50
- B: Rank=quality score×maximum cost-per-click=1.0×$0.75=0.75
- C: Rank=quality score×maximum cost-per-click=1.0×$1.00=1.00
- The advertisers can be ranked as follows:
- 1. A
- 2. C
- 3. B
- An advertisement can also be associated with an actual cost-per-click. The actual cost-per-click of the advertisement can be determined by the maximum cost-per-click of the advertisement, quality score of the advertisement, and by the amount selected or bid by the advertiser directly below. In one implementation, the actual cost-per-click can be the price that is necessary to keep the advertisement's position above the next advertisement. To determine the actual cost-per-click, the
system 104 can determine how much the advertiser in position 1 would have to pay to give them a rank equal to the advertiser in position 2, and then thesystem 104 adds a unit amount, e.g., $.01, to this determined amount. - To determine how much the advertiser in position 1 would have to pay to give them a rank equal to the advertiser in position 2, the rank of position 2 can be divided by the quality score of position 1 and $.01 can be added to that amount. The last advertiser in the list can pay a minimum cost-per-click to hold the position in the list. For example, suppose the minimum cost-per-click is $0.20. The actual cost-per-click of advertisers A, B, and C can be determined as follows:
- A: C's rank/A's quality score=1.0/3=$0.33+$0.01=$0.34
- C: B's rank/C's quality score=0.751=$0.75+$0.01=$0.76
- B: minimum cost-per-click=$0.20
- In this example, advertiser A would only have to pay $0.34 to hold the first position in the list of advertisements. C would have to pay $0.76 to hold the second position. Advertiser B would be required to pay the minimum cost-per-click amount of $0.20.
- The advertisements, associated usage data, and bidding parameters described above can be stored as advertisement data in an
advertisement data store 114. An advertiser 102 can further manage the serving of advertisement by specifying an advertising campaign. The advertising campaign can be stored in campaign data in acampaign data store 116, which can, for example, specify advertising budgets for advertisements, when, where and under what conditions particular advertisements may be served for presentation. For example, a computer company may design an advertising campaign for a new laptop computer that is scheduled to be released on November 20. The advertising campaign may have a budget of $500,000, and may have 30 different advertisements that are to be served for presentation during the month of November. Such data defining the advertisement campaign can be stored in thecampaign data 116. - As can be appreciated from the foregoing, the
advertising management system 104 permits the serving of advertisements targeted to documents served by the publishers 106 and thesearch engine 112. Additionally, the usage information and quality factors described above can be used by theadvertisement management system 104 to serve higher performing advertisements that are more likely to elicit a response from users of theuser devices - The serving of the advertisements, such as the
advertisement 120, can be further optimized by evaluating the effectiveness of the advertisements. One technique for evaluating the effectiveness of an advertisement is to have an audience, e.g., users of the user devices 108, evaluate the advertisement for advertisement recognition and brand linkage. The evaluation can be used to collect evaluation results that can be used to generate evaluation values that measure various advertisement features of advertisement effectiveness. For example, a measure of advertisement recognition can be based on the percentage of an evaluating audience that recognizes the advertisement, and the measure of brand linkage can, for example, be based on the percentage of the evaluating audience that correctly identifies the featured product and/or brand of the advertisement. - Such advertisement measurements alone are context-independent, i.e., the measurements of brand linkage and advertisement recognition alone do not reveal a measure of contextual effectiveness of an advertisement. Accordingly, in some implementations, the
advertisement management system 104 includes acontextual evaluation subsystem 130. In addition to being able to collect evaluation results related to brand linkage, advertisement recognition, and other context-independent advertisement data, thecontextual evaluation subsystem 130 can also measure how effective an advertisement is in the various contexts in which the advertisement may be presented. Such contexts can include, for example, content dependent contexts, time dependent contexts, visually dependent contexts, or other contexts. - An example of a content dependent context is a context defined by the publisher content in which the advertisement is presented. For example, an advertisement presented on a sports-related web page is presented in a sports context, and the same advertisement presented on a financial news-related web page is presented in a financial context. Such content contexts can, for example, be identified by meta-data related to the web page in which the advertisement is presented; by mining text of the web page to identify keywords associated with particular content types; or by identifying a predefined category to which the web page belongs. Other processes for identifying a content context can also be used.
- Similarly, time dependent contexts can be defined by the local time of the user device 108 to which the advertisement is served, or defined by a reference to a standard time, such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Likewise, visually dependent contexts can, for example be defined by a visual aspect of the advertisement, such as a different font sizes or styles; and different images. Other parameters or features that can define a context in which the advertisement is presented can be used.
- Other example contexts can be a search context and a content context. The search context is a context in which the advertisement is presented in response to identification of a search query for which the advertisement is determined to be relevant. For example, advertisements presented in conjunction with search results from the
search engine 112 are presented in the search context. The content context is a context in which the advertisement is presented in response to identification of publisher content for which the advertisement is determined to be relevant. For example, a sporting equipment advertisement that is deemed relevant to the content of a sports-related web site may be selected for presentation with a web page for the sports-related web site. Such a presentation with the web page is a presentation in the content context. - By measuring the contextual effectiveness of an advertisement, the advertiser can learn in which context the advertisement is most effective. Accordingly, advertisement placement, budgeting, and other advertising and/or campaign related factors can be adjusted to facilitate a more efficient use of the advertiser's resources.
- In some implementations, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can generate anevaluation version 122 of theadvertisement 120. Theevaluation version 122 of theadvertisement 120 can, for example, be generated by embedding anadvertisement evaluation tool 132 in theadvertisement 120. In some implementations, theadvertisement evaluation tool 132 can be computer instructions, e.g., HTML, JavaScript™, or some other instructions executable by a computer device, such as a user device 108. In some implementations, theadvertisement 120 can be brand obfuscated, i.e., a brand name or product identifier can be removed from the advertisement. For example, an advertisement image from a still advertisement or a key frame from a video advertisement can be used to generate a debranded version of theadvertisement 120. - The
advertisement 120 can be served for presentation in a plurality of contexts C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn in response to a corresponding plurality of advertisement requests. For example, as requests for advertisements are received from thepublishers user devices search engine 112, theadvertisement 120 may be served for presentation. In some implementations, thecontextual evaluation subsystem 130 can serve theevaluation version 122 of theadvertisement 120 in response to a subset of the advertisement requests, e.g., for every nth request, theadvertisement management system 104 can serve theevaluation version 122 of the advertisement. Other selection processes can also be used to serve theevaluation version 122 of theadvertisement 120, e.g., a random selection process, a contextual balancing process that proportionally serves theevaluation versions 122 according to contexts. - The
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can determine the context in which theevaluation version 122 of theadvertisement 120 is presented. The determination can, for example, be made based on the content of a presentation environment, e.g., a sports web page, or news web page; or the determination can be made based on the web address of a requesting publisher; or by processing any other relevant information indicative of context in which theevaluation version 122 is presented. - The
evaluation tool 132 can be presented to a user as a survey or some other assessment opportunity by which the user can evaluate the advertisement by use of theevaluation tool 132. In some implementations, thecontextual evaluation subsystem 130 can determine whether a user selects theadvertisement evaluation tool 132 presented in the context, and can receive advertisement evaluation results QR1, QR2, QR3 . . . QRn for evaluations conducted using theadvertisement evaluation tool 132. For example, in the context C1, approximately 50% of theevaluation versions 122 of theadvertisement 120 are selected for conducting an evaluation, as illustrated by unselected white impression circles and selected shaded impression circles. Likewise, approximately 25% of theevaluation versions 122 are selected in the context C2; almost none are selected in the context C3; and nearly all are selected in the context Cn. The corresponding evaluation results for the evaluations conducted can be provided to theadvertising management system 104 and stored as theevaluation data 134. - For each context C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can generate engagement rates for theevaluation version 122 and theadvertisement 120. Each engagement rate ER1, ER2, ER3 . . . ERn is associated with the corresponding context C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn of the plurality of contexts. Each engagement rate ER1, ER2, ER3 . . . ERn is a measure of a rate of participation of use of theadvertisement evaluation tool 132 for the corresponding context C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn. - Each engagement rate can be determined independently of a performance rate of the
advertisement 120, e.g., the engagement rate can be determined independent of an overall click-through rate of theadvertisement 120, or some other measure of performance of the advertisement when the advertisement is presented without theevaluation tool 132. In particular, each engagement rate ER is indicative of a level of user interaction with theadvertisement evaluation tool 132 in a corresponding context C, which, in turn, is an indirect signal of an audience response to theadvertisement 120. - The engagement rate signal, however, can either be a negative signal, e.g., audience dislike, or a positive signal, e.g., audience acceptance. In other words, the engagement rate alone may not necessarily indicate the effectiveness of the
advertisement 120. For example, anevaluation version 122 of anadvertisement 120 may have a particularly high engagement rate ER in a corresponding context C. However, the engagement rate ER may be particularly high in that context C because users in that context C may dislike the advertisement and desire to make their displeasure known to the advertiser. To determine an effectiveness of anadvertisement 120, the engagement rate ER is combined with other data to generate advertisement effectiveness measures. - In some implementations, the engagement rates ER1, ER2, ER3 . . . ERn and the evaluation results QR1, QR2, QR3 . . . QRn can be used to generate the advertisement effectiveness measure for each of the contexts C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn. For example, if the
advertisement evaluation tool 132 is used to evaluate advertisement recognition and brand linkage for the advertisement, then each advertisement effectiveness measure can be based on the advertisement recognition value, the brand linkage value, and the engagement rate ER associated with the context C. In one implementation, the evaluation values of advertisement recognition value, brand linkage value and engagement rates are percentage values, and each advertisement effectiveness measure can be a product of the three values, e.g., -
EMx=AR*BL*ERx - where AR is the percentage of the evaluating audience in all contexts C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn that recognized the advertisement, BL is the percentage of the evaluating audience in all contexts C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn that recognized the brand linkage, and ERx is the engagement rate of a particular context Cx.
- In other implementations, the advertisement recognition values and the brand linkage values can be associated with each context, and each advertisement effectiveness measure can be a product of the three values for each context, e.g.,
-
EMx=ARx*BLx*ERx - where ARx is the percentage of the evaluating audience in a particular context Cx that recognized the advertisement, BLx is the percentage of the evaluating audience in a particular context that recognized the brand linkage, and ERx is the engagement rate of the particular context Cx.
- In some implementations, an additional advertisement likeability value L can also be included. The likeability value L can be determined by qualitative evaluation results, e.g., a Likert scale of ratings of 1-5, with 1 indicative of a low degree of likeability and 5 indicative of a high degree of likeability, and the overall value normalized to 1. For example, the effectiveness measure for a context can be the product of four values, e.g.,
-
EMx=AR*BL*ERx*L - Or, alternatively:
-
EMx=ARx*BLx*ERx*Lx - where Lx is a likeability value for a particular context.
- In other implementations, the effectiveness measure for a context can be determined independent of an engagement rate for the context. For example, an effectiveness measure for a context can be equal to the brand linkage value for that context.
- By way of another example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can determine advertisement effectiveness measures based on the number of evaluation questions answered for each evaluation, and based on other values instead of percentages. For example, theadvertisement evaluation tool 132 may include hierarchal evaluation questions that are presented in response to receiving a response to a first hierarchal evaluation question or a previous hierarchal evaluation question, and the evaluation results can include data indicating a quantity of hierarchal evaluation questions presented, e.g., answered. The engagement rates ER1, ER2, ER3 . . . ERn for the advertisement can be generated by weighing each engagement rate ER according to the quantity of hierarchal evaluation questions presented incorresponding advertisement evaluations 132. For example, an advertisement evaluation may include six hierarchal questions, e.g., questions that are presented conditioned on an answer to a previously presented or first question. Each time anadvertisement evaluation tool 132 is selected, an engagement count can be generated, e.g., a count value of 1. However, if only three of the six hierarchal questions are presented, the count value can be weighted by a factor of 1/2, e.g., 3/6. Likewise, if only two of the six hierarchal questions are presented, the count value can be weighted by a factor of 1/3, i.e., 2/6. Such a weighting can result in an engagement rate that is based on both an actual engagement of theevaluation tool 132 and a degree of engagement, i.e., questioning depth, of theevaluation tool 132. The weighted engagement rates can thus be used to generate the advertisement effectiveness measures as described above. - Thus, in some implementations, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can determine advertisement effectiveness measures based on qualitative data provided in the evaluation results. For example, theadvertisement evaluation tool 132 may include questions that measure an audience's rating of theadvertisement 120, e.g., “Rate this advertisement on a scale of 1-5 (1 being the worst rating, 5 being the best rating).” - Based on such qualitative evaluation results provided from the
advertisement evaluation tool 132, thecontextual evaluation subsystem 130 can generate an advertisement effectiveness measure for a particular context C. For example, a central tendency of the evaluation results can be determined, e.g., an average. An average value of three can be determined to be neutral and result in an effectiveness measure that is proportional to the engagement rate; an average value of less than three can be determined to be negative and result in an effectiveness measure that is a negative multiple of the engagement rate; and an average value greater than three can be determined to be positive and result in an effectiveness measure that is a positive multiple of the engagement rate. Other processes for generating an effectiveness measure based on qualitative data can also be used. - While the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 has been described with respect to anadvertisement 120, the collection and processing of the evaluation data as described above can also be used to facilitate the tuning of an advertisement campaign. For example, thecontextual evaluation subsystem 130 can identify advertisements in an advertisement campaign, and generateevaluation versions 122 of the advertisements, as indicated by the ellipses trailing theadvertisement 120. Eachevaluation version 122 of theadvertisements 120 can be served as described above, and the evaluation results QR1, QR2, QR3 . . . QRn for each context C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn can likewise be processed for eachevaluation version 122. Engagement rates ER1, ER2, ER3. ERn theadvertisement 120 in the advertisement campaign and thecorresponding evaluation versions 122 can be generated in a similar manner as described above. - The engagement rates ER1, ER2, ER3 . . . ERn, evaluation results QR1, QR2, QR3 . . . QRn and the advertisement effectiveness measures can be stored in the
evaluation data store 134. Additionally, the engagement rate and/or the advertisement effectiveness measure for each context C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn can be used to adjust advertisement placement, budgeting, and other advertising and/or campaign related factors to facilitate a more efficient use of the advertiser's resources. For example, a particular image associated with theadvertisement 120 may be adjusted and the adjustment persisted to theadvertisement data store 114. Likewise, an advertising budget, run rate, and/or placement parameters may be adjusted and persisted to thecampaign data store 116. - In some implementations, the
advertisement evaluation tool 132 can include computer instructions that generate an in situ evaluation. For example, theadvertisement evaluation tool 132, upon execution by a user device 108, can generate the in situ evaluation substantially within the display region that would be normally occupied by theadvertisement 120, i.e., the display region occupied by theevaluation version 122. The in situ evaluation is an evaluation having an evaluation environment substantially within the display area of theevaluation version 122 of the advertisement, i.e., engagement of the evaluation tool does not redirect a web browser to a separate evaluation landing page or open a new browser window directed to the evaluation landing page. - An example in situ evaluation is shown in
FIGS. 2A-2C .FIGS. 2A-2C illustratesscreen shots online advertisement 220 presented in a context.FIG. 2A illustrates a displayedadvertisement 220 being presented in a presentation context, e.g., either as an advertisement listed in response to a search query, or as an advertisement selected and displayed based on the content of an underlying web page, or based on some other context. Theadvertisement 220 can be displayed or otherwise presented on a computer device, such as a user device 108, in response to execution of the instructions included in theadvertisement document 120. - The
advertisement 220 includes alogo 240, and abranding 242 that includes a Brand name, “Brand X,” a product name, “Whippet,” a slogan, “Your Best Friend,” and an image of the product. -
FIG. 2B illustrates a screen shot 202 depicting a displayedevaluation version 222 of theadvertisement 220. Theevaluation version 220 can be displayed on a computer device, such as a user device 108, in response to execution of the instructions in theevaluation version 122 of theadvertisement 120 and theadvertisement evaluation tool 132 included in theevaluation version 122. - A first in
situ evaluation environment 230 presents questions related to advertisement recognition and likeability. A user selection of “No” indicates a lack of advertisement recognition; conversely, a selection of one or “Yes—Like it” or “Yes—Dislike it” indicates both advertisement recognition and a corresponding likeability factor. - Other questions to measure likeability can also be used. For example, the questions can be directed to rating the advertisement, e.g., on a scale of 1-5, ratings of 1-5, with 1 indicative of a low degree of likeability and 5 indicative of a high degree of likeability; or presenting a broader range of “yes” responses, such as “Yes, and I love it!,” “Yes, and it's okay.” and “Yes, and I can't stand it!”
-
FIG. 2C illustrates a screen shot 204 depicting the displayedevaluation version 222 of theadvertisement 220. A second insitu evaluation environment 232 presents a second hierarchal question in response to a user selection of one of the “Yes—Like it” or “Yes—Dislike it” options presented inFIG. 2B . The question presented in theenvironment 232 is related to brand linkage, and includes a text field in which a user may enter a product description. In some implementations, the second insitu display environment 232 is generated in response to engagement of the first insitu display environment 230. - Although only two questions are shown in
FIGS. 2B and 2C , additional questions could also be presented during the evaluation. Additionally, while the evaluation shown inFIGS. 2B and 2C are in situ evaluations, other evaluation types could also be used, e.g., selection of theevaluation 230 can redirect a web browser to a separate evaluation landing page or open a new browser window directed to the evaluation landing page. -
FIG. 3 is a screen shot 300 of an example advertisement context defined by the audio and/or visual features of theevaluation advertisement 322. For example, the advertisement context can be defined by presentation features of theevaluation advertisement 322 that includes a visual presentation feature or an audio presentation feature. For example, adifferent logo 340 can be used in the evaluation advertisement, and anaudio feature 342, e.g., a barking sound, can also be included to evaluate the effectiveness of such features. Accordingly, the engagement rate of each presentation context, e.g., different audio and/or visual features, can be measured. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of anauction subsystem 400 that uses advertisement effectiveness measurements EM1, EM2 . . . EMn in a bidding process. Theauction subsystem 400 can be included in theadvertisement management system 104 ofFIG. 1 . - In one implementation, the
auction subsystem 400 processes advertiser bids for an amount the advertisers are willing to pay for each click of an advertisement, e.g., a cost-per-click amount an advertiser pays when, for example, a user clicks on an advertisement. The auction subsystem can take into account a number of performance parameters of anadvertisement 120 stored in theadvertisement data store 114, such as the click through rate (CTR), a cost per number of actions (CPM), a maximum cost per click (MCPC), a minimum cost per click (mCPC) and a quality factor (Q). Additional or fewer performance factors stored in theadvertisement data store 114 can be used by the auction subsystem. - Additionally, campaign data stored in a
campaign data store 116 can also be used by theauction subsystem 400 when performing an auction. Advertiser budgets, placements, and run rates can also be considered to ensure that an auction is conducted in a manner that is consistent with campaign strategies. - Finally, the engagement rates ER, effectiveness measures EM, and the contexts C of the advertisements that are submitted for auction can also be used when performing the auction. Together the performance parameters of an
advertisement 120, the campaign data, and one or more of the engagement rates ER and effectiveness measures EM can be used to determine a contextual bid value for a bid. - For example, the
auction subsystem 400 can receive anadvertisement request 402 that includes context data defining a context in which an advertisement is to be displayed, e.g., content of a particular publisher, and/or defining a particular advertisement feature context, e.g., a video advertisement, or an image advertisement. In response to therequest 402, theauction subsystem 400 can determine a corresponding engagement rate ER and a corresponding effectiveness measure EM for each advertisement in the auction and adjust advertiser bidding parameters accordingly. - For example, an advertisement that is determined to be very effective in the context defined by the
advertisement request 402 may have a corresponding minimum cost per click reduced, as the advertisement has been determined to elicit a positive user experience in the context. Conversely, an advertisement that is determined to be very ineffective in the context defined by theadvertisement request 402 may have a corresponding minimum cost per click increase, or may even be precluded from participating in the auction for therequest 402, as the advertisement has been determined to elicit a negative user experience in the context, or likely to be ignored in the context and therefore generate no revenue for the publisher. - In some implementations, an adjusted minimum cost per click (mCPC′) is determined according to the following formula:
-
mCPC′=(1-(EM/S))*mCPC - where EM is an advertisement effectiveness measure, S is a scaling factor, and mCPC is the minimum cost per click for an advertisement. Other auction adjustments based on the engagement rates, context, and effectiveness measures can also be used, e.g., mCPC′=mCPC/EM, or mCPC′=mCPC/EMn (where n can be an adjustable number), or mCPC′=ER*mCPC/log(EM). Such adjustments can be selected based on the ranges of the effectiveness measures and engagement rates.
- In summary, the
auction subsystem 400 can receive auction bids for corresponding advertisements in response to theadvertisement request 402. One or more of the auction bids can be contextual bids. Each contextual bid is based on one or more performance parameters for a corresponding advertisement and an effectiveness measure EM associated with corresponding advertisement and a context specified by therequest 402. -
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an example process 500 for determining advertisement engagement rates. The process 500 can, for example, be implemented in thecontextual evaluation subsystem 130 ofFIG. 1 , or in some other processing system. - An evaluation version of an advertisement that includes an evaluation tool is generated (502). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can generate theevaluation version 122 of theadvertisement 120. - The evaluation version of the advertisement is served for presentation in a plurality of contexts (504). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can receive advertisement requests from publishers, user devices and search engines, and can serve theevaluation version 122 of theadvertisement 120 for every nth impression. - For each serving of the evaluation version of the advertisement, the context in which the evaluation version of the advertisement is presented is determined (506). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can determine the context in which theevaluation version 122 of theadvertisement 120 is presented based on the advertisement request, or based on content associated with the requestor, or by processing other data that is indicative of a context. - Advertisement evaluation results are received and associated with the contexts (508). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can receive evaluation results QR1, QR2, QR3 . . . QRn and associate them with the contexts C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn. - Engagement rates for the evaluation version of the advertisement are generated (510). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can generate the engagement rates ER1, ER2, ER3 . . . ERn for corresponding contexts C1, C2, C3 . . . Cn as described with reference toFIG. 1 above. -
FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of anexample process 600 for generating advertisement effectiveness measurements. Theprocess 600 can, for example, be implemented in thecontextual evaluation subsystem 130 ofFIG. 1 , or in some other processing system. - Each engagement rate is associated with a corresponding context (602). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can associate each engagement rate ER1, ER2, ER3 . . . ERn with a corresponding context C1, C2, C3, . . . Cn. - Measurement values are generated from the evaluation results (604). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can generate measurement values, such as brand linkage (BL) values, advertisement recognition (AR) values, and other values based on the evaluation results. - Engagement rates based on a rate of participation in the evaluation using the evaluation tool for each corresponding context are determined (606). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can determine an engagement rate for each context based on a ratio of the number of times the evaluation tool was used by a user to the number of times theevaluation version 122 of theadvertisement 120 was served. The engagement rate can be further determined based on the number of questions answered in the evaluation, or on other data indicative of a level of user engagement. - Advertisement effectiveness measures for each of the contexts are generated (608). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 generates an effectiveness measure EM for each context that is a product of the engagement rate ER for the context, the brand linkage value, and the advertisement recognition value. - The effectiveness measure EM can also be generated based on other data, such as qualitative data of the evaluation results. For example, the effectiveness measure can be generated based on the likeability of the advertisement, e.g., based on numeric ratings of the advertisement, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest.
-
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of anexample process 700 for adjusting advertisement bid parameters based on advertisement engagement rates and/or advertisement effectiveness measures. Theprocess 700 can, for example, be implemented in theauction subsystem 400 ofFIG. 4 , or in some other processing system. - An advertisement request for a context is received (702). For example, the
auction subsystem 400 can receive anadvertisement request 402 that includes context data defining a context in which an advertisement is to be displayed, e.g., content of a particular publisher, and/or defining a particular advertisement feature context, e.g., a video advertisement or an image advertisement/ - Engagement rates and/or effectiveness measures for the advertisement in the context are identified (704). For example, in response to the
request 402, theauction subsystem 400 can identify a corresponding engagement rate ER and a corresponding effectiveness measure EM for each advertisement in the auction. - One or more bid parameters for the advertisement based on the engagement rate and/or the effectiveness measure are adjusted (706). For example, the
auction subsystem 400 can reduce a minimum cost per click for an advertisement that is determined to be very effective in the context defined by theadvertisement request 402, or can increase a corresponding minimum cost per click for an advertisement that is determined to be very ineffective in the context defined by theadvertisement request 402. - The advertisement is submitted to auction with the adjusted one or more bid parameters (708). For example, the
auction subsystem 400 can conduct the auction and use the adjusted auction parameters to select one or more winning advertisements in response to theadvertisement request 402. -
FIG. 8 is a flow diagram of anexample process 800 for adjusting campaign targeting based on contextual advertisement effectiveness measures. Theprocess 800 can, for example, be implemented in thecontextual evaluation subsystem 130 and theadvertisement management system 104 ofFIG. 1 , or in some other processing system. - Campaign performance in each of a plurality of presentation contexts is evaluated (802). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can serve evaluation versions of advertisements belonging to a campaign and evaluate the performance the advertisements in each of the contexts, such as described with reference toFIGS. 1-3 , 5 and 6 above. - Evaluation values for the campaign for each presentation context are generated (804). For example, the
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 can collect the evaluation results and generate corresponding evaluation values of brand linkage, likeability, and other evaluation values. - Campaign targeting for each presentation context based on the evaluation values for each presentation context is adjusted (806). For example, the
advertisement management system 104 can adjust campaign targeting to increase advertisement serving in contexts having a low brand recognition and decrease serving of advertisements in contexts having high brand recognition if the goal of the campaign is to increase brand recognition. Likewise, theadvertisement management system 104 can adjust campaign targeting to reduce the serving of advertisements for contexts in which the advertisements have a low likeability, and increase the serving of advertisements for contexts in which the advertisements have a high likeability. Other targeting adjustments based on the evaluation values can also be made. - The
contextual evaluation subsystem 130 and theauction subsystem 400 can be realized by instructions that upon execution cause one or more processing devices to carry out the processes and functions described above. Such instructions can, for example, comprise interpreted instructions, such as script instructions, e.g., JavaScript or ECMAScript instructions, or executable code, or other instructions stored in a computer readable medium.
