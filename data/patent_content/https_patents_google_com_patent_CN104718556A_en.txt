Description
the cross reference of related application
This application claims Application U.S. Serial No 13/609 that submit on September 11st, 2012, that be entitled as " DEFININGRELEVANT CONTENT AREA BASED ON CATEGORY DENSITY ", the right of priority of 435, its disclosure is incorporated into this by reference.This instructions relates to information and presents.
Technical field
This instructions relates to information and presents.
Background technology
The Internet provides the access to extensively various resource.Chance for providing other content (such as advertisement) while providing resource is provided to the access of these resources.Such as, when a people performs on-line search, content for the businessman (business) relevant with on-line search can also be provided to user.Because content is for the businessman relevant with the search of people, so this people probably will be interested in this content.
The selection of content and present the level of interest that can affect user.If selected for specific user compared with content, if Stochastic choice content, then user will be very possible not too interested.The on-line search activity of user can provide some opinions relevant with the interest of user.
Summary of the invention
System for limiting the relevant range for merchant entities with the activity relevant with the search inquiry of user and technology are discussed herein.If the search inquiry of user is relevant with specific businessman or businessman's classification, then the content from other businessman in identical businessman classification that also easily may access user of user is interested.The businessman being located adjacent to the intended destination of user or user more easily may access than the businessman be positioned away from user.
Determine that the geographic area of the appropriate size relevant with the search of a people can become a part for content choice process.In some implementations, a people may find that the region of being correlated with depends on the type of searched for businessman.That is, if a people is searching for the very professional businessman providing the commodity being difficult to find, then this people may more in response to the content with large geographical zone association, and more likely be ready to go to farther distance to obtain the commodity being difficult to find.This can think " relevant range " that the entirety relevant to his or her search is large or geographic area by causing user.But if a people is searching for more general thing, then he may only consider the businessman being in close proximity to his current location, thus causes less relevant range.
People will find the position that the size of relevant geographic area can also depend on the search inquiry submitted to user and associates.That is, if user is positioned at densely populated region, and have many contiguous options (such as, in 1 to 5 mile of his position), then he may unlikely be ready to advance beyond 5 mile radius to obtain the commodity closer to his position or service that he can obtain.Compared with driving, the user in the position facilitating pedestrian also may more be ready to proceed on foot, thus causes less relevant range.
A people will find that the shape of relevant geographic area also can depend on the position of user.Such as, if user is positioned at populous and highly developed urban district, then he may be ready to advance in any direction, to attempt new Italian restaurant.But, the user being positioned at rural environment more may be subject to arterial highway and highway the restriction of use.Consequently, the user-dependent geographic area be considered to be positioned at position, rural area may be subject to the impact of the accessibility of region.
Describe in more detail below, can be defined by its region relevant to the general search inquiry of user and for providing the technology of Search Results to user.Generally speaking, the novel aspects of the theme described in the disclosure can be embodied in comprise and use one or more computing equipment to receive the method for the action of searching request from user.Process also comprises the one or more computing equipment of use and determines businessman's classification based on searching request; Use one or more computing equipment, determine the position associated with searching request, wherein this position selects from comprising in the explicit location that searching request comprises, the position associated with the result in response to searching request and the group of interested position that associates with searching request; And use one or more computing equipment, determine businessman's classification density information based on the businessman's classification determined and the position that associates with searching request at least in part.Process also comprises the one or more computing equipment of use, based on the businessman's classification density information determination scope for position; Use one or more computing equipment, at least in part based on the scope determined, businessman's classification and position, determine the local content provided to user; And use one or more computing equipment, provide local content for display to user, wherein except the external of Search Results provides local content to user.
These and other implementation can comprise following characteristics separately alternatively.Such as, businessman's classification can be determined based on the result associated with searching request.In some implementations, determine businessman's classification comprise receive for searching request Search Results and assess Search Results to identify businessman's classification.Searching request can comprise businessman's classification or belong to the concrete businessman of businessman's classification.In some implementations, scope limits user and will think the relevant range relevant to searching request.In some implementations, relevant range is different according to the one or more businessmans classification in businessman's classification or region or region.In some implementations, relevant range depends on the density of population associated with position.
In some implementations, process also comprises the one or more computing equipment of use, and provide businessman's global directory, the feature of each businessman is and businessman's category associations, and wherein determines that businessman's classification comprises use businessman global directory.In some implementations, determine that businessman's classification density information comprises inquiry businessman global directory.
In some implementations, process also comprises the one or more computing equipment of use, according to the map of businessman's classification by global provider family's density.In some implementations, process also comprises the one or more computing equipment of use, the map of precomputation businessman density.In some implementations, scope limits the region from the criterion by being used as chosen content of position.In some implementations, scope limits the Uncircular field comprising the initial point associated with position.
In some implementations, determine that scope comprises the threshold number that mark treats the searching request result returned to user, mark can comprise the scope of the searching request result of threshold number, and the database of inquiry merchant entities with location and businessman classification about, entity in scope.In some implementations, determine that scope also comprises to determine and the businessman classification number about, entity in scope, and when being greater than threshold number with businessman classification about the number of, entity in scope, amendment scope equals threshold number to make the number of merchant entities be narrowed.
In some implementations, the threshold number of searching request result expects the maximum number of the result returned.In some implementations, determine that scope also comprises the minimal amount of identification search request results and scope of revising equals minimal amount to make the number of merchant entities in Query Result expand as.In some implementations, process also comprises the one or more computing equipment of use, carries out auction, and wherein provide content at least in part based on the result of auction based on the Query Result associated with scope.
In some implementation, system described herein and technology can provide one or more advantage.Such as, by using the position associated with particular search query, system described herein and technology can produce the Search Results specific to this position.Search Results can comprise the businessman being positioned at and being defined as with the user-dependent region of submitting search to.Be defined as to change based on ad-hoc location with the size in user-dependent region.Such as, if user is positioned at rural areas, then user may be ready the distance (user compared with in densely populated urban district) of advancing farther more.In addition, position can also affect Search Results, and this depends on search inquiry itself.Such as, if user is searching for very professional article, then user is being ready advance farther (finding the user of very common article compared with hope) possibly.

For the ease of the search of resource 105, environment 100 can comprise search system 112, and search system 112 carrys out identifying resource by the resource captured on website 104 and index content publisher provides.The resource that can correspond to based on data about the data of resource carrys out index.Index and the Resource Replica of high-speed cache alternatively can be stored in the high-speed cache 114 of index.
Subscriber equipment 106 can submit search inquiry 116 by network 102 to search system 112.Responsively, the high-speed cache 114 of search system 112 access index, to identify the resource relevant to search inquiry 116.The resource of search system 112 identification search result 118 form, and Search Results 118 is returned to subscriber equipment 106 in result of page searching.Search Results 118 is generated by search system 112, identification response in particular search query resource and be included in the data of the link of resource.
Except in response to except the Search Results 118 of search inquiry 116, the additional content item that will present be selected and be provided to Content Management System 110 can.In certain embodiments, Content Management System 110 provides one or more content item automatically in response to user search queries 116.Content Management System 110 receives searching request, and determines business types based on searching request.In some implementations, searching request is the user search queries 116 being sent to Content Management System 110 by network 102.Searching request can be sent directly between from subscriber equipment 106 or from search system 112 by network 102.In some implementations, searching request comprises both search inquiry 116 and Search Results 118.In some implementations, search inquiry 116 and Search Results 118 can be sent to Content Management System 110 from search system 112.Then, Content Management System 110 is analyzed searching request based on the business types associated with searching request and is provided content item, as described below.
Based on the searching request received, Content Management System 110 determines the businessman's classification associated with searching request.Such as, the searching request comprising word " Piza " can cause businessman's classification " Piza restaurant " or " Italian restaurant ".In another example, the searching request for " running shoes " can cause businessman's classification " running shop " or " sport footwear ".
Content Management System 110 is configured to the position determining to associate with searching request further.This position directly can be submitted to by user (such as, by submitting his or her city or postcode to) or indirectly distinguish (such as, by obtaining the IP address with user-association, and determining the position with IP address information).Select in the explicit location that position can comprise from searching request, the position associated with the result in response to searching request or the interested position that associates with searching request.
Then, Content Management System 110 determines the businessman's classification density information for businessman's classification of this position, and determines scope (extent) based on the businessman's classification density information for this position.
Content Management System 110 can comprise for the treatment of, classification, select and multiple engines of content distributed item.Request processor 121 receives searching request by network 102 from search system 112.In certain embodiments, request processor 121 directly receives searching request from subscriber equipment 106 by network.Searching request can comprise search inquiry 116 and/or one or more in response in the Search Results 118 of search inquiry 116.In some implementations, can from the one or more derivation searching request search inquiry 116 and Search Results 118.
Classification engine 122 determines the businessman's classification associated with searching request.Such as, if request processor 121 receives the searching request comprising word " Piza ", then classification engine 122 can determine such as the businessman's classification associated with request of " Piza restaurant " or " Italian restaurant " and so on.
Classification engine 122 can also access storage businessman's global directory in the database 123.Businessman's global directory comprises numerous content supplier 108 (such as, enterprise).Content supplier 108 in businessman's global directory can be categorized into businessman's classification by classification engine 122.In some implementations, content supplier 108 with one or more businessmans category associations, so classification engine 122 does not need to carry out any association.Instead, classification engine 122 uses businessman's global directory to determine businessman's classification.Can classify based on market, client, product, service or other factors.
The information relevant with each content supplier in content supplier 108 can be stored in database 123 that is in Content Management System 110 or that associate with Content Management System 110.In some implementations, content supplier 108 has been classified into businessman's classification, and businessman's classification is saved and otherwise indicates in the database 123 or in the database 123.In some instances, particular content provider 108 can with more than businessman's category associations.When content supplier and more than businessman's category associations, classification subset can be selected based on other in such as inquiry request.The information in the database 123 of storage can comprise the geographic position of the title of content supplier 108, the one or more businessmans classification associated with content supplier 108 and content supplier 108.
Location engine 124 is provided for the position determining to associate with searching request.In some implementations, user can submit his or her position on one's own initiative together with search inquiry 116, the searching request that so this position and Content Management System 110 receive associates (such as, by providing position data or provide position data in searching request (such as " pizzeria of South Bend ")).In some implementations, location engine 124 can by determining that position is determined in the IP address associated with searching request.Based on determined IP address, location engine 124 is determined and the position of asking to associate.In some implementations, location engine can point out user, the subscriber equipment submitting search inquiry 116 to or search system 112 to input the position of user.Position can be and the postcode of user-association, city or gps coordinate.
As described above, position can be the position of explicit statement in searching request (such as, " the international shop of Art Brown of Manhattan ").Alternatively, position can associate with the result in response to searching request.Such as, if searching request comprises word " the international shop of Art Brown ", then the result in response to this searching request can indicate the international shop of Art Brown to be positioned at center, Manhattan city (Midtown).Position can also be determined by the interested position associated with searching request.Such as, the searching request comprising word " Epcot " can associate with Ward Disney World holiday resort.Location engine 124 can determine that Ward Disney World holiday resort (WaltDisney World Resort) is positioned at Orlando, Florida State, and determines the position of Orlando, Florida State thus.
Content Management System 110 also comprises the density calculator engine 125 for determining the businessman's classification density information for position.Businessman's classification density information needs great geographic area with the content supplier of the significant result or specific merchant classification that produce certain number for determining.How many businessmans in classification density instruction businessman of businessman classification are positioned at specific geographical area.The businessman being positioned at this specific geographical area is more, and businessman's density is higher.
In some implementations, density calculator engine 125 can store by inquiry businessman's classification density that businessman's global directory in the database 123 determines for position.By inquiry businessman global directory, density calculator engine 125 can identify all businessmans in specific merchant classification, and determines the position of each businessman in businessman.
In some instances, businessman's classification Density dependence is in the density of population associated with position.Such as, if businessman's classification is " Piza restaurant ", then the such as densely-populated position at center, Manhattan city and so on will have the businessman's classification density far above Montana State Browning (Browning, Montana).That is, at center, Manhattan city, little geographic location may produce many Piza restaurants, and the much bigger geographic area that will need around the position of Montana State Browning, to produce the Piza restaurant of identical number.
Other factors can affect businessman's classification density of ad-hoc location.Such as, the characteristic of position can affect businessman's classification density of businessman's classification.That is, compared with pendant (Tempe, Arizon) smooth in Arizona State, may be higher for businessman's classification density in " surfing shop " in Honolulu, Hawaii (Honolulu, Hawaii).
In some implementations, density calculator engine 125 can determine that the businessman's number in area of geographic relevance is too low, and if relevant range is expanded further, it may comprise user can think the businessman of advancing too far away.In this case, classification engine 122 can provide businessman's classification widely, so that comprise the businessman that more possibility is relevant.Such as, if searching request comprises word " Piza " and classification engine 122 selects businessman's classification " Piza restaurant " at first, then businessman's classification can be changed into such as the classification of businessman widely of " Italian restaurant " and so on by classification engine 122, to produce the associated merchant of more big figure.
Similarly, if density calculator engine 125 determines that the businessman's number in area of geographic relevance is too high, classification engine 122 can provide narrower businessman's classification, so that only comprise the businessman directly relevant with searching request.Such as, if searching request comprises word " exquisite Italian restaurant " and classification engine 122 selects businessman's classification " Italian restaurant " at first, then businessman's classification can be changed into such as narrower businessman's classification of " Italian restaurant---exquisite food and drink " and so on by classification engine 122, to produce the businessman of the more closely-related more peanut with initial search request.
In some implementations, density calculator engine 125 generates the map of businessman's classification density of the content supplier 108 illustrated in one or more region.Map can be provided to other parts in subscriber equipment 106 or system 100.In some implementations, density calculator engine 125 can generate the map of businessman's density by the whole world according to businessman's classification.
Fig. 2 A illustrates the illustratively Figure 200 in the region around the special park (Bryant Park) of the intown Brian in Manhattan.The ad-hoc location associated with searching request is indicated by arrow 202.In some implementations, density calculator engine 125 uses the map of mark 204a, 204b, 204c, the 204d of the geographical location had in each content supplier 108.Content supplier 108 can be restricted to those content suppliers in the classification only associated with searching request (such as, Piza restaurant) by density calculator engine 125.Density calculator engine 125 can focus on further with the particular location 202 of asking to associate (such as, center, Manhattan city or Montana State Browning), and the map in the region around particular location 202 is provided together with the position by the surrounding content provider 108 marked in businessman's classification that 204a, 204b, 204c, 204d indicate.Mark 204a, 204b, 204c, 204d in specific region (and thus, the content supplier 108 of businessman's classification) more, businessman's classification density is higher.Similarly, mark fewer, businessman's classification density is lower.
In some implementations, density calculator engine 125 does not use map, but replace the content supplier determined in businessman's classification be positioned at (or being associated with) position or around position region (that is, the gps coordinate of the contiguous content supplier of businessman's classification) where.Contiguous content supplier has to be selected with the content supplier of the content be included together with Search Results, and wherein content supplier or its sponsor have and exist or cum rights in position or close to the physics of position.
Based on the businessman's density information for ad-hoc location, then " scope " for searching request determined by density calculator engine 125.As used in this article, term " scope " comprises its its ordinary meaning, includes but not limited to from being used as the region of selecting to treat the position of the criterion of the content provided to user, the threshold number etc. of content item will comprised at Search Results.In some implementations, determine scope comprise mark treat the content item returned to user threshold number, mark may by comprise the content item of threshold number scope and inquiry merchant entities database supply (such as, activity description) to locate the merchant entities relevant with the classification in scope.
In some implementations, the initial qualified content item that scope comprises assessment further and identifies is determined.If the total number of the initial qualified content item of businessman exceedes threshold number, amendment scope is equal to or less than threshold number to make merchant entities number be narrowed.Threshold number can be expect the maximum number of the content item (that is, associating with merchant entities) returned.In some implementations, determine that scope comprises mark minimal amount further, and scope of revising is equal to or greater than minimal amount to make merchant entities number expand as.In some implementations, then auction is carried out based on the result merchant entities associated with scope.Then Content Management System 110 provides content based on auction result to user at least in part.
In some implementations, scope is the geographic range limited by the radius extended from the position 202 associated with searching request, thus limits the border circular areas 206 around position 202, as such as illustrated in fig. 2.Radius can be selected to make to set the content supplier of number and to be positioned at the circular geographic area that (or being associated with) limited by radius.By the geographic range determined limit and be considered to be referred to herein as the area of geographic relevance 206 for businessman's classification or relevant range with user-dependent geographic area.Area of geographic relevance 206 can according to different from businessman's classification that searching request associates or ad-hoc location.The latter is illustrated by comparison diagram 2A and Fig. 2 B.
Such as in the example map of Fig. 2 B, area of geographic relevance 206 is not limited to border circular areas.That is, scope needs not be the uniform radius equidistantly extended from center.In some implementations, first the big map of businessman's classification density that specific merchant classification is shown is provided.Then map is amplified to the ad-hoc location associated with searching request, until only have the content supplier of certain number to be positioned at the map of amplification.Can with non-geometric non-uniform manner convergent-divergent map.Such as, not amplify according to the distance to ad-hoc location, enlarged map can be carried out according to the journey time of estimation.Generation is had the map of irregular (that is, non-circular or rectangle) shape by such Zoom method, this shape as by can use the existence in road/path and traffic determine.
Alternatively, method can start from the big map of businessman's classification density that specific merchant classification is shown, and only gives prominence to the accurate location associated with searching request.Then outstanding region is outwards expanded from this position, to be included in the entity near this position.The expansion in outstanding region or reduce and can evenly occur, thus cause representing the outstanding circle as the area of geographic relevance 206 in Fig. 2 A.In some instances, to expand or outwards convergent-divergent is heterogeneous, but replace and make the region comprising arterial highway and highway expand farther and be included in outstanding region, and undeveloped or inapproachable region is not included in outstanding region.Non-homogeneous expansion like this can cause as the erose area of geographic relevance 216 in Fig. 2 B.
In some implementations, density calculator engine 125 can be provided for the upper threshold value and the lower threshold value that limit geographic range.That is, too large scope may produce the businessman of locating too far away, thus user goes to this merchant location by being unlikely ready.Therefore, such as, the scope of the geographic restrictions of such as 10 miles and so on can be limited, density calculator engine 125 only be comprised be positioned at the businessman/content sponsor of 10 miles of (or being associated with) ad-hoc location.Similarly, result may be nonsensical---to have very little geographic range---if scope limits too narrow.Need the sponsor of minimal amount to run the significant auction for such as advertisement.Therefore, such as, the sponsor (such as, 5 to 6 content suppliers) of threshold number may be needed according to the geographic area of geographic range restriction.
With reference to Fig. 2 A, provide the ground Figure 200 of the area of geographic relevance 206 for Piza restaurant illustrated around the ad-hoc location 202 of the special park (Bryant Park) of Brian.As shown in Figure 200, numerous merchant entities is positioned at ten block radius of position 202.Density calculator engine can have the lower threshold value of 11 entities.Based on this threshold value and very high businessman's classification density (as illustrated by numerous mark 204a, 204b, 204c, 204b) of 11 entities, determine the geographic range of area of geographic relevance 206.As shown in Figure 2 A, for the area of geographic relevance 206 of the position 202 relevant with " Piza restaurant " be the circle limited by the radius of about half around position 202 mile.
As discussed above, area of geographic relevance can be any shape; It is not limited to circle or rectangular shape.Irregular shape should be understood to be non-circular shape or not be rectangular shape.In the region that population is less, erose area of geographic relevance may be more meaningful, because erose region can be sketched the contours of walking better or be driven more to hold accessible region.
With reference to Fig. 2 B, map 210 illustrates the area of geographic relevance 216 for Piza restaurant around the ad-hoc location 212 of underpopulated Montana State Browning (Browning, Montana).Compared to the round-shaped area of geographic relevance 206 (shown in Fig. 2 A) of Manhattan, the area of geographic relevance 216 in Fig. 2 B is erose.The shape of the area of geographic relevance 216 in Fig. 2 B reflects the low density of population of Montana State Browning and the low businessman classification density in Piza restaurant.In example in fig. 2b, density calculator engine 125 determines geographic range based on the businessman's classification density information for Piza restaurant around the Browning of Montana State.Because regional population around position 212 is rare, wherein little Piza restaurant immediate vicinity 212, the span of relevant geographic area 216 to exceed to the east of ad-hoc location 212 and to the west of 20 miles.
Note, relevant geographic area 216 also extends along highway, instead of extends from ad-hoc location 212 equably.By limited range in this way, density calculator engine 125 provides the user being positioned at position 212 area of geographic relevance 216 more may being ready to go to, and drives to hold accessible arterial highway and highway because area of geographic relevance 216 is sketched the contours of.By contrast, if density calculator engine 125 provides the round-shaped area of geographic relevance in the example of Manhattan as shown in Figure 2 A, area of geographic relevance may comprise many geographic position that user unlikely goes to, such as undeveloped or inapproachable position (such as, cross a river, wherein nearest bridge 40 mile, but wherein " by air line distance " businessman is actually relatively near).Thus, for denser population's and drive and the easier geographic position close to (that is, there is the road/path of laying) of walking, round-shaped area of geographic relevance may be more meaningful.The relatively little round-shaped area of geographic relevance 206 of Fig. 2 A reflects the high businessman classification density of Manhattan and both Walkabilities of position 202.
Content Management System 110 comprises publish engine 126 further.Publish engine 126 receives businessman's classification density information for ad-hoc location and businessman's classification and scope from density calculator engine 125, and selects and the one or more content items being arranged in (or being associated with) one or more businessman/content suppliers for the businessman/content supplier of the area of geographic relevance of specific merchant classification and associating.In some implementations, Content Management System 110 carries out auction based on the qualified content item with the entity associated being positioned at (or being associated with) area of geographic relevance.In those examples, the content item issued by publish engine is at least in part based on the result of auction.Then publish engine 126 issues one or more content item.One or more content item can be published together with the Search Results 118 from search system 112 of the search inquiry 116 in response to user.

At 304 places, determine businessman's classification based on searching request.Such as, the classification engine 112 in Content Management System 110 can analyze searching request to select business types.Such as, if searching request comprises word " the international shop of Art Brown ", then classification engine 112 is examined searching request and is determined that businessman's classification is " stationer's ".This example illustrates, even if searching request points to certain shops (the international shop of Art Brown), still determines more broadly businessman's classification.
At 306 places, determine the position associated with searching request.This position can be determined by the location engine 124 in Content Management System 110.In some instances, this position is selected from comprising in the explicit location that searching request comprises, the position associated with the result in response to searching request or the group of interested position that associates with searching request.Such as, searching request can comprise word " Art Brown international Bi Dian city " center ".From this searching request, position can be defined as the center, Manhattan city of New York by location engine 124.In another example, searching request only comprises word " the international shop of Art Brown ".But location engine 124 can be determined, the international shop of result instruction Art Brown in response to searching request is positioned at center, Manhattan city.
At 308 places, the location engine 124 by such as 306 determines the businessman's classification density information for position.In some implementations, by generate as discussed above all and illustratively Figure 200 respectively shown in Fig. 2 A and Fig. 2 B, 210 and so on map determine businessman's classification density information.
In some implementations, by using businessman's global directory to determine businessman's classification density information.Businessman's global directory comprises the businessman that it is characterized by with one or more businessmans category associations.Businessman's global directory comprises the position for each businessman in the businessman in global directory further.By using position and businessman's classification of each businessman in businessman's global directory, density calculator engine 125 can determine the businessman's classification density information for position.
At 310 places, based on the classification density information determination scope for position.Such as, density calculator engine 125 uses the map of 308 places generation to determine geographic range.Density calculator 125 can use one or more threshold value further.Such as, can lower threshold value be defined, make the content supplier comprising certain number.Businessman's classification density is lower, may need larger area of geographic relevance to comprise the content supplier as the minimal amount determined by lower threshold value.Similarly, can also upper threshold value be set.Upper threshold value can be set based on the number of the content supplier comprised in area of geographic relevance.In some implementations, upper threshold value can be set based on geographic distance.That is, upper threshold value can limit certain geographic distance that user may be ready to advance.Any distance far away than this geographic distance will be regarded as user advances too far, so to associate with than upper threshold value geographic distance or content supplier that contrast locating upper threshold value geographic distance is far away will not be included in area of geographic relevance.
Upper threshold value geographic distance in illustratively Figure 200 in Fig. 2 A may be less than the upper threshold value geographic distance in the example map 210 in Fig. 2 B.This is because for Piza, the people of Montana State Browning more may be ready than being positioned at the intown people in Manhattan farther distance of advancing.Upper threshold value and lower threshold value can be decided by the ad-hoc location associated with searching request.Upper threshold value and lower threshold value can also be decided by the businessman's classification determined.
Such as, the lower threshold value in the intown illustratively Figure 200 in the Manhattan in Fig. 2 A can be 10, thus needs area of geographic relevance 206 to comprise at least 10 content suppliers relevant with searching request " Piza restaurant ".But the lower threshold value in the example map 210 of the Montana State Browning shown in Fig. 2 B can be only 5, thus area of geographic relevance 216 is needed to comprise at least 5 content suppliers.The lower threshold value of Montana State Browning reflects the fact that less businessman and content supplier are positioned at Montana State Browning.
At 312 places, at least in part based on scope and except searching request result, provide content in response to request to user.
