- This specification generally relates to ranking users, and/or particular items of digital content distributed by users in social networking services.
- Internet-based social networking services provide a digital medium for users to interact with one another and to share information.
- users are able to distribute digital content (e.g., posts including textual comments, digital images, digital videos, digital audio, hyperlinks to network-accessible documents, etc.) to other users that they might be connected to within the social networking service.
- Digital content that is distributed to a user can be displayed to the user automatically in a content stream in a home (or “stream”) page, and/or in response to a user query in a search results page.
- aspects of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of: receiving, from computer-readable memory, a particular item of digital content distributed by a user through a computer-implemented social networking service; identifying, using the one or more processors, a set of items of digital content distributed by the user through the computer-implemented social networking service; receiving interaction data from the computer-readable memory; determining, based on the received interaction data, at least one of a user ranking score associated with the user and an item ranking score associated with the particular item of digital content; and storing the at least one of the user ranking score and the item ranking score in the computer-readable memory.
- the items of digital content in the set of items of digital content being distinct from the particular item of digital content.
- the interaction data representing interactions of one or more recipients with the items of digital content in the set of items of digital content.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- the interactions represented by the interaction data can include one or more of: sharing an item of digital content, commenting on an item of digital content and endorsing an item of digital content.
- the set of items of digital content can include a set of all items of digital content distributed by the user prior to distribution of the particular item of digital content.
- Determining the user ranking score can include the actions of: determining a recipient-specific user ranking score for each recipient of a set of recipients that have received at least one item of digital content of the set of items of digital content to provide a plurality of recipient-specific user ranking scores; and aggregating the plurality of recipient-specific user ranking scores to determine the user ranking score.
- Determining a recipient-specific user ranking score can include calculating, using the received interaction data, a probability that a specific recipient of the set of recipients will interact with an item of digital content distributed by the user.
- the set of recipients can include all direct contacts of the user within the social networking service.
- Determining the item ranking score can include the actions of: determining a recipient-specific item ranking score for each recipient of a set of recipients that have received the particular digital content item to provide a plurality of recipient-specific item ranking scores; aggregating the plurality of recipient-specific item ranking scores to determine an initial item ranking score; determining a time decay parameter associated with the particular digital content item; and degrading the initial item ranking score based on the time decay parameter to provide the item ranking score.
- Determining a recipient-specific item ranking score can include calculating, using the received interaction data, a probability that a specific recipient of the set of recipients will interact with the particular digital content item.
- the methods can further include the actions of: receiving a search query; receiving search results responsive to the search query; determining that the search results include a set of users of a social networking service, and, in response, retrieving a plurality of user ranking scores; determining, based on the plurality of user ranking scores, a user rank order; and providing instructions to display representations of the users based on the user rank order.
- each user ranking score is assigned to a respective user in the set of users. Retrieving a plurality of user ranking scores can include accessing a user index stored in computer-readable memory.
- the methods can further include the actions of: receiving a search query; receiving search results responsive to the search query; determining that the search results include a plurality of items of digital content distributed through the social networking service, and, in response, retrieving a plurality of item ranking scores; determining, based on the plurality of item ranking scores, an item rank order; and providing instructions to display representations of the digital content items based on the item rank order.
- Retrieving the plurality of item ranking scores can include accessing item data sets stored in computer readable memory.
- users of social networking services can be categorized and/or ranked based on their activity, and highly interactive users can be provided as recommended contacts to new users of social networking services.
- potentially viral digital content can be discovered before going viral, and digital content can be prioritized and stored to reduce latency.

- Each social graph can include edges to additional individuals or entities at higher degrees of separation from the user. These contacts can in turn have additional contacts at another degree of separation from the user.
- a user's connection to someone in a particular social network can be used to identify additional connections based on that person's connections.
- the distinct social graphs can include edges connecting one or more social graph to one or more other social graphs.
- Types of connections and social graphs can include, but are not limited to other users in which the user is in direct contact (e.g., user mail or chat contact, direct contacts on social sites) and users in which the user is in indirect contact (e.g., friends of friends, connections of users that have a direct connection to the user).
- the social graph includes content generated by individuals (e.g., blog posts, reviews) as connections to the user.
- the social graph can include connections within a single network or across multiple networks (separable or integrated).
- Public social graph relationships can also be considered. In some examples, public relationships can be established through public profiles and/or public social networking services.

- an item rank order for a plurality of items can be determined based on respective item ranking scores, and the items can be displayed based on the item rank order.
- a user ranking score is determined based on a plurality of recipient-specific user ranking scores (RS REC ).
- a recipient-specific user ranking score can indicate the probability that a recipient will interact with an item distributed by a user.

- T indicates the number of items distributed by the user and received by the recipient
- ⁇ and ⁇ are constants.
- ⁇ and ⁇ determined by empirical analysis of interactions.
- ⁇ and ⁇ are constants between 0.5 and 1 and can be chosen such that the ratio of ⁇ to ⁇ is equal to the ratio of Q to T.
- ⁇ and ⁇ can be determined based on aggregated data over the social networking service or a sub-part of the social networking service that the users interact with, and can provide an estimate of the interaction rate between the users in the absence of specific data reflecting an actual interaction rate.
- the set of 1 to n recipients includes all direct contacts of the user within the social networking service. In some examples, the set of 1 to n recipients includes all direct contacts and contacts of direct contacts of the user within the social networking service.
- Q and T are provided based on accumulated historical data that is associated with a total number of items distributed by the user to recipients over a given time period (e.g., X number of seconds, hours, days, weeks, months or years, where X is an integer greater than 0).
- the accumulated data includes a total number of interactions (e.g., endorsements, shares and/or comments) by the recipient with items distributed by the user over the given time period.
- the recipient-specific user ranking scores can be provided as quantifiable probability ratios that reflect the relative frequency with which a particular recipient interacts with items distributed by a particular user.
- the recipient-specific user ranking scores can range between a minimum value (e.g., 0) and a maximum value (e.g., 1).
- a relatively high recipient-specific user ranking scores (e.g., above 0.5) can indicate that the recipient user is interested in content items distributed by the author.
- the user ranking score associated with the user can be determined based on the following relationship:
- the user ranking score can change over time.
- a recipient-specific user ranking score can change in response to the associated recipient actually interacting with an item distributed by the user. Consequently, Q can increase over time (e.g., can converge toward T), thereby changing the user ranking score.
- a recipient-specific user ranking score can change in response to the user distributing more items. Consequently, T can increase over time, thereby changing the user ranking score.
- the user ranking scores each represent the respective probability that other users (e.g., recipients) connected to the user in the social networking service might interact with items distributed by the user.
- each user ranking score reflects a total number of probable interactions by contacts of the user with items distributed by the user through the social networking service sometime in the future.
- a user with relatively high user ranking score can include a user that has a relatively high number of contacts that interact with content distributed by the user.
- the user ranking scores for a plurality of users of the social networking service can be stored in a user index (e.g., in computer-readable memory). In this manner, the user ranking scores of particular users can be retrieved for use.

- the initial item ranking score can be determined based on a plurality of recipient-specific item ranking scores (RS IREC ).
- a recipient-specific item ranking score can indicate the probability that a recipient interacts with the item distributed by the user.
- each recipient-specific item ranking score is provided based on the following relationship:
- RS IRECi G ⁇ + ⁇ F ⁇ + ⁇
- i indicates the i'th recipient in a set of 1 to m recipients that have received the item of digital content from the user
- G indicates the number of interactions of the i'th recipient with items received from the user
- F indicates the number of items distributed by the user and received by the recipient
- ⁇ and ⁇ are constants, as discussed above.
- the set of 1 to m recipients includes all direct contacts of the user within the social networking service that the user has distributed the item to (i.e., all contacts included on a user-defined ACL associated with the item).
- the set of 1 to m recipients includes all direct contacts that the user has distributed the item to and contacts of the direct contacts within the social networking service.
- G and F are provided based on accumulated data that is associated with a total number of items distributed by the user to recipients over a given time period (e.g., X number of seconds, hours, days, weeks, months or years, where X is an integer greater than 0).
- the initial item ranking score associated with the item can be determined based on the following relationship:
- a first item ranking score for an item can be determined based on a first time and a second item ranking score for the item can be determined based on a second time, where the second time is later than the first time. Accordingly, the first item score can be greater than the second item score as a result of application of the time decay.
- An item of content with a relatively high item ranking score associated therewith can generally be considered as being of potentially more interest to users than items with lower item ranking scores. In this manner, the item ranking score for a particular item can decrease over time.
- the item ranking score can change over time based on user interactions.
- a recipient-specific item ranking score can change in response to the associated recipient actually interacting with the item. For example, when a particular recipient interacts with the item, the associated recipient-specific item ranking score can be set to a maximum value (e.g., 1), thereby changing the item ranking score.
- a recipient-specific item ranking score can change in response to the associated recipient interacting with other items distributed by the user. Consequently, G can increase over time (e.g., can converge toward F), thereby changing the item ranking score.
- a recipient-specific item ranking score can change in response to the user distributing more items. Consequently, F can increase over time, thereby changing the item ranking score.
- the item ranking scores for a plurality of items distributed using the social networking service can be stored in an item index (e.g., in computer-readable memory).
- respective item ranking scores can be stored in respective item data sets, discussed above. In this manner, the item ranking scores of particular items can be retrieved for use.

Abstract
Description
where i indicates the i'th recipient in a set of 1 to n recipients that have received items of digital content from the user, Q indicates the number of interactions of the i'th recipient with items received from the user, T indicates the number of items distributed by the user and received by the recipient, and α and β are constants. In some examples, α and β determined by empirical analysis of interactions. In some examples, α and β are constants between 0.5 and 1 and can be chosen such that the ratio of α to β is equal to the ratio of Q to T. In some examples, α and β can be determined based on aggregated data over the social networking service or a sub-part of the social networking service that the users interact with, and can provide an estimate of the interaction rate between the users in the absence of specific data reflecting an actual interaction rate.
where i indicates the i'th recipient in a set of 1 to m recipients that have received the item of digital content from the user, G indicates the number of interactions of the i'th recipient with items received from the user, F indicates the number of items distributed by the user and received by the recipient, and α and β are constants, as discussed above. In some examples, the set of 1 to m recipients includes all direct contacts of the user within the social networking service that the user has distributed the item to (i.e., all contacts included on a user-defined ACL associated with the item). In some examples, the set of 1 to m recipients includes all direct contacts that the user has distributed the item to and contacts of the direct contacts within the social networking service. In some examples, G and F are provided based on accumulated data that is associated with a total number of items distributed by the user to recipients over a given time period (e.g., X number of seconds, hours, days, weeks, months or years, where X is an integer greater than 0).
RS ITEMt=(RS IINIT)(ω)
where t indicates a time since the item was distributed by the user. In some examples, t can be determined as the difference between a current time and the time that the item was distributed. In some examples, the current time can include the time at which the item ranking score is being determined. In some examples, the time decay can be provided based on the following relationship:
