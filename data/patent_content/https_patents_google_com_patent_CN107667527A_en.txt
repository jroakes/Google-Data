There is provided herein the method that can improve the depth sense in the environment with wide illumination range, optical sensor and
Robot system.Can be in the various differences of the illumination level with change equipped with the robot system of computer vision system
Operated in environment.Some environment (the good indoor environment of outdoor environment and lighting condition during such as daytime) may be very
It is adapted for use with stereo-picture processing and carries out depth sense.When the object in environment is illuminated brightly in a dark room, sense from these things
The imager for the light that body reflects can capture the feature of these objects considerable details (for example, shape, color, profile,
Edge etc.).However, in other environment (such as with dim artificially lighting indoor environment and night-environment), Ke Yicong
Object emission goes out less light so that is relatively difficult to the feature for distinguishing these objects.In addition, the because depth perception based on stereo-picture
Survey depends primarily on identification from the common trait between two images of different viewing angles, it is possible that being difficult to determination has
The thing of seldom detectable feature (such as without those detectable features of many color changes, edge, profile or other products)
The depth of body (for example, flat surfaces of big solid color).
Compared with dim environment and/or there is an environment of the object with seldom detectable feature, the method energy of structured light
Enough images for being projected to by the light that will be patterned into scene and capturing the scene with projection pattern improves depth sense.Throw
Manual features are irradiated on object and surface by shadow pattern, and these objects or surface may be come for accurate depth sense originally
Saying has excessively few feature or excessively dim light.Thus, there is projection by the way that structured light processing is used in into capture
The image of the environment of pattern, it is possible to achieve for the standard on the surface in originally excessively dark or environment with excessively few feature
True depth sense.In some embodiments, projection pattern can be the light for having the wavelength in distinctive infra-red bands.Although this
The technology of kind structured light is probably useful in darker and some indoor environments, but projection pattern may be by different
Light source (such as daylight) waters down or suppressed.
In operation, robot system can be transformed into the bright conversion between dark surrounds and/or from interior
Outdoor environment.In some cases, robot system is likely encountered the environment of the combination with light and darkness part.Example

Infrared light image is generated with infrared sensing photoelectric detector.As a result, such optical sensor can be captured in light
Two different-wavebands in image.
The single optical sensor that both visible images and infrared light image can be captured can be only compared to each
On the spot capture for two single optical sensors of visible images or infrared light image more added with resource efficiency.Work as space
When resource-constrained, such as in small machine people's system, it may be desirable to reduce the quantity of optical sensor.In addition, single optics passes
Sensor can need less energy to operate and can increase machine by reducing the quantity for the sensor for being prone to failure
The reliability of device people's system.
In addition to above-mentioned benefit, make what both visible light sensing photoelectric detector and infrared sensing photoelectric detector mixed
Single optical sensor reduces the influence of systematic error, and the systematic error is if two single optical sensors are used
Occur.Furthermore it is possible to using some interspersed arrangements of visible light sensing photoelectric detector and infrared sensing photoelectric detector come
Avoid or further reduce the influence of systematic error.Thus, using single optical sensor avoid to perform generally with use
The needs of the associated error-prone collimation technique of two different optical sensors.

Image in person.The imaging system can also include texture projecting apparatus, and the texture projecting apparatus is by the figure of known structured light
Case is projected in specific IR light belts environmentally.Although this IR image is by Projection Character to the surface for improving depth determination
(particularly in being likely difficult to distinguish the low light environment of feature of object in the visible spectrum), but projection pattern may be by
Strong infrared light from other sources (such as artificial light and/or daylight) overcomes or watered down.As a result, some features are (all
Part such as color distortion, the edge of object and/or projection pattern may be only in visible light wave range or specific IR optical bands
It can be perceived.
In one example, computing device can be based on the correspondence between a pair of the visible images captured by imaging system
Feature determines the depth information of environment.By way of example, the computing device can be determined in two visible images
The mapping of respective pixel value, and can be surveyed based on the physical relation between two optical sensors, computing device using triangle
Amount determines depth information.In the environment with wide illumination range, the depth information based on visible ray can provide the photograph of environment

Fig. 4 is the concept map of the function of exemplary optical sensors 402.It is (all that optical sensor 402 includes photoelectric detector
Such as photoelectric detector 404) array.Some photoelectric detectors in array are configured as exposed to wavelength in visible spectrum
Electric charge is generated during incident beam in (for example, 380nm to 750nm).Other photoelectric detectors in array are configured to when exposure
Electric charge is generated when incident beam of the wavelength in infrared spectrum (for example, 750nm to 3000nm).In certain embodiments, it is red
External sensed photoelectric detector is configured as capturing the infrared light (for example, 825nm to 875nm) of arrowband.In the implementation of structured light
In example, light that infrared texture projecting apparatus can be projection patterning in such arrowband of infrared light.
It can be seen that light sensing photoelectric detector and infrared sensing photoelectric detector can be arranged in a variety of different ways.At some
In embodiment, it is seen that light sensing photoelectric detector can be interspersed with infrared sensing photoelectric detector so that in photoelectric detector battle array
The substantially homogeneous mixing of each type of photoelectric detector on row be present.The visible light sensing Photoelectric Detection of arrangement is contemplated herein
The various modes of device and infrared sensing photoelectric detector, and further discuss in more detail below.
In some embodiments, the array of photoelectric detector can be coupled to the array of filter.Filter can be with
It is covered on the top of photoelectric detector so that be incident on the light on specific photoelectric detector first by corresponding filter.
Each filter can serve as the light that makes wavelength in certain band by while stopping or decay wavelength is outside the certain band
The bandpass filter of light.As described herein, " being configured as " capture or detect the photoelectric detector of light of a certain wavelength can be by
It is embodied as the photoelectric detector for being coupled to such filter as described above.
During operation, the visible ray 406 and infrared (IR) light 408 being incident on optical sensor 402 can respectively by
Visible light sensing photoelectric detector and infrared sensing the photoelectric detector capture of optical sensor.Optical sensor can include quilt
It is configured to set from the electric charge generation visible images 410 in photoelectric detector and the control circuit of IR light images 412 and/or processing
It is standby.Then these images can be supplied to computing device, with used in stereo-picture processing and depth sense and other possibility
Purposes in.
It should be noted that visible ray photoelectric detector and the specific band that uses of infrared light photoelectric detector capture light can be with
Changed according to particular implementation.In addition, the drop angle rate (rate of drop off) of the edge of these wave bands can also
Changed according to embodiment.It should be appreciated that the border of visible band and infrared light band can among various embodiments
With difference.
It is also noted that " visible images " described herein also refer to full-colour picture in some cases
As (for example, gray level image to the Color-sensitive of the light in visible spectrum).In other cases, photoelectric detector can be provided

Fig. 5 A are the exemplary arrangements 500 of the photoelectric detector on the exemplary optical sensors according to exemplary embodiment
Concept map.The exemplary arrangement 500 described in Fig. 5 can be for the application optical sensor (it is all as shown in Figure 4
Optical sensor 402) photoelectric detector an exemplary arrangement.Exemplary arrangement 500 shown in Fig. 5 is chessboard figure
Case, wherein visible light sensing photoelectric detector and infrared sensing photoelectric detector replace with column direction in the row direction.However,
It should be appreciated that according to specific embodiment, a variety of other Photoelectric Detections can be used on particular optical sensor
Device pattern.
During operation, optical sensor can use its visible light sensing photoelectric detector capture visible images and make
Infrared light image is captured with its infrared sensing photoelectric detector.As described herein, these images can be used at stereo-picture
To determine the depth on the surface in environment in reason.The processing of such stereo-picture can be related to determination from a visual angle (for example,
From the first optical sensor) image in feature location of pixels, and by its from from different visual angle (for example, coming
From the second optical sensor) image in the location of pixels of this feature be compared.Using triangulation, two can be based on
Known distance (for example, the distance between first and second optical sensors) and this feature between different visual angles is in two images
In relative pixel locations determine the depth of this feature.
The depth sense technology of the application is related to two distinct types of light (infrared light and visible ray) to perform so
Stereo-picture processing, to determine estimation of Depth in two different bands (for example, wave band or frequency band) of light.Then, these
Estimation of Depth can be combined to form the combined depth estimation at least one surface in environment.However, because visible ray
Sensing photoelectric detector and infrared sensing photoelectric detector prevent take up identical position on photoelectric detector, but interspersed
In planar array, so there may be a certain amount of inaccuracy when combining two single estimation of Depth.
As an example, it is seen that light image can include the feature captured by visible light sensing photoelectric detector 504, and
Infrared light image can include the same characteristic features captured by infrared sensing photoelectric detector 506.This feature may seem
Identical pixel is occupied in visible images and infrared light image, although the physical bit of each photoelectric detector of capture this feature
Put different (in this example, being the distance between photoelectric detector 504 and photoelectric detector 506).This slight inaccuracy
Property may be according to being interspersed with the specific pattern of visible light sensing photoelectric detector and infrared sensing photoelectric detector and change.Fig. 5

In addition to inaccuracy as reduction, the checkerboard pattern shown in Fig. 5 provides reduced systematic error.Examine
The different arrangements of photoelectric detector are considered, wherein visible light sensing photoelectric detector row replace with infrared sensing photoelectric detector row.
Increased systematic error is can suffer from using the imaging system of two such row alternating optical sensors.If two optics pass
Sensor calibration is bad, then the relative pixel locations in image captured may be offset, and cause systematic error.The skew may influence
The accuracy of the location of pixels all arranged of photoelectric detector.By replacing photoelectric detector type (example along both row and columns
Such as, checkerboard pattern), this system deviation can be avoided or substantially reduce its influence.
In certain embodiments, software and/or the technology of the known arrangement based on photoelectric detector can be used to compensate
Or correct the inaccuracy.Photoelectric detector arrangement 500 in Fig. 5 is thought of as whole optical sensor, it is by 16 photoelectricity
Detector (8 visible light sensing photoelectric detectors and 8 infrared sensing photoelectric detectors) forms.In the exemplary embodiment, 8
It can be seen that light sensing photoelectric detector can be used to from the full-colour image of photogenerated 2 × 2 in visible spectrum, and 8 infrared sensings
Photoelectric detector can be used to from the image of photogenerated 2 × 2 in arrowband infrared spectrum.In this example, each mosaic is (all
Such as mosaic 502) the single pixel that can correspond in image；That is, two visible light sensing photodetector pairs should be in visible
Pixel in light image, and two corresponding pixels in infrared light image of infrared sensing photoelectric detector.When generation image
During pixel, the electric charge that can be generated to two photoelectric detectors of same type in mosaic is averaged.Although gained
The resolution ratio of image reduces (because two photoelectric detectors contribute to single pixel), but reduces system deviation；From spy
The light for determining the feature that mosaic is captured is indicated on same pixel opening position in visible images and infrared light image.
In other embodiments, it is seen that light sensing photoelectric detector can be with infrared sensing photoelectric detector with alternating pattern
Arrangement.As an example, the often row in array can replace between visible light sensing and infrared sensing photoelectric detector.Make
For another example, each column in array can replace between visible light sensing and infrared sensing photoelectric detector.Implement additional
In example, optical sensor can will be seen that light sensing and infrared sensing photoelectric detector are arranged to repeat patterns or mosaic.Example
Such as, any amount of visible light sensing and infrared sensing photoelectric detector in mosaic can be combined and implement various square edges
Embedding pattern.Given mosaic can include any amount of photoelectric detector.Regardless of the specific arrangement of photoelectric detector,
Optical sensor can be provided with the visible light sensation for enabling optical sensor to capture both visible images and infrared light image
Certain of light-metering photodetector and infrared sensing photoelectric detector combine.
In some embodiments, using the robot system of visible ray and infrared light sensing optical sensor can to
Timing, which is carved, to be known, detects environment or otherwise classify to the environment that it is currently at.Such robot system
The one or more of optical sensor can be changed based on the identified environment that robot system wherein is currently just being responsible for
The operation of photoelectric detector.The control circuit of optical sensor can be configured to vary each of optical sensor during operation
Kind operating aspect and parameter, including be applied to the amount of the gain of the electric charge of each optical sensor and be exposed to photoelectric detector
The length (time for exposure) and other possible operating aspects of time under light.In some embodiments, can be visible
Light sensing photoelectric detector and infrared sensing photoelectric detector set different yield values and time for exposure.
As an example, robot system can determine that it just operates in daytime outdoor environment and responsively reduced
The time for exposure of photoelectric detector and/or yield value.In some cases, robot system can be reduced or otherwise set
The time for exposure of visible light sensing photoelectric detector is put, while does not reduce or otherwise changes infrared sensing photoelectric detector
Time for exposure.If the robot system moves into the indoor environment of dark, robot system can responsively increase
It can be seen that the time for exposure and/or yield value of light sensing photoelectric detector and/or infrared sensing photoelectric detector.Robot system can
Can run into the yield value that may need to change visible light sensing photoelectric detector, infrared sensing photoelectric detector or both and/or
Other scenes of time for exposure.
In some cases, robot system can be designed as operating in specific environment, and expection will not undergo photograph
Bright acute variation.For example, robot system can be designed as only with the seldom window relatively uniform with artificial light
Operated in the indoor environment at family.However, although it is contemplated that illumination range is less than the illumination in the indoor and outdoors environment of other mixing
Scope, but such environment may still include bright and clear surface and shaded surface.Machine in this environment
People's system can use one or more optical sensors, and each optical sensor includes more more than infrared sensing photoelectric detector
Visible light sensing photoelectric detector.
For example, each infrared sensing photoelectric detector may be more sensitive to infrared projection pattern, and each visible light sensing
Photoelectric detector may be relatively less sensitive to the ambient light in environment.Therefore, depending on its desired use, some optical sensings
Device can be designed as including more a type of photoelectric detectors compared with another type of photoelectric detector.And
And, it is seen that the arrangement of light sensing photoelectric detector and infrared sensing photoelectric detector can be examined according to each type of photoelectricity
Survey the quantity of device and the expected purpose of optical sensor and change.It should be appreciated that can according to embodiment, desired use and/
Or the robot system expection various environment to be run into combine any number of visible light sensation arranged in a variety of ways to realize
The various photoelectric detectors of light-metering photodetector and infrared sensing photoelectric detector.

With including being arranged to various various sizes of any amount of photoelectric detectors.It is also noted that term " horse as referred to herein
Sai Ke " refers to the repeated packets of photoelectric detector.

Optical sensor 604 is shown as and the separating distance D3 of the second optical sensor 606.In Fig. 6 stereo imaging system 600,
First optical sensor 604 and the second optical sensor 606 can rings from (for example, from different visual angles) from different angles
Border 608.Therefore, the first optical sensor 604 can be used to the image from the first viewpoint capturing ambient 608, and the second optics
Sensor 606 can be used to the image from the second viewpoint capturing ambient 608.
First optical sensor 604 and the second optical sensor 606 can be configured as capturing visible images and infrared
Light image.In certain embodiments, the first optical sensor 604 and the second optical sensor 606 are similar with optical sensor 402
Or it is identical, and can have the photoelectric detector of (including arrangement 500 shown in Fig. 5) arrangement in the above described manner.
Environment 608 can be illuminated by visible ray 610 at least in part.The visible light source can be daylight or visible spectrum people
Work illumination (for example, from incandescent lamp bulb, fluorescent lamp bulb, light emitting diode etc.) and other possible visible light sources.Visible ray
610 can illuminate some parts, object or surface in environment 608 brightly, and other parts, object in environment 608 or
Surface is then shielded or rather dark.
Environment 608 can also partly be illuminated by the infrared projection pattern from texture projecting apparatus 602.Texture projecting apparatus
602 can be infrared transmitter or infrared projector.For example, texture projecting apparatus can include light source, projection optical system with
And liquid crystal display (liquid crystal display, LCD) or other methods that light is interrupted with pattern.The pattern of projection can
To be grid, point, striped, spot, horizontal bar and/or the known combination and other shapes of vertical bar.
In some cases, when the pattern of projection part shielded or rather dark out of environment 608, object or surface
During reflection, it can just be detected.In addition to launching visible ray, some visible light sources, which can be launched, waters down or suppresses infrared throwing
The infrared light of shadow pattern.
In certain embodiments, the pattern of projection can be known or otherwise predetermined pattern, and it is shape
Unique combination.When pattern is scheduled, the differentiated part of the pattern, which can be located in the infrared image of capture and provide, to be used for
The reference point of triangulation.For example, the differentiated part of predetermined pattern is once identified from the image of capture, it becomes possible to using pre-
The characteristic (such as its size and location) for determining the differentiated part of pattern projects the surface of the differentiated part as determination thereon
Depth basis.In the embodiment for using known or predetermined projection pattern, structured light depth sense can be needed only
An infrared image and the relative position of optical sensor and texture projecting apparatus is wanted to generate depth map.However, from different points of view
Multiple infrared light images of capture can provide the additional information that can be used to improve or verify the accuracy of triangulation.
In other embodiments, the pattern of projection can generate at random.In some embodiments, change can be captured
Multiple infrared light images of the projection pattern generated at random.The computing device handled using structured light can export each infrared
The depth information of light image.Then it is more accurate or complete to generate that the depth information corresponding with each different pattern can be combined
Depth map.
During operation, the first optical sensor 604 can capture from the visible ray 610 that environment 608 reflects
Infrared light image is captured in light image and the infrared projection pattern reflected from environment 608.From different viewpoints, the second optics
Visible images are captured in the visible ray 610 that sensor 606 can reflect from environment 608 and are reflected from environment 608
Infrared light image is captured in infrared projection pattern.According to the time for exposure of optical sensor, the darkness part of environment may have been seen
Being black or very dark, and the bright light part of environment 608 can show in visible images and be illuminated surface
Details and feature.On the contrary, according to the time for exposure of optical sensor, the bright light part of environment 608 may look like
White or watered down, and the darkness part of environment 608 can show the infrared patterns being projected out in infrared light image.
Can be captured based on the first optical sensor 604 and the second optical sensor 606 two of computing device are visible
Light image generates depth image.This, which can be related to, finds in two visible images corresponding pixel value (for example, special characteristic
Pixel value) mapping, and it is how far away in pixel space middle-range to calculate these public domains, and (is based on using triangulation
For example, the distance between two optical sensors D3) determine depth map or image.The depth map or depth image can include
Based on from the visible detection of reflection to feature, related to the distance on the surface of the object in environment 608 information.So
And the surface of the object in the shade of environment 608 or rather dark part may not reflect enough visible rays come it is accurate
Really determine the distance on these surfaces；Therefore, can be represented exactly in environment 608 from depth map caused by visible images
The depth on some surfaces.
Similarly, computing device can be captured based on the first optical sensor 604 and the second optical sensor 606 two
Individual infrared light image generates depth image.Can be with being generated for visible images similar mode for infrared light figure
The depth image or depth map of picture.The depth map or depth image can be included based on infrared light (including the infrared throwing from reflection
Shadow pattern) feature, related to the distance on the surface of the object in environment 608 information that detects.However, environment 608
The surface of object in bright illumination part may reflect too many infrared light, so as to water down originally detectable feature and make
The distance on these surfaces, which must be determined, becomes difficult；Therefore, environment can be represented exactly from the depth map of infrared light image generation
The depth on some surfaces in 608.
Computing device can be combined from the depth map generated according to visible images and according to infrared light image generation
The information of depth map, to determine the combined depth figure of environment 608.Because each depth map represents what is detected in different spectrum
Depth, therefore combined depth figure can be that whole environment 608 provide more comprehensively and/or accurate depth map.
In certain embodiments, the list that can be captured based on the first optical sensor 604 or the second optical sensor 606
One infrared light image determines depth map.For example, computing device, which can use, is based on the optical sensing of texture projecting apparatus 602 and first
What the triangulation technique of the known distance between device 604 and the first optical sensor 604 captured projects on environment 608
The infrared image of projection pattern is to determine depth map.Known distance D1, D2 and D3 and the first optical sensor 604 and/or second
Any combination for one or more infrared images that optical sensor 606 is captured can be used to determine depth map.
In some cases, the depth map determined according to visible images and another depth determined according to infrared light image
Figure can include overlapping depth information.When generating combined depth figure, computing device can select from one of two depth maps
Depth information is selected, with combined depth figure.In some embodiments, computing device can be believed the depth for carrying out self-overlapped
The depth information for ceasing two depth maps being present in is averaged.
Although the depth map determined according to visible images needs at least two visible rays captured from two different points of view
Image, but the depth map determined from infrared light image can only need the single infrared light figure from the capture of one of these viewpoints
Picture.As set forth above, it is possible to the known distance between the optical sensor based on texture projecting apparatus 602 and capture infrared light image makes
Determined with triangulation based on infrared depth map.Therefore, in other exemplary stereo imaging systems, the first optical sensing
There was only an ability for needing to capture infrared image in the optical sensor 606 of device 604 and second, this Shen is based on to realize to come from
The technology of the depth map of the combination of visible ray and infrared light please.
