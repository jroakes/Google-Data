- Network devices can be physically located at different geographical locations (“geo-locations”) across the world.
- Network devices can include routers, bridges, switches, and repeaters, as well as user devices which can be operated by a user.
- User devices for example, personal computers and smart phones, that are coupled to a network, for example, the Internet, enable users of the devices to access resources stored on computers and storage devices that are also coupled to the network.
- This specification describes technologies relating to determining the geo-location of network devices from events obtained from the network devices. This determination is made using models, for instance by using models based on a Dirichlet process or a Pitman-Yor process, of the probability that the same event is obtained multiple times from a particular device or a particular group of devices.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of obtaining, by a system comprising one or more computers, a sequence of events, each of the events including geographical location information, from a first device to be located; determining, by operation of the system and for each event and each of a plurality of geographical locations, a probability that the respective event was obtained from a second device given that the second device is located at the respective geographical location; determining, by operation of the system, a probability that the sequence of events was obtained from the second device, including using a model representing how sequences of events are generated by network devices; and determining, by operation of the system and for each of the plurality of geographical locations, a probability that the first device is located at the respective geographical location using the probability that the sequence of events was obtained.

- a system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- the model includes: a first probability that a previously obtained event is re-obtained, wherein the first probability equals (m ⁇ d)/(k+ ⁇ ), wherein k is a total number of events already obtained, m is the number of times the respective event has already been obtained, ⁇ is a predetermined non-zero constant and d is a predetermined constant; and a second probability that a not-previously-obtained event is obtained, wherein the second probability equals ( ⁇ +t*d)/(k+ ⁇ ), wherein t is a number of different events already obtained.
- the parameter ⁇ has a fixed value.
- the parameter ⁇ is determined from the sequence of events.
- the constant d is zero.
- the model represents the generation of the sequence of events by a Dirichlet process or by a Pitman-Yor process.
- the method further includes: identifying a first session of the first device, wherein a session is a period of time with a start time and an end time, wherein the model represents how sequences of events are generated by network devices in a single session. Identifying the first session includes determining that a predetermined amount of time has lapsed since the end of a previous session.
- the first device is one of a first group of devices, the method further includes: determining, for each of the plurality of geographical locations, a probability that a device of the first group of devices is located at the respective geographical location.
- the method further includes dividing the sequence of events into a plurality of groups of events, wherein each group of events is associated with a session of the first device, wherein the model represents how sequences of events are generated by network devices in a plurality of sessions.
- the model represents the generation of the sequence of events in a plurality of sessions by a hierarchical Dirichlet process or by a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process. Determining, for each of the plurality of geographical locations, a probability that the first device is located at the respective geographical location includes determining a minimum or a maximum of an expression for a probability that the sequence of events are obtained given that the first device is located at each of the plurality of geographical locations.
- the expression is a maximum-likelihood expression and determining a minimum or a maximum includes maximizing the maximum-likelihood expression by using an expectation-maximization method or a gradient-descent method. Determining, for each of the plurality of geographical locations, a probability that the first device is located at the respective geographical location includes using a Gibbs sampling method.
- a system can estimate geographical locations of network devices, e.g., user devices, from events obtained from the network devices using statistical models modeling the probability that a sequence of two or more related events is observed from a same user device in a group of user devices. For example, an estimate of a geographical location of a network device can be inferred from information obtained from an aggregated group of network devices, for example, on the order of 100 or 1000 devices, that is stable on a timescale of one day.
- a system can estimate a geographical location of presence that is accurate to the level of a city, a postal code, a neighborhood or an area, for example, a 2 ⁇ 2 sq. km area.

- FIG. 1 illustrates multiple user devices 10 a , 10 b , e.g., laptops, mobile phones, smartphones, tablet PCs, personal computers, or PDAs, and a computer system 20 and a database 40 that are coupled to a network.
- the multiple user devices 10 a , 10 b can be organized into or belong to a group of user devices 10 .
- the techniques described below are described for user devices; however, they can also be implemented for other network devices, e.g., routers, bridges, switches, repeaters or hubs.
- the computer system 20 and database 40 can each be implemented on one or multiple computers in one or multiple locations, programmed and configured to perform the methods described below.
- the system 20 obtains events 30 a - 30 d that originated from the group of user devices 10 .
- Events are generally generated by a user device in response to a user action on the device; however, events may also be generated by the device itself. Events can be interactions of the user or the device with other devices or with resources or services on the network. Events can also be states or changes of state of the device itself that are transmitted to other devices on the network.
- an event can be, for example, a query received from a user device, including a search query, a map query, or a route query; a setting in a network application, e.g., a language setting, time zone or region setting, or a preference setting in a social network; a visit to one or more web pages by the user; one or several cookies stored on the device or transmitted by the device; or a posting in a social network.
- Events are described in this specification as being observed, collected, received, or obtained by the system 20 , by which is meant that data representing each of the events is observed, collected, received, or obtained by the system 20 , and that the data includes content of the event.
- events that include implicit or explicit information related to the geographical location of the device from which the events originated.
- an event is a search query containing the possible location X, e.g., New York City. Three search queries containing the possible location New York City would be three instances, ev1, ev2, ev3, of the same event.
- system 20 can associate times with the events. For example, every event can be associated with a time stamp indicating the time at which the particular event was observed, transmitted or generated.
- Example systems and methods to obtain and store events from user devices are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/458,895, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
- the user devices that are included in a group of devices 10 can be identified by the system 20 based on the network addresses, e.g., Internet Protocol addresses, of the user devices.
- the system 20 can determine information regarding similarities in an estimated geographical location of a group of network devices from the network addresses of network devices. Methods that can be performed to cluster or group network devices based on their network addresses are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/458,895, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
- the system 20 can identify a single device 10 a from the group of devices 10 from which one or more particular events were obtained. Alternatively or in addition, the system 20 can identify distinct users of the device 10 a . For instance, the system 20 may be able to use cookies to distinguish among multiple users of the device.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect personal information, e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, or a user's current location, or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, or a user's current location, or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized, so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user.
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used.
- the system 20 can group the events originating from one user into one or more sessions, e.g., session 31 , based on the times at which the events where generated or observed. For example, the system can identify the beginning of a new session if no event has been obtained from a particular device for a predetermined period of time, e.g., one hour. If the difference between time stamps associated with events subsequently obtained from the same user device is less than the predetermined period of time, the system 20 can determine that these events are associated with this new session. The session ends if no event is obtained for the predetermined period of time. In this manner, the system 20 can divide a portion or all of the obtained events into one or more sessions.
- a predetermined period of time e.g., one hour
- the system 20 can estimate a geographical location of the single device 10 a or 10 b and/or the group of devices 10 based, at least partially, on the obtained events. A method for doing so that can be performed by the system 20 is described in reference to FIG. 5 , below.
- the estimate of the geographical location of the device 10 a or the group of devices 10 can be (i) a single geographical location, e.g., the geographical location having the greatest probability among multiple geographical locations, or (ii) a probability distribution representing the probability that the device 10 a or the group of devices 10 are located at multiple geographical locations, e.g., a probability value for each geographical location.
- the system 20 determines a probability distribution 80 of geographical locations including a probability 80 a , 80 b that a device of the group of devices is located at a particular geographical location for every one of a number of candidate geographical locations.
- the system 20 can apply a weight to each event to be used in estimating the geo-location of the device 10 a , 10 b or the group of devices. For instance, a user might generate a sequence of slightly modified or refined queries to find a place of interest, e.g., a restaurant, in a particular area. While the first event of such a sequence of events can have a certain predictive power regarding the geographical location of the user or the user device, the subsequent events adds less predictive power than an event independent from the first event. In particular, several events can originate from the same user. Adding many events from one user may not provide as much information as few events from each of many users. Additionally, query events can be repeated.
- the system 20 can take this into account when estimating the geographical location of the device 10 a or the group of devices 10 by using a statistical model 90 modeling the probability that a sequence of two or more events is observed from the user device 10 a or the group of user devices 10 .
- the system 20 applies the statistical model 90 to compute a conditional probability that an obtained sequence of events is observed from the group of devices 10 given that the group of devices 10 is located at a respective geographical location.
- Alternative or additional implementations of the statistical model 90 are described below in reference to FIGS. 2 and 4 .
- the statistical model 90 can be model based on a Dirichlet process or a Pitman-Yor process.
- the statistical model 90 can also be a hierarchical Dirichlet process or Pitman-Yor process based model.
- a hierarchical Dirichlet process probabilities of a sequence of sequences of events e.g. p( ⁇ ev1,ev2 ⁇ , ⁇ ev3 ⁇ , ⁇ ev4,e5,e6 ⁇ ) are used.
- the statistical models described above and in reference to FIGS. 2 and 4 are models modeling the probability that a sequence of two or more events is observed from a user device or a group of user devices, these techniques can be directly employed to model the probability that a sequence of two or more events is observed in a single session of a user device.
- the system 20 instead of associating a sequence of events with a single user device or user, the system 20 can 1) associate a sequence of events with a single session, 2) use one of the statistical models described in reference to FIGS. 2 and 4 to determine a probability that the sequence of events is obtained given that the device or the group of devices is located at a respective geographical location, and 3) determine an estimate of the geographical location of a user device or group of user devices hosting the session based on this probability.
- the system 20 uses a statistical model modeling the probability that a sequence of two or more events is observed from a user or a user device during a session. based on the times at which the events where generated or observed.
- the session can be based on whether subsequent events obtained from the same user occur within a predetermined period of time.
- the session can be the sequence of events observed during a predetermined time span.
- the predetermined time span can be selected according as required in the respective geo-location system, e.g., one hour or one day. If a sequence of events obtained in one session is considered, the length of the session can determine the duration of the predetermined time span.
- the statistical model includes a probability that, a previously obtained event is re-obtained is proportional to or equal to k/(k+ ⁇ ), wherein k is a total number of events already obtained in the session and ⁇ is a predetermined positive constant. Accordingly, the model includes a second probability that an event not yet previously obtained in the session is obtained is proportional to or equals ⁇ /(k+ ⁇ ).
- the system 20 can compute a probability that an obtained sequence of events is obtained, given that the user device or group of user devices is located at one or one of multiple geographical locations. This probability can then be used by the system 20 to estimate a geographical location of a user or a user device.
- the models modeling the probability that a sequence of two or more events is observed from a user device or a group of user devices described in the previous example have the advantage, over some techniques, that the determined probabilities for the generation of a predetermined sequence of events are not dependent from an order in which the events are obtained.
- the events can be collected during a predetermined time span at system 20 or another system. Periodically or triggered by a user action, the system 20 can estimate the geographical location of the user device 10 a or the group of user devices 10 based on all events previously collected without having to consider the time order in which they were collected.
- a Dirichlet process Dir(G 0 , ⁇ )
- G 0 assigns a probability to subsets of T
- Dir(G 0 , ⁇ ) assigns a probability to subsets of the set of all probability measures on T.
- the set T can be a set of different events a user or a user device may generate, to model the generation of events by a user or user device.
- the obtained sequence of events can be modeled to be distributed according to Dir(G 0 , ⁇ ), which can describe the possible distributions of events over the set T, i.e., how many times each different event is included in a sequence of events.
- a probability distribution G i can be randomly selected according to Dir(G 0 , ⁇ ).
- the actual obtained sequence of events can be selected according to the randomly selected probability distribution G i . Therefore, the system 20 can use a model based on a Dirichlet process to model the probability that a sequence of two or more events is observed from a user device or a group of user devices.
- the system 20 For a sequence of N events obtained from a user or a user device that contains t different events, where the number of times the i-th event ev i is included in the particular sequence of events is k i , the system 20 , using a Dirichlet process based model, determines a probability of the sequence to be:
- the statistical model 90 can be represented as a Bayesian network.
- Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs whose nodes represent random variables and whose edges represent conditional dependencies. Each node is associated with a probability function that receives a particular set of values of the variables of the node as an input.
- the Bayesian network representation for the model of the event generation process by users or user devices can be used in the system 20 to infer the geographical location of users or user devices, as described below.
- the Bayesian network model 90 can be stored on the system 20 , or on another system (not shown) in any conventional form.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a Bayesian network representation of a Dirichlet process based model of the generation process of events by network devices.
- the Bayesian network contains five nodes 205 - 209 .
- the unknown probability distribution of geographical locations of a user device or a group of user devices is denoted as X (represented in the node 205 ).
- the probability distribution of geographical locations X contains, for all candidate geographical locations, a probability that a device is located at the respective geographical location.
- the set of candidate geographical locations 201 can be predetermined or it can be derived from the obtained events. Methods a system can perform to determine a set of candidate geographical locations are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/458,895, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
- loc i The unknown geographical location in which an i-th user or user device from a set of users 203 , e.g., user device 10 a , of a group of user devices 10 is located is denoted loc i (represented in the node 206 ).
- loc i represents in the node 206 .
- a group of user devices can be determined based on the network addresses of the user devices.
- the group of user devices belongs to a same block of Internet Protocol addresses 202 .
- the location loc i is selected according to the probabilities included in X.
- a known event distribution for the candidate location loc i is denoted as ⁇ loci .
- the event distribution can contain, for a set of events and candidate geographical locations, a set of conditional probabilities p(ev
- these conditional probabilities 70 can be retrieved from a database 40 that stores the conditional probabilities.
- a separate probability value 70 a - d is obtained indicating a probability that a particular event is observed given that a device is located at a respective geographical location.
- the conditional probabilities 70 can also be stored on the system 20 .
- the known event distribution can be determined in any of various ways.
- reference user devices can be used to determine the event distribution.
- Further methods to derive the conditional probabilities 70 forming the event distribution are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/458,895, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
- G i (represented at note 207 ) is assumed to exist, but is not observed.
- G i is not a probability distribution on obtained events, but on the set of all events.
- G i is randomly selected from Dir( ⁇ loci , ⁇ ), where ⁇ is a predetermined positive constant, as described above.
- ⁇ can be chosen for each user independently.
- the value of ⁇ >0 is arbitrary, but when applied to the observed events data, the value of ⁇ is chosen so that it is the value that best explains the observed data.
- the events observed from an i-th user or user device are denoted as ev ij (represented by the node 209 ), with the subscript j indicating a j-th member of a sequence of events obtained from the i-th user or user device.
- the sequence of events is obtained at or received by the system 20 , the events are known and thus constitute a set of known variables of the statistical model 90 .
- the system 20 can solve the Bayesian network model 90 , i.e., estimate the unknown probability distribution of geographical locations X based on the known events ev ij and the known event distribution ⁇ loci .
- the system 20 can be programmed to do so using a variety of different methods.
- the system 20 can use a Bayesian estimator, e.g., a maximum a posteriori (“MAP”) estimator, that minimizes a posterior expected value of a loss function, i.e., that maximizes the posterior expectation of a utility function.
- MAP maximum a posteriori
- the system 20 can use a maximum likelihood estimator that yields the most likely probability distribution of geographical locations of the user or user devices given the obtained events and a known event distribution for the candidate locations.
- a maximum-likelihood estimator which is solved by an expectation-maximization method, is described in reference to FIG. 3 .
- the system 20 can also perform a Gibbs sampling to solve the Bayesian network model 90 to infer the probability distribution of geographical locations.
- the system 20 has to determine if two obtained events are the “same” event.
- two obtained events can be identical events, e.g., literally identical search queries, two obtained non-identical events can be determined to be the “same” event based on other factors.
- two obtained events can be determined to be the same event based on the obtained events' predictive power for estimating the geographical location of a user or a user device.
- the system 20 classifies the obtained events according to the geographical location information they contain. If two events contain the same geographical location information, system 20 determines that the two events are in the same class of events, i.e., are the “same” event.
- sequences of events obtained from user devices frequently include related events. This can occur if, for example, a user enters the same query multiple times with only slight modifications. These related queries can carry the same geographical location information and therefore be classified in the same class of events.
- the criteria for determining if two events include the same geographical location information can be predetermined. For example, an event can be divided into data that describes geographical location information and data that does not describe geographical location information. Then, the system 20 can identify that two events belong to the same class of events, i.e. are the “same” event, if the data that describes geographical location information is identical in both events. For instance, names of places can constitute geographical location information. Therefore, two events can be identified by the system 20 as belonging to the same class of events if both events include the same names of places.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for determining a geographic probability distribution.
- the process uses a Dirichlet process based model, as described above.
- the process can be performed by a system as described in reference to FIG. 1 , e.g., the system 20 .
- the system 20 can determine a probability value for each of a number M of candidate geographical locations in which the group of user devices can be located.
- the candidate geographical locations form a set L of geographical locations having M members; the i-th member is denoted as loc i .
- the candidate geographical locations can be determined as described above.
- the process begins by obtaining ( 301 ) N events that have been observed from the group of devices whose geographical location are to be determined.
- the system 20 can obtain N events from the group of devices 10 . Therefore, the obtained events form a set of events E that has N members, where the j-th member is denoted with ev j . Both N and M are natural numbers.
- the system determines ( 302 ) probabilities that an i-th event ev i is observed from a device given that the device is located at the j-th geographical location loc j . For example, given that a device is located at San Francisco, a probability that a search query including “San Francisco” is observed can be 0.4. The probability that an event ev i is observed from a device given that the device is located at the j-th geographical location loc j can be expressed by a conditional probability of the form P(ev i
- Step 302 can be repeated for all obtained events and all candidate geographical locations.
- a set of conditional probabilities can be generated.
- the conditional probabilities can be previously known and stored in a database, such as a historical data base described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/458,895.
- the system 20 can access the database and request the conditional probabilities for each obtained event from this database.
- the system determines ( 303 ) the probability that the obtained sequence of events e i* has been obtained, where the “*” symbol denotes that the sequence includes all different events, i.e., runs from 1 to t, given that a user or user device is located at a certain geographical location p(ev i*
- This can include using an expression derived from a Dirichlet process based model as described above. For instance, the conditional probability p(ev i*
- the system 20 calculates ( 304 ) a probability distribution of geographical locations of the group of devices X(loc) from the conditional probabilities p(ev i*
- the calculation described in the previous paragraph can include evaluating an expression for the likelihood that the observed set of events is obtained from a device or a group of devices distributed according to a probability distribution of geographical locations. This likelihood is unknown but it can be expressed by the conditional probabilities p(ev i*
- the system 20 can determine the probability distribution of geographical locations to be determined from this expression.
- the system 20 can determine a probability distribution of geographical locations maximizing this unknown likelihood expression. This maximization can be performed without actually determining the unknown likelihood that the observed set of events was obtained from a device or a group of devices distributed according to the probability distribution of geographical locations.
- X), can be expressed as:
- the system 20 determines the probability distribution of geographical locations X that maximizes this expression.
- the system can determine the probability distribution of geographical locations X that maximizes foregoing likelihood using statistical methods, for example, an expectation-maximization algorithm, as described below in reference to FIG. 4 , steps 404 - 406 .
- a gradient descent algorithm can also be used to determine a probability distribution of geographical location X(loc) that maximizes this expression.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example expectation-maximization process to maximize a maximum-likelihood expression.
- the system 20 initializes ( 404 ) the probability distribution of geographical locations X(loc). This initialization can include assigning an equal probability value to all candidate geographical locations. Alternatively, a probability value of one can be assigned to a most likely geographical location that was previously determined. Further techniques to initialize the probability distribution are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/458,895.
- the system 20 performs an iterative procedure which first includes an expectation step, yielding an update for the conditional probabilities q(loc
- the expectation step can include calculating ( 405 ) these conditional probabilities q(loc
- the system can use these updated conditional probabilities q(loc
- the system uses the updated probability distribution of geographical location X t+1 (loc) to determine an updated set of conditional probabilities q(loc
- This iteration can be continued until an exit criterion is fulfilled.
- the probability distribution of geographical location can converge towards a probability distribution. This can include determining if the change in a last step is lower than a predetermined threshold, or that the change in the last m steps was lower than a predetermined threshold.
- Other exit criteria can include a maximum number of iterations.
- the system 20 can output the current probability distribution as an estimate of the probability distribution of geographical locations of the group of devices.
- the statistical model 90 can also be implemented as a Pitman-Yor process based model.
- the Pitman-Yor process based model is a generalization of the Dirichlet process based model.
- a Pitman-Yor based model contains an additional parameter, which can be set to tune the growth speed of the number of different events. In particular, the number of different events grows logarithmically in a Dirichlet process based model. In a Pitman-Yor based model, the number of different events grows in the order of n d , wherein d is the additional parameter.
- a probability that, at a predetermined point in time, a previously obtained event is re-obtained equals (c i ⁇ d)/(k+ ⁇ ), wherein k is a total number of events already obtained at the predetermined point in time, ⁇ and d are predetermined non-zero constants and c i is the multiplicity of the i-th event, i.e., the number of times the event has already been obtained in a predetermined time span.
- a second probability that, at the predetermined point in time, an event not previously obtained in the predetermined time span is obtained equals ( ⁇ +td)/(k+ ⁇ ), where t denotes the number of different events obtained at a certain point in time.
- the predetermined time span can be selected according as required in the respective geo-location system, e.g., one hour or one day. If a sequence of events obtained in one session is considered, the length of the session can determine the duration of the predetermined time span
- the Pitman-Yor based model can be represented by a Bayesian network model as described in reference to FIG. 2 .
- the only modification consist in the distribution of distributions G i (represented by node 207 ).
- G i encodes the probabilities of different events for a user or a user device i.
- G i is randomly drawn from PY( ⁇ loci , ⁇ , d) instead of from Dir( ⁇ loci , ⁇ ).
- the Pitman-Yor based model can be solved by the methods described above.
- the system 20 can infer a maximum likelihood estimate by using an expectation-maximization algorithm, as described above in reference to FIGS. 3 and 4 .
- conditional probabilities derived from the Pitman-Yor process based model are used instead of using the conditional probabilities for the generation of the sequence of obtained events derived from the Dirichlet process based model.
- processes have been described by which the system 20 can estimate the geo-location of a group of devices 10 including modeling the generation process of a sequence obtained events from a single user device or in a single session. These processes can also be expanded to a situation where events from multiple sessions are included in the sequence of obtained events.
- FIG. 5 illustrates the user network devices 10 a , 10 b and the computer system 20 described in reference to FIG. 1 .
- the system 20 receives or obtains events 50 a - 50 g that are associated with different sessions 51 a , 51 b from each user device 10 a , 10 b .
- a single user or user device 10 a may generate events in multiple sessions.
- a first sequence of events 50 a to 50 d is generated and grouped by the system 20 in a first session 51 a .
- a second sequence of events is generated by the user device 10 a and grouped by the system 20 into a second session 51 b . All events 50 a to 50 g are obtained at system 20 .
- the models described above can be modified. This can further improve the accuracy of the geographical location estimates as the user behavior can differ from session to session. For example, a user might search for a restaurant in a first session and for a particular product in a second session, which occurs at a later time.
- the user's search query topics e.g., the user's interests
- the user's changing interests can be accounted for in the modified model, e.g., in a hierarchical Dirichlet process based model or a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process based model.
- the model used by system 20 can be a hierarchical Dirichlet process based model.
- a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process based model can be used to take into account both sessions and users and/or user devices.
- the hierarchical Dirichlet process based model of the generation of the sequence of events can use a separate model for each session.
- each model can be independent of the models for other sessions
- FIG. 6 depicts a Bayesian network representation for a hierarchical Dirichlet process based model of the generation of events in multiple sessions.
- the background of the Bayesian network representation is described in reference to FIG. 2 above.
- reference signs 601 to 609 indicate the features of the Bayesian network of the Pitman-Yor process based model corresponding to the features referenced by reference signs 201 to 209 in the Bayesian network of the Dirichlet process based model in FIG. 2 .
- an additional layer 611 has been added to take multiple sessions into account.
- the events e ijk are not directly generated according to the distribution G i , as in FIG. 2 .
- a second probability distribution G ij ( 610 ) is generated according to Dir(G i , ⁇ ), wherein ⁇ is a predetermined constant of a second Dirichlet process.
- the parameter ⁇ is analogous to the parameter ⁇ of the first Dirichlet process.
- the two Dirichlet processes are nested and thus form a hierarchical Dirichlet process based model.
- the system 20 can use the methods described above in reference to FIG. 2 .
- the sequence of events obtained from a certain user device or user e.g., the i-th user of a group of users, can be partitioned into s different sessions indexed by j, so that the index j runs from 1 to s.
- the different events included in the sequence of events obtained from the user or user device are indexed by an index k, where the index k runs from 1 to t. Techniques to determine which events of the sequence of events are classified as the same events and which are classified as different events are described above in reference to FIG. 1 .
- the sequence of events obtained from the user or user device form a set.
- the number of times a k-th event is obtained during a j-th session of an i-th user or user device is denoted by n jk .
- the probability that a sequence of events is obtained from a user or user device given that the device is located at the i-th location can be derived from the hierarchical Dirichlet process based model described above as:
- the index m denotes an unknown number of draws from G i involved for generating the sequence of events obtained from the user or user device. Consequentially, m ranges from the number of different events in the sequence t, one draw for every different event, to the total number of events in the sequence N.
- the above probability formula can be derived as follows.
- loc i ) can be computed for every m, i.e., a probability that the observed sequence of events is obtained with m draws from G i given that the user or user device is located at the i-th geographical location.
- loc i ) can be calculated as a sum of the probabilities p(n ** ,m
- loc i )) can be derived by induction by considering one event at a time.
- the probability to obtain a restricted set of events ev 1 , . . . , ev k of events from a user or user device is denoted by p(n ** ⁇ k ,m
- a second polynomial Q k (X) can be obtained from A k (X) by multiplying the coefficients of each X by (P k ⁇ a) m ⁇ b m
- This expression can be used to derive the formula for p(n **
- this probability can be used in the processes described in reference to FIGS. 1 to 3 to compute a probability distribution of geographical locations X(loc) for the group of devices including the user device.
- Pitman-Yor process based models can also be used to generate a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process based model to model the generation of events by users or user devices in multiple sessions.
- the hierarchical Dirichlet process based models and their implementations can be used by system 20 , with the sole modification that, wherever in a draw according to a Dirichlet distribution is part of the model in the hierarchical Dirichlet process based models, a draw from a corresponding Pitman-Yor distribution is used.
- the techniques described above in reference to FIG. 6 can be used.
- the above models are based on exchangeability, the assumption that any permutation of the users, sessions for a user, and events in a session will give the same probabilities.
- the last assumption may actually not be justified: for example, a user of a map application may change driving directions by dragging an intermediate point on a displayed route. This will generate a number of consecutive requests with the same start and end point, and the events in this group are not exchangeable with other events outside the group.
- To get the “right” estimates from the above models one would have to treat these special cases separately, e.g., by replacing consecutive “driving directions events” with same start and end point occurring within a short time with just two events corresponding to start and end point.
- the models can be modified to take them into account; as long as the probability of an observed sequence of events given the location can be computed as in equations (1) or (2), above, the models and the computation, e.g., the EM algorithm, can be modified accordingly.
