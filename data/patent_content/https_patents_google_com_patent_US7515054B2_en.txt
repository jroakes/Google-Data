Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to apparatus, systems, and methods for monitoring movement of a human eye, e.g., for monitoring fatigue, purposeful communication, and/or controlling devices based upon movement of an eye, eyelid, and/or other components of the eye or eyes of a person.
- U.S. Pat. No. 3,863,243 discloses a device that sounds an alarm to warn a person using the device that they are beginning to fall asleep.
- the device includes a frame similar to a set of eyeglasses onto which is mounted an optical fiber and a photocell that are directed towards the user's eye when the frame is worn.
- the photocell detects the intensity of light reflected off of the user's eye, i.e., either by the eyelid when the eye is closed or the eye surface when the eye is open.
- a timer distinguishes between regular blinks, and an extended time period during which the eye is closed, i.e., a time period that may indicate that the person is falling asleep.
- a threshold time elapses, an alarm is sounded to notify and/or wake the user.
- Another device is the Alertness Monitor by MTI Research Inc., which may be mounted on safety glasses, and emits a continuous infrared beam of light along the axis of the eyelid at a strategic position where the beam cannot be broken by the eyelashes except during an eyeblink, giving it the ability to measure eyeblink frequency.
- Other devices such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,469,143 and 4,359,724, directly engage the eyelid or eyebrow of a user to detect movement of the eye and activate an alarm when a drowsiness condition is detected.
- Such devices may include mechanical devices, e.g., a mechanical arm, or a piezo-electric film against the eyelid.
- the present invention is directed to apparatus, systems, and methods for monitoring movement of one or more eyes, eyelids, and/or pupils of a subject.
- humans blink at least about 5-30 times per minute, or about 7,000-43,000 times per day.
- Each involuntary-reflexive blink lasts about 200-300 milliseconds, generally averaging about 250 milliseconds, amounting to about 1,750-10,800 seconds per day of eye closure due to involuntary blinking.
- the eye blink may get longer and slower and/or the blink rate may vary, and/or the eyelids may begin to droop with small amplitude eye lid blinks, e.g., until the eyes begin to close for short term “microsleeps,” i.e., sleep conditions that last for about 3-5 seconds or longer, or for prolonged sleep.
- the pupils may constrict more sluggishly, show unstable fluctuations in size, shrinking progressively in diameter, and/or demonstrate delayed responses to light flashes (i.e. delayed pupil response latency) as sleepiness and fatigue progresses.
- ocular manifestations of drowsiness may occur, such as slow or delayed saccadic eye tracking responses, e.g., to a stimulus (i.e., delayed saccadic response latency), with either over- or under-shooting the target, and/or a loss of directed gaze with or without binocular vergence or divergence, eye drift, or esophoria.
- an apparatus for monitoring eyelid, pupil, and/or eye movement includes a device configured to be worn on a person's head, a light source for directing light towards the eyes of the person when the device is worn, and first and second fiberoptic bundles coupled to the device, the first bundle positioned for viewing a first eye of the person wearing the device, the second bundle positioned for viewing a second eye of the person wearing the device.
- the apparatus may also include a camera coupled to the first and second bundles for acquiring images of the first and second eyes.
- the apparatus may also include a third fiberoptic bundle oriented away from the user, e.g., for viewing a region towards which the user's head is turned.
- the apparatus may carry one or more spatial sensors.
- the camera may be coupled to the first and second bundles for acquiring images of the first and second eyes, as well as to the third bundle for acquiring images of the area towards which the user's head and/or eyes are directed.
- the spatial sensors may allow simultaneous measuring or tracking of the user's head movement, e.g., relative to the user's eye movements.
- the arrays of emitters and/or sensors coupled to the camera may allow measurement of a variety of oculometric parameters of one or both eyes, such as eyelid velocity, acceleration and deceleration, eye blink frequency, “PERCLOS” (percentage of time the eyelid is open), the vertical height of the palpebral fissure (i.e. the region between the eye lids not covering the pupil), e.g., as a distance or percentage related to a completely open eye, and the like.
- a self-contained device for detecting movement of a person's eyelid that includes a device adapted to be worn on the person's head, an emitter on the device for directing light towards an eye of the person when the device is worn, and a camera for detecting light from the emitter.
- the sensor produces an output signal indicating when the eye is open or closed, and a transmitter on the frame is coupled to the sensor for wireless transmission of the output signal to a remote location.
- the frame may also include a processor for comparing the output signal to a predetermined threshold to detect drowsiness-induced eyelid movement.
- the emitter and sensor may be a solid state biosensor device for emitting and detecting infrared light, or alternatively an array, e.g., one or two dimensional array, of emitters and/or sensors in a predetermined configuration on the frame, e.g., in a vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or other linear or other geometric array of more than one emitter and/or sensor oriented towards one or both eyes.
- an array of emitters and/or sensors may allow measurement of oculometric parameters, such as those identified elsewhere herein.
- the emitter and/or sensors may be affixed to any number of points on the frame, e.g., around the lens and/or in the nose bridge, or alternatively anywhere along the frame, including near or on the nasal portion of the frame, the attachment of a temple piece of the frame, and/or surface mounted on the lens of an eyeglass.
- the emitter and/or sensor may be embedded in the lens of an eyeglass, or otherwise such that they operate through the lens.
- the emitter(s) and/or sensor(s) may be fixed on an eye-frame such that they move with the wearer's head movements, and continuously focus on the user's eyes in any body position, whether the user is in a vehicle, outdoors or in any other environment.
- a system for monitoring movement of a person's eye.
- the system includes a device configured to be worn on a person's head, one or more emitters on the device for directing light towards an eye of the person when the device is worn, and a camera, e.g., a CCD or CMOS device.
- the emitter(s) may be configured for projecting a reference frame towards the eye.
- the camera may be oriented towards the eye for monitoring movement of the eye relative to the reference frame.
- the camera may be provided on the device or may be provided remote from the device, but in relatively close proximity to the user.
- Light from the emitter(s) may be emitted towards the eye of a user wearing the device to illuminate the eye(s) of the user, while projecting a reference frame onto the eye.
- the emitter(s) may project light “invisibly” to the user, i.e., outside the scotopic (night-vision) or photopic (day-vision) range of normal vision, e.g., in the infrared light range, such that the illumination and/or reference frame do not interfere substantially with the user's vision.
- the camera may image light produced by the emitters, e.g., in the infrared light range, thereby detecting the projected light as a spot of light, band of light or other “glint.” Movement of the eye relative to the reference frame may be monitored with the camera. A graphical output of the movement monitored by the camera, e.g., relative to a reference frame projected onto the eye, may be monitored. For example, infrared light from the emitters may be reflected off of the retina as a “red reflex” under white light, as a white or dark black pupil under infrared light, including the image of a dark pupil using methods of subtraction known in the art.
- a processor may detect movement of the eye's pupil, e.g., measuring movement relative to the reference frame. This movement may be graphically displayed, showing the movement of the eye's pupil relative to the reference frame.
- the output signal from the one or more sensors may be correlated with video signals produced by the camera monitoring movement of the eye relative to the reference frame, e.g., to determine the person's level of drowsiness, or psycho- or neuro-physiological cognitive, emotional, and/or alertness-related state of mind.
- a method for controlling a computing device or other electronic or electromechanical device (e.g. radio, television, wheel-chair, telephone, alarm system, audible, visible or tactile alerting system, etc.) using a device worn on a user's head.
- the device may include one or more components, similar to other embodiments described herein, including a camera having at least one objective lens directed towards at least one eye of the user.
- the computer device may include a display including a pointer displayed on the display.
- the display may include a heads-up or heads-down display attached to the device worn on the user's head or otherwise attached or disposed on the user's head, a desk computer monitor that may be disposed in front of the user, a digitally projected image on a screen (e.g., as in a drive or flight simulator), and the like. Movement of the user's eye(s) may be monitored using the camera, and movement of the eye(s) may be correlated relative to the pointer on the display to cause the pointer to follow movement of the eye(s), e.g., similar to a computer mouse.
- the camera may monitor the user's eye(s) for predetermined eye activities, e.g., blinks for predetermined lengths of time, that may correspond to instructions to execute one or more commands identified with the pointer on the display, e.g., similar to “double-clicking” on a computer mouse.
- predetermined eye activities e.g., blinks for predetermined lengths of time
- the camera may monitor the user's eye(s) for predetermined eye activities, e.g., blinks for predetermined lengths of time, that may correspond to instructions to execute one or more commands identified with the pointer on the display, e.g., similar to “double-clicking” on a computer mouse.

- EMG electromyographic
- actigraphic data i.e. body movement, position
- PSG sleep polysomnographic
- EEG electroencephalographic
- the stream of data may be integrated with controllers that monitor automobile or mechanical functions (e.g. vehicle speed, acceleration, braking functions, torque, sway or tilt, engine or motor speed, etc.) to make intelligent decisions regarding slowing down or speeding up the vehicle depending upon road and/or vehicle conditions, as well as functions relating to the state of consciousness, wakefulness, attentiveness, and/or real time performance vigilance responses of the driver or machine operator.

- the processor 158 may then control, scroll, or select items from computer software programs, operate a printer, or other peripheral device (e.g., selecting a font, paragraph, tab or other symbol operator, selecting commands, such as “edit,” “find,” “format,” “insert,” “help,” or controlling CD-ROM or disc drive operations, and/or other Windows and non-Windows functions).
- a printer or other peripheral device (e.g., selecting a font, paragraph, tab or other symbol operator, selecting commands, such as “edit,” “find,” “format,” “insert,” “help,” or controlling CD-ROM or disc drive operations, and/or other Windows and non-Windows functions).

- the intensity and/or frequency of the emitter 32 and/or the threshold sensitivity of the sensor 33 or other focus may then be adjusted (e.g. manually or automatically using self-adjusting features).
- FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate an open eye condition, in which a ray of light 340 produced by the emitter 32 strikes the surface of the eye 300 itself and consequently is scattered, as shown by the rays 350 .
- the resulting light intensity detected by the sensor 33 is relatively low, i.e., the sensor 33 may not receive any substantial return signal.
- the eye 300 is shown with the eyelid 302 closed as may occur during normal blinks, moments of drowsiness, intentional blinks, or other eyelid movement. Because the light 340 strikes the eyelid 302 , it is substantially reflected back to the sensor 33 , as shown by the ray 360 , resulting in a relatively high light intensity being detected by the sensor 33 . Alternatively, as shown in 7 C, the beam of light 340 may be broken or cut by the eyelid 302 when the eye 300 is closed.
- the sensor 33 consequently produces a light intensity signal that indicates when the eye 300 is open or closed, i.e., corresponding to the time during which reflected light is not detected or detected, respectively, by the sensor 33 .
- the intensity of the infrared light reflected from the surface of the eyelid is not substantially affected by skin pigmentation. If it is desired to adjust the intensity of light reflected from the eyelid, foil, glitter, reflective moisturizer creams and the like may be applied to increase reflectivity, or black eye liner, absorptive or deflective creams and the like may be applied to reduce reflectivity.
- the light intensity detected by the sensor 33 results in an output signal 142 including a series of time-dependent light intensity signals (as shown, for example, in FIG. 12B ).
- the output signal 142 is received by the CPU 140 coupled to the sensor 33 , which compares the length of time of each light intensity signal 142 , for example, corresponding to a closed eye condition, with a predetermined threshold.
- the timer circuitry 146 may provide a threshold time to the CPU 140 for distinguishing normal blinks from intentional and/or other unintentional eyelid movement, which the CPU 140 may then filter out of the output signal 142 .
- the CPU 140 then produces a stream of data 144 that may be used for voluntary and/or involuntary communication.
- the detection device 30 may be used to detect impending drowsiness or “micro-sleeps” (i.e., sleep intrusions into wakefulness lasting a few seconds) of a user, with the processing box 130 triggering a warning to alert the user, others in his or her presence, or monitoring equipment of the onset of drowsiness.
- the threshold of the timer circuitry 146 may be adjusted such that the CPU 140 detects relatively long periods of eye closure, as may occur when a person is falling asleep.
- the threshold may be set at a time ranging from close to zero seconds up to several seconds, e.g., between about two and three hundred milliseconds (200-300 ms), or, in another embodiment, about two hundred fifty milliseconds (250 ms), e.g., to distinguish normal blinks from drowsiness-induced eyelid movement.

- the CPU 140 When the CPU 140 detects the presence of particular eyelid movement, such as an extensive period of eye closure, which may occur, for example, during an epileptic seizure, a syncopal episode, a narcoleptic episode, or when dozing off while driving or working, the CPU 140 may produce an output signal which activates an alarm.

- the processor may prepare the video signals from the camera 922 for display on a monitor, similar to the images shown in FIGS. 20A and 20B , thereby allowing the user to be monitored by third parties, e.g., medical professionals, supervisors or other co-workers, and the like. Simultaneously, other parameters may be displayed, either on a single monitor or on separate displays, similar to other embodiments described elsewhere herein.
- the processor may superimpose or otherwise simultaneously display video signals of the user's eyes and/or exocamera images, alone or in conjunction with the other sensed parameters, to allow a physician or other individual to monitor and personally correlate these parameters to the user's behavior.
- the processor may automatically process the signals to monitor or study the user's behavior.
- the processor may use the output signals to monitor various parameters related to eye movement, such as eye blink duration (EBD), eye blink frequency, eye blink velocity, eye blink acceleration, interblink duration (IBD), PERCLOS, PEROP (percentage eyelid is open), and the like.
- the video signals from the camera 922 may be processed to continuously or discontinuously and/or sequentially monitor single or multiple eye parameters, in any combination or pattern of acquisition, such as pupillary size, relative location, eye tracking movement, eye gaze distance, and the like, as described elsewhere herein.
- the apparatus 910 and/or system may monitor one or more oculometrics or other parameters, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,542,081, incorporated by reference herein.
- the system may include a processor communicating with the camera 922 for processing the video signals and identifying a pupil of the eye from the video signals.
- a processor communicating with the camera 922 for processing the video signals and identifying a pupil of the eye from the video signals.
- the processor may be able to identify the edges, and consequently the circumference, diameter, and/or cross-sectional area of the pupil.
- a display may be coupled to the processor for displaying video images of the eye from the video signals processed by the processor.
- a processor may superimpose a graphic on the display, e.g., onto the video images to facilitate identifying and/or monitoring the pupil 301 of an eye 300 .
- the processor may approximate this border, and create a graphic halo, ellipse, or other graphic 306 that may be superimposed on the image data of one or both eyes (only one eye 300 shown in FIGS. 21A-21C for simplicity). An observer may use this graphic 306 to facilitate monitoring the user of the apparatus 910 .
- the processor may automatically analyze the information regarding the size and/or shape of the pupil 301 (or the graphic 306 ), thereby correlating the video signals to determine the person's level of drowsiness or other physical and/or mental condition.
- This analysis may include monitoring the relative location of the pupil, a size of the pupil, and/or an eccentricity of the pupil, e.g., over time.
- the processor may monitor the diameter of the pupil 300 over time, which may displayed in chart form, e.g., as shown in FIG. 1 SE, stored in memory as a function of time, and/or superimposed on images of the eye, e.g., in real time.
- FIG. 21A may show the pupil 301 in a relaxed state under ambient conditions, e.g., corresponding to graphic 306 having a diameter “d 1 .”
- FIG. 21B if the user blinks or closes the eye 300 , the pupil 301 may dilate, such that the pupil 301 is initially dilated when the eye 300 is reopened, as represented by graphic 306 having a diameter “d 2 .”
- the processor may compare changes in diameter of the graphic 306 or the pupil 301 itself to determine the delay for the pupil 301 to return to the diameter “d 1 ” after a blink or other eye closure.
- This delay or loss of reactivity to visible or invisible light flashes may at least partially indicate a level of drowsiness, a level of impairment, e.g., intoxication, and/or the onset of a medical event, including lethal or terminal events such as brain damage or brain death due to hypoxemia, hypoglycemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, toxins, poisons, and the like.
- the processor may determine the approximate eccentricity of the pupil, e.g., as it is partially covered by the eyelid 302 .
- the halo 306 superimposed on the images may adopt an elliptical shape corresponding to a width “w” and height “h” of the exposed portion of the pupil 301 .
- the height “h” may be related to the diameter “d 1 ,” i.e., the ratio of the height “h” to diameter “d 1 ” may be equal to or less than one (h/d 1 ⁇ 1), as an indicator of the degree that the eyelid 302 covers the pupil 301 . For example, this ratio may reduce from one to zero once the pupil 301 is completely covered by the eyelid 302 .
- the width “w” may also be related to the diameter “d 1 ” (w//d 1 ⁇ 1), as an indicator of the degree that the eyelid 302 covers the pupil 301 , e.g., as the eyelid 302 begins to cover more than half of the pupil 301 .
- a ratio of the height and width (h/w ⁇ 1) may relate information on eccentricity of the pupil 301 , e.g., based upon coverage by the eyelid 302 .
- Such parameters may be analyzed individually, collectively, and/or along with other oculometric and/or physiological parameters to monitor, analyze and/or predict future behavior of the user. The data may be compared with empirical or other data retained or accessed by the processor to provide information regarding the user's condition, e.g., a COFI value, as described elsewhere herein.
- a warning may be provided to the user and/or to one or more third persons, similar to other embodiments described herein. Such methods may also be useful to determine whether the user is being affected by drugs, alcohol, and/or medical conditions, as explained elsewhere herein.
- an apparatus or system may test the user's pupillary response. Such a test may confirm that a patient is active, i.e., not asleep, or even deceased, while wearing the apparatus. For example, if a light source is flashed for a predetermined duration and/or pulse frequency at the user's eye, the user's pupil may dilate briefly from its relaxed state (based upon ambient lighting), and then constrict back to the relaxed state within a predictable period of time.
- FIG. 22A an exemplary method is shown for testing the vigilance of a user of any of the apparatus and systems described herein.
- a user may wear the apparatus 810 shown in FIG. 18 monitoring one or both of the user's eyes, as described further above.
- base or parameters of the user's eye(s) may be determined under a related state. For example, the relaxed diameter of the pupil may be measured or otherwise monitored under ambient conditions.
- one or more pulses of light may be emitted towards the eye(s), which may cause the eye(s) to dilate and/or constrict from the relaxed state, e.g., at substantially the same frequency as the frequency of pulsed light flashes.
- one or more emitters on the apparatus 810 may be activated in a predetermined sequence to cause the eye(s) to dilate.
- the eye(s) of the user may be monitored, e.g., subconsciously or unconsciously with the camera 830 or sensors 822 , to determine the reaction time of the eye to return to the relaxed state. The reaction time may be compared to an empirical database or other data to confirm that the user is conscious, awake, and/or alive. If desired, steps 2220 and 2230 may be repeated one or more times to confirm the reaction time and/or provide an average reaction time, if desired, e.g., to avoid false negative determinations.
- the pupil may still react to flashes of light in this manner.
- Infrared light is that it may not distract or bother the user, since the user will not consciously observe the light. Yet, the pupil may still react to such flashes sufficiently that a system monitoring the eye may identify when the pupil dilates and constricts in response to such flashes.
- the pulse rate should be longer than the time the pupil takes to naturally return to its relaxed state after dilating in response to a flash of light, e.g., at least between about fifty and one hundred milliseconds (50-100 ms).
- pulses of light e.g., near-infrared light (having wavelengths between about 640-700 nanometers) may be directed at the user's eye(s).
- the system may detect rhythmic fluctuations in pupillary response.
- Such responses may result from a primitive oculometric response, possibly relating to night vision, e.g., “seeing” in the dark or sensing infrared light sources in the dark.
- pupillary response testing may also be used to identify false positives, e.g., when a user has died, yet the system fails to detect any eye closure and/or movement. Similarly, pupillary response testing may also be able to determine whether a user is asleep or unconscious. In addition, pupillary response testing may be used to determine whether a user is under the influence of alcohol, drugs, and the like, which may affect the rate at which the pupil constricts back to its relaxed state after dilating in response to flashes of light. In addition or alternatively, pupillary response testing may also be used to determine the blood concentration or amount of drug or alcohol in the user's body depending on correlation between oculometric measures and corresponding scientifically-determined blood levels.
- FIG. 22B another method for testing threshold vigilance is shown.
- This method generally involves providing stimuli instructing the user to deliberately move their eye(s) in a desired manner, at step 2240 , and monitoring the eye at step 2250 , e.g., for deliberate movement confirming that the user has followed the instructions and moved their eye(s) in the desired manner.
- Any of the apparatus described herein may include one or more stimulus devices, e.g., speakers, lights, vibratory or other tactile devices. Alternatively, such devices may be provided remotely from the user, e.g., on a dashboard of a vehicle, a video display, and the like.
- a user may be instructed to close their eye(s) for a predetermined time if a visible light on the apparatus is activated. Once the light is activated, the system may monitor the eye(s) to confirm that the user responds within a predetermined time frame and/or in a predetermined manner (e.g., one or more blinks in a predetermined sequence).
- other stimuli may be provided instead of light flashes, such as visible instructions on a display (on or separate from the apparatus), audible signals (e.g., verbal commands from a speaker on or near the device), tactile signals, and the like.
- the user may be instructed to perform a series of actions, e.g., looking up or down, left or right, blinking in a desired sequence, closing their eye until instructed, following a pointer on a display, and the like.
- a series of actions e.g., looking up or down, left or right, blinking in a desired sequence, closing their eye until instructed, following a pointer on a display, and the like.
- Such testing may be useful to confirm, for example, whether a test subject is awake, aware, and/or alert during a series of tests or while performing various activities.
- apparatus and systems may be used to control a computer system, e.g., similar to a computer mouse, joystick, and the like.
- the camera(s) 830 may be used to monitor the location of the user's pupil(s) to direct and/or activate a mouse pointer on a computer screen or other display.
- a processor receiving the image data from the camera 922 may analyze the image data to determine the relative location of the pupil(s) within the active area 942 of the detector 940 .
- one or more displays may be fixed relative to the frame 812 disposed in front of or within the field of view of one or both of the user's eyes.
- a flat panel LCD or other display may be mounted to the frame 812 in place of lenses.
- Such an apparatus may be used for simulations, e.g., within a medical or other research facility, for recreational use, e.g., as a video game console, and the like.
- the apparatus 910 shown in FIG. 18A may be used that includes a fiberoptic bundle 924 for imaging one or both eyes of the user.
- the apparatus may also carry one or more exocameras, e.g., disposed adjacent one or both eyes of the user that may be oriented outwardly along the user's forward view.
- it may be desirable to initialize a system including such an apparatus, i.e., establish a reference frame, such as a base or reference location, a reference frame with orthogonal components, and the like.
- the user may be instructed to look at a pointer or other predetermined location on the display, thereby maintaining the user's eye(s), and consequently the user's pupil(s) substantially stationary.
- the processor may analyze the image data from the camera 830 while the user's eye(s) are substantially stationary, e.g., to determine the location of the pupil on the images that corresponds to the reference point or “base location.”
- the pointer or base location may be located substantially straight ahead of the user's pupil.
- the user may be instructed to look sequentially at two or more identified locations on the display, thereby providing a scale for relative movement of the user's eye.
- the user may be free to move their eye(s), e.g., left and right, up and down, e.g., relative to the pointer and/or the rest of the display.
- the system may monitor such movement of the eye, i.e., the processor may analyze the image data to determine the relative location of the user's pupil(s) from the base location(s). For example, if the user moves his/her eye(s) up and right from the base location, i.e., up and right relative to the pointer on the computer screen, the processor may determine this movement.
- the processor may move the pointer up and right, i.e., thereby tracking the user's gaze.
- the processor may stop the pointer once it arrives at the location where the user is currently looking on the display.
- the user may be able to execute a command once the pointer has moved to a desired location on the display, e.g., similar to activating a button on a mouse.
- the processor may monitor the image data for a signal from the user, e.g., one or more purposeful blinks in a predetermined sequence. This may be as simple as a single blink of a predetermined duration, e.g., several seconds long, to a more complicated series of blinks, e.g., including one or both of the user's eyes.
- the signal may be a predetermined period with no blinks, e.g., three, five, or more seconds long.
- the processor may activate the command. For example, the user may stop moving their eye(s) when it reaches an icon, word command, and the like on the display, and the processor may move the point until it overlies or otherwise is located at the icon or command. The user may then blink or act, as explained above, similar to a “double-click” of a button on a computer mouse, thereby instructing the processor to complete the selected command or communicate the selected command to a desired destination.
- the selected command may result in a computer program being executed, or a piece of equipment or other device being activated, deactivated, or otherwise controlled in a desired manner.
- the system may be used to complete a variety of tasks, from controlling a computer device coupled to the processor and/or display, to turning on or off a light switch or vehicle.
- Such apparatus and/or systems may thereby provide methods for using a computer hands-free, i.e., using only movement of the user's eye(s).
- the system may be used to operate a vehicle, such as a helicopter, jet, or other aircraft, e.g., to activate or otherwise control weapons, navigational, or other onboard systems.
- a vehicle such as a helicopter, jet, or other aircraft
- the system may be used in a video game or other simulation, e.g., to enhance virtual reality immersion.
- the system may allow a user to quickly navigate through multiple menus, scenes, or other activities, while leaving the user's hands free to perform other functions, e.g., perform other activities in addition or simultaneously with eye-controlled functions, which may allow more and/or more complicated tasks at the same time.
- one or more exocameras may be used to enhance and/or otherwise facilitate tracking eye movement relative to the pointer on the display.
- an exocamera may be provided adjacent at least one eye, e.g., at a predetermined distance or other relationship from the eye, that is oriented towards the display.
- the exocamera may provide images of the display, e.g., showing movement of the pointer in real time that may synchronized with movement of the eye monitored with the endocamera.
- the processor may relate this data using triangulation or other algorithms to enhance accuracy of tracking the pointer with eye movement. This may ensure the accuracy that, when the user intends to execute a command by blinking with the pointer on a command, the intended command is actually selected, e.g., when the display shows multiple available commands.
- the processor may analyze data from the endocameras and exocameras to correlate movement of the eye(s) relative to images on the display to study a variety of oculometric parameters, such as slow rolling eye movement, poor eye fixation and/or tracking, wandering gaze, increased eye blinking, hypnotic staring, prolonged eyelid droops or blinking, slow velocity eyelid opening and closing, startled eyelid opening velocities, long-term pupillary constrictive changes, unstable pupil diameters, obscured visual-evoked pupil reactions, and/or other parameters discussed elsewhere herein.
- These procedures may be used to study an individual's responsive faced with various environmental, alcohol or drug-induced, and/or other conditions.
- an apparatus 2410 may be provided for transcutaneously lighting an eye 300 of a user wearing the apparatus 2410 .
- the apparatus 2410 may be generally similar to any of the embodiments described herein, such as the frame 812 shown in FIG. 13 .
- the apparatus 2410 may include one or more emitters or other light source(s) 2422 that contact the user's head 308 , e.g., the user's temple(s) adjacent one or both eyes 300 (one shown for simplicity).
- the apparatus 2410 may include one or more sensors, such as fiberoptic bundle 2430 , e.g., terminating in a lens 2434 for acquiring images of the user's eye 300 .
- an infrared emitter 2422 may be fixedly or adjustably mounted on one or both ear pieces 2422 of a frame 2412 such that the emitter 2422 contacts and transmits light towards the user's skin.
- the emitter 2422 may include a plurality of LEDs, which may be emit collimated, non-coherent (non-laser) infrared light.
- the emitter 2422 may be oriented generally towards the eye 300 such that light from the emitter 2422 may travel through or along the user's head 308 into the eye 300 , as represented by dashed arrows 2450 .
- skin and other tissue may be at least translucent to certain frequencies of light, such as infrared light.
- at least some of the light from the emitter(s) 2422 may transmit transcutaneously along or through the user's skin and/or other tissue until at least some of the light enters the eye 300 .
- the light may reflect off of the retina (not shown) within the eye 300 , such that at least some of the light escapes out of the pupil 301 , as represented by arrows 2452 .
- the lens 2434 and fiberoptic bundle 2430 may relay images of the eye to a detector (not shown), similar to other embodiments described herein, which may identify the pupil 301 as a bright spot on the images due to the light 2452 .
- a processor or other device coupled to the detector may monitor the pupil 301 , such as its relative location on the images, size, and/or shape, similar to other embodiments described herein, e.g., using the “white pupil” or “dark pupil” techniques described elsewhere herein.
- the transcutaneous light may illuminate the entire eye 300 , especially the retina, which may be observed from in front of the user's face, e.g., as a dimmer sphere or other shape with the pupil 301 showing as a bright spot surrounded by the dimmer shape.
- This embodiment may have the advantage that one or more emitters do not have be positioned in front of the user's eye, which may partially obstruct or distract the user's field of view. Furthermore, because this system uses infrared sensing cameras and/or detectors that operated independently of the angle of incident infrared light, this embodiment may eliminate technical difficulties arising out of a loss of proper orientation of emitters to detectors. In addition, without emitter(s) in front of the eye, glint or other reflections off of the eye may be eliminated, which may facilitate analyzing the image data.
- Appendices A and B of provisional application Ser. No. 60/559,135, incorporated by reference herein, provide additional information on possible structural features, and/or methods for using the apparatus and systems described herein.
- the entire disclosures of Appendices A and B are expressly incorporated herein by reference.
