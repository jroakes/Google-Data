For example, the reply content may be automatically included in the reply and/or suggested for inclusion in the reply.
Description
Description of the division
The application belongs to a divisional application of Chinese patent application No.201680081434.6 with the application date of 2016, 12 and 27.
Technical Field
The present application relates to a method and apparatus for determining reply content for inclusion in a reply to an electronic communication by a user based on characteristics of the electronic communication and calendar data of the user.
Background
Users are often overwhelmed with electronic communications such as email, SMS communications, and social network communications. Many electronic communications sent to users involve events such as business meetings, parties, restaurant dinner, parties with friends, and so forth. Some electronic communications sent to the user and specifically related to the event solicit replies from the user or otherwise include information to which the user may wish to reply. For example, "Are you available for a call tomorrow at12:00? (can you get the phone at 12:00. An email including "A few of us are going to Restaurant A after work if anybody is interested (if one is interested, some of us goes to restaurant a after work) may not explicitly solicit a reply, but the recipient who received the email may still want to reply to the email to confirm that the recipient also goes to restaurant a after work or will not be able to participate. The recipient of the electronic communication associated with the event must formulate a reply to the electronic communication using a user interface input device (e.g., virtual keyboard, microphone) and sometimes need to refer to a calendar or other calendar data to determine which reply is appropriate.
Disclosure of Invention
Some embodiments of the present description generally relate to methods and apparatus related to calendar data (e.g., an electronic calendar) of a recipient of an electronic communication utilizing one or more features of the electronic communication to determine reply content to be included within the recipient's reply to the electronic communication. The determined reply content to be included in the reply may be provided via one or more user interface output devices of the recipient's computing device (e.g., the reply content may be automatically provided in the reply or suggested to be included in the reply).
Some of these embodiments relate to determining one or more n-grams suitable for inclusion in a reply to an electronic communication based on characteristics of the electronic communication sent to a user and based on calendar data of the user, and providing the determined n-grams for inclusion in the user's reply to the electronic communication.
As one example, suppose an email is sent to a user that includes "Want to grab dinner this Friday at 7:00? (want to eat dinner five 7:00 in this week. Embodiments of the methods and apparatus described herein may be used to determine one or more n-grams for inclusion in a user's reply to an email, where the n-grams are customized with respect to the email and the user's calendar data. For example, if the user's calendar data indicates that the user is busy during and/or near friday 7:00, it may be determined to provide "sorry, can't make it," and/or other "declining responses" to include in the reply, while "sound good," I'll be it, "and/or other" confirmatory responses "may not be determined to be included in the reply, or may be determined to suggest to be included in the reply in a less noticeable manner than the one or more rejection responses. On the other hand, if the user's calendar data indicates that the user is available during and/or near friday 7:00, it may be determined to provide one or more confirmation responses for inclusion in the reply, while one or more rejection responses may not be determined to be included in the reply, or may be determined to be suggested for inclusion in the reply in a less noticeable manner than the one or more confirmation responses.
As another example, suppose that a transmission to a user includes "Interested in dinner on Friday? (interesting for friday dinner. Embodiments of the methods and apparatus described herein may be used to determine one or more n-grams to include in a reply, where the n-grams are customized with respect to the email and the user's calendar data. For example, if the user's calendar data indicates that the user is available during one or more "evening" times on friday, then a general confirmation reply may be replaced or added, suggesting n-grams including one or more of those times (e.g., "sound good, how much about 7: 30.
In some implementations, the reply content may additionally and/or alternatively include a calendar invitation for an event referenced in the electronic communication or include an "availability" poll that is sent to the sender and/or other recipients of the electronic communication to determine a preferred time/date of the event. For example, a calendar entry for a user may be automatically created or suggested based on an electronic communication sent to the user, and a corresponding calendar invitation may be generated and automatically included (or suggested to be included) in the user's reply to the electronic communication. The invitation may be sent to the sender of the communication and/or to other recipients of the communication. As another example, where the electronic communication includes "we need to have a meeting this week, let me know what time works best for everyone (we need to hold a meeting this week, let me know what time is most appropriate for everyone)", calendar data for one or more recipients can be used to generate "candidate dates/times" and provide availability polls to the sender of the electronic communication and other recipients of the communication to determine one or more preferred dates/times from the candidate. A further reply may optionally be generated, which is an invitation to a preferred date/time.
In various implementations, one or more user interface indications (e.g., graphical, audible) of the determined reply content (e.g., text reply content, calendar invitation reply content, and/or availability poll reply content) may be presented via one or more user interface output devices of the user's computing device that generated the reply, and when the user inputs one of the selection indications via the user interface, the corresponding reply content may be included in the reply. For example, in the case where the selected reply content is n-gram, it may be included in the body of the reply. As another example, in the event that the selected reply content is a calendar invitation, the invitation may be appended to the reply and/or a connection to the invitation may be included in the body of the reply. In some implementations, the determined reply content to be included in the reply may be presented for inclusion in the reply before the user has provided any text content of the reply and/or before the user has provided any other content of the reply.
In some implementations, output provided by a trained machine learning system can be utilized to determine reply content to be provided for inclusion in a user's reply to an electronic communication. The trained machine learning system may provide an output in response to receiving an input comprising one or more message features of the electronic communication and, optionally, one or more user availability features based on calendar data of the user. For example, the machine learning system may be trained to receive as input one or more message features of the "original message" and optionally one or more features of the recipient's calendar data and to provide as output at least one feature related to the reply content. The trained machine learning system output may be used to determine which reply content to provide, whether to provide reply content, and/or how to provide reply content. For example, a trained machine learning system may provide as output a likelihood that a reply to an electronic communication will include a calendar invitation as reply content. For example, such output may be utilized to determine whether the calendar invitation is provided as reply content and/or how prominently the calendar invitation is suggested to be included to provide the calendar invitation as reply content. Also, for example, the trained machine learning system may provide as output one or more specific n-grams and/or one or more indicators of n-grams (e.g., semantic categories of n-grams), optionally with associated scores. For example, such output may be utilized to determine which n-grams to provide as reply content and/or the prominence of the n-grams provided at the time of presentation.
Some embodiments generally relate to analyzing a corpus of past electronic communications to determine relationships between: (1) One or more message characteristics of the "original" message and optionally one or more characteristics related to the recipient's calendar data, and (2) reply content associated with a "reply" message that the recipient replies to the original message. For example, the corpus may be analyzed to determine relationships between message features of original messages and the likelihood that replies to the original messages with those message features include calendar invitations and/or links to calendar invitations. In addition, for example, the corpus may be analyzed to determine relationships between message features of the original message paired with features of calendar data about the recipient and reply content included in replies to messages having those message features by recipients of the calendar data having those features. As yet another example, the corpus may be analyzed to determine that an original message that includes an event and is sent to a recipient with calendar data indicating a conflict with the event may result in a reply message (e.g., "sorry, can't make it", "thanks for the invite, but I have a conflict (thank invitation, but i have a conflict)") that includes a "reject" text response. As yet another example, a corpus may be analyzed to determine that an original message that includes an event with a date but no particular time and is sent to a recipient with calendar data indicating the availability of the date may result in a reply message that includes a reply message suggesting one or more times available to the recipient during that time (e.g., "sound good. How good.
In some implementations, determining relationships between one or more original message features of an original message of an electronic communication and one or more features optionally related to calendar data and reply content associated with replies to those original messages may be accomplished by generating appropriate training examples and training the machine learning system based on those training examples. The machine learning system may be trained to receive as input one or more message characteristics of the electronic communication and optionally one or more characteristics of the recipient's calendar data and to provide as output at least one characteristic related to the reply content, such as one of the characteristics described above.
For example, in some implementations, training examples may be generated to train a machine learning system to determine a likelihood that a reply to an original message will include an invitation, a poll, and/or a link to the invitation and/or the poll. For example, training examples may be generated, each having an output parameter indicating whether an invitation or a link to an invitation is included in a reply message, and one or more input parameters based on an original message of a corresponding one of the electronic communications to which the reply message is responsive and optionally based on one or more characteristics of calendar data of the user that generated the reply message and that are related in time to an event of the original message. For example, the first training example may include as output parameters an indication of "invite included" and include as input parameters all or part of the original text of the original message (and optionally notes associated with the original text) of the message including the corresponding first electronic communication of the invite in the reply message and one or more features of the calendar data of the user generating the reply message and related in time to the event in the first electronic communication. The second training example may include an indication of "invite not included" as an output parameter; and as input parameters all or part of the original text of the corresponding original message (and optionally the annotation associated with the text) of the second electronic communication that does not include the invitation in the reply message and one or more features of the calendar data of the user that generated the reply message and that are temporally related to the event in the second electronic communication. Additional training examples may be similarly generated.
As another example, in some implementations, training examples may be generated to train a machine learning system to determine one or more characteristics of text reply content to include in a reply to an original message. Characteristics of The text reply content may be defined with various levels of granularity, such as a particular n-gram (e.g., "Thanks, but not yet available"), a category of text replies (e.g., "confirm reply," reject reply, "" tentative reply, "" acknowledge reply suggesting available time, "" tentative reply suggesting available time "), and/or a particular n-gram paired with an n-gram category (e.g.," The [ Event Type ] sound like fun, but I have a conflict ([ Event Type ] Sounds interesting but I have conflicts) "," sound like fun, but I have [ title of conflicting schedule entry ] sound tha (sound interesting but I have The title of a conflicting schedule entry) during that time). For example, the first training example may include: an indication of a "confirmation reply" as an output parameter; and including in the reply message as input parameters all or part of the original text (and optionally the annotation associated with the text) of the corresponding original message of the first electronic communication confirming the reply and one or more characteristics of calendar data of the user generating the reply message and temporally related to the event in the first electronic communication. The second training example may include an indication of a "refusal reply" as the output parameter and as the input parameter all or a portion of the original text of the original message (and optionally an annotation associated with the text) of the corresponding second electronic communication that includes the refusal reply and one or more characteristics of the calendar data of the user that generated the reply message and that are related in time to the event in the second communication. Additional training examples may be similarly generated.
Although a number of examples of message features are provided above with respect to n-grams, a variety of additional or alternative message features may be used. The one or more additional and/or alternative message features include, for example: co-occurrence of two or more n-elements (optionally occurring in a particular order, in a certain positional relationship, and/or within a particular distance of each other); processing features of tags (e.g., parts of speech, named entities, tones) based on one or more natural languages; based on features of text that appear specifically in the topic, the first sentence, the last sentence, or other portions of the message; characteristics based on the time of sending the email, the date on which the email was sent, the number of recipients, etc. As one example, the at least one message characteristic may be: the occurrence of a particular n-element in the subject of the original message and the occurrence of another particular n-element in the body of the original message.
In some implementations, a computer-implemented method performed by at least one computing device may be provided that includes identifying an electronic communication sent to a user and determining a time indication associated with an event of the electronic communication. The time indication identifies at least a time or date associated with the event. The method further comprises the steps of: searching schedule data of the user based on the time indication; determining availability of the user to the event based on the search; and determining one or more additional message characteristics of the electronic communication. An additional message feature is the addition of the time indication. The method further comprises the steps of: text reply content is generated based on the availability of the user and based on one or more additional message features. The text reply content includes one or more n-elements not included in the electronic communication. The method also includes providing the text reply content for inclusion in a reply electronic communication that is a reply to the electronic communication by the user.
Other embodiments of the method and techniques disclosed herein may each optionally include one or more of the following features.
In some implementations, searching the user's calendar data is independent of any text input provided via the user's computing device when generating the reply electronic communication, where the user's computing device is one of the computing devices or an addition to the computing device. In some of those embodiments, providing text reply content to be included in the reply electronic communication is independent of any text input provided via the computing device at the time the reply electronic communication is generated.
In some implementations, determining the time indication associated with the event of the electronic communication includes determining the time indication based on one or more time n-grams of the electronic communication. In some of those embodiments, the method further comprises: determining one or more event n-elements of the electronic communication, each event n-element referencing a location of an event or a type of event; and determining the temporal n-ary based on a syntactic relationship between the temporal n-ary and the event n-ary in the electronic communication.
In some implementations, generating the text reply content includes generating a first reply n-element and generating a separate second reply n-element; providing reply content to be included in the reply electronic communication includes: both the first reply n-element and the second reply n-element are provided for inclusion in a reply to the electronic communication. In some of those embodiments, the method further comprises: ranking the first reply n-gram and the second reply n-gram relative to each other; and determining prominence for providing the first reply n-gram and the second reply n-gram based on the ranking.

The electronic communication system 110, reply content system 120, and trained machine learning system 135 each include one or more memories for storing data and software applications, one or more processors for accessing data and executing applications, and other components that facilitate communication over a network. In some implementations, the electronic communication system 110, reply content system 120, and trained machine learning system 135 may include one or more components of the example computing device of fig. 9. Operations performed by the electronic communication system 110, the reply content system 120, and the trained machine learning system 135 may be distributed across multiple computing devices. In some implementations, one or more aspects of the electronic communication system 110, the reply content system 120, and/or the trained machine learning system 135 may be combined in a single computing device and/or one or more aspects may be implemented on the client device 106.
In general, in some implementations, the reply content system 120 determines and provides reply content for inclusion in a user's reply to an electronic communication sent to the user and including an event. The electronic communication may be, for example, an electronic communication provided by the client device 106 and/or an electronic communication of the electronic communication database 152 that the user has not replied to. Reply content system 120 may determine reply content based on one or more message characteristics of the electronic communication and based on the availability of the user for the electronic communication event and/or other user calendar data characteristics of the user related to the time and/or date of the event. The availability of the user for the electronic communication event and/or other user calendar data characteristics may be determined by searching the user's calendar data 154 based on the time indication associated with the event (i.e., indicating the date and/or time). For example, the user availability may be determined based on whether the user calendar data indicates that the user has an event already scheduled during or near a date and/or time associated with the event.
In some implementations, the reply content system 120 can provide the determined reply content for inclusion in the reply to the electronic communication independent of any text input provided by the user in generating the reply to the communication and/or independent of any content provided by the user in generating the reply to the communication. In some implementations, the reply content determined and provided by reply content system 120 includes text reply content tailored to the electronic communication and tailored to the user's calendar data. The text reply content determined and provided for the electronic communication may include one or more n-grams as an addition to any n-grams included in the electronic communication itself. In some implementations, the reply content system 120 determines that the electronic communication of its reply content is not itself a structured invitation to an event that may be responded to with a predefined structured response such as "accept", "decline", and/or "tentative".
Calendar data 154 used by reply content system 120 to determine reply content may be provided on one or more non-transitory storage media. In some embodiments, the user's calendar data 154 may be non-publicly accessible, but accessible by the user. For example, calendar data 154 may be accessible only to the user and one or more systems and/or other users authorized by the user. The user's calendar data 154 may indicate events from various sources. For example, the user's events indicated in calendar data 154 may be from one or more electronic calendars maintained by the user, extracted from the user's electronic communications, inferred based on the user's past activity (e.g., repeated location data indicating that the user entered a gym every weekday 6:00), etc. The user's calendar data 154 may be stored in one or more locations, such as one or more cloud-based locations accessible to the user, one or more local storage devices of the user's computing device (e.g., client device 106), one or more local network storage devices accessible to the computing device and/or the user, and so forth. As described herein, in some implementations, the reply content system 120 may determine one or more characteristics of calendar data associated with an event (e.g., availability of the user) by issuing a search for the user, wherein the search includes one or more time search parameters (e.g., time and/or date) derived from electronic communications sent to the user and referencing the event.
The electronic communications database 152 includes one or more storage media that includes all or part of the electronic communications of a plurality of users. In some embodiments, electronic communication system 110 maintains an electronic communication database 152. For example, electronic communication system 110 may include one or more email systems, and electronic communication database 152 may include a plurality of emails sent and/or received via the email systems. As another example, electronic communication system 110 may include one or more social networking systems, and electronic communication database 152 may include a plurality of messages, posts, or other communications sent and/or received via the social networking systems.
As used herein, "electronic communication" or "communication" may refer to an email, text message (e.g., SMS, MMS), instant message, transcribed voice mail, or any other electronic communication sent from a first user to a restricted group of one or more other users. In various embodiments, the electronic communications may include various metadata, and the metadata may optionally be used in one or more of the techniques described herein. For example, an electronic communication such as an email may include an electronic communication address such as one or more sender identifiers (e.g., sender email address), one or more recipient identifiers (e.g., recipient email address, including recipients of carbon copy (cc) and carbon copy (bcc)), a date of transmission, one or more attachments, a subject, and a type of device that transmitted and/or received the electronic communication, among others.
As used herein, "electronic communication" and "communication" will be used to refer to electronic communications that include only original messages and electronic communications that include one or more original messages and that include one or more reply messages, depending on the context. The electronic communication may be a single document, such as an email that includes the original message and the reply message and that may be processed to distinguish the original message from the reply message. Processing the electronic communication to distinguish the original message from the reply message may include one or more computing devices "splitting" the message based on the presence of metadata, message interruption, header information included in the message, references provided around the original message, and so forth. The electronic communication may also be a plurality of documents that map to each other in response to other documents in the plurality of documents based on at least one of the plurality of documents. For example, the electronic communication may include a first email that is an original message received by the user and a second email sent by the user as a reply to the original message, or original and reply SMS messages. For example, the mapping of multiple documents to each other may be performed by electronic communication system 110. For example, the electronic communication system 110 may map a first email to a second email based on a user selecting a "reply" user interface when viewing the first email and then drafting the second email in response to selecting the reply user interface element.
As used herein, the original message is earlier in time than the response reply message, but is not necessarily the first message in electronic communication. For example, the original message may be a first message in electronic communication over time, and the reply message responsive to the original message may be a later (e.g., next in time) message over time. Also, for example, the original message may additionally and/or alternatively be a second, third or fourth message in electronic communication over time, and the reply message responsive to the original message may be a later message in electronic communication over time. Each of the original message and the reply message may include one or more of associated text, metadata, and/or other content (e.g., one or more additional documents, links to one or more documents).
In various implementations, the reply content system 120 may include a message feature engine 122, a search parameter engine 124, a search engine 126, a reply content engine 128, and/or a presentation engine 129. In some implementations, all or aspects of engines 122, 124, 126, 128, and/or 129 may be omitted. In some implementations, all or aspects of engines 122, 124, 126, 128, and/or 129 may be combined. In some implementations, all or aspects of engines 122, 124, 126, 128, and/or 129 may be implemented in a component separate from reply content system 120, such as client device 106 and/or electronic communication system 110.
The description of engines 122, 124, 126, 128, and 129 is provided below with reference to the electronic communications of the user, such as electronic communications provided by client device 106 and/or electronic communications of electronic communications database 152 that the user has not replied to. Although a single electronic communication is referenced in the example for clarity, it should be understood that reply content system 120 may determine reply content for additional electronic communications for the user and/or other users. In some implementations, the reply content system 120 may only process certain electronic communications in whole or in part. For example, electronic communications that have at least a threshold likelihood of being related to an event, as determined by one or more classifiers and/or other machine learning systems alone, may be processed by the responsive content system 120.
The message characteristics engine 122 determines one or more original message characteristics based on the electronic communication sent to the user (i.e., based at least in part on the content of the electronic communication when the content was sent to the user). Various original message characteristics may be determined. For example, the message feature engine 122 may determine one or more n-grams in the electronic communication as a message feature. For example, one or more of the n-grams may be determined based on a term frequency of the n-grams in the electronic communication (i.e., how often the n-grams occur in the electronic communication) and/or an inverse document frequency of the n-grams in the document collection (i.e., how often the n-grams occur in a document collection such as a collection of electronic communications).
Further, for example, one or more of the n-grams may be determined based on the "event n-grams" where the n-grams are locations (e.g., "restaurants," names of particular places, particular addresses) and/or event types (e.g., "dinner," "meeting," "video meeting"). In addition, for example, one or more of the n-grams may be determined based on the time n-grams when the n-grams are the date and/or time of reference (e.g., "today," "thursday," "11:00," "tonight," "morning"). In various embodiments, one or more classifiers and/or other machine learning systems may be utilized to provide an indication of one or more n-grams of the electronic communication that may be time n-grams and/or event n-grams.
Further, for example, one or more of the n-grams may be determined based on their positional proximity to one or more other n-grams and/or syntactic relationship. For example, a temporal n-element, such as an event n-element referencing a location or type of event, may be identified based on its positional proximity and/or syntactic relationship with one or more event n-elements. As yet another example, one or more of the n-grams may be determined based on the part of speech of the n-grams (e.g., "noun"), the type of the n-grams (e.g., "person," "location," or "thing"), or based on the inclusion of the n-grams in a list of potentially relevant n-grams and/or not included in a list of irrelevant n-grams (e.g., deactivated words such as "one," "one," and "the").
Further, for example, the message feature engine 122 may determine the simultaneous occurrence of two or more n-grams in electronic communication as a message feature, e.g., in a particular order (e.g., first n-grams before second n-grams), in a certain positional relationship (e.g., within n terms or characters of each other), and so forth. In addition, for example, the message feature engine 122 may determine: one or more message features (e.g., part of speech, named entity, entity type, tone) based on one or more natural language processing tags or other labels applied to the electronic communication text; based on characteristics of text that appear specifically in the topic, first sentence, last sentence, or other portion of the electronic communication; based on characteristics of metadata of the electronic communication, such as a time of day of the electronic communication being sent, a day of the week the electronic communication was sent, a number of recipients, a type of device sending the electronic communication, and the like.
Further, for example, the message feature engine 122 may determine an embedded vector of one or more features from the entire electronic communication or a subset of the electronic communication (e.g., one or more paragraphs, one or more sentences, one or more words). The features of the embedded vector may include one or more n-grams, tags applied to the one or more n-grams, grammatical features, semantic features, metadata features, and/or other features.
As a specific example, assume that the electronic communication includes a theme with the text "golf trip" and a theme with the text "We need to meet and plan our annual golf trip.how about this Thursday at 6:00? (we need to meet and plan our annual golf travel. How is there 6:00 in this week. The message feature engine 122 may determine that it includes n-elements "trip", "golf trip", "this Thursday", "6:00", "annual", "How the How is and? "while optionally excluding other n-grams. For example, the message feature engine 122 may determine "trip", "golf trip" as a message feature based on that they are event n-grams (event type), may determine "this Thursday" and "6:00" as a message feature based on that they are time n-grams and/or based on that they are in close proximity to event n-grams, may determine "How about" and "? "determined to be a feature of the message, and" annu "may be determined to be an n-gram based on its adjective in the text and/or based on its close positional proximity to the event n-gram.
Message characteristics engine 122 provides the determined message characteristics to search parameters engine 124 and optionally to trained machine learning system 135 and/or reply content engine 128. Message feature engine 122 may provide the same message feature to search parameter engine 124, trained machine learning system 135, and/or reply content engine 128-or the provided message feature may be different.
Search parameter engine 124 generates one or more search parameters for searching calendar data 154 of the user based on one or more of the message characteristics provided by message characteristics engine 122. For example, the message feature engine 122 may provide at least a time n-element and/or an event n-element of the message feature to the search parameter engine 124, and the search parameter engine 124 may generate one or more search parameters based on the time and/or event n-element.
As one example of generating search parameters based on one or more of the message features provided by the message feature engine 122, assume that the message feature engine 122 provides a message feature set comprising n-grams "this Thursday", "6:00", and "golf trip". Search parameter engine 124 may generate a temporal search parameter based on "this Thursday" and "6:00". For example, search parameter engine 124 may convert "this Thursday" to a particular date and use the particular date as a time search parameter. Also, for example, search parameter engine 124 may generate a time range of 5:00-8:00 based on "6:00" and use the time range as a time search parameter. The time range of 5:00-8:00 may provide for a search of the user's calendar data 154 to determine the user's availability one hour before and two hours after the particular time referenced (6:00). The search parameter engine 124 may also optionally generate an additional "negative" search parameter that does not include ' go ' "to prevent the user's availability from being determined to be" busy "if the user's calendar data has indicated an event for electronic communications (e.g., the user may have interacted with the sender prior to receiving the email and the event has been manually added to the user's calendar).
Search engine 126 searches the user's calendar data 154 based on the search parameters determined by search parameter engine 124. In some implementations, searching the calendar data 154 of the user may include searching one or more indexes of the index calendar and/or other calendar data of the user. Search engine 126 identifies whether any entries in the user's calendar data 154 match the search parameters and optionally one or more attributes of those entries. In this way, the search parameters are automatically provided by the search parameter engine, so that the user does not have to provide the search parameters as input, thereby simplifying user interaction.
Based on whether any of the entries match the search parameters and/or one or more attributes of those entries, the search engine 126 determines the availability of the user for the electronic communication event. For example, in the event that no entry of the user's calendar data 154 matches the search parameters, the search engine 126 may determine that the user's availability is "available". Also, for example, where one or more entries of the user's calendar data 154 completely match the search parameters (e.g., one or more entries indicate that the user is busy during a specified entire period of time), the search engine 126 may determine that the user's availability is "unavailable". In some of those cases, the search engine 126 may also include one or more attributes of entries of the user's calendar data 154 that match the search parameters along with the user's availability. For example, the search engine 126 may determine availability of the user that includes an indication of "unavailable" and may include, along with the availability of the user, a title of the item that matches the search parameter and/or a time range for the item that matches the search parameter.
As another example, where one or more entries of the user's calendar data 154 partially match the search parameters (e.g., one or more entries indicate that the user is busy during a portion of a specified period of time), the search engine 126 may determine that the user's availability is "potentially unavailable". In some of those cases, the search engine 126 may also include one or more of the attributes of the items that match the search parameters along with the availability of the user. For example, the search engine 126 may determine availability of the user that includes an indication of "potentially unavailable" and may include, along with the availability of the user, one or more time ranges during which the user is unavailable (e.g., one or more times associated with one or more entries that partially match a specified time period). As yet another example, where an entry of the user's calendar data 154 matches the search parameters entirely but is indicated as a "tentative" or otherwise "flexible" entry, the search engine 126 may determine that the user's availability is "potentially unavailable". In some of these cases, the search engine 126 may also include one or more of the attributes of the items that match the search parameters along with the availability of the user.
In some implementations, the search engine 126 issues multiple searches in the calendar data 154 of the searching user based on the search parameters determined by the search parameter engine 124. For example, assume an electronic communication including "1/1/16from 11:00AM-12:00PM (1 month and 1 day 2016, from 11:00AM-12:00 PM)". In some implementations, search parameter engine 124 may generate search parameters "1/1/16", "11:00AM-12:00PM", and "potentially conflicting" search parameters "10:00AM-11:00AM" and "12:00PM-1:00PM" to check for potential conflicts for any party within a specified period of time. In some of these embodiments, the search engine 126 may issue three separate searches, such as: (1) {"1/1/16","11:00AM-12:00PM "}, (2) {"1/1/16","12:00PM-1:00PM "}, and (3) {"1/1/16","10:00AM-11:00AM "}. If the search engine 126 determines that none of the entries of the user's calendar data 154 matches any searches, the search engine 126 may determine that the user's availability is "available". If the search engine determines that the entry of the user's calendar data 154 matches search (1), then the search engine 126 may determine that the user's availability is "unavailable". If the search engine determines that an entry of the user's calendar data 154 matches search (2) or search (3), but does not match search (1), then the search engine 126 may determine that the user's availability is "potentially unavailable". The search engine enables that the availability of the user can be automatically determined so that the user does not have to interact with various calendar data sources and various applications, such as calendar applications, thereby simplifying user interaction.
The search engine 126 provides an indication of the user's availability of the electronic communication event and optionally an indication of one or more attributes of the schedule entry (if any) that matches the search of the search engine 126 to the reply content engine 128 and/or the trained machine learning system 135. Reply content engine 128 determines reply content that is included in a user's reply to the electronic communication. Reply content may include, for example, one or more text n-grams in response to an electronic communication event, calendar invitations to the event, and/or availability polls sent to senders and/or other recipients of electronic communications to determine a preferred time/date of the event.
In various implementations, reply content engine 128 determines reply content based on one or more message characteristics determined by message characteristics engine 122 and based on availability of users and/or other attributes of calendar data provided by search engine 126. For example, reply content engine 128 may directly utilize message characteristics and/or availability of the user and/or other calendar data in determining the reply content, and/or may utilize output from trained machine learning system 135, where the output is based on the message characteristics and/or availability of the user and/or other calendar data.
As one example, trained machine learning system 135 may be trained to receive as input one or more message features and/or features related to the availability of users and/or other calendar data and to provide as output one or more reply content features that indicate whether reply content and/or content of reply content to be provided should be provided. For example, trained machine learning system 135 may be trained to provide as output one or more particular text n-grams and/or categories of text n-grams based on input of received message features and/or an indication of user availability.
For example, trained machine learning system 135 may receive as input message features and features related to the availability of a user and provide as output one or more particular text n-grams (e.g., "That time works for me (i applicable at that time)") and optionally score those particular text n-grams. The reply content engine 128 may select one or more of the particular text n-grams output to use as the reply content. Reply content engine 128 may optionally select and/or rank particular text n-grams based on optional scores provided by trained machine learning system 135 (e.g., to determine the prominence of those n-grams).
Further, for example, trained machine learning system 135 may receive as input message features and features related to The availability of a user, and provide as output one or more specific n-grams paired with an n-gram category (e.g., "The [ Event Type ] sound like fun, but I have a conflict ([ Event Type ] sound interesting, but i have conflicts)", "sound good. How can be [ available time ]. Reply content engine 128 may determine appropriate text for filling in the n-gram based on one or more message characteristics (e.g., [ Event Type ] may be filled in with "party" based on an Event message characteristic derived from "party" electronic communications). The reply content engine 128 may utilize the filler text as reply content with a particular n-gram. Reply content engine 128 may optionally rank the plurality of filled or otherwise generated n-grams based on optional scores provided by trained machine learning system 135.
As yet another example, trained machine learning system 135 may receive as input message features other than features related to the availability of a user and provide as output one or more textual n-gram categories (e.g., "informal confirmation reply," "informal tentative reply," "informal rejection reply," "confirmation reply suggesting availability time," "tentative reply suggesting availability time"), and optionally scores of those textual n-gram categories. The reply content engine 128 may utilize the availability of the user to select one or more of the reply categories and/or rank the reply categories and determine text content that meets the selected reply category (e.g., previous text replies to the category that were carved out by the user). For example, if the availability of the user is "potentially conflicting," the reply content engine 128 may utilize the availability to determine text content that meets "informal tentative replies" and/or utilize the availability to rank text content that meets the category more prominently than text content that meets other categories.
As another example, trained machine learning system 135 may be trained to provide as output one or more reply content features that indicate whether reply content should be provided based on input of received message features and/or features related to user availability and/or other calendar data.
For example, trained machine learning system 135 may receive as input message characteristics and indications of availability and/or other calendar data of a user and provide as output a likelihood that a reply electronic communication will include a calendar invitation and/or a likelihood that a reply electronic communication will include an availability poll. The reply content engine 128 may determine whether and/or how to include calendar invitations and/or availability polls in the reply content based on the output provided by the trained machine learning system 135. For example, if the output is a likelihood that the reply electronic communication will include a calendar invitation, the reply content engine 128 may determine that the reply electronic communication will be provided for automatic inclusion in the reply if the likelihood meets a threshold, but may require that user interface input be provided prior to providing the calendar invitation for inclusion in the reply if the likelihood does not meet the threshold. Further, for example, reply content engine 128 may: if the likelihood is greater than or equal to X (e.g., x=0.8), determining to provide a calendar invitation to be automatically included in the reply before any user interface input indicating a desired reply is provided; if the likelihood is less than X and greater than or equal to Y (e.g., y=0.5), requesting user interface input requires providing user interface input prior to providing the calendar invitation to include in the reply; and, if the likelihood is less than Y, determining that the calendar invitation should not be provided for inclusion in the reply.
Reply content engine 128 provides presentation engine 129 with data that it determines the reply content that is included in the reply and optionally indicates how it should be included in the reply. The presentation engine 129 provides reply content to be included in a reply electronic communication, which is a reply to an electronic communication by a user.
Providing reply content included in the reply may include, for example: embedding the reply content, providing a link to the reply content, providing a user interface indication of the reply content, and the like. For example, the presentation engine 129 may automatically attach the calendar invitation to the reply and/or automatically incorporate a link to the calendar invitation in the reply. Also, for example, the presentation engine 129 may present one or more user interface indications (e.g., graphical, audible) of the reply content, and when a user generating the reply inputs one of the selection indications via the user interface, the corresponding reply content may be automatically provided in the reply.
In some implementations, the presentation engine 129 provides reply content in generating a reply to the electronic communication independent of any text input and/or other content provided via the user's computing device. In some of those embodiments, the reply content engine 128 determines the reply content before the user even views or otherwise consumes the communication. For example, the reply content system 120 may process the communication prior to the user's view, the reply content engine 128 may determine the reply content to include in the reply to the communication, and attach or otherwise associate the reply content with the electronic communication even before the reply content is viewed by the user (e.g., attach the reply content to an entry of the electronic communication in the electronic communication database 152).
In some implementations, the presentation engine 129 can provide a number of different reply content options for inclusion in the reply. For example, a first n-gram "Sorry, but I have aconflict (Sorry, but i have a conflict)" and a second n-gram "sound good i'll be there (sound good i will be there)" may be provided. In addition, for example, both a first n-gram "sound good i'll be" and calendar invitation may be provided. In some of those embodiments, the plurality of reply content options may be provided based on selectable data (provided by reply content engine 128) that indicates how they should be included in the reply. For example, the presentation prominence of each of the plurality of reply content options may be determined based on the data and an indication of presentation prominence to potentially include a plurality of documents provided in the reply to the electronic communication. Further, for example, where the reply content engine 128 provides an indication of which of the one or more reply content options is most appropriate for inclusion in the reply based on the calendar data, the presentation engine 129 may include a graphical and/or textual representation of such one or more indications for presentation along with the one or more reply content options (e.g., a textual indication of "your calendar selection based" or "your calendar represents a conflict of this event").
In some implementations in which electronic communications are provided by the client device 106 to the reply content system 120, the presentation engine 129 may provide the reply content to the client device 106 for presentation to the user as options included in the reply. In some embodiments in which the electronic communication system 110 provides electronic communications to the reply content system 120 via the electronic communication database 152, the presentation engine 129 may store an association of the reply content with the electronic communications in the electronic communication database 152 and/or other databases. In some implementations, one or more (e.g., all) aspects of the presentation engine 129 can be implemented by the client device 106 and/or the electronic communication system 110.
The presentation engine 129 may also provide display prominence information with the determined reply content that indicates the prominence (e.g., location, size, color) that the selected reply content should be presented for use. As one example, where multiple different reply content options are provided by the presentation engine 129, the presentation engine 129 may provide an indication of the ranking of those multiple reply content options for use in determining the order in which the multiple reply content options should be presented to the user via the user interface output device of the client device 106. The presentation engine 129 may also provide a graphical and/or textual representation for presentation with the reply content indicating that the reply content is determined based on the calendar data (e.g., "your calendar selection based" or "your calendar representation you can attend this event," in some embodiments, the presentation engine 129 only provides one or more identifiers of the reply content and potentially prominence information and/or indicates that the graphical and/or textual representation of the reply content is determined based on the calendar data, and the client device 106 and/or the electronic communication system 110 may generate a display of the selected document based on the provided data, in some embodiments, the presentation engine 129 may additionally provide some or all of the data needed to generate the display.
FIG. 2 illustrates how reply content may be included in a user's reply to an electronic communication based on one or more message characteristics of the electronic communication and based on calendar data of the user. The message characteristics engine 122 determines one or more message characteristics of the electronic communication 152A sent to the user. Electronic communication 152A may be provided by, for example, client device 106 or electronic communication system 110 of fig. 1.
Message feature engine 122 provides one or more of the determined message features to search parameter engine 124 and provides one or more of the determined message features to trained machine learning system 135 and reply content engine 128. The message characteristics provided by the message characteristics engine 122 to the search parameters engine 124, the reply content engine 128, and/or the trained machine learning system 135 may be the same or may be different.
Search parameter engine 124 generates one or more search parameters for searching calendar data 154 of the user based on one or more message characteristics provided by message characteristics engine 122. For example, the message feature engine 122 may provide at least a time n-element and/or an event n-element of the message feature to the search parameter engine 124, and the search parameter engine 124 may generate one or more search parameters based on the time and/or event n-element. In this way, the search parameters are automatically provided such that the user does not have to provide the search parameters as input, thereby simplifying user interaction.
Search engine 126 searches the user's calendar data 154 based on the search parameters determined by search parameter engine 124. Search engine 126 identifies whether any entries in the user's calendar data 154 match the search parameters and optionally one or more attributes of those entries. Based on whether any of the entries match the search parameters and/or one or more attributes of those entries, the search engine 126 determines the availability of the user for the event of the electronic communication.
Search engine 126 provides reply content engine 128 and/or trained machine learning system 135 with: an indication of the availability of the electronic communication event by the user; and optionally one or more attributes of the schedule entry (if any) that match one or more searches of the search engine 126.
The trained machine learning system 135 may be trained to receive as input one or more message features and/or features related to the availability of the user and/or other calendar data and to provide as output one or more reply content features indicating whether reply content and/or the content of the reply content to be provided should be provided. For example, trained machine learning system 135 may be trained to provide as output one or more particular text n-grams and/or categories of text n-grams based on input of received message features and/or an indication of user availability.
Reply content engine 128 determines reply content to include in a user's reply to the electronic communication. Reply content may include, for example, one or more text n-grams responsive to the electronic communication event, calendar invitations to the event, and/or availability polls sent to the sender and/or other recipients of the electronic communication to determine a preferred time/date of the event.
In various implementations, the reply content engine 128 determines the reply content based on the reply content features provided by the trained machine learning system 135, and optionally based on one or more message features provided by the message feature engine 122 and/or based on the availability of the user and/or other attributes of the calendar data provided by the search engine 126.
The presentation engine 129 provides reply content 159 for inclusion in a reply electronic communication that is a reply to the electronic communication by the user. Providing reply content to be included in the reply may include, for example: automatically filling reply content in the reply; a user interface indication of the reply content is provided that, when selected, populates the reply content in the reply, and so on. This has the advantage that parts of the reply message can be automatically generated without user interaction. This results in a reduced amount of input presented to the user when the reply electronic communication is established.
FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating an example method of determining reply content to be included in a reply to an electronic communication by a user based on one or more message characteristics of the electronic communication and based on calendar data of the user. For convenience, the operations of the flowcharts are described with reference to systems performing the operations. The system may include various components of various computer systems. For example, some operations may be performed by one or more components of reply content system 120, such as engines 122, 124, 126, 128, and/or 129. Furthermore, when the operations of the method of fig. 3 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted, or added.
At block 300, the system identifies an electronic communication to send to a user.
At block 302, the system determines a time indication associated with an event of the electronic communication.
At block 304, the system searches for calendar data of the user based on the time indication of block 302.
At block 306, the system determines the availability of the user based on the search of block 304.
At block 306, the system determines one or more additional message characteristics of the electronic communication. Various message features may be utilized, such as text, semantic, and/or syntactic features. For example, the system may determine the message characteristics based on one or more n-grams in the electronic communication, a co-occurrence of two or more n-grams in the electronic communication, characteristics based on one or more n-grams that are specifically occurring in the topic, the first sentence, the last sentence, or other portions of the electronic communication, characteristics based on metadata of the electronic communication, and so forth.
At block 310, the system determines reply content based on the availability of the user of block 306 and based on one or more additional message characteristics of block 308.
At block 312, the system provides reply content for inclusion in a reply electronic communication that is a reply to the electronic communication by the user.
Fig. 4A-4C illustrate example graphical user interfaces for providing reply content for inclusion in replies to electronic communications. The graphical user interfaces of fig. 4A-4C may be presented at the client device 106 based on the reply content determined and provided by the reply content system 120. In some implementations, one or more aspects of the reply content system 120 (e.g., all or more aspects of the presentation engine 129) may be wholly or partially incorporated in the client device 106.
In fig. 4A, the user is viewing the original email 475A that has been sent to the user before the user provides any user interface input to indicate a desire to reply to the original email 475A. Reply content options represented by graphical user interface elements 481A, 482A, and 483A are presented for inclusion in a reply to an email and are included in the reply when a selection is entered via the user interface. For example, user selection of graphical user interface element 481A may automatically present the user with an editable reply email including n-grams "Thanks for the invite, but I have a conflict (thank you for invitations, but i am conflicted)" incorporated in the body of the reply email. Likewise, user selection of the graphical user interface element 482A may automatically present the user with an editable reply email including an n-gram "sound like fun, but not yet done" incorporated into the body of the reply email.
In FIG. 4A, reply content options represented by graphical user interface elements 481A, 482A, and 483A are determined based on original email 475A and based on calendar data of the user to whom original email 475A was sent. In the example of fig. 4A, the user's calendar data includes a pre-existing entry entitled "football game" which is arranged at "tomorrow night" from 6:30-8:00. Based on the calendar data and the original email 475A, the "refusal reply" graphical user interface elements 481A, 482A, and 483A may be appropriately determined for provision to the user.
As one example, one or more message characteristics of the original email 475A may be provided as input to the trained machine learning system 135 of fig. 1, and the trained machine learning system 135 may provide as output an indication that "confirm reply", "tentative reply", and "reject reply" are appropriate responses based on the message characteristics. Reply content engine 128 of fig. 1 may utilize the output and the user's calendar data to determine that "refusing reply" is appropriate. For example, reply content engine 128 may determine that the user is unavailable based on the user's calendar data and, because the user is not available, simply choose to reject the reply or determine that the reject reply should be provided more prominently. The particular rejection replies represented by graphical user interface elements 481A, 482A and 483A may be selected by reply content engine 128 from a database of rejection replies, such as the user's past rejection replies. Note that the rejection reply represented by graphical user interface element 481A includes the title ("server name") of the entry of the calendar data of the user that conflicts with the event of original email 475A. The title may be populated by the reply content engine 128 into the "conflict event" category of one of the refusal replies of the database.
As another example, one or more message features of the original email 475A and the "unavailable" feature of the user's calendar data may be provided as inputs to the trained machine learning system 135 of fig. 1, and the trained machine learning system 135 may provide as outputs "Thanks for the invite, but I have a conflict (thank you invite, but I have a conflict)", "sound like fun, but can't make it (sound interesting, but do not), and" Thanks for the invite, but I have a [ conflicting event title ] (thank you invite, but I have a [ conflict event title ]). The reply content engine 128 of fig. 1 may utilize this output to generate specific rejection replies represented by graphical user interface elements 481A, 482A, and 483A. Note that the "[ conflicting event title ]" category may be populated by the reply content engine 128 with "a server game". In some implementations, graphical and/or textual representations may be presented in conjunction with user interface elements 481A, 482A, and 483A that indicate selection of these elements based on user calendar data (e.g., a textual indication of "your calendar selection" or "conflict of your calendar representation of the event").
In fig. 4B, the user has provided a user interface input (e.g., selecting a "reply" graphical user interface element) to initiate a reply to the original email, and is presented with a reply portion 480B that includes a phantom text "Compose email" indicating to the user that the user can Compose the reply in reply portion 480B. The original email 475B to which the reply is responded to is also shown in fig. 4B for the user to reference in generating the reply.
Graphical user interface elements 481B, 482B, and 483B are presented in fig. 4B for inclusion in a reply to related text n-grams determined based on original email 475B and based on calendar data of the user (e.g., as described above with respect to fig. 4A). Graphical user interface elements 481B, 482B, and 483B are presented before the user provides any text input or other content for a reply. Original email 475B of fig. 4B is identical to original email 475A of fig. 4A, and graphical user interface elements 481B, 482B, and 483B of fig. 4B are identical to graphical user interface elements 481A, 482A, and 483A of fig. 4A. In some implementations, the graphical user interface elements 481B, 482B, and 483B of fig. 4B may be determined as described above with reference to fig. 4A.
In fig. 4C, the user is viewing the original email 475C that has been sent to the user before the user provides any user interface input to indicate a desire to reply to the original email 475C. Original email 475C of fig. 4C is identical to original emails 475A and 475B of fig. 4A and 4B. However, in the example of fig. 4C, the user's calendar data does not include a conflict of "tomorrow right".
In FIG. 4C, reply content options represented by graphical user interface elements 481C, 482C, 483C, 484C, and 485C are determined based on original email 475C and based on the user's calendar data. Based on the calendar data and the original email 475C, the "confirmation reply with time request" graphical user interface elements 481A and 482A may be determined to be suitable for providing to the user and may be determined to be suitable for providing more prominently than the "refusal reply" graphical user interface element 483C. Further, the graphical user interface elements 484C and 485C may be determined appropriately based on the schedule data and the original email 475C. In some implementations, graphical and/or textual representations may be presented in conjunction with user interface elements 481C and 482C that indicate those elements are selected based on the user's calendar data (e.g., "select based on your calendar" or "text indication that your calendar indicates that you are open to the evening").
When the graphical user interface element 484C is selected via the user interface input, an invitation may be generated at "7:00pm" under the heading "dinner" for "tomorrow". In response to the selection, the invitation may be included in the reply (e.g., an invitation attached to the reply and/or a link to an invitation embedded in the reply) and may be sent to the sender (tom@exampleurl.com) of the original email 475C and/or other recipients (spike@exampleurl.com) of the original email 475C. When the graphical user interface element 485C is selected via the user interface input, an availability poll may be generated based on the user's calendar data, which includes the individual selectable times during which the user is available as indicated by the calendar data. In response to the selection, the availability poll may be included in the reply (e.g., appended to the availability poll of the reply and/or a link to the availability poll embedded in the reply) and may be sent to the sender (tom@exampleurl.com) of the original email 475C and/or other recipients (spike@exampleurl.com) of the original email 475C. Based on the sender's and/or other recipient's selections, a preferred date/time may be determined, and a further reply may optionally be generated, which is an invitation to the preferred date/time.
In some implementations, including the invitation or availability poll in the reply includes including the invitation or availability poll only in the reply. In some other implementations, including the invitation or availability poll in the reply includes including them with other content in the reply. For example, in some implementations, the graphical user interface element 481C and graphical user interface element 484C may be selected using user interface input to generate a reply that includes n-grams "Count me in" and includes an invitation.
As one example of determining reply content represented by graphical user interface elements 481C, 482C, and 483C, one or more message characteristics of original email 475C may be provided as input to trained machine learning system 135 of fig. 1, and trained machine learning system 135 may provide as output an indication that "confirmation reply with time request", "tentative reply with time request", and "rejection reply" are based on appropriate responses of message characteristics. Reply content engine 128 of fig. 1 may utilize the output and the user's calendar data to determine that "confirmation reply with time request" is most appropriate. For example, reply content engine 128 may determine that the user is available based on the user's calendar data and, as a result of the user availability, determine a confirmation reply "yes. (good, what time? (how much does I am. The particular acknowledgement replies with time requests represented by graphical user interface elements 481C, 482C and 483C may be selected by reply content engine 128 from a database of rejected replies, e.g., past acknowledgement replies of users with time requests. Note that if original email 475C included a specified time (e.g., "Spike and I are going to dinner tomorrow night at7:00.Want to join us.
As one example of determining reply content represented by graphical user interface elements 484C and 485C, one or more message features of original email 475A may be provided as input to trained machine learning system 135 of fig. 1 (the same system as referenced in the above examples, or a separately trained system), and trained machine learning system 135 may provide as output an indication that "invite idle time of user" and "availability poll" are appropriate responses based on message functionality. The reply content engine 128 of fig. 1 may utilize this output, along with calendar data of the user and optionally other users (when access is available), to determine that the user and/or other users are available for dinner at7:00 a day-and generate an invitation represented by graphical user interface element 484C based on availability. In some implementations, reply content engine 128 may also determine 7:00 as the appropriate time based on user history data of the user and/or other users indicating that 7:00 is a popular dinner time. Note that if the original email 475C included a specified time (e.g., "Spike and I are going to dinner tomorrow night at7:00.Want to join us. The reply content engine 128 of fig. 1 may also utilize the output of the machine learning system 135 and the calendar data of the user to determine one or more idle times of the user to include the option of being in the availability poll represented by the graphical user interface element 485C.
FIG. 5 illustrates another example graphical user interface for providing reply content for inclusion in a reply to an electronic communication. The graphical user interface of fig. 5 may be presented at the client device 106 based on the reply content determined and provided by the reply content system 120. In fig. 5, the user has provided user interface input (e.g., selected a "reply" graphical user interface element) to initiate a reply to the original email, and is presented with a reply portion 580 that includes phantom text "compound email" indicating to the user that the user can Compose the reply in the reply portion 580. The original email 575 to which the reply is responded to is also shown in fig. 5 for the user to refer in generating the reply. Reply content options represented by graphical user interface elements 581, 582, and 583 are presented for inclusion in a reply to an email and when selected via user interface input.
In fig. 5, reply content options represented by graphical user interface elements 581, 582, and 583 are determined based on the original email 575 and based on the user's calendar data. In the example of FIG. 5, the user's calendar data indicates that the user is available after "tomorrow night" 5:30. Based on the calendar data and the original email 575, it may be determined that the "reply with time suggestion" graphical user interface elements 581, 582, and 583 are suitable for providing to the user.
As one example, one or more message characteristics of the original email 575 may be provided as input to the trained machine learning system 135 of fig. 1, and the trained machine learning system 135 may provide as output an indication of "reply with time suggestion", "temporary reply with time suggestion", and "reject reply" being an appropriate response based on the message characteristics. The reply content engine 128 of FIG. 1 may utilize the output and the user's calendar data to determine that "reply with time suggestion" is appropriate. The particular replies represented by graphical user interface elements 581, 582, and 583 may be determined by reply content engine 128 based on the available time indicated by the user's and optionally other users' calendar data (when access is available), and optionally based on the user's and/or other users' historical data indicating that the suggested time is a popular dinner time.
As another example, one or more message characteristics of the original email 575 and "available" characteristics of the user's calendar data may be provided as inputs to the trained machine learning system 135 of fig. 1, and the trained machine learning system 135 may provide as output all or part of the particular n-grams represented by graphical user interface elements 581, 582, and 583. For example, the trained machine learning system 135 may provide as output "I'm free after end time of last event" (I are available after the end time of the last event) "," How open time? ([ available time ] how. The reply content engine 128 of fig. 1 may utilize this output to generate graphical user interface elements 581, 582, and 583.
Turning now to fig. 6-8, additional descriptions of training at least one of the trained machine learning systems 135 of fig. 1 and 2, such as may be used in the various apparatus and methods described with respect to fig. 1-5, are provided.
FIG. 6 illustrates an example environment in which electronic communications may be analyzed to generate an output for training a machine learning system to generate one or more reply content features based on one or more message features and one or more calendar data features and in which the machine learning system may be trained based on the training examples.
The example environment of fig. 6 includes an electronic communication system 110, an electronic communication database 152, and calendar data 154 for one or more users of fig. 1. The example environment of fig. 6 also includes a machine learning system 135A that represents the at least one trained machine learning system 135 of fig. 1 in its untrained state. The example environment of fig. 6 also includes a selection engine 130 and a training example system 140.
The selection engine 130, training example system 140, and machine learning system 135A may each be implemented in one or more computing devices that communicate, for example, over a network. Selection engine 130, training example system 140, and machine learning system 135A are example systems in which the systems, components, and techniques described herein may be implemented and/or with which the systems, components, and techniques described herein may interface. The selection engine 130, training example system 140, and machine learning system 135A each include one or more memories for storing data and software applications, one or more processors for accessing data and executing applications, and other components that facilitate communication over a network. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 and the training example system 140 may include one or more components of the example computing device of fig. 9. Operations performed by selection engine 130, training example system 140, and/or machine learning system 135A may be distributed across multiple computing devices. In some implementations, one or more aspects of selection engine 130, training example system 140, and/or machine learning system 135A may be combined in a single computing device.
Generally, in some implementations, the training example system 140 utilizes past electronic communications of the electronic communication database 152 and optionally associated calendar data 154 without direct human access to generate training examples for training the machine learning system 135A. Training examples may be generated to train the machine learning system 135A to learn the relationship between: (1) One or more message characteristics of the "original" message, optionally in combination with characteristics related to calendar data of the recipients of those original messages; and, (2) one or more characteristics related to reply content in the recipient's "replies" to these original messages.
For example, in some implementations, the machine learning system 135A may be trained to determine a relationship between message characteristics of an original message in combination with characteristics of the recipient's calendar data and the likelihood that replies to electronic communications having those message characteristics by recipients having those calendar data include invitations, availability polls, and/or links to invitations and/or availability polls. Also, for example, in some other implementations, the machine learning system 135A may be trained to determine a relationship between message characteristics of an original message in combination with characteristics of the recipient's calendar data and one or more n-gram and/or n-gram categories included in replies to electronic communications having those message characteristics by recipients having calendar data with those characteristics.
In some implementations, the selection engine 130 can select communications utilized by the training example system 140 based on one or more criteria to generate training examples for training the machine learning system 135A. For example, the selection engine 130 may tag or otherwise annotate certain communications of the electronic communications database 152 as suitable for those utilized by the training example system 140. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 can select the electronic communications that are utilized based on those electronic communications that include an "original" message and a "reply" message that is responsive to the original message. As described herein, the electronic communication including the original message and the reply message may be a single document and/or multiple documents mapped to each other.
In some implementations, the selection engine 130 can select the electronic communications used to train the training examples of the machine learning system 135A based on those electronic communications that include replies with specific reply content, such as invitations, availability polls, links to invitations and/or availability polls, one or more n-grams, and the like. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 can select electronic communications that are used based on those electronic communications that include a "reply" message by the recipient whose calendar data is available (e.g., available via the calendar data 154).
In some implementations, the selection engine 130 can select electronic communications to utilize based on those electronic communications being event communications. For example, the selection engine 130 and/or other engines may determine that the electronic communication is an event communication based on it including an "original" message that includes a lead, a place, a date, and/or a time. In some of these embodiments, the selection engine 130 may include or be in communication with a classifier and/or other machine learning system that determines the likelihood that an electronic communication is related to an event based on characteristics of the electronic communication—and may determine that those electronic communications whose likelihood meets a threshold are event electronic communications.
In some implementations, selection engine 130 may employ one or more techniques to reduce the occurrence of certain types of communications used in generating training examples. For example, where database 152 includes emails, selection engine 130 may employ techniques to filter out emails that may come from an enterprise. For example, emails from certain email addresses, emails from email addresses with certain domain names, emails from email addresses with certain prefixes, emails with certain n-elements in the subject line, etc. may be filtered out. In addition, e-mail that conforms to certain business templates may be filtered out, for example. In addition, e-mail that may be spam may be filtered out, for example. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 selects the electronic communication based on other one or more attributes associated with the communication and/or the sender and/or recipient of the communication. For example, if it is desired to determine a relationship for a particular geographic area and/or domain, communications associated with that geographic area and/or domain may be selected.
In various implementations, the training example system 140 includes an original message feature determination engine 142, a reply content feature determination engine 144, and a calendar data feature engine 146. In some implementations, all or more aspects of engines 142, 144, and/or 146 may be omitted, combined, and/or implemented in components separate from training example system 140. For example, in some implementations, the calendar data feature engine 146 may be omitted and a training example generated to train the machine learning system to receive one or more message features (rather than any calendar data) as input and to provide one or more features of the reply content as output.
In general, the original message feature determination engine 142, the reply content feature determination engine 144, and optionally the calendar data feature engine 146 work in concert and determine a plurality of training examples, each based on a corresponding one of a plurality of electronic communications having an original message and a reply message. For a given electronic communication having an original message and a reply message, original message feature determination engine 142 determines a vector of original message features based on the original message for the given electronic communication, and reply content feature determination engine 144 determines a vector of one or more features of reply content based on the reply message for the given electronic communication.
The vector of original message features and the vector of one or more features of the reply content included in the training examples will depend on the desired input parameters and the desired one or more output parameters of the implementation of the machine learning system 135A. For example, assume that machine learning system 135A is being trained to provide as output a likelihood that a reply to an electronic communication will include an invitation and/or a link to the invitation. In this case, the reply content feature determination engine 144 may generate training examples, each training example including a vector of one or more reply content features that are single features of "true" (including invitations and/or links to invitations) or "false" (not including invitations and/or links to invitations).
As another example, assume that machine learning system 135A is being trained to provide as output: for each of one or more n-gram categories (e.g., semantic categories), the reply message of the electronic communication will include a corresponding likelihood for that category. For example: 1) The reply to the electronic communication includes the possibility of a "confirmation reply"; 2) The reply to the electronic communication includes the possibility of a "refusal reply"; 3) The reply to the electronic communication includes the possibility of a "confirmation reply with time suggestion"; 4) The reply to the electronic communication includes the possibility of a "refusal reply with indication of a conflicting event"; etc. In this case, the reply content feature determination engine 144 may generate training examples, each training example comprising a vector of multiple reply content features, each reply content feature being either "true" (including n-elements of the category) or "false" (not including n-elements of the category).
In some implementations, the reply content feature determination engine 144 may determine one or more semantic categories of the reply message based on grouping the electronic communications into clusters based on similarities of the reply messages for the electronic communications, and determine the semantic categories based on the clusters. In some of those embodiments, the reply content feature determination engine 144 groups the electronic communications into clusters based on similarities, such as semantic, syntactic, and/or text similarities, between the text of the reply messages of the electronic communications of the corpus. In general, reply messages for electronic communications grouped in a given cluster will be more similar to each other (based on the similarities used in the packets) than reply messages similar to the packets in other clusters. Each determined cluster may be content of a different semantic category of the reply message. In some implementations, in grouping electronic communications into multiple clusters, the reply content feature determination engine 144 may use one or more clustering algorithms based on similarity metrics between reply messages. For example, in some implementations, x-means clustering may be utilized, wherein the distance between reply messages is based on a similarity measure between the original messages. In general, x-means clustering is an unsupervised method for finding ideal k for k-means clustering. Generally, k-means clustering aims at dividing observations into groups, each of which is included in the group with which it is most relevant. Additional and/or alternative clustering techniques may optionally be used.
The original message feature determination engine 142 may determine various original message features, such as features based on syntax, semantics, n-gram, and/or metadata. For example, one or more original message characteristics may indicate whether a particular n-element is present in one or more locations of the original message, or whether any n-elements of a particular class of n-elements are present in one or more locations of the original message. The class of n-elements may be, for example, a group of n-elements having similar semantic meaning. As another example, the original message feature may indicate a number of recipients of the original email, such as "one," two to five, "or" five or more. As yet another example, the original message characteristics may indicate semantic characteristics of one or more portions of the original message, such as semantic characteristics of the subject matter of the original message, all or a portion of the body of the original message, and so forth.
As described herein, in some implementations, the original message characteristics of the training examples may be paired with one or more characteristics based on calendar data of a user generating the reply message for which corresponding reply content characteristics are determined by the reply content characteristics determination engine 142. For example, for a given electronic communication, the original message feature engine 142 may determine one or more message features based on the original message of the electronic communication, the reply content feature determination engine 144 may determine one or more reply content features based on the reply message of the electronic communication, and the calendar data feature engine 146 may determine one or more calendar data features based on calendar data 154 of the user generating the reply message of the electronic communication, wherein the calendar data is related to events of the original message. For example, the calendar data feature engine 146 may determine the calendar data feature based on the availability of users that generated replies to attend the event of the original message, where the availability indicates availability when the reply message was authored (e.g., calendar data entries of users based on events that do not themselves reference the original message). The message feature and the calendar data feature may be used as input features for the training examples, and the reply content feature may be used as output features for the training examples.
Various calendar data features may be determined by the calendar data feature engine 146. For example, the calendar data feature may indicate whether the user is "available", "unavailable", or "potentially unavailable" for the event of the original message. Also, for example, the calendar data feature may indicate attributes of calendar data entries that conflict or are likely to conflict with events of the original message. The attribute may be, for example, a title of the calendar data entry, a duration of the calendar data entry, a category of the calendar data entry, etc. In some implementations, the calendar data feature engine 146 can determine the availability of the user for events of the original message and/or other calendar data features by searching the user's calendar data 154 based on a time indication (i.e., an indication date and/or time) associated with the events of the original message. For example, the user availability may be determined based on whether the user calendar data indicates that the user has an event already scheduled during or near a date and/or time associated with the event.
The training examples generated by the training example system 140 for the machine learning system 135A are provided to the machine learning system 135A to train the machine learning system 135A. During training, machine learning system 135A iteratively learns a hierarchy of feature representations based on training examples generated by training example system 140.
Turning now to FIG. 7, an example of how to generate training examples based on electronic communications and train a machine learning system using the training examples to generate an output of one or more reply content features based on an input of one or more message features and one or more calendar data features is provided. The selection engine 130 may select communications from the electronic communications database 152 that are to be used to generate training examples for training the machine learning system 135A based on one or more criteria. For example, selection engine 130 may select an electronic communication based on: those electronic communications that include an "original" message and a "reply" message that is responsive to the original message; those electronic communications that include a "reply" message provided by the recipient of the recipients whose calendar data is available (e.g., available via calendar data 154); and/or those that may be associated with an event.
For a given electronic communication of the electronic communication, the original message feature determination engine 142 determines a vector of original message features based on the original message of the given electronic communication and includes the original message features as input features 145A of the corresponding training examples 145.
The reply content feature determination engine 144 determines a vector of one or more reply content features based on the reply message for the given electronic communication and includes the reply content features as output features 145B for the corresponding training examples 145.
The calendar data feature engine 146 determines a vector of one or more calendar data features based on the calendar data 154 of the user that generated the reply message and that is temporally related to the event of the original message. The calendar data feature engine 146 includes calendar data features that are additional input features to the input features 145A of the training examples 145.
Training examples 145 are used to train machine learning system 135A. Although only a single training example 145 is shown in fig. 7, it is to be understood that engines 142, 144, and 146 will generate multiple training examples (each based on corresponding electronic communications) and multiple training examples for training machine learning system 135A.
As one particular implementation of fig. 7, training examples 145 and all additional training examples may each have: an output parameter indicating which of a plurality of n-gram semantic categories is included in the reply message of the corresponding electronic communication: and one or more input parameters based on the original message of the corresponding electronic communication and on calendar data of the user generating the reply message of the corresponding electronic communication. For example, the reply content feature determination engine 144 may be based on a rule including "ican make it.how much about 7:30? (how does i can do.7:30. The raw message feature determination engine 142 may generate raw message features based on the corresponding raw message as input to the first training example. The original message characteristics may include, for example, one or more syntactic, semantic, and/or n-gram based characteristics of the original message. The calendar data characterization engine 146 may generate "availability" of the user as a further input to the first training example based on the calendar data of the user generating the reply message.
Further, for example, the reply content feature determination engine 144 may generate the reply content feature of the output of the second training example including an indication of the semantic category of "reject reply" based on the reply message including "Sorry, can' tmake it". The raw message feature determination engine 142 may generate raw message features as input to the first training example based on the corresponding raw message. As a further input to the first training example, the calendar data characterization engine 146 may generate "unavailable" availability of the user based on the calendar data of the user generating the reply message.
Additional training examples may similarly be generated, including additional examples, each with output features based on other semantic categories of n-grams. The machine learning system may be trained based on training examples. The trained machine learning system may receive as input one or more characteristics of the original message and calendar data of a user related to an event of the original message and provide as output one or more semantic categories of n-grams and optionally associated possibilities for inclusion in a reply to the original message.
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating an example method of generating a training example and training a machine learning system using the training example to generate an output of one or more reply content features based on one or more message features and an input of one or more calendar data features. For convenience, the operations of the flowcharts are described with reference to systems performing the operations. The system may include various components of various computer systems. For example, some operations may be performed by one or more components of training example system 140 and/or machine learning system 135A of fig. 6. Moreover, although the operations of the method of FIG. 8 are illustrated in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted, or added.
At block 800, the system identifies event electronic communications, each including an original message and a reply message.
At block 802, the system generates input features for a training example based on an original message of one of the electronic communications and a user availability associated with a user generating a corresponding reply message.
At block 804, the system generates one or more output characteristics of the training examples based on reply content associated with the reply message of the electronic communication. For example, in one embodiment, one or more output characteristics may be "true" or "false" and true if the reply message includes an invitation and/or a link to the invitation and false otherwise. Also, for example, in another embodiment, the one or more output features may include a plurality of features, each feature being "true" or "false," and each feature indicating whether the reply message includes n-elements of a particular semantic and/or other class. For example, a first feature may indicate "confirm reply," a second feature may indicate "reject reply," and so on.
At block 806, the system trains a machine learning system based on the training examples.
Although the method of fig. 8 is described with respect to a single training example, it should be appreciated that one or more steps (e.g., blocks 802, 804, and 806) may be iteratively performed to determine a plurality of training examples and train a machine learning system based on the plurality of training examples.
Where the system described herein gathers personal information about a user or may utilize personal information, the user may be provided with the following opportunities: whether the control program or feature gathers user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, one or more social activities, profession, user preferences, or the user's current geographic location), or whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. Moreover, certain data may be processed in one or more ways to remove personally identifiable information before it is stored or used. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personally identifiable information cannot be determined for the user, or the geographic location of the user may be generalized (e.g., to the level of a city, zip code, or state) where geographic location information is obtained, and thus the particular geographic location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may control how information about the user is collected and/or used.
