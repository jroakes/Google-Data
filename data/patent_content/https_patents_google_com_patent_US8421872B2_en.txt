Definitions
- Modern image recognition processes allow ever-better recognition of objects, landscapes, faces, symbols, strings of letters, etc. in images. More and more cameras are connected to devices that are connected to remote data transmission networks. Such a configuration supports the following application.
- a terminal for example, in a mobile telephone
- This image ( 2 ) or these images are then sent to a server computer ( 7 ) by means of remote data transmission ( 3 ).
- an image recognition process ( 4 ) is run that converts the image information into symbolic information ( 5 ), for example, plain text.
- the image recognition process may recognize that the Eiffel Tower can be seen in the image.
- the remaining process functions in a manner similar to a traditional search engine ( 6 ) on the Internet.
- the server computer sends the user back a list with “links” to database entries or web sites containing information about the object ( 8 ) shown.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example imaged-based information retrieval system according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of example training images and attribute detectors of the imaged-based information retrieval system of FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 3 is another illustration of an example training image and attribute detectors of the imaged-based information retrieval system of FIG. 1 .
- the trained attribute detectors ( 32 ) are used to find the attributes they represent in an input image ( 31 ). This occurs by means of a search process. Each attribute detector outputs a confidence value that states how well it recognizes the attribute it represents from the image. If the accumulated confidence values ( 33 ) from all of the attribute detectors exceed a predetermined threshold value, it is assumed that the object was recognized.
- Visual recognition of buildings is easily attainable with today's methods. It is of course helpful if the user photographs the building in a frontal and vertical manner rather than from an oblique angle.
- image recognition may be supported by using positioning information as well. Many telephones are equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System) such that it is possible to know the location of the telephone within a few meters at all times. This information can be used in image processing to limit consideration to only the buildings or building details that are nearby. Because the building ought to be recognizable at different times of the day, it is important to ensure when constructing the visual representation that appropriate image material must be incorporated. For most image recognition processes, this means that several pictures should be taken under various lighting conditions and these pictures should be used in constructing the models.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- Another category of objects is products such as automobiles, books, or toys. If the user sees a model of automobile that he or she finds interesting, the user can simply take a picture of it and, for example, be pointed to a corresponding web site with more product information. Again, in the early phases of such a service, it will be useful if the user takes photographs from exact frontal or side views and sends them to the server computer. In later versions, when the pose invariance has been improved, the user will be less restricted. It is important for the image-based search service to be structured in such a way that, similar to the current World Wide Web, it is possible for every provider of information to offer an image-based search function for his or her web site. In this manner, it is possible to easily ensure that an image-based search function is available for many products because automobile manufacturers, for example, have a significant interest in their latest model being recognizable by imaging techniques.
- Another useful service lies in offering text recognition. For a person traveling to Tokyo or Paris who is not familiar with the local language, it would be very valuable to be able to point his or her camera at a sign and receive a translation and other information about the recognized text. If, for example, a person is standing in front of a sushi bar in Tokyo, it would be very valuable to be able to read the corresponding entry in a restaurant guide immediately and without additional effort. This is a particularly convenient solution to enable visitors who cannot read Japanese characters to access additional information.
- Face recognition is another special case. People who, for whatever reason, would like others to be able to find out more about them quickly may make images of their face available that could then be used in image recognition.
