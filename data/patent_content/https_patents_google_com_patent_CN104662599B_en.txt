According to the sample implementation of disclosed technology, once secure image, then used
Family can be by the application itself that runs on mobile computing device and its on remote display
It is mutual with the image of projection that both come in projection.In a kind of sample implementation, user can be led to
Cross the picture waved the touch-screen sweeping on mobile computing device and roll through projection, change at mirror
In the remotely expression of picture, near-real-time comes into force.
According to sample implementation, it is desirable to have its mobile computing on same computer monitor
3rd user of the bigger view of the image on device can utilize similar place as above
Reason.For example, capture QR mark, adjust view field and remotely show at remote computer monitor
Show sharing application on device.Therefore, the implementation of disclosed technology so that can be simultaneously
Single remote display accommodates multiple projection.
According to some sample implementation, the operation time framework of disclosed system can include
Three assemblies: (1) remote projection service, for example, the web of operation on centralized server
Service, is used for managing projection session；(2) storehouse run on mobile computing device or application,
For rendering image and information and sharing image and information with centralized server；And (3) exist
The web application running in browser on computer, the receiving of this computer is used for serving one
Or the remote display monitor of multiple projection.
According to the sample implementation of disclosed technology, arbitrary remote display can become
Projectable.For example, the owner of remote display can start the calculating at remote display
Browser on machine, and access the remote projection service on web, i.e. via HTTP
Request.In a kind of sample implementation, projection display applications can be run in a browser.
In a kind of sample implementation, and as described above, projection display applications can be to encode use
Mark in bar code, the QR of the unique ID identifying remote display or illustrate at screen center
Other figures start.Multiple remote displays can ask remote projection service simultaneously, and
They each can be assigned to unique ID.
The example of this light-duty deployment can be realized by clicking on the bookmark opening projection web services
Implementation.The owner of remote display also can select have background image or blank screen.
For example, on shopping plaza or public remote display in the street, static state can as usual be shown
Background image or motion graphics (such as advertisement), and can on the top of background image wash with watercolours

According to some sample implementation, remote projection session can have three phases: (1)
Via QR marker recognition target remote display；(2) projection on remote display is adjusted
Region (its position and size)；And (3) and shared shifting on selected viewing area
The screen of dynamic technique device.
Identify target remote display
In sample implementation, and as described above, disclosed technology can be passed through following
Mode starts: it is effective that the camera function being invoked on mobile computing device is searched in the scene
QR marks.In sample implementation, camera view can be taken on mobile computing device
Prospect, for user aim on target remote display QR mark.QR mark is permissible
Detected and decoding shows ID to extract, and can send for foundation projection meeting to server
The request of words.In sample implementation, then server can utilize the session representing session
The remote display that the display ID that ID notice is decoded identifies.Thereafter, it is possible to use distributed
Session id is at server, mobile device and remote computer (its control projection remote display)
Between communicate, the session id of this distribution can allow message quilt when multiple session activation
It correctly route.In sample implementation, once remote computer receives new session id,
Then it can be responded by following manner: is the chessboard on remote display by QR mark transitions
Pattern, adjusts view field for user.
Adjust view field
Once the Mobile solution on mobile computing device detects checkerboard pattern, then Mobile solution
The center that can calculate detected chessboard deviation camera view is how many.This Mobile solution can be sent out
Send the adjustment amount that side-play amount must be made on remote display as checkerboard pattern so that chessboard
Can again manifest the center at camera view.When user is to the target on remote display
When (inclination) mobile computing device is moved in position, the adjustment amount needed for checkerboard pattern can be connected
It is sent to remote display continuously, and, the position of the chessboard on remote display changes can
To be fed back to mobile computing device by camera.
Slide as described above, user can move with circle on the touch-screen of mobile computing device
Start to refer to, to zoom in or out target projection.Frame can indicate target projection size.Showing
In example implementation, the size of chessboard can keep constant.In sample implementation, user
Also can be with computing device in rotary moving with conversion between horizontal and vertical, therefore this can change
The orientation of view field.
Once user touches the touch-screen of mobile computing device, the then region specified by blue border
Can be fixed for projecting mobile computing device screen.This system can be passed through following now
Mode enters the shared stage: takes back the application of the prospect of being projected to, and is remotely showing again
Show that the center of device illustrates that its QR marks, for the following projection from other mobile devices.
Share mobile computing device screen
At this stage, and according to some sample implementation, figure has once been secured
Picture, then the position of mobile computing device and orientation may become and the projection on remote display
Unrelated, and user can be mutual with application.Meanwhile, the screen picture can applied with poll,
And in one implementation, if having updated screen, then can be to remote display

Wide.
In sample implementation, user can do as usual should with the movement on mobile computing device
With alternately, and on local mobile computing device screen and remote projection, reflection UI is changed
Become.In addition, if remote display supports user's input, then remote projection can allow user
Directly via projection operation's application.For example, when the finger such as mouse or touch event being detected
When showing event, remote computer can verify it whether in the border of fixing projection, and
If it is, then can be by the projector of this event relay to pairing corresponding with session id.This
Allowing when there is multiple projection on same remote display, remote display is to suitable throwing
Shadow assigns the event related to instruction.On a kind of sample implementation, when customer incident falls
When outside any projection, do not trigger behavior.
In sample implementation, the Mobile solution running on the mobile device can be from remotely
Its projection on display receives incoming event, and to the user interface in the application being projected
(UI) allocating event again.In sample implementation, application can be in response to event, just
As these event this locality originate from mobile computing device, and will be as mentioned above on both sides
All show that UI changes.
Algorithm for " camera projection "
One aspect of disclosed technology relates to positioning target projection district on remote display
Territory.This aspect can be useful, especially for wherein can be on same remote display
Arrange the shared remote display of multiple projection, and user needs not by other existing projections
Desired region is found in the space using.User is possibly used technology as touch pad
Positioning projection region, for example, on the touch-screen of mobile computing device, slip finger is to move
View field on remote display.But, these technology may be less directly perceived, and when row
Enter apart from big when, for example, on the remote display of wall size, may be slack-off and be difficult to make
With.
Returning to physics hand-held light projectors metaphor, such projector allows user by slightly
Ground is mobile and oblique projector is easily controlled and projection is placed where on large surfaces.In order to
Imitate this means, develop and be disclosed that a kind of technology, in it allows user to use
The camera of the mobile computing device put rather than real projector physically aim at it remotely
Desired locations on display.
According to the sample implementation of disclosed technology, explanation now is used for utilizing mobile computing
Device camera carrys out the algorithm of simulated projections behavior.In a kind of sample implementation, can pass through
Use camera positioning given pattern (for example, checkerboard pattern) over the display so that it is protected
Hold the center at camera view.Move to the new position on remote display as user or
During the camera of inclination movement computing device, target pattern may the center of deviation camera view.Base
In observed bias, can carry out should moving on remote display with regard to target pattern
How many calculating so that it is again at the center of camera view.
Target pattern designs
One aspect of disclosed technology is that design has mobile computing device camera easily and can
Algorithm by the suitable target pattern of ground detection.Checkerboard pattern contribute to uniqueness be marked at many
Lighting condition and can detecting with various angles.In a kind of sample implementation, 5x4 checkerboard pattern
(seeing Figure 4 and 5) is utilized, and has been found that have elasticity for wrong report, and provides
For calculating the inside intersection point more than sufficient of homography matrix.And, implement in some example
In example, utilize the asymmetrical design of chessboard to assist in camera relative to wherein showing chessboard
The orientation of remote display.
Detection checkerboard pattern
According to the sample implementation of disclosed technology, chessboard detection algorithm can utilize
OpenCV, for the popular storehouse of increasing income of computer vision.In certain sample implementation,
This algorithm can be utilized to carry out the specific checkerboard pattern being detected in frame by following manner: by image
Thresholding, searches for black quadrangle, and finds and the intersection point within sequence.Typical algorithm
Example embodiment may by iterative search continuously with find the quadrangle of constantly extension and
Attempt the new configuration of rectangle and more value precision compared to speed.But, typical algorithm can
In the case of needing continuous print real-time tracking wherein on the processor of mobile computing device not
Too effective.Therefore, in a kind of example embodiment, can refine OpenCV in three kinds of modes
Algorithm.It is possible, firstly, to by coming fast based on the size of quadrangle and degree of approach thresholding energetically
Speed processes (or elimination) quadrangle.Secondly, can eliminate by extension quadrangle to find more
The iteration of the search of many intersection points.For example, perform experiment, and determine that iterative search has not
Make the return that time cost reasonably successively decreases.3rd, can be based on the side of mobile computing device
The chessboard point that orientation and their orders on horizontal and vertical axle sort detected, so that
More effectively find homography later.
Deviation from camera is transformed to displaing coordinate
According to the sample implementation of disclosed technology, the output of chessboard detection algorithm can be
The inside intersection point of one group 12 sequences in camera coordinates.For example, if dx and dy is these
The center of fiqure of point is relative to the skew on horizontal and vertical axle of the center of camera view.Real in example
In existing mode, these skews can be transformed to displaing coordinate, to determine that chessboard needs remotely
Move how many (seeing equation (1)) on display.
Wherein, H is the 3x3 projective transformation from camera to remote display coordinate, i.e. singly answers square
Battle array.H can be calculated by following manner: find at two groups of points that (it is ours iteratively
In the case of include at camera coordinates and the chessboard point detecting over the display) between most preferably reflect
Penetrate and transformation matrix.But, this process can be simplified in the following manner: is determined by
Correspondence between two groups of points, by orienting (via built-in acceleration based on mobile computing device
Meter detection) and the chessboard point that the detected order on horizontal and vertical axle sort and detected
Chessboard point.Once known correspondence, then we can be by calculating the least square of linear system
Solving (seeing equation 2) and determining homography matrix H, this may than iteration means faster
T=HO (2)
Wherein, O can be 3x12 matrix, and wherein, each column is observed in camera coordinates
The homogeneous coordinates of chessboard point.In a kind of sample implementation, T captures 12 over the display
The coordinate of individual chessboard point.In some implementation, may need not know because of following deduction
The absolute position of road chessboard point over the display: each point can be expressed as relative to chess
Disk center TcenterRelative coordinate Trelative, and this point can be for observed chessboard point
O also sets up.Therefore,
Tcenter+Trelative=H (Ocenter+Qrelative) (3)
Because Tcentre=H Ocenter, and for computing redundancy, so we obtain equation 4.
Trelative=H Orelative (4)
It is known that TrelativeAnd OrelativeBoth.But, determine TrelativeStill may need
Want the physics size of known chessboard over the display, although it does not changes during projecting.?
In a kind of sample implementation, predetermined fixing chessboard size may be used for all of display；
But, fixed size is inappropriate possibly for different Projection Constraints.For example, large chessboard is permissible
For the display of wall size, allowing distance to project, and little chessboard may be used for PC prison
Visual organ.In a kind of sample implementation, remote display may exceed at runtime for
The chessboard size of mobile computing device (via server).In sample implementation, we
This extra communication steps can be eliminated by deducing further.For example, and according to showing
Example implementation, can be by size factor S from TrelativeDecompose out:
S Tunit=H Orelative (5)
Wherein, S can be 3x3 scale transformation matrix, and TunitIn unit ratio
One group of chessboard point, it is independent of the actual physical size of chessboard and position.At sample implementation
In, then we can obtain:
Tunit=S-1H Orelative (6)
In this sample implementation, TunitIt is constant, it is known that Orelative, and, can
Using as overall calculation S-1H.In sample implementation, can be based on equation (1) and (6)
Calculate the adjustment amount needing in unit ratio, i.e. the left side of equation (7) (below) is permissible
By as the overall remote display that is sent to:
In sample implementation, because the actual size S of the known chessboard of remote display, institute
Recover dx' and dy' so that it can be adjusted by scaled unit ratio.
Synchronized by alternately checkerboard pattern
According to the sample implementation of disclosed technology, mobile computing device produces and updates
And but the actual chessboard updating on remote display can necessarily include two asynchronous dependences
Process.For example, it can be relative for updating, and is applied to the current location of chessboard,
And then the position updating can be updated for producing the next one by mobile computing device.As a result,
And it is according to sample implementation, when sending renewal by network to remote display, mobile
Computing device is before analyzing new frame and another renewal of generation, it may be necessary to wait this renewal
It is remotely displayed device process.This inevitable requirement is by allowing once to run these two only processing
Individual and synchronize these two process.
In order to determine whether to have been processed by updating, i.e. moved chessboard, passed through camera
The deviation of the keyboard observed changes may be unreliable, because mobile computing device may be constantly
Mobile, even if when user is not intended to as now.Accordingly, it may be desirable to from remote display
Clearly confirm to have been processed by updating to indicate.In a kind of sample implementation, it is possible to
Remote display sends message by network to mobile computing device.But, this other row
Journey not only makes agreement complicated, and increases delay.
In the sample implementation of disclosed technology, can be by sharing same size
Replace to utilize visual synchronization mechanism (to see between two different checkerboard patterns (the 106th, 107)
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5).For example, when remote display is in response to more newly requested and mobile chessboard, it
Upset or alternately checkerboard pattern are visually to confirm.Once mobile computing device detect shown in
The conversion of the type of chessboard, then it can start to process new frame, and sends new renewal.
Only produce when checkerboard pattern overturns to update and well process is synchronized.However, it is possible to be following
Situation: because the delay of system and user's hand is quick mobile, so updating or even processing
Before remote display receives renewal, mobile computing device is in new position or orientation.
Move to maximally follow user, and according to sample implementation, the generation that can continue
Update, without waiting for pattern conversion, but come so with important enhancing.According to disclosed
The sample implementation of technology, can with from its produce update pattern type, the i.e. the 1st
Checkerboard pattern or the 2nd 107 checkerboard pattern send each and update.In sample implementation,
When update reach remote display when, remote display can check its types of patterns, application with
The consistent pattern of current checkerboard pattern on remote display, and overturn this pattern simultaneously.
This enhancing can ensure that correct renewal for current chessboard position, this based on the assumption that
Generally, renewal needs are oversize, be i.e. longer than two patterns changes to reach display.This means permit
Permitted later renewal and covered untreated renewal earlier, and can early be reached in late renewal
In the sense that utilize the non-determined sequence of message on network.
