- the term "transceiver” is used in this specification to refer to a transmitter and/or receiver.
- An interactive session system 170 is also accessible by user devices 130 over the network 190.
- the interactive session system 170 serves interactive sessions and data related to interactive sessions to users of user devices 130.
- the term "interactive session” is used in this specification to refer to a presentation that allows a user to experience an event or receive data related to the event. Events of different types can be presented. In some implementations, events may be "assistance” events, for which interactive sessions provide step-by-step assistance to users to accomplish a particular task, or events may be "experience" events, for which interactive sessions provide users with an experience of participating in an activity.
- An example interactive session for an assistance event is a session that describes a step-by-step process to build a computer.
- An example interactive session for an experience event is a session that provides the experience of driving a certain make and model of an automobile.
- the interactive session system 170 may also provide interactive sessions for other appropriate event types.
- the data that the interactive session system 170 provides for an event may also differ based on the event type and based on the intent of the user.
- interactive sessions for repair events may provide users with a list of tools and parts required to accomplish a task at the beginning of an interactive session.
- a user may have implicitly or explicitly specified an intent for viewing an interactive session.
- the user may explicitly specify an intent, for example, by interacting with a user interface element that represents their intent.
- a user may implicitly specify an intent, for example, by submitting a search query that is related to the intent, or by requesting other information that is related to the intent.
- a user request for information about purchasing tools needed to repair a computer may be considered an implicit indication of the user's intent to repair a computer.
- the interactive session system 170 may also determine specific data to provide based on the intent. For example, a user that is viewing a session that describes building a computer, and with the intent to build the computer, may be presented with additional information, e.g., a list of parts, tools and the time required to complete the task. Another user that is watching the same session with the intent to learn about computers may be presented with other information, e.g., articles about memory, heat dissipation, or other computer related topics, in a side panel of a viewing environment as the interactive session is presented.
- additional information e.g., a list of parts, tools and the time required to complete the task.
- Another user that is watching the same session with the intent to learn about computers may be presented with other information, e.g., articles about memory, heat dissipation, or other computer related topics, in a side panel of a viewing environment as the interactive session is presented.
- the interactive sessions can be created by assistants, such as expert assistants, or non-expert users.
- An "assistant" can be a user or entity that has been accepted by the system 170 for a category, e.g., as a result of the user's or entity's having provided credentials or demonstrated a high level of skill.
- An "expert assistant” may be an assistant with a high level of skill or expertise in a particular area. Examples of expert assistants include a licensed contractor for construction related videos or a company that produces sessions for a particular product the company manufactures and a user that has produced a large number of highly rated sessions. An assistant does not have to have a particular level of skill or have produced a large number of highly rated sessions. For example, an assistant may simply be a friend or acquaintance of another user that knows how to accomplish a task, such as programming a universal remote control. This assistant and the other user can participate in an interactive session where the assistant helps the other user program a universal remote control.
- a content item management system can provide content items with the interactive sessions.
- the content item management system may select advertisements based on the subject matter of a session, the event type, and the user's intent. For example, for a repair event, the content item management system may provide advertisements for providers of tools and parts that are listed in the list of tools and parts required to accomplish the repair task.
- the interactive session system 170 includes a user interface generator 172, an object identifier 174, and a user interface element index 176.
- the user interface generator 172 generates user interfaces based on an image or video feed.
- the user interface generator 172 may generate a user interface based on an image or video feed of the workspace 101, as described in more detail below.
- the object identifier 174 is used to identify objects depicted in an image or video.
- the object identifier 174 may detect tools or other objects depicted in an image of the workspace 101.
- the objects can be detected using vision and image processing technologies.
- a label or annotation describing each detected object can be included in the user interface. For example, if a hammer is detected in an image or video, a label including "hammer" may be depicted in the user interface near the depiction of the hammer.
- Production systems 140 can be used to create sessions. Production systems 140 may range from studios to smartphones to simple hand-held video recording systems. Generally, a production system 140 is a system that includes an audio input device 142, a video input device 144, a display device 146, and/or optionally other input and output devices and production processes that are used to create sessions. For example, post production processes may be used to add metadata to an interactive session. Such metadata may include, for example, keywords and topical information that can be used to classify the session to one or more topical categories; a list of tools and parts required for a particular session and descriptions of the tools and parts; and so on.
- metadata may include, for example, keywords and topical information that can be used to classify the session to one or more topical categories; a list of tools and parts required for a particular session and descriptions of the tools and parts; and so on.
- Tactical sensory input devices may also be used in a production system 140.
- a particular interactive session may provide input data for a "G-suit" that applies pressure to a user's body and that the user interprets as simulated motion.
- appropriate input systems are used in the production system 140 to generate and store the input data for the interactive session.
- Production systems 140 may also be or include devices that are attached to a person.
- wearable computer devices that include a camera input device and microphone input device may be worn on a user's person during the time the user is creating the session.
- Other types of input and output devices may also be used, depending on the type of interactive session.
- an augmented reality visor that provides a view of a real-world environment augmented by computer-generated graphics may be used.
- a tactical sensory input device and a tactical sensory output device that applies pressure to a user's body and that the user interprets as simulated motion or other type of feedback may also be used.
- Some interactive sessions may be provided as part of a consultation process, for example when the user cannot find a stored interactive session that fulfills the user's informational needs.
- an automobile mechanic may contact a user at another location, e.g., the user's home, to consult with the user regarding an automobile repair.
- the automobile mechanic may then explain to the user, by means of an interactive session that highlights certain parts of the automobile engine as seen from the point of view of the automobile mechanic, certain repairs that are necessary and request authorization from the user to proceed.
- the user can ask questions and discuss alternatives with the automobile mechanic during the interactive session to make an informed decision.
- the interactive session system 170 is depicted as a separate system in FIG. 1, in some implementations the interactive session system 170 is part of the user system 130 and/or the production system 140.
- the production system 140 and/or the user device 130 may include a user interface generator 172 that generates the user interfaces.
- the interactive session system 170 is a third party system accessed by the user device 130 and the production system 140.
- a third party interactive session system 170 may provide user interfaces to the user device 130 and the production system 140 so that the user of the user device 130 and the user of the production system 140 can interact with the interactive session system 170 and/or each other.
- a user may be presented with a list of parts, tools, or other objects that are required to complete a task during an interactive session. This can decrease the amount of time required to complete an interactive session as the user does not have to search for tools while the session is in progress.
- an assistant it may be difficult for an assistant to describe the tool or part required at a particular time. For example, there may be several versions of a screwdriver required during an interactive session. If the differences between the screwdrivers are not obvious, the assistant may resort to saying things like "the fifth tool from the left,” or “you're getting warmer, but further to the left.” This can be frustrating to the user and/or the assistant, and can lengthen the time required to complete the interactive session.
- the interactive session system 170 can generate a user interface for a workspace 101 that makes it much easier for the assistant to point out objects to the user.
- the example environment 100 is described with reference to a user operating the user device 130 and being located at a first location, and an assistant operating the production system 140 at a second location remote from the first location.
- the user may be located at the user's residence in one state, while the assistant may be located at a residence or work location in a different state.
- the user organizes a workspace 101 with tools, parts, and other objects that are required to complete an interactive session, for example based on a list presented to the user.
- the example workspace 101 includes a wrench 103a, a screwdriver 103b, and another screwdriver 103c.
- the workspace 101 also includes, for each object, an indicator element 104a-104c that is used to identify the object.
- the indicator elements 104a- 104c can also be placed near the objects by the user.
- An indicator element 104a- 104c can include a visual code 106a, an indicator
- An indicator element 104a- 104c can also include an energy source, such as a battery, for powering the indicator 108a- 108c, the control module 110a- 110c, and the wireless
- the visual codes 106a- 106c can be QR codes, bar codes, numbers, alpha-numeric codes, or other types of identifiable objects.
- the visual code 106a for an indicator element 104a is unique to that indicator element 104a.
- each object 103 a- 103c is associated with a unique visual code 106a- 106c, respectively.
- the indicator elements 104a- 104c can be configured to stand on the workspace 101 such that the visual codes 106a- 106c are visible to the video input device 134.
- the indicators 108a- 108c can include a light, such as a light-emitting diode (LED), a speaker, or other object that can be used to draw a user's attention to the indicator element 104a- 104c.
- a light such as a light-emitting diode (LED)
- a speaker or other object that can be used to draw a user's attention to the indicator element 104a- 104c.
- the assistant can cause the indicator 108a to activate, drawing the user's attention to the object.
- the wireless communication devices 112a-l 12c are used to register their indicator elements 104a- 104c with the interactive session system 170. To register with the interactive session system 170, each wireless communication device 112a-l 12c can send data identifying the indicator element 104a- 104c and/or the visual code 106a- 106c to the user device 130. In turn, the user device 130 can provide the data to the interactive session system 170.
- Each indicator element 104a- 104c can have a unique identifier, e.g., ID number that uniquely identifies the indicator element 104a- 104c. This unique identifier can be sent to the interactive session system 170 during the registration process.
- the interactive session system 170 may store its identifier and/or its visual code so that the interactive session system 170 can associate the indicator element with the proper user interface element.
- the wireless communication devices 112a-l 12c are also used to receive a command signal for activating the indicators 108 a- 108c.
- the wireless communication device 112a provides a signal to its control module 110a indicating receipt of the command signal.
- the control module 110a activates the indicator 108a.
- the control modules 110a- 110c can be configured to activate their indicators 108a- 108c for a predetermined amount of time, or until a signal is received by the wireless
- the user interface generator 172 generates user interfaces, such as the example user interface 150, and provides the user interfaces to production systems 140 of assistants, or other users. In general, the user interfaces enable assistants to select objects 103a-103c in order to activate the indicator 108a-108c associated with the object 103 a- 103c.
- the user interface generator 172 receives an image or video feed of a workspace 101, for example from the video input device 134 of the user device 130.
- the image or video feed depicts the objects 103a- 103 c arranged on the workspace 101 and the indicator elements 104a- 104c positioned near each of the objects 103a- 103c.
- a user interface created by the user interface generator 172 can include an image or video of the workspace 101, including the objects 103a- 103c and the indicator elements 104a- 104c.
- the user interface 150 includes depictions of a wrench 151a, a screwdriver 151b, and another screwdriver 151c, which correspond to the wrench 103a, the screwdriver 103b, and the screwdriver 103c of the workspace 101, respectively.
- the user interface generator 172 also creates user interface elements 154a- 154c for each indicator element 104a- 104c.
- a user interface element 154- 154c enables the assistant to select the object 103a- 103c associated with the user interface element 154a-154c, and cause the indicator 108a for the object 103a-103c to activate.
- the production system 140 sends a command signal to the user device 130, e.g., by way of the interactive session system 170, and the user device 130 activates the indicator 108b by sending a command signal to the wireless communication device 112b.
- An example process for generating a user interface is illustrated in FIG. 4 and described below.
- the example user interface elements 154- 154c each includes a selectable icon
- a selectable icon 155a causes the production system 140 to send the command signal to the user device 130.
- the selectable icons 155a- 155c can be selected by point and click using a mouse or other pointer, or by an assistant touching a touchscreen at the selectable icons 155a- 155c.
- each user interface element 154a- 154c includes an "On" icon and an "Off icon. This allows the assistant to selectively turn the indicators 108a- 108c on and off. For example, if the assistant selects an "On" icon for the wrench 103 a, the production system 140 may send a command to the signal to the user device 130 to turn the indicator 108a on. Similarly, if the assistant selects the "Off icon for the wrench 103 a, the production system 140 may send a command to the signal to the user device 130 to turn the indicator 108a off.
- the interactive session system 170 can maintain an index of user interface elements 154a- 154c in the user interface element index 176.
- the user interface element index 176 can include data identifying each user interface element 154a- 154c included in a user interface 150 and, for each user interface element 154a-154c, data identifying its corresponding indicator element 104a- 104c.
- the data identifying an indicator element 104a- 104c may include the unique identifier for the indicator element 104a- 104c. This index can be used to map data identifying a selected user interface element 154a- 154c to its corresponding indicator element 104a- 104c.
- the user interface generator 172 can generate user interfaces that accept other forms of input in addition to, or in place of, selectable icons.
- the production system 140 includes or is communicably coupled to an eye tracking device.
- the eye tracking device can determine the direction in which the assistant is looking and cause indicators 108a- 108c to activate based on this direction. For example, if the eye tracking device determines that the assistant is looking at the depiction of the wrench 15 la in the user interface 150, the production system 140 can use this data to cause the indicator 108a to activate.
- the eye direction can be used in combination with other signals.
- the eye direction may be used in combination with a timer. If the production system 140 determines, in combination with the eye tracking device, that the assistant has been looking at the depiction of the wrench 15 la for at least a threshold amount of time, e.g., two seconds, the production system 140 may cause the indicator 108a to activate.
- the eye direction may also be used in combination with a voice command, such as
- the assistant may speak the command "activate.”
- the production system 140 can detect the command, e.g., by way of the audio input device 142, and in response, cause the indicator 108a to activate.
- the production system 140 and/or the interactive session system 170 accepts voice commands without eye tracking.
- voice associations between the assistant and the objects 151 a- 151c depicted in the user interface 150 may be used to activate the indicators 108a- 108c.
- the voice associations can be learned before or during an interactive session.
- the assistant may say "pick up the 3/4" wrench” and select the icon 155a for the wrench 103a.
- the interactive sessions system 170 can then associate the command "3/4 wrench” or "pick up the 3/4" wrench” with the user interface element 154a, and thus the indicator element 104a.
- the assistant can train the interactive session system 170 by selecting the appropriate icon 155 a- 155c and recording a corresponding command. Thereafter, when a command associated with one of the indicator elements 155 a- 155c is spoken, the production system 140 and/or the interactive session system 170 can cause the corresponding indicator 108a- 108c to activate.
- the voice associations for each user interface element 154a- 154c can also be stored in the user interface element index 176 with a reference to its
- the user interface is based on a video feed of the workspace 101 rather than a still image.
- the user interface generator 172 may receive a video feed from the user device 130, generate user interface elements 154a- 154c for each indicator element 104a- 104c depicted in the video feed, and superimpose the user interface elements 154a- 154c on a reproduction of the video feed to create the user interface 150. If the video input device 132 moves, the user interface generator 172 can also move the user interface elements 154a- 154c to keep them near the corresponding indicator elements 104a- 104c in the video feed.
- the interactive session system 170 can also help train the user as to what each tool or part is.
- the user places the appropriate objects 103a- 103c and an indicator element 104a- 104c for each object on the workspace 101.
- the user can record a description of the object using the audio input 132 of the user device 130.
- the interactive session system 170 may provide a user interface to the user device 130.
- This user interface may include an icon that enables the user to select each indicator element 104a- 104c and record a description for the object associated with that indicator element.
- the user interface may be similar to the user interface that is presented at the production system 140.
- the interactive session system 170 can associate the description with its corresponding indicator element 104a- 104c.
- the interactive session system 170 can cause the user device 130 to play the description for the selected object.

Similar to the interactive session 170 of FIG. 1, the interactive session system 270 generates user interfaces, such as the user interface 250, based on images or video feeds of the workspaces.
- the example user interface 250 included depictions of the tools 251a-251c and user interface elements 254a-254c that each includes a selectable icon 255a-255c and optionally the visual code 256a-256c of its corresponding indicator element 204a-204c.
- the example environment 200 also includes a laser system 260.
- the laser system 260 includes a laser controller 261 and a laser 263.
- the laser 263 is used to highlight objects or locations, e.g., a particular spot or place on a workspace, selected at the user interface 250 in place of, or in addition to, the use of indicator elements.

- a feedback loop can be used to help guide the laser 263 to the appropriate object 203a-203c.
- the interactive session system 270 or one of the other systems, can monitor the location of a dot or line produced by the laser's beam 265 on the workspace 201 as the laser 263 is guided into position.
- the location of the dot or line can be captured by the video input device 234 and displayed in the user interface 250, as illustrated by the icon 267.
- the interactive session system 270 can compute the vertical and/or horizontal distance between the location of the dot or line and the destination at the selected object 203a-203c. These distances can be with respect to the user interface 250. For example, the interactive session system 270 may compute the distances in terms of pixels. Based on the computed distances, the interactive session system 270 can provide data to the user device 230 to continue guiding the laser 263 to the selected object. Once the laser 263 is directed to the selected object, the interactive session system 270 can provide data to the user device 230 to cause the laser 263 to remain in that position.
- the example user interface 250 illustrates the movement of the laser's beam 265 from a position 266 on the workspace 201 to its current position near the wrench 203a.
- the user interface 250 includes an icon 268 displaying the position 266 and the icon 267 displaying its current position.
- the two lasers can be directed at the same position. If this position cannot be detected through the video feed, one of the lasers can be moved away from the original position and then moved back. If the movement of the laser from the original position is detected, for example by detecting another bright spot where the laser has been moved to, then the original position can be considered the location of the lasers.
- Two lasers can also be used to project a pattern that can be more readily recognized in the video feed. For example, two lasers may be used to project a crosshairs-like pattern onto the workspace 201.
- indicator elements 204a-204c may be omitted.

- a computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.
- a computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system.
- a program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code).
- a computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- the processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output.
- the processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application- specific integrated circuit).
- processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer.
- a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both.
- the essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data.
- a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks.
- mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks.
- a computer need not have such devices.
- a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few.
- Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non- volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.
- the processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer.
- a display device e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor
- keyboard and a pointing device e.g., a mouse or a trackball
- Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components.
- the components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network.
- Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- inter-network e.g., the Internet
- peer-to-peer networks e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks.
- the computing system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device).
- client device e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device.
- Data generated at the client device e.g., a result of the user interaction
