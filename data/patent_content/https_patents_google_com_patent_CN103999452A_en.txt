Embodiment
Conventionally, the designer of consumer electronic devices to wish to guarantee in the time that user participates in to carry out product in the mode of expecting mutual.Therefore the output that, most of electronic equipment is designed to receive input signal from one or more source and those input signals is translated into expectation.This input can be inputted by user or machine, and any output corresponding with such input may be provided in information, is provided as the input to other entities, or is stored for subsequent use.During the design phase of electronic device concept, for the object of a kind of product working in the mode of expecting of design, input mechanism is completed by designer conventionally.
Equipment output and/or the equipment operating expected can be determined easily with the input mechanism in response to traditional, such as remote control input, switchgear switch input, button input etc.It is not to be easy to detect or translate into equipment operating that the input that other of electronic equipment are not too traditional---includes but not limited to the input of mankind's gesture, tactile touch input or wireless noncontact input---.
Design allows in an equipment detecting tradition input and detecting product that non-traditional input combines and can realize user and designer and can carry out mutual more selection with natural mode and such product.Product can be designed to the type of the input based on receiving on equipment and enable or off-stream unit function.Particularly, input type can represent how product reacts on user or electronics input.For example, be conventionally designed to can to detect remote signal (, as remote decoder) with identical infrared sensor from the stereo ceiver of remote controller reception order and also detect user's approaching to transducer simultaneously.; can to identical transducer programme to determine whether from remote control or user for example through before this equipment or on touch sensor or near object receive specific input, and therefore reflect the light being provided by the reflector adjacent with transducer.
Such transducer can with one or two input to enable or off-stream unit in concrete function.For example, use stereo ceiver discussed above, the infrared sensor on receiver can detect user to the approaching of the transducer on receiver or receiver, and can in the time the approaching of user being detected, carry out quiet to stereo ceiver.Therefore,, except the remote control from transducer receives order, for example, stereo ceiver can detect user and approach this equipment when, and can approach to enable or inactive concrete function based on this with identical transducer.
Advantageously, the described system in present disclosure can provide one or more advantage, such as making user can use multiple input mechanisms and device sensor to carry out alternately.There is electronic product how to carry out some mutual illustrated examples with received transducer input.Many different features can realize with transducer and transducer input, and the scope of above-mentioned these contents unrestricted content described below.
Figure 1A and Figure 1B illustrate the concept map of the environment 100 for controlling electronic equipment 102.Although electronic equipment 102 is depicted in television set 106 outsides, but equipment 102 also can be integrated into a part for television set 106.Therefore, in some implementations, equipment 102 can use traditional television components.
As shown in Figure 1A, environment 100A comprise via remote controller 108 at foreground and electronic equipment 102 mutual and on backstage with the mutual user 104 of television set 106 (its another form that is electronic equipment).User 104 can use a teleswitch and 108 control electronic equipment 102.For example, user 104 can select volume control, channel control or other to control to make the function in equipment 102 actuating equipments 102 or on television set 106.User can alternatively or simultaneously use a teleswitch and 108 control television set 106.As an example, remote controller 108 can be programmable remote control, and it sends the signal that television set 106 moves based on it in the time that volume button is pressed, and the signal that transmitting apparatus 102 moves based on it in the time that channel button is pressed.
Electronic equipment 102 comprises transducer 110 and optical transmitting set, such as light-emitting diode (LED) 112.When from the watching above of equipment 102, transducer 110 can be positioned at reflector side (it can be LED112 itself or the position that is launched from the light of LED) conventionally.Transducer 110 also can with LED112 in line.For example, transducer 110 can be positioned at the dead astern of LED112.But, in normal running, can locate as follows, aim at and cover transducer and reflector: which makes transducer 110 not trigger the mutual of approaching physically user and equipment 102, such as by user reflector and transducer 110 wave above or other article so that get the light of spontaneous emitter and be reflected off article and received by transducer 110.
Conventionally the existence that, for example transducer 110 can the Infrared based on reflecting between object and LED112 detects sub-carrier signal whether.Although only show a transducer and LED at this, but can realize transducer and/or the LED of any suitable number in electronic equipment 102.In addition, can carry out in the following manner placement sensor and LED on equipment 102: which makes it possible to monitor at once near some inputs (for example brandishing article the diverse location of user on equipment 102).
In electronic equipment 102, can realize other transducers.For example, microphone apparatus can be configured to adaptively the phonetic entry of sensing user or depend on that in detected room, noise regulates volume reactively.In another example, LED and sensor combination can be used for regulating the brightness in room to change in the time room darkens being detected or brighten.Use such additional sensor, user can provide combinatorial input to equipment 102.For example, user can make its hand brandish through transducer 110 so that the phonetic entry of connection equipment 102 is identified, and then can tell other order to equipment 102.
In some implementations, electronic equipment 102 can be implemented as the stereo ceiver that is connected to audio system (not shown) and/or television set 106.In some implementations, electronic equipment 102 be configured to the Set Top Box of the output on one or more processor control television set 106 (as, cable or satellite box).In some implementations, electronic equipment 102 is configured to the joystick for playing stream video, object for appreciation game on line or access online resource.
In the time of operation, electronic equipment 102 can receive input in every way.For example, electronic equipment 102 can have button, touch sensor and switch, and by pressing, switch or mobile such mechanism, user can manually activate.In some implementations, electronic equipment 102 can be configured to from remote controller such as remote controller 108 receives order.
Now, with reference to Figure 1B, show near the user's 104 of electronic equipment 102 environment 100B.Particularly, user 104 has been moved upward to electronic equipment 102, and is shown in when equipment 102 is placed hand above to tilt towards television set 106.(show user's left arm with dashed line form, can carry out respectively two actions with instruction, wherein transducer is arranged in wherein an only equipment, transducer is arranged in two equipment but user selects to perform an action by approaching wherein an only equipment, or transducer is arranged in two equipment but transducer triggers different actions by equipment makes user can approach two transducers on equipment).At this, for example electronic equipment 102 can detect user's approaching and this detection is interpreted as to the concrete input to transducer 110 and LED112 to equipment 102.This concrete input can be interpreted as the function that can carry out on electronic equipment 102.
Detect approaching of user and can comprise that the input that determines whether the optical transmitting set at equipment (for example LED112) receives light reflection.Particularly, if the article of being controlled by user be placed on electronic equipment 102 closely in, can the light from LED112 be detected at transducer 110 places.For example, electronic equipment 102 for example can be monitored the input receiving at LED112 place, for various types of reception light (concrete wavelength, pulse pattern etc.), definite reception only symbolistic, be derived from the maker in maker in remote controller or electronic equipment 102 itself, and carry out reaction (for example, when equipment 102 is in concrete pattern lower time, hand is brandished through concrete region and produced concrete action) according to the pre-defined rule known to user.
Electronic equipment can also be determined the distance that approaches between article that user controls and electronic equipment 102, and can be by determined distance as any guiding of enabling, stopping using or carrying out function (if existence).For example, user 104 can place hand or finger near transducer 110, and equipment 102 can detect input and whether is derived from LED112 but not remote controller.Then, equipment 102 can detect and carry out function based on this.For example, when, electronic equipment 102 can for example,---represent volume control---at definite user's proximity transducer 110 (touch sensor), carry out the mute function in volume functions or remove mute function.Each so independent sensing activity also can switching function, makes first-hand brandishing carry out quietly to working equipment 102, and brandishing its releasing is subsequently quiet.In some implementations, sensing activity can be switched the operating state of electronic equipment 102.For example, have user near sensing transducer 110 time, equipment 102 can switch to the time-out playback state with frozen frozen mass from the playback state that makes content flow present to user.This state can be maintained until the motion of user and institute's sensing is mutual and/or in the time receiving the remote signal of the operating state for changing equipment.
In another example, electronic equipment 102 can be identified as at least one LED on appliance-originated 102 and come based on signal the operator scheme of switching device 102.Similarly, electronic equipment 102 can detect whether receive the signal that remote controller produces at transducer 110 places, and can provide different functions based on this detection.In some implementations, electronic equipment 102 can change simply the channel on equipment 102 in the time determining the source of concrete input signal.
With reference to figure 2A, describe the top perspective view of electronic equipment 202.This electronic equipment 202 comprises via light pipe 210 and is connected to the reflector 206 that is arranged on the LED204 on circuit board 208.This circuit board 208 also provides the connection to one or more microprocessor, and these any or all connections in connecting can be used for carrying out function and the algorithm of the signal that employing equipment 202 receives.
In addition, can be adjacent to place transducer (not shown) with reflector 206 (it can be the lens in the end of light pipe 210 simply, or can be mounted in other embodiments the LED of the surface of electronic equipment 202).Transducer also can be connected to the circuit on circuit board 208, make for example to receive input signal, when (comprising the IR signal of certain digital signal) when transducer, input IR (or other electromagnetic signals) can be converted into wired electric signal and offer processor on circuit board 208 for analyzing and processing.
In some implementations, LED204 is connected to the light pipe 210 that extends to LED204 light source from viewing location (before 206).In some implementations, reflector 206 can be adjacent with the input of optical sensor, if make user cover physically optical transmitting set 206 with single finger or hand, will be reflected off the input of user to optical sensor from the light of reflector.In some implementations, the dead ahead that stands in sense position can be enough to trigger the reflection of getting back to transducer.
The hand 212 that reflector 206 in this example is used near user reflector 206 illustrates, makes adjacent transducer can detect user's the approaching of hand 212 (that is, having the distance very little apart from equipment 102), as shown in emitting electromagnetic wave.In some implementations, reflector 206 is positioned and is controlled to the user of equipment 202 provides visual information, and launches the light that will be detected by optical sensor.
Transducer can be proximity transducer, such as comprising the transducer of one or more light-emitting diode of connecting with power circuit, be connected to phototransistor, and therefore can a packaging part comprise reflector and transducer the two.In the time of working sensor, apply voltage to proximity transducer, this proximity transducer sends again infrared light.The light sending is propagated through air until object is left in its dissipation or reflection.In the time that object is left in reflection such as people, propagate light and be reflected back toward towards transducer.If the relative proximity transducer of object or people, reverberation will than object away from the situation that stronger.On the contrary, if object or people are far, reverberation is will be weak or do not exist.But if reverberation provides strong reflection, proximity transducer will be activated.In the time that proximity transducer is activated, will to lead-out terminal such as remote controller sends corresponding signal.This lead-out terminal can be for carrying out the function of any number on active electron equipment 202 with reception signal.
