- Licensed spectrums include portions of the radio spectrum reserved for use by licensed organizations. For example, in the United States, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulates radio communications. These licensed organizations have exclusive use of the radio spectrum over geographic areas that they have been granted licenses for.
- FCC Federal Communication Commission
- One benefit of operating communication systems within licensed spectrums is the minimal interference these systems experience from other systems operating in the same frequency range.
- These same communication systems may also operate within unlicensed spectrums.
- communication systems operating within unlicensed spectrums may experience interference from other systems operating within the same frequency ranges.
- LTE systems may operate within frequency ranges that another communication system, such as a Wi-Fi (e.g., IEEE 802.11n) communication system, also operates within.
- Wi-Fi e.g., IEEE 802.11n
- a base station e.g., eNB
- PSS primary synchronization signal
- SSS secondary synchronization signal
- UEs user equipment
- CRSs transmitted cell-specific reference signals
- a UE operating within an LTE system may synchronize to PSS and SSS signals, and subsequently detect and acquire the CRS transmission for time and/or frequency tracking and/or automatic gain control (AGC) loop maintenance.
- AGC automatic gain control
- a discovery signal is proposed in LTE such that UEs are expected to detect and measure neighbor cells and/or secondary cells (Scells) using the discovery signal.
- the discovery signal may be, for example, a combination of PSS, SSS, and CRS subframes transmitted at a periodic rate (e.g., up to 5 msecs of populated subframes every 100 msecs).
- LTE Release 12 UEs are expected to detect and measure at least neighbor cells and secondary serving cells using the discovery signal.
- FIG. 8 depicts synchronization transmissions in LTE Release 8/9/10/11 and also the discovery signal transmissions that are being considered for LTE Release 12.
- an LTE UE After an LTE UE acquires PSS/SSS it is able accurately identify LTE symbol ( ⁇ 70 us) and subframe (1 ms) boundaries. Subsequently, the UE uses CRS transmissions from the cell for time/frequency tracking and AGC loop maintenance.
- APs For communication systems operating within the Wi-Fi standard (e.g., IEEE 802.11n, infrastructure mode), access points (APs) transmit beacon frames that that contain information relevant for synchronization and discovery. For example, synchronization between APs and stations (STAs) (e.g., UE) in a Wi-Fi communication system is maintained via a timing synchronization function (TSF) where beacon frames transmitted by an AP contain a TSF timestamp value that is used by STAs to synchronize their own timer's TSF timer value.
- TSF timing synchronization function
- a receiving STA may accept the timing information in beacon frames sent from the AP, and if the STA's TSF timer value is different from the timestamp value in the received beacon frame, the receiving STA sets its local TSF timer value to the received timestamp value.
- Wi-Fi APs may transmit beacon frames according to a beacon period (e.g., 100 msecs) that defines a series of Target Beacon Transmission Times (TBTTs) (e.g., 0 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms . . . ).
- TBTTs Target Beacon Transmission Times
- the AP may schedule a beacon frame as the next frame for transmission.
- beacon frames are transmitted only if the transmission medium is determined to be free. If the transmission medium is busy (e.g., current transmissions are detected), the beacon frame transmission is deferred until the next available transmission opportunity. Subsequent beacon frames, however, are not also deferred (unless the transmission medium is busy at their scheduled TBTT), but rather are still scheduled at their pre-determined TBTTs.
- Wi-Fi may also include a preamble that precedes data transmission in every physical layer convergence protocol data unit (PPDU).
- PPDU physical layer convergence protocol data unit
- the length of the preamble depends on a number of factors including Wi-Fi specification version (e.g., 802.1111g vs. 802.11n), the number of spatial streams, and the sounding formats supported.
- the short training fields (STF) in the preamble can be used to determine fine timing.
- Preamble transmission for 802.11n is illustrated in FIG. 10 .
- the preamble may be used by a receiving AP or UE to assist in synchronization and AGC maintenance.
- base stations may operate primary cells (Pcell) that operate on licensed carriers (e.g., frequency carrier operating within licensed spectrum), and/or Scells that operate on licensed or unlicensed carriers (e.g., frequency carrier operating within unlicensed spectrum) (e.g., long-term evolution unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U)).
- Pcell primary cells
- licensed carriers e.g., frequency carrier operating within licensed spectrum
- Scells that operate on licensed or unlicensed carriers
- licensed or unlicensed carriers e.g., frequency carrier operating within unlicensed spectrum
- LTE-U long-term evolution unlicensed spectrum
- the Scell supports on/off. Additional assistance signaling regarding sequence identification information for the discovery signal and timing (e.g., periodicity and subframe offset of discovery signal) can also be provided by the Pcell.
- the UE may use the transmitted discovery signals and assistance information to detect and synchronize to the Scell. Because the base station transmits on the Scell, which is operating on a licensed carrier, the discovery signals are transmitted with known periodicity and known symbol/subframe locations. As such, a UE can correlate with these signals and determine symbol/subframe timing for the Scell. The UE may also perform measurements on the Scell operating on a licensed carrier.
- the UE may perform radio resource management (RRM) measurements, such as measuring the Scell's reference signal received power (RSRP) and/or reference signal received quality (RSRQ).
- RRM radio resource management
- the UE may also report the various measurements to a base station or some other network device.
- the base station is expected to implement a ‘listen before talk’ (LBT) strategy (i.e., the base station has to detect (e.g., sense) if there are transmissions on the unlicensed frequency carrier, and transmit only if no other transmission is detected on the unlicensed frequency carrier), similar to the strategy Wi-Fi employs and discussed above.
- LBT listen before talk
- the base station it is not possible for the base station to make periodic discovery signal transmissions with a known pattern without violating the LBT strategy, as the frequency carrier may not be free for transmission during all occasions of scheduled discovery signal transmissions. As such, there are opportunities for improvements to synchronization with, and measurement reporting of, unlicensed frequency carriers.

- a method and apparatus for synchronizing to an Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier determine, at a UE, one or more measurement instances where a discovery signal may be transmitted on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier based on a higher layer configuration message (also referred to herein as an unlicensed spectrum measurement instance configuration message) such as a radio resource configuration (RRC) message.
- a base station may transmit, on a Pcell operating on licensed spectrum, the unlicensed spectrum measurement instance configuration message indicating to a UE one or more measurement instances where a discovery signal may be transmitted on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier.
- the unlicensed spectrum measurement instance configuration message may indicate to a UE, for example, that a discovery signal transmission is to be expected in subframes ⁇ x,x+1 ⁇ , ⁇ x+40,x+41 ⁇ , ⁇ x+80,x+81 ⁇ , . . . ⁇ , where x can be a subframe index relative to a system frame number (SFN) 0.
- the discovery signal may include, for example, periodic transmissions of PSS/SSS and/or CRS, whereby the measurement instances include subframes associated with these periodic discovery signal transmissions.
- the discovery signal comprises PSS, SSS, and CRS transmitted in a 1 msec subframe every 80 msec.
- the discovery signal comprises a burst of three 1 msecs subframes transmitted every 160 msecs with a first subframe containing PSS, SSS, and CRS, and second and third subframes containing only CRS.
- the base station may transmit the unlicensed spectrum measurement instance configuration message to UE's operating on the Pcell.
- the method and apparatus may determine whether the discovery signal will be transmitted during at least one of the measurement instances on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier based upon a control channel message (also referred to herein as an unlicensed spectrum control channel message). For example, the base station may transmit to UEs, on a Pcell operating on a licensed carrier, an unlicensed spectrum control channel message associated with the discovery signal indicating whether the discovery signal will be transmitted on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier during one or more of the measurement instances. This allows the base station to mute the discovery signal in transmission instances where the Scell is occupied. The base station may transmit the discover signal at a later time (e.g., move the discovery signal).
- a control channel message also referred to herein as an unlicensed spectrum control channel message
- the base station may determine whether the frequency carrier is occupied by sensing a channel (e.g., by performing clear channel assessment as known in the art). If the channel is not occupied, the base station may determine to transmit a discovery signal in the next available measurement instance. If the channel is occupied, the base station may mute, or mute and move, the discovery signal transmission. More generally, this enables the base station to transmit the discovery signal only on an as needed basis, i.e., it enables an ‘on-demand’ detection and measurement procedure for the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier. For example, UEs may measure the channel only when an unlicensed spectrum control channel message indicates that a discovery signal will be present during a measurement instance.
- the method and apparatus may then detect the discovery signal transmission on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier during one or more of the measurement instances based on the unlicensed spectrum control channel message indications.
- the method and apparatus may also synchronize to the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier based on the detected discovery signal transmission.
- a base station reserves an unlicensed frequency carrier, such as a Scell, and sends a frequency carrier aggregation (CA) activation command to a UE for frequency carrier activation purposes as is known in the art.
- the base station may then begin discovery signal transmission on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier, and the UE may use the discovery signal for time and/or frequency synchronization.
- the UE may also utilize the discovery signal for channel state information (CSI) reporting purposes during frequency carrier activation.
- CSI channel state information
- a base station may deactivate the Scell on the unlicensed frequency carrier when there is no data transmission to the UE.
- the UE may then measure and report RRM measurements on the unlicensed frequency carrier using the discover signal.
- a received unlicensed spectrum control channel message may indicate to a UE that a discovery signal will be transmitted on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier during the next measurement instance.
- the UE may make RRM measurements during the next measurement instance and report those measurements to, for example, the base station.
- the unlicensed spectrum control channel message may indicate to a UE that a discovery signal will be transmitted on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier during a future measurement instance that is offset a number of subframes from the subframe corresponding to the next immediate measurement instance.
- the method and apparatus determine that the unlicensed spectrum control channel message is associated with a radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) configured for the UE.
- RNTI radio network temporary identifier
- the method and apparatus determine whether the discovery signal will be transmitted during at least one of the measurement instances on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier based on successfully decoding the unlicensed spectrum control channel message. For example, the method and apparatus may determine that the discovery signal will be transmitted on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier during at least one of the measurement instances based upon successfully decoding the unlicensed spectrum control channel message.
- the UE monitors the Pcell for an unlicensed spectrum control channel message that includes cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits that are masked by the UE's configured RNTI.
- the unlicensed spectrum control channel message may be sent on a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) or an enhanced physical downlink control channel (EPDCCH), for example.
- the UE may monitor the search space on the Pcell in a subset of subframes either fully or partially overlapping with the set of measurement instances where the discovery signal is expected on the Scell. For example, if discovery signal transmission is expected in subframes ⁇ x,x+1 ⁇ , ⁇ x+40,x+41 ⁇ , ⁇ x+80,x+81 ⁇ , . . .
- the UE may monitor the PDCCH/EPDCCH channels on the Pcell for unlicensed spectrum control channel messages that include CRC bits scrambled by the UE's configured RNTI in subframes ⁇ x ⁇ 1,x,x+1 ⁇ , ⁇ x+39,x+40,x+41 ⁇ , ⁇ x+79,x+80,x+81 ⁇ , . . . ⁇ .
- the UE can monitor the Pcell for unlicensed spectrum control channel messages in all non-discontinuous reception (DRX) subframes.
- the method and apparatus receive the unlicensed spectrum measurement instance configuration message in a control channel that is one of a PDCCH and EPDCCH.
- the discovery signal includes periodic transmissions of at least a PSS and a SSS.
- the unlicensed spectrum control channel message includes downlink control information (DCI).
- DCI may indicate, for example, that the discovery signal will be present in at least one of the measurement instances.
- a UE may determine that the discovery signal will be present in the next measurement instance.
- the UE if the UE successfully decodes an unlicensed spectrum control channel message encoded with CRC scrambled by RNTI, the UE examines the DCI contents of the unlicensed spectrum control channel message to determine whether the discovery signal will be present on the Scell in the next measurement instance.
- the DCI contents of the unlicensed spectrum control channel message may contain a bitmap where each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a particular Scell, indicating whether the discovery signal of that Scell is present in the next measurement instance.
- the RNTI configured for the UE may be associated with discovery signals on multiple Scells on which the UE is configured to perform measurements, for example, such as RSRP or RSRQ.
- the method and apparatus may determine that the discovery signal will be transmitted during a measurement instance on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier based upon unsuccessfully decoding the unlicensed spectrum control channel message.
- the base station may encode an unlicensed spectrum control channel message based on a UE's associated RNTI, indicating that the discovery signal will not be transmitted during the next measurement instance.
- the base station may not transmit an unlicensed spectrum control channel message.
- the base station may transmit an unlicensed spectrum control channel message encoded with an RNTI that is not associated with a receiving UE. As such, the UE will not be able to successfully decode the unlicensed spectrum control channel message and will determine that the discovery signal will be transmitted during the next measurement instance on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier.
- the UE determines that that the discovery signal will not be transmitted during a next measurement instance based upon successfully decoding an unlicensed spectrum control channel message, but rather will be transmitted during an alternate measurement instance of the one or more measurement instances. For example, a UE may receive from a base station an unlicensed spectrum control channel message indicating that the discovery signal will be not be transmitted during the next measurement instance, but rather will be transmitted a number of measurement instances from the next measurement instance (e.g., 1 measurement instance from the next one). In one example, if the UE detects the unlicensed spectrum control channel message in a particular subframe, e.g., subframe x, on the Pcell, the next measurement instance may begin from a corresponding subframe x on the Scell.
- a particular subframe e.g., subframe x
- the next measurement instance may begin from another subframe on the Scell that is offset from the subframe received on the Pcell containing the unlicensed spectrum control channel message.
- the offset may be optionally embedded in the DCI contents of the unlicensed spectrum control channel message. In this event, the UE would now monitor the Scell for the subframe that has been offset to receive the discovery signal.
- the unlicensed spectrum control channel message is received at least in a first subframe that overlaps at least partially in time with one or more measurement instances.
- the method and apparatus perform a measurement, such as an RSRP or RSRQ measurement, on the discovery signal during at least one measurement instance of the one or more measurement instances.
- the method and apparatus may then report a measurement value based on performed measurement.
- a UE may determine that, based on a received unlicensed spectrum control channel message, the discovery signal will be transmitted during the next measurement instance.
- the UE may then measure the Scell during the next measurement instance and report measurement data based on that measurement to a base station.
- the method and apparatus monitor the Scell for PSS and/or SSS transmissions. If the method and apparatus detect PSS and/or SSS transmissions, the method and apparatus assume that a SCDS was transmitted during that time. The method and apparatus may proceed to perform measurements such as RSRP and RSRQ, and may report any such measurement values. Otherwise, the UE assumes that the SCDS was not transmitted and skips performing measurements in that SCDS occasion.
- cell synchronization and/or AGC settling may be handled by transmission of either existing reference signals (e.g., CRS) or a new preamble sequence before data transmission.
- CRS existing reference signals
- the UE has no expectation of CRS transmissions on the Scell until it receives an activation command for the Scell.
- the UE uses CRS transmission on the Scell to acquire synchronization and/or for AGC maintenance. Because there is no discovery signal support, the UE does not perform any RRM measurements on the unlicensed carrier.
- a base station may decide, however, whether to configure or activate the UE to the Scell based on other information such as UE location and radio frequency (RF) fingerprint.
- the base station may request the UE to send a ‘one shot’ measurement report based on measurements done over a few subframes following the request.
- a method in a UE connected to a Pcell operating on a licensed carrier, and configured with a Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier includes determining, from a higher layer configuration message, a set of measurement instances where a discovery signal can be present; the discovery signal comprising periodic transmissions of at least a PSS and a SSS.
- the method may also include monitoring, on the Pcell, a control channel using a RNTI associated with the discovery signal, in a first subframe.
- the method may include determining a measurement instance associated with the first subframe from the set of measurement instances, determining that the discovery signal is present in the measurement instance if the control channel is not successfully decoded in the first subframe, or determining that the discovery signal is not present in the measurement instance if the control channel is successfully decoded in the first subframe.
- the method may also include performing a first measurement on the discovery signal in at least one measurement instance in the set of measurement instances, and reporting a measurement value based on at least the first measurement.
- the measurement instance at least partially overlaps with the first subframe in the time domain.
- the first control channel is one of a PDCCH and an EPDCCH.
- determining that the discovery signal is not present in the measurement instance if the control channel is successfully decoded in the first subframe further includes determining a DCI from the successfully decoded control channel and determining that the discovery signal is not present in the measurement instance based on information indicated in the DCI.
- the method may also include determining an alternate measurement instance and a second subframe from the control channel, if the control channel is successfully decoded, monitoring, on the Pcell, the control channel using the radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) associated with the discovery signal, in the second subframe, determining that the discovery signal is present in the alternate measurement instance if the control channel is not successfully decoded in the second subframe, performing a second measurement on the discovery signal in the alternate measurement instance, and reporting a measurement value based on at least the second measurement.
- the alternate measurement instance does not belong to the set of measurement instances determined from the higher layer configuration message and the alternate measurement instance does not overlap with the first subframe in time domain.

- the periodic discovery signal transmissions continue, as indicated by subframes 218 , 220 .
- a base station may transmit an unlicensed spectrum control channel message 122 indicating that a UE should or should not expect the discovery signal in a particular Scell subframe (or window of subframes, e.g., depending on a timing uncertainty between the Pcell and Scell).
- the unlicensed spectrum control channel message 122 may indicate that the UE should not expect the discovery signal in the next transmission instance, and identifies the next out of place transmission instance (e.g., a number of subframes after a subframe corresponding to the next transmission instance).
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart 500 of an example method at a UE, such as UEs 108 , 116 , that allows for a UE to synchronize to a Scell.
- the method illustrated in FIG. 5 may be carried out by one or more suitably programmed controllers or processors executing software.
- the methods may also be embodied in hardware or a combination of hardware and hardware executing software.
- the methods are described with reference to the illustrated flowcharts (e.g., in FIG. 5 ), it will be appreciated that many other ways of performing the acts associated with the methods may be used. For example, the order of some operations may be changed, and some of the operations described may be optional.
- the methods may be described with reference to the example base station 132 or UEs 108 , 116 , it will be appreciated that the methods may be implemented by other apparatus as well, and that the base station 132 and UEs 108 , 116 may implement other methods.
- Method 500 begins at step 502 where one or more measurement instances where a discovery signal may be transmitted on a Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier are determined based on an unlicensed spectrum measurement instance configuration message 120 , such as one that may be transmitted by base station 132 .
- the method continues to step 504 , where an unlicensed spectrum control channel message 122 that is associated with the discovery signal is received on a Pcell, such as one that may be transmitted from base station 132 .
- the method continues to step 506 , where a determination is made as to whether the discovery signal will be transmitted during at least one of the measurement instances on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier based on the received unlicensed spectrum control channel message.
- step 508 the discovery signal transmission is detected on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier during at least one of the one or more measurement instances.
- step 510 the method includes synchronizing to the S cell operating on an unlicensed carrier based on the detected discovery signal transmission.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart 600 of an example method at a base station, such as base station 132 , that provides transmissions to allow UEs, such as UEs 108 , 116 , to synchronize to an Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier.
- the method begins at step 602 , where an unlicensed spectrum measurement instance configuration message is transmitted on a Pcell that includes an indication of one or more measurement instances where a discovery signal may be transmitted on a Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier.
- step 604 an unlicensed spectrum control channel message is transmitted on the Pcell, where the unlicensed spectrum control channel message is associated with the discovery signal and indicates whether the discovery signal will be transmitted on the Scell operating on an unlicensed carrier during one or more of the measurement instances.
- the apparatus described herein may be manufactured by using a computer program, software, or firmware incorporated in a computer-readable storage medium for execution by logic such as a general purpose computer or a processor.
- Examples of computer-readable storage mediums include a non-volatile memory (e.g., read only memory (ROM), flash memory, EPROM, EEPROM), a random access memory (RAM), a register, cache memory, semiconductor memory devices, magnetic media such as internal hard disks and removable disks, magneto-optical media, and optical media such as CD-ROM disks, and digital versatile disks (DVDs).
- ROM read only memory
- flash memory e.g., EPROM, EEPROM
- RAM random access memory
- register e.g., a register
- semiconductor memory devices e.g., magnetic media such as internal hard disks and removable disks, magneto-optical media, and optical media such as CD-ROM disks, and digital versatile disks (DVDs).
- FIG. 7 is a functional block diagram illustrating an example of UE 108 that employs RF transceiver 712 , processor 714 , memory 706 , and input output (I/O) devices 704 , where each of these devices is operatively coupled to expansion bus 702 .
- Processor 714 may include, for example, unlicensed carrier discovery signal transmission detection logic 104 and unlicensed carrier discovery signal transmission measurement logic 106 .
- Expansion bus 702 may be any suitable bus that allows for communications among the various devices.
- Memory 706 may be a computer-readable medium such as describe above that stores executable suitable instructions such as unlicensed carrier discovery signal transmission detection logic code 708 , and may also include unlicensed carrier discovery signal transmission measurement logic code 710 , which may be executed by processor 714 .
- the example apparatus 700 may also include one or more of I/O device 704 that is operatively coupled to expansion bus 702 to allow a user to provide user input.
- discovery signals are maintained on unlicensed frequency carriers such that UE's may rely on the discovery signals for synchronization, AGC, signal measurement, and/or measurement reporting purposes, for example.
- base stations may be able to transmit discovery signals during periods of time where interference from other devices operating on the same unlicensed spectrum is reduced.
- UE's are able to determine when to expect the discovery signal, which may result in more accurate signal measurement and signal measurement reporting data.
