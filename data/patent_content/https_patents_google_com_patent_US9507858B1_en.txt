Definitions
- the present invention relates to techniques for modeling textual documents. More specifically, the present invention relates to a technique for selectively merging clusters of conceptually related words in a probabilistic generative model for textual documents, wherein the model characterizes textual documents based on clusters of conceptually related words.
- Prototype systems with stemming components have been attempted but without any real success. This is because the problem of determining whether a stem can be used in a particular context is difficult. That might be determined more by other nearby words in the text rather than by the word to be stemmed itself. For example, if one were looking for the James Bond movie, “for your eyes only”, a result that returned a page with the words “for your eye only” might not look as good.
- clusters are formed during a training phase which uses a large number of documents to form a generative model for the text in these documents. During this training process, it is common for separate clusters to form for similar topics. For example, separate clusters may form for “George Bush jokes,” and “George Bush memorabilia.” It is desirable to merge such similar clusters into a combined cluster which will do a better job of generalizing. Unfortunately, existing systems provide no automated mechanism for merging such similar clusters.
- One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that merges similar clusters of conceptually-related words in a probabilistic generative model for textual documents.
- the system receives a current model, which contains terminal nodes representing random variables for words and contains cluster nodes representing clusters of conceptually related words. Nodes in the current model are coupled together by weighted links, wherein if a node fires, a link from the node to another node causes the other node to fire with a probability proportionate to the weight of the link.
- the system determines whether cluster nodes in the current model explain other cluster nodes in the current model. If two cluster nodes explain each other, the system merges the two cluster nodes to form a combined cluster node.
- the system while determining whether cluster nodes in the current model explain other cluster nodes, the system analyzes each given cluster node in the current model. In doing so, the system forms a query which includes words associated with the given cluster node. Next, the system runs the query against the current model minus the given cluster node to produce a set of resulting cluster nodes. Finally, if the activation strength of a resulting cluster node exceeds a threshold, the system determines that the resulting cluster node explains the given cluster node.
- merging the two cluster nodes involves: (1) merging parents of the two cluster nodes to produce a set of parents for the combined cluster node; (2) merging children of the two cluster nodes to produce a set of children for the combined cluster node; and (3) if a given cluster node is a parent of one cluster node and a child of the cluster node, the system makes the given cluster node a child but not a parent of the combined cluster node.
- the system if merging the two cluster nodes causes two weighted links to exist from a given parent node to the combined cluster node, or from the combined cluster node to a given child node, the system combines the two weighted links into a single combined weighted link.
- the system additionally performs training operations. These training operations involve iteratively: (1) receiving a set of training documents, wherein each training document contains a set of words; (2) applying the set of training documents to the current model to produce a new model; and (3) making the new model the current model.
- the system while applying the set of training documents to the current model, applies the set of training documents to the links defined in the current model to produce functions for weights for corresponding links in the new model. The system then optimizes the functions to produce weights for links in the new model.
- producing the new model additionally involves selectively introducing new cluster nodes into the current model.
- producing the new model additionally involves selectively introducing new links from cluster nodes to terminal nodes and from cluster nodes to other cluster nodes.

- a computer-readable storage medium which may be any device or medium that can store code and/or data for use by a computer system.
- One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that learns concepts by learning an explanatory model of text.
- small pieces of text are generated in a fairly simple, but incredibly powerful way, through the execution of probabilistic network.
- the system learns the parameters of this network by examining many examples of small pieces of text.
- One embodiment of the system considers the important information in a piece of text to be the words (and compounds) used in the text. For example in the query “cooking classes palo alto” the words are “cooking” and “classes”, and the compounds consist of the simple compound “palo alto”. Distinguishing compounds from words is done on the basis of compositionality. For example, “cooking classes” is not a compound because it is about both cooking and classes. However “palo alto” is not about “palo” and “alto” separately. This is sometimes a hard distinction to make, but good guesses can make such a system better than no guesses at all.
- FIG. 1 shows one such model.
- the circles are called model nodes.
- These nodes represent random variables, each of which models the existence or non-existence of concepts or terminals.
- the only terminals we are considering in this model are “elephant”, “grey” and “skies”.
- This model might be used for example to explain why the words grey and skies often occur together, why the words grey and elephant often occur together, but yet why the words “elephant” and “skies” rarely occur together. It is because when people are generating text with these words, they have ideas in mind. The system's concepts are supposed to model the ideas in a person's mind before they generate text.
- This model can be used or “executed” to generate text.
- U Universal node
- firing means that the idea of that concept is active, and is able to fire terminals.
- terminals the idea of firing is that the terminals exist in the text to be generated.

- C 1 becoming active
- FIG. 2 shows this particular execution of the model detailed in FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 3 shows an example concept representing the states of the United States of America.
- the concept can fire terminals representing each of the 50 states, each with probability 1/50.
- That probability is roughly (1/50)*(49/50) 49 , which is approximately 0.7%.
- For this concept to fire all the states would be (1/50) 50 which is incredibly small.
- we develop such a concept that covers the idea of the states of the United States we would want it to explain pieces of text where all the states occur.
- each concept picks an activation level.
- this activation level chooses “how many” terminals are to be picked from this concept. Note that this activation level is not a quality of our model. In fact, it is only chosen when the model is being executed. What activation does is it modifies the probability that this concept fires each of its terminals (but not its sub-concepts, i.e. concept to concept linking is unaffected by activation).
- the probability that the result does NOT fire is the product of the probability that each cause does NOT fire it.
- Bayesian Networks a certain class of probabilistic models
- Bayesian networks are well-understood probabilistic modeling techniques in which conditional independences are asserted between various random variables in a joint distribution. As in the model above, Bayesian networks have nodes and directed links. These networks compactly represent a joint distribution over a number of random variables while structurally representing conditional independence assumptions about these variables.
- the set of nodes pointing to a node is called its “parents”.
- the set of nodes reachable from a node via following links is called its “descendants” or “children”; and the structure implies that a node is independent of its non-descendants given its parents.
- the entire distribution is therefore encoded in the conditional probability tables of a child given its parents (nodes with no parents have their own distributions). The probability of a particular instantiation of the entire network is simply then the product of the probabilities of each child given its parents.
- Bayesian networks are related to our model in the following way, if each node in the execution of our model is considered to be a random variable then the joint distribution over the set of nodes that are turned on is exactly that which arises from considering our model as a Bayesian network with noisy-or combination functions.
- noisy-or conditional probabilities turn a boolean child on independently from each parent. That is, the probability of a child being off is the product of the probability that each parent does not fire it. Note this is exactly the combination function used in our model to decide if multiple active concepts that link to a terminal fire it.
- Bayesian networks are themselves a subclass of more general probabilistic models.
- some source of text In learning a generative model of text, in one embodiment of the present invention some source of text must be chosen. Some considerations in such a choice are as follows: (1) it should have related words in close proximity; (2) it should present evidence that is independent, given the model we are trying to learn (more on this later); and (3) it should be relevant to different kinds of text. For this reason, the implementation of the model which follows uses exemplary “query sessions” from a search engine as its small pieces of text. We have also implemented and run our model on web pages and other sources of text, but for the purposes of making this exposition more concrete, we focus on the analysis of query sessions.
- a query session (also referred to as a user session or a session) as any set of queries that are deemed to be relevant.
- a query session can include a set of queries issued by a single user on a search engine over a fixed period of time. Note that while issuing queries, a user will often search for related material, issuing several queries in a row about a particular topic. Sometimes, these queries are interspersed with queries associated with other random topics.
- An example query session (not an actual one) might appear as follows:
- FIG. 4 illustrates a number of local networks.
- the terminals for a particular user session are assumed to be active. Note that our model is replicated for each such session. This is because what we observe for each session is only the words that the user used, and not in fact that concepts that were active in the user's mind when those words came about!
- the local nodes here represent our uncertainty about these concepts. Because the user may have been thinking of anything when they wrote each word they wrote, all concepts have to be considered in each local network.
- FIG. 5 shows a slightly reworked version of the model, where variables exist to explicitly show whether or not each concept triggers another concept or terminal. Note that the joint distributions implied by both are the same, once they are projected to the original variables we are interested in (i.e. C 1 and C 2 ). The triangles in this figure represent extra “trigger” variables, and it is often helpful to think about the model with them because they simplify the number of conditional probabilities that are required.
- the “trigger” variable between U and C 2 only needs to know the distributions of U and the weight of the link from U to C 2 to decide the probability that C 2 gets fired from U.
- the other trigger into C 2 only needs to know the values of the C 1 and weight of the link from C 1 to C 2 .
- the system maintains counters for links and prospective links in the current model to count the expected number of times they are activated during the training process, where the expectation is over the probability that the trigger variables are activated given the training data
- EM expectation maximization
- FIG. 6 illustrates the crawling, ranking and searching processes in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- a web crawler 604 crawls or otherwise searches through websites on web 602 to select web pages to be stored in indexed form in data center 608 .
- the selected web pages are then compressed, indexed and ranked in module 605 (using the ranking process described above) before being stored in data center 608 .
- a search engine 612 receives a query 613 from a user 611 through a web browser 614 .
- This query 613 specifies a number of terms to be searched for in the set of documents.
- search engine 612 uses search terms specified in the query to identify highly-ranked documents that satisfy the query.
- Search engine 612 then returns a response 615 through web browser 614 , wherein the response 615 contains matching pages along with ranking information and references to the identified documents.
- the system can characterize the documents (and query phrases) based on the clusters of conceptually related words to improve the searching and/or ranking processes.
- FIG. 7 illustrates data structures involved in characterizing a document in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. These data structures include, order one probability table 702 , parent table 704 , child table 706 and link table 708 .
- Order one probability table 702 includes entries for each node in the probabilistic model that approximate the order one (unconditional) probability that the node is active in generating a given set of words. Hence, an entry in order one probability table 702 indicates how common an associated word or cluster is in sets of words that are generated by the probabilistic model. In one embodiment of the present invention, order one priority table 702 also includes an “activation” for each cluster node indicating how many links from the candidate cluster to other nodes are likely to fire.
- Parent table 704 includes entries that identify parents of associated nodes in the probabilistic model, as well as the link weights from the identified parents.
- child table 706 includes entries that identify children of associated nodes in the probabilistic model, as well as the link weights to the identified children. (Note that child table 706 is optional; it is not necessary for most of the operations we discuss.)
- link table 708 is populated during the process of characterizing a document.
- Link table 708 includes entries for links to consider as evidence while constructing an evidence tree as is discussed below with reference to FIGS. 8-11 . Each entry in link table 708 contains the weight for an associated link as well as the identifier for the associated parent node. Moreover, link table 708 can be sorted by parent identifier as is discussed below.
- FIG. 8 presents a flow chart of the characterization process in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the system starts by receiving a document containing a set of words (step 802 ).
- this document can include a web page or a set of terms (words) from a query.
- the system selects a set of “candidate clusters” from the probabilistic model that are likely to be active in generating the set of words (step 804 ). This process is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 9 . Note that by selecting a set of candidate clusters, the system limits the number of clusters that are considered in subsequent computational operations, thereby reducing the amount of computation involved in characterizing the document.
- the system then constructs a vector (set of components) to characterize the document (step 806 ).
- This vector includes components for candidate clusters, wherein each component of the vector indicates a degree to which the corresponding candidate cluster was active in generating the set of words in the document. This process is described in more detail below with reference to FIGS. 10-11 .
- the system can use this vector to facilitate a number of different operations related to the document (step 808 ). Some of these uses are listed below in a following section of this specification entitled “Uses of the Model”.
- FIG. 9 presents of a flow chart of the process for selecting candidate clusters in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- This flow chart describes in more detail the operations involved in performing step 804 in FIG. 8 .
- the system starts by constructing an “evidence tree” starting from terminal nodes associated with the set of words in the document and following links to parent nodes (step 902 ). As a node is selected to be part of the evidence tree, links to the node from parent nodes are inserted into link table 808 .
- the system uses the evidence tree to estimate the likelihood that each parent cluster is active in generating the set of words (step 904 ). More specifically, in one embodiment of the present invention, for a cluster node C i that only points to terminal nodes, the system estimates the likelihood that C i was involved in generating the set of words (we refer to this estimated likelihood as the “Guess of C i ”) using the following formula,
- This formula indicates that the guess of C i is the order one probability of C i multiplied by a product of conditional probability contributions from active child nodes w j of C i .
- the numerator of this contribution, ⁇ tilde over (P) ⁇ (C i ⁇ w j ), is the weight of the link from C i to w j multiplied by a guess at the activation of C i .
- the activation of C i is an indicator of the number of active links out of node C i .
- the denominator of this contribution, ⁇ tilde over (P) ⁇ (w j ) is the order one probability of w j multiplied by the number of words in the set of words.
- Score ⁇ ( C i ) ⁇ k ⁇ Contribution ⁇ ⁇ ( C k , C i ) ⁇ ⁇ j ⁇ Contribution ⁇ ⁇ ( w j , C i ) .
- conditional probability contributions come from other cluster nodes C k as well as from child nodes w j .
- the system marks terminal nodes during the estimation process for a given cluster node to ensure that terminal nodes are not factored into the estimation more than once.
- the system selects parent nodes to be candidate cluster nodes based on these estimated likelihoods (step 906 ).
- the system has a set of candidate clusters to consider along with their activations.
- FIG. 10 presents a flow chart of the process of approximating probabilities for candidate clusters in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the system first selects states for the probabilistic model that are likely to have generated the set of words (step 1002 ).
- the system constructs the vector, wherein the vector includes components for candidate clusters. Each of these components indicates a likelihood that a corresponding candidate cluster is active in generating the set of words.
- the system considers only selected states in approximating the probability that an associated candidate cluster is active in generating the set of words (step 1004 ).
- P ⁇ ( C i ) ⁇ P network ⁇ ( C i ⁇ ⁇ is ⁇ ⁇ on ) ⁇ P network ⁇ ( explored ) .
- This formula indicates that P(C i ) is the sum of the network probabilities for networks in which C i is discovered to be active divided by the sum of all network probabilities for networks that have been explored.
- the probability of a given network state occurring can be calculated as,
- P network ⁇ nodes ⁇ ⁇ j that ⁇ ⁇ are ⁇ ⁇ on ⁇ ( 1 - ⁇ nodes ⁇ ⁇ i ⁇ ⁇ that ⁇ ⁇ are on ⁇ ⁇ and ⁇ ⁇ point ⁇ ⁇ to ⁇ ⁇ j ⁇ ( 1 - w i ⁇ j ) ) ⁇ ⁇ nodes ⁇ ⁇ k that ⁇ ⁇ are ⁇ ⁇ off ⁇ ( ⁇ nodes ⁇ ⁇ i ⁇ ⁇ that ⁇ ⁇ are on ⁇ ⁇ and ⁇ ⁇ point ⁇ ⁇ to ⁇ ⁇ k ⁇ ( 1 - w i ⁇ k ) )
- This probability includes contributions from nodes that are “on”.
- the system computes the probability that at least one link into j (from an active parent node i) fires. This is one minus the probability that no link into j from an active parent node i fires, wherein the probability that a link from an active node does not fire is one minus the link weight.
- the probability also includes contributions from nodes k that are “off”. For a given node k that is off, the contribution is the probability that no link points to k from active node i, which is simply the product of one minus the link weights.
- FIG. 11 illustrates how states for the probabilistic model are selected in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- This flow chart describes in more detail the operations involved in performing step 1002 in FIG. 11 .
- one embodiment of the present invention considers only candidate cluster nodes and terminal nodes associated with the set of words in the document. All other terminals are assumed to be off and are summarized in a simple term which is used to reduce the probability of the parent being on.
- the system starts by randomly selecting a starting state for the probabilistic model (step 1102 ).
- Each starting state indicates which nodes in the probabilistic model are active and which ones are not. Note that any starting state is possible because the universal node can trigger any subset of the candidate nodes to fire.
- link weights in the probabilistic model tend to make some states more likely than others in generating the set of words in the document. Hence, it is unlikely that a random starting state would have generated the set of words in the document.
- the system performs “hill-climbing” operations to reach a state that is likely to have generated the set of words in the document (step 1104 ).
- hill-climbing operation typically changes the state of the system in a manner that increases the value of a specific objective function.
- the objective function is the probability of a given network state occurring, P network , which is described above.
- the system periodically changes the state of an individual candidate cluster between hill-climbing operations without regards to the objective function. In doing so, the system fixes the changed state so it does not change during subsequent hill-climbing operations. This produces a local optimum for the objective function, which includes the changed state, which enables to system to explore states of the probabilistic model that are otherwise unreachable through only hill-climbing operations.
- FIG. 12 presents a flow chart summarizing the learning process in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the system first receives a current model (step 1202 ).
- a current model can be created from a set of words by: (1) generating a universal node that is always active; (2) generating terminal nodes representing words in the set of words; (3) generating cluster nodes by selecting training instances; and (4) directly linking the universal node with all the nodes.
- the system receives a set of training documents (step 1204 ).
- the system starts with a small set of training documents for an initial iteration, and doubles the number of training documents in each subsequent iteration until all available training documents are used. This allows the system to learn larger concepts, which require fewer training documents to learn, during the earlier iterations.
- the system applies the set of training documents to links defined in the current model to produce weights for corresponding links in the new model.
- the system maintains counters for links and prospective links in the current model to count the expected number of times the links and prospective links are activated during the training process (step 1206 ), where the expectation is over the probability that the links are activated given the training data
- EM expectation maximization
- the system then selectively deletes clusters from the new model (step 1210 ). This process is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 13 .
- the system then considers the new model to be the current model (step 1212 ) and repeats the process for a number of iterations to produce a generative model explains the set of training documents.
- FIG. 13 presents a flow chart of the process of selectively deleting cluster nodes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. This flow chart illustrates in more detail what takes place during step 1210 in the flow chart illustrated in FIG. 12 .
- the system determines the number of outgoing links from the cluster node to other nodes (step 1302 ). These other nodes can be terminal nodes associated with words or other cluster nodes. Using the expected counts collected over the training data, the system also determines the frequency with which the cluster node is activated (step 1304 ). If the number of outgoing links is less than a minimum value, or if the determined frequency is less than a minimum frequency, the system deletes the cluster node (step 1306 ).
- deleting the cluster node reduces memory usage, improves computational efficiency of the model, and improves the quality of clusters returned by the model without adversely affecting the usefulness of the model. Similarly, if a cluster node is rarely activated, deleting the cluster node has similar benefits.
- the process of deleting a cluster node from the model involves: (1) deleting outgoing links from the cluster node; (2) deleting incoming links into the cluster node; and (3) deleting the cluster node itself.
- FIG. 14 presents a flow chart illustrating the process of identifying and merging similar cluster nodes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- this merging process takes place during a separate iteration of the training process illustrated in FIG. 13 . Note that this merging iteration can be interspersed with the training iterations illustrated in FIG. 13 .
- the system first receives the current model (step 1402 ).
- the system determines whether cluster nodes in the current model “explain” other cluster nodes in the current model (step 1404 ).
- step 1404 determines whether cluster nodes in the current model “explain” other cluster nodes in the current model.
- the system merges the two cluster nodes to form a combined cluster node (step 1406 ).
- This process is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 16 .
- FIG. 15 presents a flow chart illustrating the process of determining whether cluster nodes explain each other in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. During this process, the system iteratively analyzes each given cluster node to determine which other cluster nodes explain the given cluster node.
- the system forms a query which includes a set of “top words” associated with the cluster node (step 1502 ).
- This set of top words can include words whose nodes are most likely to fire if the cluster node fires.
- the system runs the query against the current model minus the given cluster node to produce a set of resulting cluster nodes (step 1504 ). More specifically, the given cluster node is temporarily removed from the current model and the query is run against this temporarily modified model. The query produces a set of resulting cluster nodes.
- the system determines that the resulting cluster node explains the given cluster node (step 1505 ).
- FIG. 16 presents a flow chart illustrating the process of merging two cluster nodes to form a combined cluster node in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the system merges the parents of the two cluster nodes to produce a set of parents for the combined cluster node (step 1602 ).
- the system also merges the children of the two cluster nodes to produce a set of children for the combined cluster node (step 1604 ).
- the system makes the given cluster node a child but not a parent of the combined cluster node (step 1606 ). This makes sense because in our model parent nodes occur more frequently than their child nodes. Because the combined cluster node will by definition be more frequent than the given cluster node, the given cluster node should be a child and not a parent of the combined cluster node.
- the system combines the two weighted links into a single combined weighted link (step 1608 ).
- the weight on this combined weighted link can be calculated by exponentially combining (or even adding) the weights of the two weighted links. Note that any reasonable approximation for the combined weight can be used because subsequent iterations of the training process will further refine the weight on this combined weighted link.
Abstract
Description
wherein
{tilde over (P)}(C i →w j)=(weightC
and wherein
{tilde over (P)}(w j)=O1(w j)×(# words).
Guess(C i)=O1(C i)·Score(C i),
wherein
wherein P(Ck|Ci) is the conditional probability of Ck given Ci, P(Ck) is the order one probability of Ck, and Score(Ck) is the previously calculated score of Ck. Note that since the evidence tree is constructed from terminals up, the score of the child node Ck will have been computed before the score of the parent node Ci is computed.
V i=Activation(C i)×P(C i),
wherein the Activation(Ci) is an indicator of the number of links that will fire if node Ci fires, and wherein P(Ci) is the probability that Ci is active in generating the set of words in the document.
This formula indicates that P(Ci) is the sum of the network probabilities for networks in which Ci is discovered to be active divided by the sum of all network probabilities for networks that have been explored.
This probability includes contributions from nodes that are “on”. More specifically, for each node j that is on in a given network, the system computes the probability that at least one link into j (from an active parent node i) fires. This is one minus the probability that no link into j from an active parent node i fires, wherein the probability that a link from an active node does not fire is one minus the link weight.
-
- (1) Guessing at the concepts behind a piece of text. The concepts can then be displayed to a user allowing the user to better understand the meaning behind the text.
- (2) Comparing the words and concepts between a document and a query. This can be the information retrieval scoring function that is required in any document search engine, including the special case where the documents are web pages.
- (3) A different way of using our model for web search is to assume that the distribution of clusters extends the query. For example, a query for the word “jaguar” is ambiguous. It could mean either the animal or the car. Our model will identify clusters that relate to both meanings in response to this search. In this case, we can consider that the user typed in one of either two queries, the jaguar (CAR) query or the jaguar (ANIMAL) query. We can then retrieve documents for both of these queries taking into account the ratio of their respective clusters' probabilities. By carefully balancing how many results we return for each meaning, we assure a certain diversity of results for a search.
- (4) Comparing the words and concepts between a document and an advertisement. This can be used as a proxy for how well an advertisement will perform if attached to a certain piece of content. A specialization of this is attaching advertisements to web pages.
- (5) Comparing the words and concepts between a query and an advertisement (or targeting criteria for an advertisement). In search engines, advertisers often select a set of “targeting criteria”, which when they show up in user queries, and ad is served. The text of these criteria (and the ad copy itself) can be compared to a query via the use of clusters in our model. This comparison can be a proxy for how well the ad will perform if served on a search page resulting from the query.
- (6) Comparing the words and concepts between two documents. This can be used as a distance metric for conceptual clustering of documents, where similar documents are grouped together.
- (7) Projecting text into the space of clusters. The probabilities of clusters in the text can be used as features for an arbitrary classification task. For example, a pornography filter can be produced by projecting the text of a page onto clusters, and then building a classifier that uses the clusters and the words as its input.
- (8) Generalizing a web query to retrieve more results, using the bit cost or probability of a set of words or terminals given their parent clusters.
- (9) Guessing at whether a particular word is a misspelling of another word by looking at the concepts induced by the two words.
