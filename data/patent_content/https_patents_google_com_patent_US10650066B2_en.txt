- an online search provider When an online user performs an online search, an online search provider will provide primary search results to the online user. In addition to the primary search results, the online search provider may also provide additional content to the online user. This additional content may be provided by the online content providers associated with the websites included within the search results.
- a first search result may include a first or primary website associated with a first online content provider.
- the first online content provider may have a plurality of potential items of additional or secondary content, incorporating different landing pages that are related or otherwise relevant to the search specified by the online user.
- the online content provider may choose to provide additional links to the items of additional or secondary content in the form of sitelinks, which can be presented to the online user in addition to the first or primary result(s) of the search.
- sitelinks By providing such sitelinks, the online user, who may be more interested in one of the items of additional or secondary content, can directly view the item of additional or secondary content with a single click.
- Sitelinks have proven to be very successful in providing such additional or secondary content to online users. However, for some kinds of online searches, in which the search terms are very broad, the sitelinks, by themselves, may not provide enough information, or the most relevant information, to the online user, so as to prompt the online user to click on the sitelink.
- the online user may not click on any of the sitelinks provided, or may not reach the sitelink most relevant to the search specified by the user with a single click.
- click counts are important to online content providers, the loss of clicks is an undesirable outcome.

- the subject matter described herein relates generally to online content and/or online advertising.
- the methods and systems herein enable relevant items of creative text (“creatives”) stored in a content provider database to be matched with specific sitelinks.
- the resulting presentation to an online user referred to as an “enhanced sitelink,” provides additional relevant information regarding the sitelink.
- a typical content provider/advertiser may have provided a content providing network or system with hundreds or thousands of creatives, each of which may be associated with one or more keywords, geographies or languages. Some of these creatives may be relevant to a set of sitelinks that the content provider may choose to add subsequently to a campaign.
- the sitelinks do not need to originate from or belong to the same ad campaign, ad group or other entity, as the creatives with which the sitelinks are ultimately matched, as long as the sitelinks and creatives are associated with the same content provider. From a content provider standpoint, having to manually manage and possibly duplicate the creatives for sitelinks purposes can be burdensome. Manual management of creative and sitelink matching may also create consistency issues that may arise when one of the creatives or campaigns needs to be paused or changed.
- the methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effect may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: a) storing within a memory device a plurality of creatives, each creative being associated with a uniform resource locator (URL); b) canonicalizing each URL associated with each of the plurality of creatives; c) clustering the plurality of canonicalized URLs into creative clusters, wherein each creative cluster includes a plurality of clustered creatives each having a substantially similar canonicalized URL associated therewith; d) receiving, at the computing device, a sitelink having a sitelink URL associated therewith; e) canonicalizing the received sitelink URL; f) matching the canonicalized sitelink URL with one of the creative clusters to generate a candidate set of creatives for the received sitelink; g) associating a selected creative from the candidate set of creatives with the received sitelink based on at least one of filter rules

- FIG. 3B is an example screenshot 350 according to the present disclosure, showing representative search results arising from a search for “items” specified by a user 107 .
- a search specified by user 107 yields a primary result 352 , which is a link to an advertiser-specified landing page.
- Primary result 352 includes a link 354 , as well as a descriptive creative 356 .
- the search may also yield several additional or secondary results 358 - 364 including sitelinks 366 - 372 . Appearing with sitelinks 366 - 372 are descriptive texts (referred to as “creatives” or “creative texts”).

- a content provider 102 may have a plurality of landing pages, with associated URLs (forming additional or secondary results 358 - 364 , for example), that are relevant to the search ordered by user 107 .
- Each landing page (and associated URL) has one or more creative texts associated with it. These creative texts may also be associated with other landing pages (and URLs) within the advertiser website.
- AMS 106 in an example embodiment of the present disclosure, matches creatives with URLs so as to increase the relevance of the combined creative and URL to the search conducted by user 107 .
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example method 400 for enhancing, for example, sitelink 312 with creative content, such as text (shown in FIG. 3 ).
- Method 400 is described in the context of the results of a search performed by a user 107 , which yields a primary result 302 (shown in FIG. 3 ), and a plurality of additional or secondary results (also referred to as the “extension”), although some of the steps such as the storing and/or canonicalization of creatives and/or sitelinks may be performed prior to a search by a user 107 .
- “canonicalization” refers to a process for converting data that has more than one possible representation into a “standard”, “normal”, or canonical form.
- AMS 106 generates and stores 402 in a creatives database (which in an example embodiment is ad repository 136 shown in FIG. 1 ) a candidate set of creatives associated with each advertiser specified sitelink. Each sitelink has a URL associated with it, as does each creative. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, AMS 106 simply associates all creatives with the same URL as the sitelink as being part of a candidate set.
- a creatives database which in an example embodiment is ad repository 136 shown in FIG. 1
- AMS 106 simply associates all creatives with the same URL as the sitelink as being part of a candidate set.
- AMS 106 canonicalizes 404 the creative URLs to identify characteristics of the URLs that will enable the creative URLs to be grouped into creative clusters.
- Canonicalization of creative-associated URLs may be accomplished through a variety of schemes, including analyzing landing pages associated with the sitelinks to compare the contents of the respective landing pages to identify significant similarities amongst the landing pages, wherein significant similarities are determined using one or more predefined rules or parameters.
- canonicalization of creative-associated URLs includes crawling the creative-associated URL with and without a URL parameter associated with the creative-associated URL, comparing the landing pages, and removing the parameter from the creative-associated URL when the landing pages match.
- canonicalizing creative-associated URLs may include application of webmaster-supplied rules that indicate the relevance of URL parameters.
- AMS 106 forms 406 creative clusters, such that creatives within a cluster share the same canonical URL.
- AMS 106 then saves 408 the clusters in a cluster lookup table.
- AMS 106 stores data regarding advertising campaigns in campaign database or repository 150 (shown in FIG. 1 ).
- the campaign data includes sitelinks associated with various landing pages.
- sitelink URLs are canonicalized 412 to identify and account for advertiser redirects and other parameters in the URLs, used for recording and reporting site activity, that are otherwise inconsequential to directing a user to the final landing page associated with each URL.
- AMS 106 identifies parameters in a link URL that are not important to identify a corresponding landing page by crawling the link URL with and without the parameter and then comparing the landing pages in each iteration for matches. Where landing pages match after crawling, the parameter is removed.
- AMS 106 applies webmaster supplied rules as to relevance of URL parameters for landing page purposes. Following a user search, AMS 106 identifies a plurality of relevant sitelinks and refers 414 to the saved creative cluster lookup table for one or more clusters of candidate creatives to match to the specified sitelinks. In addition to, or as an alternative to associating sitelinks with ad campaigns, sitelinks may also be associated with other entities, such as ad groups.
- AMS 106 applies specific filter rules and/or policy checks related to the suitability of the creative for the specific sitelink, to eliminate matches of creatives to sitelinks that are expressly excluded, or simply inappropriate, relative to the search specified by user 107 .
- filter rules or policy checks include demographic, geographic and language checks (to ensure that the creative is appropriate to user device location, for example), user device and/or platform rules, as well as checks to ensure that the candidate creatives are compatible with the status of the ad campaign.
- AMS 106 prunes the set of candidate creatives by performing deduping to remove redundancies and duplication between creatives found for a specific sitelink and by applying other policy checks such as the size of the available candidate set and estimated measures of the improvement to ad CTR (“click-through-rate”).
- AMS 106 performs creative matching 416 .
- AMS 106 saves 418 data representing the enhanced sitelink, to be served to user 107 .
- AMS 106 performs creative matching by generating permutations of matches between one or more specified sitelinks and corresponding candidate creatives, and assigning scores to each permutation that reflects a relative value of the “fit” of each proposed match.
- the score may be based on various signals such as an impression score, which is a measure of how many times that creative was shown over a recent timeframe such as a week, and an IDF-score, which is a measure of similarity of terms between a sitelink text and a creative text.
- impression count refers to the number of times that an item, such as a creative, has been presented to online users.
- each sitelink is matched with an as yet unmatched creative with the highest score.
- Remaining sitelinks are successively matched with the next highest scoring creatives, until all sitelinks are matched with creatives.
- a total match score is determined that is below a predefined threshold, AMS 106 uses a more globally optimal matching algorithm.
- the globally optimal matching algorithm is implemented as follows. For example, two sitelinks S 1 and S 2 are to be provided to a user 107 in response to a search. Assume S 1 can be matched to two (non-duplicative) creatives C 1 and C 2 , having match scores of 10 and 8, respectively. Likewise, S 2 can also be matched to C 1 and C 2 , but with corresponding match scores of 8 and 2, respectively. In a matching scheme in which a first creative match score is optimized, the resulting association is S 1 -C 1 and S 2 -C 2 with an overall score of 12.
- FIG. 6 is an example bipartite graph 600 that may be used in matching sitelinks S 1 and S 2 with creatives C 1 and C 2 .
- AMS 106 constructs bipartite graph 600 in which a set of specified sitelinks (S 1 , S 2 ) constitutes one set of nodes and the creatives (C 1 , C 2 ) in a candidate set form the other set of nodes.
- AMS 106 adds an edge (shown as a connecting line in graph 600 ) between a sitelink node and a creative to which it can be matched and the weight of the edge (the number adjacent the connecting line) is the match-score for the respective sitelink-creative pairing.
- AMS 106 performs a constrained maximal matching on this graph to obtain the overall best score subject to the constraint that there is no inter-sitelink creative duplication.
- the bipartite matching scheme uses the numerical values from the previous example to generate an improved matching of S 1 -C 2 and S 2 -C 1 with a total score of 16.
- a path growing heuristic is used, with additional modifications to avoid seed-bias, to provide match augmentation and to account for conflict resolution.
- the basic approach is to maintain two sets of paths obtained by alternatively performing 1) expansion from a sitelink to get its best remaining creative (e.g., the assignment S 1 -C 2 provided above), with 2) expansion from a creative for its best remaining sitelink to which it can be assigned (e.g., the assignment S 2 -C 1 provided above).
- the edges visited in each step get added to one of the two path-sets in alternating fashion.
- AMS 106 checks for duplicate creatives and/or redundant creatives (similar but not identically-duplicate creatives) from amongst the selected creatives, and rejects them. In addition, AMS 106 applies a predefined size constraint, in which matches that yield a score below a predefined threshold are discarded. If there are no choices available to grow a path from a certain node, AMS 106 restarts the process with the next sitelink that has not yet been explored. AMS 106 also does not revisit a sitelink or creative node.
- AMS 106 obtains two possible assignments, In one example, AMS 106 additionally attempts to ‘augment’ these assignments by checking if there are any unassigned sitelinks in each assignment. If unassigned sitelinks exist, they are matched with any available creatives that are eligible.
- AMS 106 selects the assignment that has a higher score and meets the size constraint.
- the creative matching process using the described algorithm, could yield different results based on the order in which sitelinks are initially arranged. This ‘seed-bias’ can be resolved by repeating the matching with different orders.
- AMS 106 may apply rules, applicable for example to more than 6 sitelinks, to define subsets in order to limit the number of permutations that are performed, to streamline the matching process.
- FIG. 7 is another example bipartite graph 700 illustrating a slightly more complex scenario than that illustrated in FIG. 6 .
- sitelinks S 1 and S 2 can be potentially matched with creatives C 1 , C 2 or C 3 .
- S 1 can be matched with C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 , with scores of 10, 8, and 5, respectively.
- C 2 can be matched with C 1 and C 2 with scores of 8 and 5, respectively.
- an optimal matching must take this constraint into consideration. Further, it is possible that C 1 and C 2 cannot both be part of the same matching as they may be deemed redundant to one another. In such a situation, an optimal matching would be S 1 -C 3 and S 2 -C 1 .
- creatives may be ranked by metrics in addition to, or other than, impression count.
- Such an approach is desirable when a set of candidate creatives are not otherwise clearly differentiated by their respective impression counts.
- such an approach improves the quality of the results of the matching process by ensuring that the creatives shown in association with the selected sitelinks are related to the text in the sitelink.
- an additional scoring factor referred to herein as an IDF score.
- IDF refers to “inverse-document-frequency,” which refers to one of a number of known methodologies for analyzing term frequency within a document (or item of publication), while correcting for terms that are simply generally frequently encountered in a group of documents (or items of publication).
- both sitelink text and creative text are normalized.

Abstract
Description
Creative Score=w1×Impression Score+w2×IDF Score,
where 0≤w1≤1 and 0≤w2≤1. When w1=1, and w2=0, only impression scores are counted. When w1=0 and w2=1, only IDF based scores are counted. In one embodiment, when performing IDF scoring, both sitelink text and creative text are normalized. As used herein, “normalized” means that terms are reduced to their stems, and stopwords (typically, short, functional words such as “the,” “is,” “at,” “which,” and “on”) are removed. The IDF score is the weighted sum of words common to both a creative and an associated sitelink. In addition, IDF scoring may be performed in a uniform mode, in which no external influences are used, and all terms are given equal weight. Alternatively, in a non-uniform mode, different terms may be given different weights, based on external considerations. For example, the term “sale” may have a high IDF weight in a general corpus of text items, but may carry a lower weight in a corpus comprised of only creatives.
