Definitions
- Systems and methods described herein relate to image scanning and, more particularly, to techniques for scanning and locating features in documents.
- OCR optical character recognition
- One aspect is directed to a system that includes a stereoscopic camera to generate images of opposing pages of a document from which a three-dimensional image of a surface of the opposing pages of the document is generated.
- the system further includes control logic to process the three-dimensional image to locate a groove between the opposing pages of the document that is defined by the spine of the document.
- Another aspect is directed to a computer-implemented method for detecting a groove caused by a spine of a document.
- the method includes generating scores for points in a three-dimensional image that defines a surface of the document, where the scores quantify a likelihood that a particular point is in the groove.
- the method further includes detecting the groove based on the generated scores.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a book that is to be scanned
- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a frontal view of the book shown in FIG. 1 ;
- FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary system for optically scanning documents, such as books or magazines, to obtain images of the documents;
- FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary pattern
- FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary implementation of the control logic shown in FIG. 3 ;
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary operations of the system shown in FIG. 3 in processing a page of a document;
- FIGS. 7A and 7B are diagrams of an opened document, such as a book, on a platform;
- FIG. 8 is a graph illustrating an exemplary biasing function that may be applied to the points of an image
- FIG. 9 is a top view of a document similar to that shown in FIG. 7A , in which a number of possible candidate lines are illustrated.
- FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating one exemplary application of the concepts described herein relating to locating a central groove in a document.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a book 100 that is to be scanned. Pages 101 - 104 of book 100 emanate from a central groove 110 that is defined by the spine of the book. Page 104 is shown as the opened-to left page of the book. In contrast to a page of paper placed flat on a surface, page 104 includes a three-dimensional profile.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a frontal view of book 100 . From this view, it can be seen that groove 110 is generally defined by a dip or “hole” located in the vicinity of the middle of the book. Consistent with aspects of the invention, a central groove, such as groove 110 , may be automatically located and identified in a three-dimensional image of surface of a document.
- FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary system 300 for optically scanning documents, such as books, magazines, or catalogs, to obtain images of the documents.
- System 300 may include cameras 305 and 310 for taking two-dimensional images of a book 301 resting on a platform 302 .
- Documents other than books, such as, for example, magazines or other documents for which it is difficult to generate a flat image of a page, may also be processed.
- An infra-red (IR) stereo camera 315 may include multiple imaging lenses 320 spaced at known distances from one another.
- An IR projector 325 may project IR radiation through a pattern mask 330 onto book 301 .
- Control logic 350 may control the operation of system 300 .
- control logic 350 may control cameras 305 , 310 , and 315 , and receive and process images taken by these cameras.
- Cameras 305 and 310 may include high definition cameras. In some implementations, only one of cameras 305 and 310 may be used. In other implementations, additional cameras similar to cameras 305 and 310 may be used.
- IR stereo camera 315 by virtue of its multiple imaging lenses 320 , can take multiple images of book 301 , each from different viewpoints.
- the images may be set to be taken in the IR spectrum.
- IR projector 325 may project IR radiation through pattern mask 330 onto book 301 .
- IR stereo camera 315 may take a stereoscopic image of the pattern defined by pattern mask 330 .
- the pattern may then be detected in the resulting image.
- the pattern may include a pattern that resembles a maze. Because the relative positions of imaging lenses 320 are known, the images can be stereoscopically combined (by, for example, control logic 350 ), using known stereoscopic techniques, to obtain a three-dimensional mapping of the pattern.
- the pattern falls on the surface of book 301 , causing the three-dimensional mapping of the pattern to correspond to the three-dimensional surface of the page of the book.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary portion of a pattern.
- the pattern may be superimposed on the surface of a three-dimensional page.
- Control logic 350 may detect and record the three-dimensional position of the pattern, which may be used to define the surface of a page in three-dimensional space.
- FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary implementation of control logic 350 .
- Control logic 350 may include a bus 510 , a processor 520 , a main memory 530 , a read only memory (ROM) 540 , a storage device 550 , an input device 560 , an output device 570 , and a communication interface 580 .
- Bus 510 may include a path that permits communication among the components of control logic 350 .
- Processor 520 may include a conventional processor, microprocessor, or processing logic that interprets and executes instructions.
- Main memory 530 may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by processor 520 .
- ROM 540 may include a conventional ROM device or another type of static storage device that stores static information and instructions for use by processor 520 .
- Storage device 550 may include a magnetic and/or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive.
- Input device 560 may include a conventional mechanism that permits a user to input information to control logic 350 , such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and/or a biometric mechanism, etc.
- Output device 570 may include a conventional mechanism that outputs information to the user, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc.
- Communication interface 580 may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables control logic 350 to communicate with other devices and/or systems.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary operations of system 300 in processing a page of a document.
- System 300 may begin by gathering data (act 601 ).
- the gathered data may include stereo images taken by IR stereo camera 315 .
- high definition two-dimensional images taken by cameras 310 and 305 may also be gathered; although this data is not necessary for groove detection as described herein, it may be useful for further image processing, such as OCR processing.
- the stereo images may include a pattern created by transmitting IR radiation from IR projector 325 through pattern mask 330 and onto the surface of the open pages in the document.
- the data gathered in act 601 may be saved to a computer-readable medium, and in the case of the stereo images, may be processed to match the pattern in at least two of the stereo images in order to recover the three-dimensional position of each pixel (point) in the image.
- the recognized three-dimensional image of objects will be referred to herein as a set of three-dimensional points that define the surface of the document (and potentially the platform) in three-dimensional space.
- FIGS. 7A and 7B are diagrams of an opened document 710 , such as a book, on a platform 720 , and having a central groove 705 .
- the set of three-dimensional points gathered in act 601 may be gathered for document 710 and platform 720 .
- FIG. 7A is a top view of document 710 .
- FIG. 7B is a front view of document 710 taken along the line A-A′ in FIG. 7A .
- Document 710 which can be thought of as an object in a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate (X,Y,Z) image space, is shown along the Y and X axes in FIG. 7A and the X and Z axes in FIG. 7B .
- the three-dimensional set of points may be processed to locate the central groove of the document in a number of iterative passes over the document surface at varying levels of resolution.
- a first resolution may be chosen (act 602 ).
- the first resolution may be a relatively coarse resolution in which only a small subset of all the available points are used.
- the points may be determined as a subset of the points that are each a fixed distance from one another in the X-Y plane ( FIG. 7A ).
- a score may be generated (act 603 ).
- the score may be generally defined to quantify the likelihood that the point is in the central groove. For example, one score may be defined as: (z 1 ⁇ z 0 )+(z ⁇ 1 ⁇ z 0 ), (eq. 1) where z 0 is the Z coordinate value of the point being considered, z 1 is the Z coordinate value of the point immediately to the right of z 0 along the X axis, and z ⁇ 1 is the Z coordinate value of the point immediately to the left of z 0 along the X axis. Three exemplary points z ⁇ 1 , z 0 , and z 1 are shown in FIG.
- the score for this point will be relatively high relative to the scores for other points.
- the score for the points z ⁇ 1 ′, z 0 ′, and z 1 ′ (on platform 720 ) will be approximately zero and the score for the points z ⁇ 1 ′′, z 0 ′′, and z 1 ′′ may be less than zero.
- scores may optionally only be calculated for points in which z 1 >z 0 and z ⁇ 1 >z 0 . Points that do not satisfy this constraint may be assigned a predetermined value, such as zero, or may be excluded from further consideration for being in the central groove.
- Document 710 will normally be placed on platform 720 such that central groove 705 is in the vicinity of the middle of platform 720 .
- the scores generated in act 603 may optionally be biased towards points that are generally in the middle of the image (act 604 ). For example, points towards the middle of the image may be boosted in score while points toward the edges may be reduced in score.
- FIG. 8 is a graph 800 illustrating an exemplary biasing function that may be applied to the points.
- one or more candidate lines may be determined as corresponding to central groove 705 (act 605 ).
- the candidate line(s) may be determined by searching for lines through the points that define the surface of the document for which the sum of the scores for the points in the line is maximized.
- FIG. 9 is a top view of document 710 , similar to that shown in FIG. 7A , in which a number of possible candidate lines are illustrated. Of the three lines 901 - 904 , line 904 , which passes near the actual center groove 705 , will include points that have the highest total score. Accordingly, this line will be considered the most likely candidate line generated in act 605 .
- Acts 603 - 605 may be repeated a number of different times using successively finer resolutions.
- the resolution in the vicinity of the most likely candidate lines can be increased by determining a new subset of the points that are each a smaller fixed distance from one another in the X-Y plane than the fixed distance used in the previous iteration (acts 606 and 607 ).
- Whether the previous iteration was the final iteration (act 606 ) can be determined by a number of factors, such as whether a predetermined resolution was reached (e.g., the scanned resolution of the points) or whether the score of the leading candidate line relative to the next likely candidate line is above a certain value.
- the highest scoring candidate line may then be determined to be central groove 705 (act 608 ).
- Control logic 350 may store an indication of the determined central groove 705 for later or immediate processing.
- FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating one exemplary application of the concepts described herein relating to locating a central groove in a document.
- Books may be scanned using a system such as that shown in FIG. 3 .
- an operator may turn each page of the current book and instruct system 300 to scan and process each page as described above.
- the resulting image data including two-dimensional image data from cameras 305 and 310 and a three-dimensional map of the surface of the book may be stored in a repository 1005 along with an indication of the location of the central groove.
- the two-dimensional/three-dimensional data may then be processed into a more useful form.
- the processing may involve techniques that rely on the location of the central groove, such as de-warping the two-dimensional images of the scanned document.
- the two-dimensional images of the book 1010 may be stored with a corresponding OCR textual version of the book 1015 .
- One or both of the OCR textual data and the images of the pages may then be returned, over network 1020 , to clients 1025 as search results.
- the central groove was located by generating, for select three-dimensional points on the surface of the document, a score that generally defines the likelihood that the point is at a local minimum (in a “hole”). Lines are then fitted through multiple points, and the line with the maximum summed score may be considered to be a line traversing the central groove.
