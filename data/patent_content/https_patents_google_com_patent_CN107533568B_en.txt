Detailed Description
The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The accompanying drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, the present subject matter is not limited to and may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.
The subject technology provides systems and methods that facilitate adaptive and automatic setting of zoom levels for displaying application content. The application content may be associated with a web-based application, a mobile application, and/or a desktop application. For example, the application content may include a web page. The zoom level may be set based on the characteristics of the content contained in the web page and/or the user's preferences. The web page may be viewed at the set zoom level in a web client application (e.g., a web browser application) running on the user's computing device. The zoom level may be automatically set such that the application content is displayed (e.g., in a web client application) by the computing device at the adaptively set zoom level without manual intervention by the user. When a user adjusts the zoom level set by the subject technology for displaying a specified web page, the user provides feedback to the subject technology. In this case, the subject technology can adjust the user preferences based on the received feedback and use the adjusted user preferences to set a zoom level for subsequent web pages viewed by the user.
FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary network environment 100 that facilitates adaptive setting of zoom levels for displaying web pages in accordance with the subject technology. Network environment 100 includes computing devices 102,104, and 106 (hereinafter "102-106"), and computing systems 110 and 112 (hereinafter "110-112"). Computing devices 102-106 and computing systems 110-112 can communicate with each other over network 108. Each of computing systems 110-112 can include one or more servers 114 and 116 and one or more data stores 118 and 120. In some aspects, the network environment 100 can have more or fewer computing devices (e.g., 102-106) and/or computing systems (e.g., 110-112) than shown in FIG. 1.
Each of computing devices 102-106 can represent various forms of processing devices having a processor, memory, and communication capabilities. Computing devices 102-106 may communicate with each other, computing systems 110-112, and/or other systems and devices not shown in FIG. 1. By way of non-limiting example, the processing device can include a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a network appliance, a camera, a smart phone, an Enhanced General Packet Radio Service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a game console, or a combination of any of these or other processing devices.
In an exemplary aspect, any of the computing devices 102-106 may execute computer instructions to run a web client application (e.g., a web browser application) and display web pages in the web client application. Computing devices 102-106 may locally store user preferences associated with zoom levels for displaying web pages. The web client application may request a web document associated with the web page and render the web document for display of the web page. The web documents may include hypertext markup language (HTML) documents and related style sheets, such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). For example, any of the computing devices 102-106 may request a web document associated with the web page from a web host server hosting the website containing the web page. web documents may also include documents associated with other markup languages, including but not limited to extensible hypertext markup language (XHTML) and extensible markup language (XML).
Computing devices 102-106 may determine and set a zoom level based on content characteristics associated with the web page and the user's preferences. The computing devices 102-106 can display web pages in view windows of the web client application, where the view windows are displayed on respective display devices (e.g., screens, monitors) associated with the computing devices 102-106. In some aspects, any of the computing devices 102-106 may be associated with multiple display devices.
Each of the computing systems 110-112 may be any system or device with a processor, memory, and communication capabilities. In some exemplary aspects, any of the computing systems 110-112 can be a single server (e.g., 114). In other implementations, any of computing systems 110-112 can represent more than one computing device working together to perform the actions of a computer server (e.g., a cluster of machines). Further, any of computing systems 110-112 can represent various forms of servers, including but not limited to web servers, application servers, proxy servers, network servers, or server farms. Computing systems 110-112 can represent various types of computing environments and architectures in which different types of instructions are executed by components of computing systems 110-112.
In an exemplary aspect, computing system 110 may execute computer instructions to host a website that provides one or more web pages. Each web page may be associated with a web document (e.g., an HTML document, CSS table). A user of any of computing devices 102-106 can input a request for a web page of a website hosted by computing system 110. Computing system 110 can provide web pages (e.g., provide web documents) to computing devices 102-106 that input the request. One or more web pages of the website can be displayed on the display devices of the computing devices 102-106 that receive the web pages. In this case, one or more web pages displayed on computing devices 102-106 are retrieved remotely from computing system 110. In some aspects, the one or more web pages are not limited to website data that is retrieved remotely from computing system 110 by computing devices 102-106. In addition to or in lieu of remotely retrieved website data, the website data may be retrieved from local memory of the computing devices 102-106. In some aspects, computing system 110 can include one or more servers 114, wherein the use of more than one server can facilitate load balancing between servers.
In an exemplary aspect, the computing system 112 may execute computer instructions that facilitate adaptive setting of zoom levels for displaying web pages. The computing system 112 may be associated with an online service such as an email service and/or social networking service, or other online service. When the user creates an online account for the online service, computing system 112 may allow the user to store preferences associated with zoom levels on computing system 112 (e.g., data store 120) and/or a computing system associated with the online service (not shown). User preferences associated with zoom levels may be adjusted and stored when a user performs online activities associated with a user account (e.g., checking email, consuming social network posts), and/or other online activities (e.g., browsing activities) when a user logs into a user account.
The computing system 112 may also allow user preferences to be synchronized with computing devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets, desktop computers) specified by the user and/or computing systems associated with online services specified by the user. When a user logs into an online account using computing device 102, user preferences stored on computing device 102 may be initiated to be synchronized with user preferences stored on computing system 112. Synchronization of user preferences stored on other computing devices designated by the user to allow synchronization with user preferences stored on computing system 112 may also be initiated when the user logs into the online account using these other computing devices. The user may be provided with an option to allow the user to set whether to synchronize user preferences stored in the user's computing device (e.g., computing device 102) with computing system 112 and/or other computing devices and computing systems.
In some aspects, the computing devices including 102-106 and the computing systems including 110-112 may communicate wirelessly through a communication interface (not shown), which may include digital signal processing circuitry, if necessary. For example, a computing device (e.g., 102) may communicate with another computing device (e.g., 104) and/or computing system (e.g., 110), and a computing system (e.g., 110) may communicate with another computing system (e.g., 112) and/or computing device (e.g., 102). The communication interface may provide for communication under various modes or protocols, such as a global system for mobile communications (GSM) communication voice call, Short Message Service (SMS), Enhanced Message Service (EMS) or Multimedia Message Service (MMS) messaging, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Personal Digital Cellular (PDC), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), CDMA2000, or General Packet Radio System (GPRS), among others. For example, communication may occur through a radio-frequency transceiver (not shown). Further, close range communications may occur, for example, using a bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver.
In some aspects, network environment 100 can be a distributed client/server system across one or more networks, such as network 108. Network 108 may be a large computer network such as a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), the internet, a cellular network, or a combination thereof, connecting any number of mobile clients, fixed clients, and servers. Further, the network 108 can include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, a tree or hierarchical network, and the like. In some aspects, communication between each client (e.g., computing devices 102-106) and a server (e.g., computing systems 110-112) can occur via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), a Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel, or other secure network connection. In some aspects, the network 108 may further include a corporate network (e.g., an intranet) and one or more wireless access points.
Where the systems discussed herein collect or may make use of personal information about a user, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, browsing activities, profession, user preferences, or the user's current location), or whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that is more relevant to the user. Further, certain data may be processed in one or more ways before being stored or used, such that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that no personal identity information for the user can be determined, or the geographic location of the user from which the location information is obtained (such as to city, zip code, or state level) may be generalized such that no specific location of the user can be determined. Thus, the user may control how information is collected about the user and used by the content server.
FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram that illustrates an exemplary process 200 for facilitating adaptive setting of a zoom level for displaying a web page in accordance with one or more implementations. The steps of the exemplary process 200 need not be performed in the order shown. It is to be understood that the depicted order is an example of one or more exemplary methods and is not meant to be limiting to a particular order or hierarchy of presentation. The steps can be rearranged and/or two or more steps can be performed simultaneously. For purposes of illustration, the example process 200 is described herein with reference to the computing device 102, the computing system 110 (e.g., web hosting server), and the computing system 112 of the example network environment 100 of fig. 1; however, exemplary process 200 is not limited to computing device 102, computing system 110, and computing system 112.
At block 205, the computing device 102 receives a set of web documents associated with a first web page. The computing device 102 may receive the set of web documents from a computing system 110 (e.g., a web hosting server). When computing system 110 receives the request for the first web page from computing device 102, computing system 110 may provide the set of web documents to computing device 102. A user of computing device 102 may cause a request for a first web page to be sent to computing system 110 by clicking on a link to the first web page or providing a Universal Resource Locator (URL) of the first web page to, for example, a web client application (e.g., a web browser application) executing on computing device 102. The set of web documents may include documents that, when rendered by the web client application, allow display of the first web page. For example, the set of web documents may include HTML documents and associated style sheets (e.g., CSS). The display of the first web page may be provided to the user on one or more display devices associated with the computing device 102.
At block 210, the computing device 102 determines a characteristic of content associated with the first web page based on the set of web documents. The set of web documents may contain information associated with content contained in the first web page. By way of non-limiting example, the content contained in the first web page may include text, graphics, links, scripts, and the like. The layout of the content contained in the first web page may include the font type, size and/or color and distribution of the entire first web page; paragraph and/or column layout; image position and/or size; the location and/or amount of white space, etc. As an example, text contained in the first web page may be presented in a multi-column format. As another example, there may be empty space along the left and right edges of the first web page. The presence of these empty spaces along the left and right edges may indicate that the first web page is designed using a fixed width. The set of web documents may include, for example, elements (e.g., HTML elements) and rules (e.g., CSS rules) that specify content contained in the first web page and/or specify how the content contained in the first web page is to be rendered or arranged.
In one or more implementations, the computing device 102 determines the content characteristics based on an analysis of the set of web documents. The analysis may include parsing the set of web documents to identify content and/or a layout of the content. Once the content and/or the layout of the content is identified, the content and/or the layout of the content may be represented in a format that may be utilized by the computing device 102 (e.g., a web browser application running on the computing device) to allow the first web page to be displayed. Alternatively or additionally, in one or more implementations, computing system 112 or other computing device or computing system may perform an analysis of the set of web documents and determine content characteristics based on the analysis. The computing system 112 may provide information associated with the content characteristics and/or analysis to the computing device 102.
The content properties may be based on an analysis of a Document Object Model (DOM) of the set of web documents. DOM is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in web documents. For HTML documents, objects typically contain HTML elements contained in the HTML document. To perform the DOM analysis, the web client application may parse a set of web documents, which may include HTML documents and any associated style sheets, to generate a DOM representation associated with the first web page. The DOM representation may be or include a DOM tree. The nodes of the DOM tree are formed from elements of the HTML document, where each element has a start tag, an end tag, and content related to the element (e.g., content between the start and end tags of the element). Nodes of the DOM tree may be associated with style rules contained in the relevant style sheet. Thus, the content of the first web page and the layout of the content may be represented by a DOM representation.
DOM analysis may be utilized to determine content characteristics associated with the first web page including font size distribution on the first web page, number of columns on the first web page, unused white space at the edge of the first web page, size/placement of images on the first web page, and the like. A DOM representation (e.g., DOM tree) of the first web page may be stored in the computing device 102 for later retrieval to allow the first web page to be rendered faster, such as when the user subsequently accesses the first web page. When the first web page changes, the computing device 102 may update the DOM representation of the first web page. Although the DOM analysis and DOM representation are described with reference to the first web page, the description associated with the DOM analysis and DOM representation is applicable to other web pages as well.
When the computing device 102 parses the set of web pages, a DOM representation can be built. In some aspects, to allow the content of the first web page to be displayed to the user with minimal latency from the user to the first web page, the web client application may allow the first web page to be displayed while the set of web documents is being parsed without having to wait to parse the entire set of web documents before displaying the first web page. Computing device 102 may download the set of web documents from computing system 110 and store the set of web documents locally in computing device 102. A web client application running on the computing device 102 may retrieve a set of web documents stored locally in the computing device 102, parse the set of web documents, and allow the first web page to be displayed when the set of web documents is parsed.
Although described above with reference to a DOM representation, other ways of representing the content and/or the layout of the content associated with the set of web documents may be utilized. The representation may be in any format that may be utilized by the computing device 102 to allow the first web page to be displayed.
In one or more implementations, the computing device 102 may determine the content characteristics based on an image content analysis of image content contained in the first web page. Alternatively or additionally, the image content analysis may be performed by an image content analysis service that is remote from the computing device 102. The image content analysis service may be provided by the computing system 112 and/or an image content analysis server not shown in the network environment 100 of fig. 1. For example, image content analysis may be used to detect objects, such as human or animal faces, landscapes (e.g., bodies of water, mountains, forests, etc.), buildings, etc., represented by image content contained in the first web page.
At block 215, the computing device 102 determines user preferences associated with the zoom level. The user preferences may be stored, for example, locally in computing device 102 and/or remotely (e.g., in computing system 112). The user preferences may be determined based on previous browsing activities and user input associated with zoom levels associated with the previous browsing activities. The previous browsing activity may include a previous web page visited by the user before the user visited the first web page. In providing the user input, the user input may include a user manually setting a zoom level for displaying the web page. For example, if a user sets a zoom level that causes the physical size of text of one or more web pages to be greater than a certain size, the computing device 102 may determine user preferences related to the physical size of the text based on the user manually setting the zoom level. In some aspects, the user may manually set user preferences to be applied to a web page accessed by the user through options provided to the user (e.g., by a web client application), such as options provided to the user to allow the user to set user preferences regarding the size of text displayed to the user. Although text size is provided as an example above, user preferences for setting zoom levels related to other content characteristics in addition to text size may also be determined based on content characteristics associated with previous browsing activities and user input associated with zoom levels related to previous browsing activities.
User preferences associated with various content characteristics may be categorized into respective importance levels associated with the various content characteristics. For example, a given content property may be classified as one of a "high importance", "medium importance", and "low importance" rating. As another example, a given content characteristic may be classified using a numerical scale, such as 1 for "least importance" and 5 for "highest importance". Other ways of representing the importance level of a given content property may be utilized.
The respective importance levels may be associated with content characteristics such as font size, font size distribution, amount and location of white space on the web page, size and location of images on the web page, content of the images, and so forth. The respective importance may also be applied to the respective physical sizes of the font sizes, such that a font size associated with a certain physical size may be associated with one importance level, while a font size associated with another physical size may be associated with another importance level.
Content properties associated with higher importance levels have a greater impact on the zoom level determined and set by the computing device 102 to display the first web page, while content properties associated with lower importance levels may have less or no impact. The importance level associated with the content property may also indicate whether a higher or lower zoom level should be utilized for the presence or absence of the content property.
In one or more implementations, the user preferences may be based on eye tracking technology. Where the user allows analysis of the user's eye movement on the user's display device, the preferences may be based on content characteristics determined to be of interest to the user (e.g., images of people, subtitles under images, white space along the edges of the first web page, etc.) as well as those content characteristics determined to be of interest to the user. The user preference may be determined for content characteristics that draw the attention of the user such that the user lowers the set zoom level, raises the set zoom level, or does not change the set zoom level. The importance level associated with the content characteristics may be based on information obtained from eye tracking techniques.
In some aspects, a user may be provided with an aspect for manually setting user preferences (e.g., by a web client application) and/or otherwise providing information related to user preferences. For example, the user may provide a distance between the user and one or more of the user's display devices and/or may provide an importance rating related to one or more content characteristics.
These content properties, such as font size, font size distribution, etc., may be part of a set of predetermined content properties that are used to determine user preferences and zoom levels. In one or more implementations, user preferences may be based on machine learning. Using machine learning, based on user feedback (e.g., manually adjusting a set zoom level), the computing device 102 may identify additional content characteristics that may affect the user's desired zoom level. The computing device 102 may identify patterns, colors, or combinations thereof that should be considered by the user's desired zoom level and other content characteristics than the predetermined set of content characteristics. For example, through machine learning, the computing device 102 may identify that the hash mark and the dot pattern consistently cause the user to adjust the zoom level set by the computing device 102 so that the user has a closer view of the hash mark and the dot pattern. The computing device 102 may then adjust the user preferences associated with the additional content characteristics based on the subsequent user feedback.
The user preferences associated with the zoom level, such as the importance level associated with the content characteristics, may be based on user feedback associated with the zoom level set by the computing device 102. The user feedback may come from, for example, a user adjusting a zoom level set by the computing device 102. As will be described with reference to fig. 3, the computing device 102 may determine and adjust user preferences, such as adjusting importance levels associated with content characteristics, based on user input that changes the zoom level set by the computing device 102. The adjustment of the user preferences allows the computing device 102 to adapt and learn the preferences of the user such that subsequent zoom levels set by the computing device 102 are conducted based on the adjusted user preferences. When additional user input is received, the frequency with which the user adjusts the zoom level set by the computing device 102 may be reduced.
The user preferences may also include the viewing environment of the user. The user's viewing environment may include the number of display devices (e.g., screens, monitors) being utilized by the user, the size and resolution of the display devices utilized by the user, the distance between the user and the display devices, and so forth. For example, the computing device 102 may include one or more built-in display devices and/or one or more external display devices (e.g., a high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) monitor, a DisplayPort monitor, etc.) connected to the computing device 102 or otherwise accessible to the computing device 102. The distance between the user and the display device may be provided by the user and/or may be determined by the display device (e.g., a smart monitor).
At block 220, the computing device 102 sets a first zoom level for displaying the first web page based on the content characteristics and the user preferences. The computing device 102 may provide a first web page for display at a first zoom level in a web client application.
The computing device 102 may determine the first zoom level by associating the presence or absence of the content characteristic with a user preference. Based on the previous browsing activity and the associated zoom level used for the browsing activity, for example, the user preferences may indicate that the user does not change the zoom level of the web client as long as the physical size of the text on the web page is visible to the user and is large enough. In these cases, the computing device 102 may set the first zoom level of the web client application such that the text of a given web page has a physical size that is historically large enough for the user. The physical size of the text that is large enough may be the minimum text size at which the user has not altered the zoom level of the web client.
In this case, for example, the user preference may indicate that display text having a physical size greater than 2 millimeters has "high importance" while other content characteristics are associated with lower importance. The computing device 102 may set the first zoom level such that the physical size of the text provided for display to the user is typically at least 2 millimeters. As another example, the user preferences may indicate that display text having a physical size greater than 2 millimeters and less than 6 millimeters has "high importance," while other content characteristics are associated with lower importance. The computing device 102 may set the first zoom level such that the physical size of the text provided for display to the user is typically between 2 millimeters and 6 millimeters.
As another example, with respect to image content on the first web page, the user preferences may indicate that the user set the web page to a higher zoom level (e.g., 150%) when the web page contains images of humans or animals and that the user keep the web page at a lower zoom level (e.g., 100%) when the web page does not contain images or contains images of humans or animals. Image content analysis may allow for the identification of human or animal faces in an image, and the results of such image content analysis may be utilized in setting a zoom level for a web page. The set first zoom level may be based on a physical size of a human or animal face provided for display to the user. For example, a user preference may indicate that a human or animal face displayed at a physical size greater than 3 centimeters along at least one dimension has "high importance," while other content characteristics are associated with lower importance. The computing device 102 may set the first zoom level such that the human or animal face provided for display to the user is typically greater than 3 centimeters along at least one dimension.
In one or more implementations, the computing device 102 may determine and set an additional zoom level for displaying the first web page based on the content characteristics and the user preferences. For example, computing device 102 may be associated with a built-in display device and an external display device that are connected to computing device 102 or otherwise associated with computing device 102. The first zoom level may be set for a built-in display device (e.g., monitor) of the computing device 102. Computing device 102 may determine and set additional zoom levels for the external display device.
Since the size and/or resolution of the display devices may be different, the zoom level for displaying the first web page on the built-in display device may be different from the zoom level of the external display device. In some cases, the computing device 102 may set the zoom levels of the built-in display device and the external display device such that the content (e.g., textual content, graphical content) appears to be the same size or nearly the same size on both display devices. In some cases, the zoom level set for each display device may take into account the relative distance between the user and the display device.
FIG. 3 illustrates a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary process for facilitating adaptive setting of zoom levels for viewing a web page in accordance with one or more implementations. The steps of the exemplary process 300 need not be performed in the order shown. It is to be understood that the illustrated order is an example of one or more exemplary methods and is not meant to be limited to the specific order or hierarchy presented. The steps may be rearranged and/or two or more steps may be performed simultaneously. For illustrative purposes, the example process 300 may be performed after the example process 200 of fig. 2. Further, the example process 300 is described herein with reference to the computing device 102, the computing system 110 (e.g., a web hosting server), and the computing system 112 of the example network environment 100 of fig. 1. However, the exemplary process 300 is not limited to the computing device 102, the computing system 110, and the computing system 112.
At block 305, the computing device 102 receives user input to adjust the zoom level set for displaying the first web page from the first zoom level to another zoom level. The user input may include a manual adjustment by the user of the first zoom level set by the computing device 102 to a different zoom level. The user input may be considered feedback that the computing device 102 set the zoom level for displaying the first web page at block 220. For example, the user input may include the user accessing a menu associated with the web client and using the menu to change the zoom level. As another example, the user input may include the user performing a predetermined action that results in adjusting the zoom level, such as the user pressing a key or combination of keys on a keyboard or the user pressing a Ctrl button on a keyboard while scrolling a mouse wheel. Where the web page is displayed on a touchscreen display device associated with the computing device 102, the user may adjust the zoom level by providing, by way of non-limiting example, a pinch gesture or a tap gesture (e.g., a double tap gesture, a triple tap gesture). Other actions to adjust the zoom level may be performed by the user and/or defined by the user.
At block 310, the computing device 102 adjusts the user preferences based on the received user input. The adjusted user preferences may be stored, for example, locally in computing device 102 and/or remotely in computing system 112. In one or more implementations, user preferences may be adjusted based on content characteristics associated with a portion of a first web page being displayed on a display device when user input is received. For example, if the user provides user input to increase the zoom level while the display device is displaying a portion of a first web page containing an image depicting a person, the computing device 102 may associate the increased zoom level of the web page with the image containing the person and adjust the user preferences accordingly.
Where the first web page contains multiple content properties associated with high importance that require satisfaction of different zoom levels, the computing device 102 may utilize the relative importance of the content properties to set the first zoom level. For example, as discussed above with reference to block 220, the first web page may include text and an image having a face, and the user may have preferences associated with the text and the image. The computing device 102 may set the first zoom level such that as many content characteristics as possible associated with high importance are satisfied.
Adjusting user preferences, such as the relative importance between content characteristics, may be based on feedback received from the user regarding the first zoom level set by the computing device 102. For example, the relative importance between the content characteristics may be determined based on user input to a first zoom level set by the computing device 102. The computing device 102 may set the first zoom level such that the physical size of the text, as provided for display to the user, is typically greater than 2 millimeters, with most human faces being less than 3 centimeters in all dimensions. If the user input adjusts the first zoom level to the second zoom level such that the face is typically greater than 3 centimeters along at least one dimension, the computing device 102 may adjust the user preference such that the importance associated with the physical size of the face as provided for display to the user is higher than the importance associated with the physical size of the text as provided for display to the user.
The adjustment to the user preference may include matching the content characteristics determined to be present or absent on the first web page with the content characteristics determined to be present or absent on the web page accessed by the user prior to accessing the first web page. Differences between content characteristics (e.g., differences in the presence or absence of content characteristics) and user feedback associated with these differences may allow the importance and relative importance of content characteristics to be determined. Further, the importance and relative importance between the physical size of text and the physical size of human or animal faces, such as in the above example, may be fine-tuned based on subsequent web pages visited by the user and subsequent feedback received from the user. Similarly, an exemplary range of 2 mm to 6 mm for the physical size of the text and/or the size of the human or animal face preferred by the user may be fine-tuned based on subsequent web pages visited by the user and subsequent feedback received from the user.
At block 315, the computing device 102 receives a second set of web documents associated with a second web page. The second set of web documents may be received by the computing device 102 from a web host server associated with the second web page. The web host server may be the computing system 112 shown in FIG. 1 or another web host server not shown in FIG. 1. The web host server associated with the second web page may provide the second set of web documents to the computing device 102 when the web host server receives a request for the second web page from the computing device 102. The second set of web documents may include HTML documents and associated style sheets (e.g., CSS sheets) that, when rendered by the web client application, allow the second web page to be displayed.
At block 320, the computing device 102 determines content characteristics associated with the second web page based on the second set of web documents. The computing device 102 may determine these content characteristics in a manner similar to that described above with reference to block 210.
At block 325, the computing device 102 sets a zoom level for displaying the second web page based on the content characteristics associated with the second web page and the adjusted user preferences. By utilizing the user preferences adjusted based on the received user input at block 305, the computing device 102 adapts the zoom level set for displaying the second web page using feedback provided by the user regarding the zoom level set by the computing device 102 for displaying the first web page.
When the user accesses additional web pages and provides feedback on the zoom level set by the computing device 102 for displaying the web pages, the computing device 102 may make additional adjustments to the user preferences based on the received user input to adjust the zoom level set by the computing device 102 to display the web pages. When the computing device 102 becomes better able to set a zoom level that the user is satisfied with (e.g., without user input to adjust the set zoom level), the user may adjust the zoom level set by the computing device 102 less frequently.
In one or more embodiments, the example processes 200 and 300 of fig. 2 and 3, respectively, may be performed on a portion of a web page. The computing device 102 may determine content characteristics of a portion of a web page, such as based on a DOM analysis of the portion of the web page, an image content analysis of the portion of the web page, and so on. The computing device 102 may determine and set a zoom level to be used for at least the portion of the web page based on the determined content characteristics and user preferences for the portion of the web page. In some aspects, after the computing device 102 has determined the content characteristics of the entire web page, the computing device 102 may use the set zoom level for displaying the portion of the web page.
In other aspects, after the computing device 102 has determined the content characteristics of the entire web page, the computing device may adjust (e.g., update) the zoom level for the portion of the web page. For example, the zoom level set for the entire web page may be the zoom level that the computing device 102 determines will allow the user to view the entire web page without the user having to adjust the zoom level when the user views any portion of the web page. In the event that a user is consuming content associated with a portion of a web page while the zoom level of the web page is being adjusted (e.g., updated) by computing device 102, a transition from one zoom level to another zoom level is provided through a smooth animation from content displayed at one zoom level to content displayed at another zoom level.
In one or more implementations, for a given display device associated with computing device 102, computing device 102 may determine a zoom level for the web page such that different portions of the web page may be set with different zoom levels. As an example, the portions may be based on a DOM representation of the web page, such as each portion being associated with a < div > element in an HTML document associated with the web page. As another example, an HTML document associated with a web page may embed content from other web pages, such as by using, for example, an < iframe > element. The computing device 102 may determine a respective zoom level for each portion of the web page that contains content that is not associated with any embedded web page. The computing device 102 may determine a respective zoom level for each portion of the web page that contains content associated with the embedded web page, where each portion may be associated with one embedded web page, for example. In some aspects, the computing device 102 may set a zoom level for the embedded web page (embedded web page) and a zoom level for the embedded web page (embedded web page) such that a ratio between the zoom level for the embedded web page and the zoom level for the embedded web page remains fixed. As another example, the portion may include any portion of a web page being displayed in a visible area of the display device, such as a portion of a web page that is visible in a view window associated with a web client application.
FIG. 4A shows a series of web client interfaces 410,430, and 450 and their respective display areas 412,432, and 452 on a display device associated with computing device 102, illustrating different zoom levels set for different portions of a web page, according to one or more embodiments. The web client interfaces 410,430, and 450 are associated with a web client application executing in the computing device 102. The web client interfaces 410,430, and 450 and their respective display areas 412,432, and 452 may be displayed on a display device in a view window associated with the web client application.
Based on the content characteristics and the user preferences of the first portion of the web page, the computing device 102 sets a zoom level of 90% for the first portion of the web page. The zoom level of 90% is set in the display area 412 of the web client interface 410. Consider that a user of the web client application performs a scroll down 415 on the web client interface 410, such as by using a swipe gesture (e.g., within the display area 412), a mouse (e.g., a scroll wheel), a keyboard, and so forth. The computing device 102 receives an indication that a first portion of the web page is moved outside of a visible region of a window associated with the web client application. In response to the scroll down 415, the content on the display device changes from the display area 412 of the web client interface 410 to the display area 432 of the web client interface 430. The user is typically provided with an animation that moves down through the web page, transitioning from display area 412 of web client interface 410 to display area 432 of web client interface 430. Computing device 102 receives an indication that the second portion of the web page is moved into the visible area of the window.
The second portion of the web page may be initially displayed at the zoom level set for the first portion of the web page. The computing device 102 may determine and set a zoom level for displaying the second portion based on the content characteristics and the user preferences associated with the second portion. The computing device 102 may then update the zoom level set for displaying the second portion of the web page. The computing device 102 sets a zoom level of 130% for the second portion of the web page. The zoom level of 130% is set in the display area 452 of the web client interface 450. The increase in zoom level from 90% to 130% may be based on user preferences associated with a higher zoom level for the portion of the web page containing the image. In display areas 412,432, and 452, the presence of image 420 may cause computing device 102 to increase the zoom level based on the user preferences.
The transition from displaying the second portion of the web page using the zoom level of 90% to displaying the second portion of the web page using the zoom level of 130% may be provided by a smooth animation. In some aspects, the zoom level of 130% may be set for the second portion before the downward scrolling 415 is completed. In these aspects, the user may see that the display area 412 transitions to the display area 452 without first transitioning to the display area 432.
As shown in the web client interface 450, upon increasing the zoom level in the display area 452, some of the content (e.g., text) near the right edge of the display area 432 is obscured in the display area 452, and a horizontal scroll bar 455 is provided in the web client interface 450 to indicate the presence of the obscured content. The web page can be translated such that the occluded content is within a visible area of a window associated with the web browser application. The user may pan to the right by tactile input, such as providing a right swipe gesture, pressing a right key on a keyboard, moving a horizontal scroll bar 455 (e.g., using a finger, stylus, mouse, etc.), and so forth.
In some aspects, the computing device 102 may pan the displayed portion of the web page to the right such that the white space 460 is outside of the view window and the previously occluded content of the web page is in the view window, as shown in fig. 4B by the web client interface 470 with its associated display area 472. The computing device 102 may transition from the display area 452 of the web client interface 450 to the display area 472 of the web client interface 470. The computing device 102 may transition directly from the display area 412 of the web client interface 410 to the display area 472 of the web client interface 470, such as when the computing device 102 sets a zoom level and performs a pan before completing the scroll down 415. When the window contains white space and certain content of the web page is obscured, the computing device 102 may perform a panning to remove the white space 460 based on the user's preferences to remove the white space from the view window.
In some aspects, the computing device 102 may include or may utilize speech recognition technology that allows for processing of spoken commands from a user. For example, the computing device 102 may include a microphone for accepting speech input from a user. The user may provide spoken commands to cause panning of the web page to the left or right and/or to cause adjustment of a zoom level used to display the web page. The user may be provided with settings that allow voice recognition to be turned on or off.
In some aspects, the computing device 102 may include or may utilize eye tracking technology that determines information associated with the user's gaze. For example, the computing device 102 may include a camera that may determine information associated with the user's gaze. By way of non-limiting example, the gaze information may include determining a location on a display device of the computing device 102 at which the user is looking and/or determining a direction in which the user is looking at the location. Using the gaze information, the computing device 102 may pan the content of the web page. For example, the computing device 102 may not pan when the user is looking at content displayed in the center of the web client view window, while the computing device 102 may pan when the user's gaze moves to a boundary (e.g., left or right) of the web client view window. The user may be provided with settings that allow the eye tracking to be turned on or off.
In one or more implementations, the web client application may reflow (reflow) the web page each time the zoom level is adjusted. Reflow of the web page may include re-rendering the web page and re-computing the content and layout of the content contained in the web page. In some aspects, the web client does not reflow the web page when the zoom level is changed. In these aspects, since increasing the zoom level may cause some content of the web page to be obscured by a window of a window associated with the web client application, the user may need to pan the web page to have the obscured content within the visible area of the view window. For example, a change in zoom level may cause the left and/or right side of the web page to be occluded, and the user may need to pan the web page left or right to see the occluded content. In one or more implementations, the web client application may provide a setting to the user that allows the user to set whether the user wishes the web page to be reflowed when adjusting the zoom level. The user may provide different settings for different web pages.
Although described above with reference to facilitating adaptive setting of a zoom level for a computing device 102 to display a web page, computing system 112 may facilitate adaptive setting of a zoom level for a display of a web page. Computing system 112 may execute one or more of the blocks shown in fig. 2 and 3. Computing system 112 may also determine different zoom levels for different portions of the web page and/or different zoom levels for different display devices associated with computing device 102. The computing system 112 may also provide information associated with the positioning of the content, such as information to pan to make the occluded content visible and/or reduce white space.
The computing system 112 may determine and set a zoom level for the web page based on content characteristics associated with the web page and user preferences stored in the computing system 112. The computing system 112 may determine the content characteristics based on an analysis of the DOM of the web document associated with the web page and/or an image content analysis. In some aspects, when computing device 102 accesses a web page, computing system 112 may determine content characteristics of the web page and provide the content characteristics to computing device 102. In other aspects, the computing system 112 may provide information associated with the web page to the computing device 102, from which the computing device 102 may derive content characteristics associated with the web page. The computing device 102 may conserve resources for processing web documents associated with web pages, for example, to determine content characteristics and/or store content characteristics. The delay in displaying the web page may also be reduced.
In one or more implementations, the computing system 112 may be or may be associated with an email service and/or a social networking service. The user preferences associated with the zoom level may be synchronized between computing device 102 and computing system 112 and between any other computing devices and computing systems specified by the user. The user may be provided with an option to set whether the computing device is designated or not designated to synchronize with the computing system 112. In the event that the user logs into a previously created account through a shared or public computing device, the zoom level for displaying the web page is set by the shared or public computing device using user preferences stored in computing system 112. However, the user may provide settings such that the user preferences are not stored locally on the shared or public computing device.
In one or more implementations, the computing system 112 may provide or may be associated with a search engine service. In these aspects, the computing system 112 may request the web page from the web host server, determine content characteristics of the web page (e.g., using DOM analysis \ image content analysis, etc.), and store the determined content characteristics. The request for web documents, determining content characteristics, and storing content characteristics may be part of a search engine index executed by a search engine service, for example.
The content characteristics may be stored in a local memory of the computing system 112 or in a memory accessible to the computing system 112, such as a memory remote from or accessible to the computing system 112. The stored content properties may be retrieved later and provided to the computing device (e.g., 102-106) requesting the web page. The computing device may then utilize the content characteristics received from the computing system 112. In some cases, computing system 112 may determine information associated with the web page and provide the information to computing device 102, from which computing device 102 derives content characteristics associated with the web page for use in determining and setting a zoom level for displaying the web page. For example, a search engine service may provide a web page and information about determined features associated with the web page in search results. The stored content properties may be in the form of, for example, a DOM representation of the web page. The computing device may then utilize the stored content properties to set a zoom level for displaying the web page.
In one or more implementations, when a computing device (e.g., 102) requests a web page from computing system 110, computing system 112 may determine whether content characteristics associated with the requested web page are pre-stored. For example, when a user using computing device 102 logs into an online account associated with computing system 112 (e.g., for an email account, a social networking account), a request for a web page by computing device 102 may be detected by computing system 112. Based on detecting the request, computing system 112 may request a web document associated with the web page from computing system 110 and determine content characteristics associated with the web page based on the web document.
In some aspects, if there are stored content characteristics for the web page, the computing system 112 may determine one or more zoom levels and provide them to the computing device 102. The zoom level may be based on the stored content characteristics and user preferences associated with the user of the computing device 102. When a user logs into a user account, the user preferences may be stored by the computing system 112 or otherwise accessible to the computing system 112. The computing system 112 may also store hardware characteristics associated with the computing device 102 as part of the user preferences. The hardware characteristics may include, for example, the number of monitors previously provided to the computing system 112 by the computing device 102, the display size of the monitors, the resolution of the monitors, and so forth.
In other aspects, if such stored content characteristics exist, the computing system 112 may provide the stored content characteristics to the computing device 102 to allow the computing device to determine and set one or more zoom levels associated with the web page. If these stored content characteristics do not exist for the web page, the computing system 112 may determine the content characteristics, provide the determined content characteristics to the computing device 102, and store the determined content characteristics for provision to the computing device in subsequent requests for the web page.
In one or more implementations, the subject technology allows a user (e.g., by computing device 102 or computing system 112) to provide settings associated with a zoom level for displaying a web page. The user may turn on or off the setting of zoom levels by computing device 102 and/or computing system 112 for some or all of the web pages accessed by the user. For example, the user may provide a blacklist of web pages for which the user wishes to manually set the zoom level, and/or a whitelist of web pages for which the user desires the computing device 102 to set the zoom level for viewing the web pages. For web pages on the blacklist, a user may specify a default zoom level for viewing the web pages, where each web page may be associated with a respective default zoom level. The user may provide settings to turn speech recognition and/or eye tracking on or off. The user may provide settings regarding whether computing device 102 or a remote service (e.g., provided by computing system 112) determines and sets a zoom level for displaying the web page. The user may be provided with other options for adjusting settings associated with setting a zoom level for displaying a web page.
While the above description has been made with reference to settings that facilitate adaptability and automatic setting of zoom levels for displaying web pages, the subject technology allows for adaptability and automatic setting of zoom levels for displaying application content other than web pages. Therefore, the above description is also applicable to other application contents. By way of non-limiting example, the subject technology may allow for setting a zoom level for displaying content in an application window associated with an application running on computing devices 102-106. The application may be used in a web-based platform, such as a web client application, and/or on other platforms, such as mobile applications and desktop applications. In this regard, the application window may be associated with, for example, a browser application as described above, as well as other types of applications such as file management applications, document processing applications, word processing applications, image processing applications, and the like.
The application content and/or layout for the application may be retrieved, in part or in whole, from local memory of the computing device 102-106 running the application. The application content may include, by way of non-limiting example, text, graphics, links, scripts, and the like. The layout of the application content may include font type, size, and/or color and distribution thereof; paragraph and/or column layout; image position and/or size; the location and/or amount of white space, etc. The computing device 102 may determine content characteristics associated with the application content and/or its layout. The computing device 102 may set a zoom level for displaying application content based on the determined content characteristics and user preferences. The computing device 102 may set different zoom levels for different portions of the application content. The user preferences may be adjusted based on user feedback of the zoom level set by the computing device 102.
For example, for a document containing text and/or image content, the computing device 102 may open the document using a word processing application. The computing device 102 may determine content characteristics of the document and set a zoom level for displaying the document based on the determined content characteristics and user preferences. As another example, for a user interface of a file management application, the computing device 102 may determine content characteristics of the user interface and set a zoom level for displaying the user interface. The user interface may include folder icons, file icons, and any text associated with the folder and file icons. In some aspects, some or all of the user preferences for setting zoom levels for displaying web pages may be used to set zoom levels for displaying other application content, and vice versa. User preferences associated with displaying application content other than web pages can be stored locally on computing device 102 and/or remotely (e.g., on computing system 112).
In one or more implementations, a zoom level for one application (e.g., a file management application) may be set with user preferences determined based on user interaction with the other application (e.g., a word processing application). For example, user preferences obtained directly through user interaction with a text processing application (such as a user preparing a document using a word processing application) may be used in setting a zoom level for a file management application. As one example, if the user preferences indicate that the physical size of text provided by the text processing application for display to the user is typically greater than 2 millimeters, the computing device 102 may cause the file management application to be set at a zoom level such that the physical size of text provided by the file management application for display to the user is typically greater than 2 millimeters.
Alternatively or additionally, the user preferences determined based on the user's interaction with one application may be separate from the user preferences determined based on the user's interaction with another application. For example, while user preferences determined based on user interaction with the word processing and file management applications may be shared between applications to determine the zoom level of the applications, user preferences determined based on user interaction with the image processing applications may not be shared with the word processing and file management applications. In this regard, the zoom level set for displaying content in the image processing application may not affect the zoom level set for displaying content in the word processing application and the file management application.
This decoupling of user preferences and/or zoom levels set between different applications may be based on feedback from the user. User preferences associated with one application may deviate from user preferences associated with another application. For example, the computing device 102 may determine that the user manually adjusts the zoom level in the image processing application based primarily on image content rather than text content, while the computing device 102 may determine that the user manually adjusts the zoom level in the word processing application based primarily on text content rather than image content.
Figure 5 conceptually illustrates an exemplary electronic system 500 with which some embodiments of the subject technology can be implemented. Electronic system 500 can be a computer, telephone, PDA, or any other type of electronic device. Such electronic systems include various types of computer-readable media and interfaces for various other types of computer-readable media. Electronic system 500 may be any of computing devices 102-106 and any of computing systems 110-112 shown in FIG. 1. Electronic system 500 includes bus 508, processing unit 512, system memory 504, Read Only Memory (ROM)510, permanent storage device 502, input device interface 514, output device interface 506, and network interface 516.
Other embodiments use removable storage devices (e.g., floppy disks, flash drives, and their corresponding disk drives) as the permanent storage device 502. Like the persistent storage device 502, the system memory 504 is a read-write memory device. Unlike storage device 502, however, system memory 504 is a volatile read-and-write memory, such as a random access memory. The system memory 504 stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some embodiments, the processes of the subject disclosure are stored in system memory 504, permanent storage 502, and/or ROM 510. For example, according to some embodiments, various memory units include instructions that facilitate adaptive setting of zoom levels for displaying application content. Processing unit 512 retrieves instructions to be executed and data to be processed from these various memory units in order to perform the processes of some embodiments.
The bus 508 is also connected to an input device interface 514 and an output device interface 506. The input device interface 514 enables a user to communicate information and select commands for the electronic system. Input devices used with input device interface 514 include, for example, alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices (also referred to as "cursor control devices"). Output device interface 506 can, for example, display images generated by electronic system 500. Output devices for use with output device interface 506 include: such as printers and display devices, such as Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) or Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). Some embodiments include, for example, a device that acts as a touch screen for both input and output devices.
Finally, as shown in FIG. 5, bus 508 also couples electronic system 500 to a network (not shown) through network interface 516. In this manner, the computer can be part of a network of computers (e.g., a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), or an intranet, or a network of networks such as the Internet.
Many of the above-described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer-readable storage medium (also referred to as computer-readable media). When executed by one or more processing units (e.g., one or more processors, cores of a processor, or other processing units), these instructions cause the processing unit to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of computer readable media include, but are not limited to, CD-ROMs, flash memory, RAM chips, hard disks, EPROMs, and the like. The computer readable medium does not include carrier waves or electronic signals that are communicated wirelessly or over a wired connection.
In this specification, the term "software" is intended to encompass firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage devices that can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also, in some embodiments, various software aspects of the subject disclosure may be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program, along with different software aspects of the subject disclosure. In some embodiments, software aspects may also be implemented as discrete programs. Finally, any combination of separate programs implemented with the software aspects described herein is within the scope of the subject disclosure. In some embodiments, when a software program is installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, the software program defines one or more specific machine embodiments that execute and perform the operations of the software program.
