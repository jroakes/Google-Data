- the typed input is not limited to a single term. For example, the terms “La Zola” are selected, the user can type letters “l-a-j-o-l-l-a.”
- the one or more replacement terms can be received by a user selection of a suggested transcription presented in user interface.
- the user interface can include a dropdown box that is provided when a particular term or terms of the first transcription is selected.
- the system presents one or more suggested transcriptions in the dropdown box.
- Each of the one or more suggested transcriptions includes a replacement term or terms to replace the particular term or terms. For example, when the term “Zola” of the first transcription is selected, the system provides a dropdown box where one or more suggested transcriptions are presented.
- One of the suggested transcriptions can be “Directions to La Jolla.”
- the term “Jolla” is a replacement term to replace the selected term “Zola.”
- the user can select the suggested transcription “Directions to La Jolla” in the dropdown box and the system receives term “Zola” as a replacement term.
- the system determines whether one or more replacement terms are classified as a correction of one or more selected terms ( 340 ). The determination can be made based on certain criteria. In some implementations, the determination can be based on a phonetic similarity between each selected term and each replacement term. In particular, the phonetic similarity measures how similar the sound of the selected term is to the replacement term. The phonetic similarity between the selected term and the replacement term can be determined using a distance measure. In some implementations, the phonetic distance can be based on a minimum edit distance between the selected term and the replacement term. The system can determine that the replacement term is a correction of the selected term if a minimum edit distance between the replacement term and the selected term is equal or more than a threshold value, e.g., 2.
- a threshold value e.g., 2.
- the user may select the term “Zola” from the first transcription and replace the term “Zola” to the term “Jolla.”
- the system can determine that the minimum edit distance is 2 because “Z” is replaced with “J” and “l” is added.
- the system can determine that the replacement term “Jolla” is a correction of the selected term “Zola.”
- the system provides a first transcription as “Directions to La Jolla,” the user may select “Directions” from the first transcription and replace the term “Directions” to the term “Direction.”
- the system can determine that the minimum edit distance is 1 because “s” is deleted.
- the system can determine that the replacement term “Direction” is not a correction of the selected term “Directions.”
- the system can filter out replacements such as correcting article errors or typo not to be used for training the acoustic model.
- the minimum edit distance measures a number of different sounds between the selected term and the replacement term.
- the minimum edit distance is calculated using phonetic dictionaries.
- the minimum edit distance is calculated using an acoustic models, for example, acoustic Hidden-Markov-Models.
- the determination can be based on connections among the selected terms.
- the connections measure how close one selected term is to other selected terms.
- the connections can be determined using a connection distance measure.
- the connection distance can be determined based on a number of words between one selected term and other selected terms. If the number of words is equal or more than a threshold value, e.g., 2, the system can determine that the replacement term is not a correction of the selected term.
- the user may select two terms “Directions” and “Zola” from the first transcription and replace the term “Zola” to the term “Jolla.”
- the system can determine that the connection distance between the two terms is 2 because there are two terms “to” and “La” between the selected terms “Directions” and “Zola.”
- the system can determine that the replacement term is not a correction of the selected term.
- the selected terms “Directions” and “Zola” are not used to train the acoustic model because the term “Directions” could have been selected by a user's mistake such a touch error.
- the user may select two terms “La” and “Zola” from the first transcription and replace the term “Zola” to “Jolla.”
- the connection distance between the two terms is 0 because there is no term between the two terms “La” and “Zola.”
- the system can determine that the replacement term is a correction of the selected term.
- the determination can be based on consecutiveness of the selected terms. For example, the user may select the term “Direction” and the term “Zola” from the first transcription. The system can determine that the selected terms are not consecutive. In response, the system can determine that the one or more replacement terms are not a correction of one or more selected terms. Thus, the selected terms may not be used to train the acoustic model because the term “Directions” could have been selected by a user's mistake such as a touch error.
- the user may select the terms “La” and “Zola” from the first transcription and replace the term “Zola” to “Jolla.”
- the system can determine that the selected terms “La” and “Zola” are consecutive.
- the system can determine that the replacement term is a correction of the selected term.

- the system can isolate the first portion from the first audio data using timings that each term of the first transcription starts and ends. For example, where the system obtains the first transcription of “Directions to La Zola,” the system can determine the timings that each term of the first transcription starts and ends based on audio features such as a magnitude and a frequency of audio. In this example, the system can determine eight distinctive timings that the four terms of the first transcription start and end. Where the first portion of the first audio data corresponds to the term “Zola,” the system can identify the timings that the term “Zola” starts and ends. Thus, the system can determine that a portion of the first audio data between the two timings is the first portion of the audio data.

Abstract
Description
- This specification relates to speech recognition.
- Devices can include software for responding to an utterance of a user of the device. Some utterances can include instructions to the device to call a phone number, text a phone number, operate an application, or search for information on the mobile device or the Internet. The device can employ speech-to-text, or automated speech recognition (ASR), processes to recognize a voice input from the user.
- According to one example implementation, a speech recognition system receives an utterance of one or more terms from a user. In response, the speech recognition system provides a transcription of the utterance to a user device. When the provided transcription is not correct, the speech recognition system can receive user input to correct a particular term or terms of the transcription. The speech recognition system trains an acoustic model using the user input to correct the particular term or terms and audio data corresponding to the particular term or terms.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving first audio data corresponding to an utterance; obtaining a first transcription of the first audio data; receiving data indicating (i) a selection of one or more terms of the first transcription and (ii) one or more of replacement terms; determining that one or more of the replacement terms are classified as a correction of one or more of the selected terms; in response to determining that the one or more of the replacement terms are classified as a correction of the one or more of the selected terms, obtaining a first portion of the first audio data that corresponds to one or more terms of the first transcription; and using the first portion of the first audio data that is associated with the one or more terms of the first transcription to train an acoustic model for recognizing the one or more of the replacement terms. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods. For a system of one or more computers to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the system has installed on it software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them that in operation cause the system to perform the operations or actions. For one or more computer programs to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the one or more programs include instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the operations or actions.
- The foregoing and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination. In particular, one embodiment includes all the following features in combination. The method further includes receiving second audio data corresponding to an utterance, the second audio data including a second portion corresponding to the first portion of the first audio data; obtaining a second transcription of the second audio data; identifying the second portion from the second audio data; obtaining a corrected transcription of the second portion using the trained acoustic model; and obtaining a transcription that merges the second transcription and the corrected transcription. The method further includes obtaining search results responsive to the transcription that merges the second transcription and the corrected transcription; and providing one or more of the search results. Determining that the one or more of the replacement terms are classified as a correction of the one or more of the selected terms includes determining phonetic similarity between the one or more of the selected terms and the one or more of the replacement terms. Determining the phonetic similarity includes calculating a phonetic distance between each of the one or more of the selected terms and each of the one or more of the replacement terms. Determining that the one or more of the replacement terms are classified as a correction of the one or more of the selected terms includes determining connections among the one or more of the selected terms.

Determining that the one or more of the replacement terms are classified as a correction of the one or more of the selected terms includes determining that each of the one or more of the selected terms includes a threshold number of characters.
- The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular embodiments so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. An acoustic model is trained to recognize a specific term from various pronunciations of the specific term. A speech recognition system using the trained acoustic model can provide a correct transcription of the specific term from the various pronunciations of the specific term without receiving a user's correction input.

FIG. 1A illustrates an example method for performing a voice search, including receiving a correction input in an example user interface. A search system providesuser interface 102 a for displaying on auser device 106 a, e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, or other user device configured to receive voice input. Theuser interface 102 a includes asearch box 104 for receiving typed input corresponding to a query and amicrophone icon 108 for initiating a speech recognition session to receive a first voice query from auser 10 instead of a typed input. Theuser 10 inputs a first voice input 101, e.g., by selecting themicrophone icon 108 in theuser interface 102 a. In some implementations, the user interface includes a keyboard layout that can be presented for typed input to the search box. - In a user session, the search system receives an utterance 101 from a
user 10. For example, the utterance 101 can be a voice input. In particular, theuser 10 provides a voice input of “Directions to La Jolla” to theuser device 106 a. For example, theuser 10 can pronounce “Jolla” as [zō-la]. In response to the first voice input 101,user interface 102 a is presented including a display of afirst transcription 112 generated from the first voice input 101 in thesearch box 104. Thefirst transcription 112 is “Directions to La Zola.” For example, a speech-to-text process can be performed on the first voice query to generate a purported transcription as the correspondingfirst transcription 112. The search system can provide the transcription as thefirst transcription 112 to theuser device 106 a for display in theuser interface 102 a. - Furthermore, the
first transcription 112 can be used as a query to a search system. The search system providessearch results 110 responsive to the query “Directions to La Zola” for display inuser interface 102 b. For example, thesearch results 110 can include links to particular resources determined by the search system to be responsive to the query. However, in this example, the recognized query was recognized the term “Zola” instead of the term “Jolla.” - As shown in
user interface 102 b, in response to the recognition, theuser 10 can interact with theuser interface 102 b to select aportion 114 of thefirst transcription 112 corresponding to the recognized term “Zola.” For example, in a touch interface, theuser 10 can touch the recognizedterm 114 with a finger or stylus. In a non-touch interface, the user can navigate a cursor to the recognized term and select the recognized term, e.g., with a mouse input. - With reference to
user interface 102 c, theuser 10 provides afirst input 111 to theuser device 106 a. Thefirst input 111 is provided to replace theselected portion 114 of thefirst transcription 112. For example, thefirst input 111 can be a typed input. Theuser 10 can type a spelling, letter by letter, of the term “j-o-l-l-a” to replace theselected portion 114. Theuser 10 may use a keyboard layout provided by the user interface to type the spelling of term. - As shown in
user interface 102 d, a corrected transcription “Directions to La Jolla” is displayed in thesearch box 104. Furthermore, in response to the correctedtranscription 116, the search system providessearch results 120 responsive to the corrected query “Directions to La Jolla” for presentation in theuser interface 102 d. For example, the search results 120 can include links to particular resources determined by the search system to be responsive to the corrected query. In some implementations, the search system recognizes the query as a particular type of request, e.g., directions, and provides a map interface as part of or instead of the search results 120. -
FIG. 1B illustrates another example method for performing a voice search. In this example, theuser 10 can provide correction input to theuser device 106 a without typing a spelling of a term to replace the selectedportion 114. With reference touser interface 102 b, theuser 10 selects aportion 114 of thefirst transcription 112 to replace the term “Zola.” When theuser 10 selects theportion 114 of thefirst transcription 112, one or more suggested transcriptions are provided to theuser device 106 a. For example, as shown inuser interface 102 c, a suggestedtranscription 117 of “Directions to La Jolla” can be displayed in adropdown box 115. Theuser 10 can select the suggestedtranscription 117 to replace thefirst transcription 112. For example, in a touch interface, theuser 10 can touch aportion 119 of theuser interface 102 c with a finger or stylus. In a non-touch interface, theuser 10 can navigate a cursor to theportion 119 to select the suggestedtranscription 117 and select theportion 119, e.g., with a mouse input. - When the
user 10 selects the suggestedtranscription 117, as shown inuser interface 102 d, a corrected transcription “Directions to La Jolla” is displayed in thesearch box 104. Furthermore, in response to the correctedtranscription 116, the search system providessearch results 120 responsive to the corrected query “Directions to La Jolla” for presentation in theuser interface 102 d. For example, the search results 120 can include links to particular resources determined by the search system to be responsive to the corrected query. In some implementations, the search system recognizes the query as a particular type of request, e.g., directions, and provides a map interface as part of or instead of the search results 120. - From the user sessions described with reference to
FIGS. 1A and 1B , the system receives training data to train an acoustic model. In particular, the system receives (i) audio data corresponding to at least a portion of the first voice input 101 and (ii) one or more terms in the correctedtranscription 116 as training data. In some implementations, the system receives audio data corresponding to “Directions to La Jolla [zō-la]” and a replaced term “Jolla” in the correctedtranscription 116 as training data. The system identifies a portion of the audio data that corresponds the selected term “Zola.” The system isolates a portion of the audio data that corresponds to “Zola [zō-la]” from the audio data. Using the isolated portion of the audio data and the replaced term “Jolla,” the system trains the acoustic model. For example, the system can train the acoustic model to recognize the term “Jolla” in response to a voice input of “Zola [zō-la].” - In some implementations, the system receives audio data corresponding to the first voice input and the entire corrected transcription as training data. For example, the system receives audio data corresponding to “Directions to La Jolla [zō-la]” and the entire corrected transcription “Direction to La Jolla.” Using the audio data and the entire transcript, the system trains the acoustic model.
- The
user interface 102 e is presented including a display of asecond transcription 118 obtained using the trained acoustic model. In this user session, the system receives the second voice input 121 from auser 20. In particular, theuser 20 provides a voice input of “Directions to La Jolla [zō-la]” to the user device 106 b. In response to the second voice input 121, the system provides asecond transcription 118 as “Directions to La Jolla” instead of “Directions to La Zola” using the trained acoustic model. - Moreover, in response to the
second transcription 118, the search system providessearch results 120 responsive to the corrected query “Directions to La Jolla” for presentation in theuser interface 102 e. For example, the search results 120 can include links to particular resources determined by the search system to be responsive to the corrected query. In some implementations, the search system recognizes the query as a particular type of request, e.g., directions, and provides a map interface as part of or instead of the search results 120. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an examplevoice search system 200 using a trained acoustic model. Thesystem 200 provides search results relevant to submitted queries as can be implemented in an internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment. Thesystem 200 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented. - A
user 202 can interact with asearch system 214 through aclient device 204. For example, theclient 204 can be a computer coupled to thesearch system 214 through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet. In some implementations, thesearch system 214 and theclient device 204 can be one machine. For example, a user can install a desktop search application on theclient device 204. Theclient device 204 will generally include a random access memory (RAM) 206 and aprocessor 208. - The
user 202 can submit voice queries 210 to asearch engine 230 within asearch system 214. When theuser 202 submits avoice query 210, thevoice query 210 is transmitted through a network to thesearch system 214. Thesearch system 214 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network. - The
search system 214 includes aspeech recognition engine 254. Thespeech recognition engine 254 receives thevoice query 210 and transcribes the voice query to a recognized query, e.g., using acoustic and language models. In some implementations, the recognized query is returned to theclient device 204 for presentation to theuser 202. Additionally, the recognized query is provided to thesearch engine 230. - The
search system 214 further includes anindex database 222 and asearch engine 230. Thesearch system 214 responds to an input query by generatingsearch results 228, which are transmitted through the network to theclient device 204 in a form that can be presented to the user 202 (e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed in a web browser running on the client device 204). - When the recognized query determined from the
voice query 210 is received by thesearch engine 230, thesearch engine 230 identifies resources that match, or are responsive to, thequery 210. Thesearch engine 230 will generally include an indexing engine 220 that indexes resources (e.g., web pages, images, or news articles on the Internet) found in a corpus (e.g., a collection or repository of content), anindex database 222 that stores the index information, and a ranking engine 252 (or other software) to rank the resources that match thequery 210. The indexing and ranking of the resources can be performed using conventional techniques. The search engine 130 can transmit the search results 228 through the network to theclient device 204 for presentation to theuser 202. - In addition, the
voice recognition engine 254 corrects one or more terms of the recognized query using an acoustic model. The acoustic model can be trained using techniques described above with reference toFIGS. 1A and 1B . In particular, thevoice recognition engine 254 identifies a certain portion of thevoice query 210 and determines one or more corrected terms corresponding to the portion of thevoice query 210 using the acoustic model. Thevoice recognition engine 254 replaces the one or more terms of the recognized query, which corresponds to the portion of thevoice query 210, to the one or more corrected terms. Thevoice recognition engine 254 obtains a corrected query and present the corrected query to theuser device 204. Thesearch engine 230 can identify resources that are responsive to the corrected transcription and provide one or more search results. -
FIG. 3 illustrates an example method 300 for training an acoustic model. For convenience, the method 300 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers, located in one or more locations, and programmed appropriately in accordance with this specification. - The system receives first audio data corresponding to an utterance (310). For example, the utterance can be voice input. The user can select a voice input indicator, e.g., a microphone indicator, associated with particular user interface indicating a voice input can be provided. For example, user interface of the user device can include a microphone indicator. When a voice input is initiated by the user, a microphone of the user device captures voice input from the user. The voice input is then transmitted by the user device to the system. The voice input can be, for example, “Directions to La Jolla [zō-la].”
- The system obtains a first transcription of the first audio data (320). The first transcription is a transcription of the received first audio data. For example, a language model can be used to provide transcription of the first audio data and convert it into a recognized text output. The speech to text technique can include the use of an acoustic model that identifies phonemes or other linguistic units from the audio signal and a language model that assigns probabilities to particular words or sequences of words. In some implementations, the speech to text technique can correct or compensate for errors in the voice input, e.g., based on spelling and/or grammar rules.
- The first transcription is provided to the user device, for example, for display in particular user interface. The first transcription can be displayed, for example, to indicate the system's recognition of the first audio data. The user can then examine the presented first transcription to determine whether the system correctly recognized the first audio data. For example, the first audio data can be the voice query “Directions to La Jolla [zō-la]” which may be recognized in the first transcription as the query “Directions to La Zola.” Here, the word “Jolla” was recognized as “Zola.”
- Additionally, the system can perform an action responsive to the first transcription. For example, the system can obtain search results using the first transcription as a search query. One or more search results responsive to the search query can be provided to the user device for display in the search interface. In some implementations, the action is part of a particular task, e.g., creating a calendar entry. In some other implementations, the first transcription corresponds to the action, e.g., inputting text in a text editor or e-mail.
- The system receives data indicating (i) a selection of one or more terms of the first transcription and (ii) one or more replacement terms (330). The selection of the one or more terms of the first transcription can be received by direct input, e.g., using a finger on a touch screen, or using a particular input device e.g., a mouse cursor or stylus. For example, the user can touch a particular term or terms of the first transcription. In response, the selected term or terms can be highlighted by the user device indicating the selected term or terms. Thus, for the first transcription “Directions to La Zola,” the user can select the term “Zola.”
- In some implementations, the one or more replacement terms can be received by typed input. The user interface includes a keyboard layout that can be presented for receiving the typed input from the user. In particular, the user can type a particular term or terms to replace the selected term or terms using the keyboard layout. For example, after selecting the term “Zola,” the user can type the individual letters “j-o-l-l-a.” The typed input is not limited to a single term. For example, the terms “La Zola” are selected, the user can type letters “l-a-j-o-l-l-a.”
- In some implementations, the one or more replacement terms can be received by a user selection of a suggested transcription presented in user interface. For example, the user interface can include a dropdown box that is provided when a particular term or terms of the first transcription is selected. The system presents one or more suggested transcriptions in the dropdown box. Each of the one or more suggested transcriptions includes a replacement term or terms to replace the particular term or terms. For example, when the term “Zola” of the first transcription is selected, the system provides a dropdown box where one or more suggested transcriptions are presented. One of the suggested transcriptions can be “Directions to La Jolla.” Here, the term “Jolla” is a replacement term to replace the selected term “Zola.”The user can select the suggested transcription “Directions to La Jolla” in the dropdown box and the system receives term “Zola” as a replacement term.
- The system determines whether one or more replacement terms are classified as a correction of one or more selected terms (340). The determination can be made based on certain criteria. In some implementations, the determination can be based on a phonetic similarity between each selected term and each replacement term. In particular, the phonetic similarity measures how similar the sound of the selected term is to the replacement term. The phonetic similarity between the selected term and the replacement term can be determined using a distance measure. In some implementations, the phonetic distance can be based on a minimum edit distance between the selected term and the replacement term. The system can determine that the replacement term is a correction of the selected term if a minimum edit distance between the replacement term and the selected term is equal or more than a threshold value, e.g., 2. For example, the user may select the term “Zola” from the first transcription and replace the term “Zola” to the term “Jolla.” The system can determine that the minimum edit distance is 2 because “Z” is replaced with “J” and “l” is added. In response, the system can determine that the replacement term “Jolla” is a correction of the selected term “Zola.”
- For another example, where the system provides a first transcription as “Directions to La Jolla,” the user may select “Directions” from the first transcription and replace the term “Directions” to the term “Direction.” The system can determine that the minimum edit distance is 1 because “s” is deleted. In response, the system can determine that the replacement term “Direction” is not a correction of the selected term “Directions.” Thus, the system can filter out replacements such as correcting article errors or typo not to be used for training the acoustic model. In some implementations, the minimum edit distance measures a number of different sounds between the selected term and the replacement term. In some implementations, the minimum edit distance is calculated using phonetic dictionaries. In some implementations, the minimum edit distance is calculated using an acoustic models, for example, acoustic Hidden-Markov-Models.
- In some implementations, the determination can be based on connections among the selected terms. In particular, the connections measure how close one selected term is to other selected terms. The connections can be determined using a connection distance measure. In some implementations, the connection distance can be determined based on a number of words between one selected term and other selected terms. If the number of words is equal or more than a threshold value, e.g., 2, the system can determine that the replacement term is not a correction of the selected term. For example, the user may select two terms “Directions” and “Zola” from the first transcription and replace the term “Zola” to the term “Jolla.” The system can determine that the connection distance between the two terms is 2 because there are two terms “to” and “La” between the selected terms “Directions” and “Zola.” In response, the system can determine that the replacement term is not a correction of the selected term. Thus, the selected terms “Directions” and “Zola” are not used to train the acoustic model because the term “Directions” could have been selected by a user's mistake such a touch error.
- For another example, the user may select two terms “La” and “Zola” from the first transcription and replace the term “Zola” to “Jolla.” The connection distance between the two terms is 0 because there is no term between the two terms “La” and “Zola.” The system can determine that the replacement term is a correction of the selected term.
- In some implementations, the determination can be based on consecutiveness of the selected terms. For example, the user may select the term “Direction” and the term “Zola” from the first transcription. The system can determine that the selected terms are not consecutive. In response, the system can determine that the one or more replacement terms are not a correction of one or more selected terms. Thus, the selected terms may not be used to train the acoustic model because the term “Directions” could have been selected by a user's mistake such as a touch error.
- For another example, the user may select the terms “La” and “Zola” from the first transcription and replace the term “Zola” to “Jolla.” The system can determine that the selected terms “La” and “Zola” are consecutive. In response, the system can determine that the replacement term is a correction of the selected term.
- In some implementations, the determination can be based on a number of characters in each of the one or more selected terms. For example, the user may select the term “to” from the first transcription and replace the term “to” to “from.” The system can calculate the number of characters, i.e., two characters, in the selected term “to.” In response, the system can determine that the replacement term is not a correction of the selected term. Thus, the system can filter out replacements such as correcting prepositions not to be used for training the acoustic model.
- For another example, the user may select “Zola” from the first transcription. The system can determine the number of characters is 4 in the selected term “Zola.” In response, the system can determine that the replacement term is a correction of the selected term.
- In response to determining that the one or more of the replacement terms are classified as a correction of the one or more of the selected terms, the system obtains a first portion of the first audio data that corresponds to one or more terms of the first transcription (350). In some implementations, the first portion of the first audio data can be the entire first audio data. For example, the system can obtain the first portion that is the first audio data corresponding to the user's utterance “Directions to La Jolla [zō-la].”
- In some implementations, the first portion of the first audio data can be isolated from the first audio data. The first portion corresponds to a particular term or terms in the first transcription that are selected by the user. For example, the user may select the term “Zola.” The system isolates the first portion corresponding to the term “Zola” from the first audio data. In this example, the sound of the first portion can be [zō-la].
- In some implementations, the system can isolate the first portion from the first audio data using timings that each term of the first transcription starts and ends. For example, where the system obtains the first transcription of “Directions to La Zola,” the system can determine the timings that each term of the first transcription starts and ends based on audio features such as a magnitude and a frequency of audio. In this example, the system can determine eight distinctive timings that the four terms of the first transcription start and end. Where the first portion of the first audio data corresponds to the term “Zola,” the system can identify the timings that the term “Zola” starts and ends. Thus, the system can determine that a portion of the first audio data between the two timings is the first portion of the audio data.
- The system uses the first portion of the first audio data that is associated with the one or more terms of the first transcription to train an acoustic model for recognizing the one or more of the replacement terms (360). In some implementations, the system uses the entire first audio data and the entire first transcription to train the acoustic model. In some implementations, the system uses the isolated first portion that is associated with the one or more terms of the first transcription to train the acoustic model. For example, after isolating the first portion [zō-la] from the first audio data, the system can use the first portion [zō-la] to train the acoustic model for recognizing the replacement term “Jolla.”

FIG. 4 illustrates an example method 400 for providing search results using a trained acoustic model. For convenience, the method 400 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers, located in one or more locations, and programmed appropriately in accordance with this specification. - The system receives second audio data corresponding to an utterance (410). For example, the utterance can be a voice input. The user can select a voice input indicator, e.g., a microphone indicator, associated with particular user interface indicating a voice input can be provided. For example, user interface of the user device can include a microphone indicator. When a voice input is initiated by the user, a microphone of the user device captures voice input from the user. The voice input is then transmitted by the user device to the system. The voice input can be, for example, “Directions to La Jolla [zō-la].”
- The system obtains a second transcription of the second audio data (420). The second transcription is a transcription of the received second audio data. For example, acoustic and language models can be used to provide the second transcription of the second audio data and convert it into a recognized text output. For example, the second audio data can be the voice input “Directions to La Jolla [zō-la]” which may be recognized in the second transcription as “Directions to La Zola.”
- The system identifies a second portion of the second audio data (430). In particular, the second portion of the second audio data corresponds to the first portion of the first audio data described with reference with
FIG. 3 . For example, the system can identify the second portion [zō-la] of the second audio data that corresponds to the first portion [zō-la] of the first audio data. - The system obtains that a corrected transcription of the second portion using a trained acoustic model (440). In particular, the trained acoustic model can be an acoustic model that is trained using techniques described above. For example, referring to the example described with reference to
FIG. 3 , the acoustic model is trained to recognize the replacement term “Jolla” using the first portion [zō-la] of the first audio data. In response to the identified second portion [zō-la] that corresponds to the first portion [zō-la], the system can obtain the corrected transcription “Jolla” for the second portion of the second audio data. - The system obtains a transcription that merges the second transcription and the corrected transcription (450). The system replaces a particular term or terms of the second transcription corresponding to the second portion to the corrected transcription and obtains a new transcription that merges the second transcription with the corrected transcription. For example, the system replaces the term “Zola” of the second transcription to the corrected transcription “Jolla” and obtains the merged transcription “Directions to La Jolla.”
- The system obtains search results responsive to the transcription that merges the second transcription and the corrected transcription (460). For example, the system obtains search results responsive the transcription “Directions to La Jolla.” The search results can include links to particular resources determined by the search system to be responsive to the corrected query. In some implementations, the search system recognizes the query as a particular type of request, e.g., directions, and provides a map interface as part of or instead of the search result
- The system provides one or more of the search results (470). The system provide the obtained search results to the user device. For example, the system can provide the search results to be displayed in the user interface of the user device.

- Computers suitable for the execution of a computer program can be based on general or special purpose microprocessors or both, or any other kind of central processing unit. Generally, a central processing unit will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a central processing unit for performing or executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. The central processing unit and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device, e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive, to name just a few.
