Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to batteries and more particularly to a method for determining the residual charge on a battery.
- Batteries are widely used to provide power, or back-up power, to electronic devices, and especially portable electronic devices including mobile communication devices. While the lifetime of such batteries has improved over the last several years, the demand for battery power has increased as the use of the electronic devices increase due to consumer habits. Extended use of the electronic device may result in a “dead” battery and great frustration to the consumer.
- residual power an indication on the electronic device of battery power remaining for use. This indication is typically represented by a number or bar graph on a display of the electronic device as a percentage of a fully charged battery.
- One method determines battery residual charge and battery capacity (total battery capability) by applying discharging pulses and rest periods to a battery, measuring the voltage drop as an index to determine the potential maximum battery capacity.
- the known art typically uses an open battery voltage to determine the present capacity (residual battery charge).
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an electronic device in accordance with an exemplary embodiment
- FIG. 2 is a graph of parameters measured from the voltage drop of a battery in accordance with the exemplary embodiment.
- FIG. 3 is flow chart of the steps in accordance with the exemplary embodiment.
- a block diagram of an electronic device 10 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment includes a battery 12 coupled in parallel with a series connected load 14 and switch 16 .
- the electronic device 10 may be any type of device requiring a battery as the main source of power or as a back-up source of power.
- One example of the electronic device 10 would be a mobile communication device such as a cell phone.
- a Lithium ion battery is preferred; however, the residual power of any type of battery may be determined by the method described herein.
- the electronic device 10 may have a minimal battery drain, for example when in a stand-by mode, the load represents a larger current drain, such as when a cell phone call is placed.
- a microprocessor 18 is coupled to the battery 12 and provides opening and closing instructions to the switch 16 .
- An analog to digital converter 20 is coupled to the battery 12 for measuring the voltage thereacross, and provides voltage magnitudes in digital format to the microprocessor 18 .
- the method described herein in accordance with the exemplary embodiment measures parameters that describe the timing behavior of the voltage drop due to charge transfer and correlates them to residual (remaining) battery charge.
- a current pulse is applied to the battery 12 (application of the load 14 )
- a first voltage drop relating to internal resistance is experienced prior to a second voltage drop relating to battery charge transfer polarization.
- the current pulse is created when a load is coupled to a battery.
- the load may be created by turning on or off circuits of the electronic device, e.g., a display or keypad backlight, by answering a call, or by turning on or off a specific load designed just to create the desired current pulse.
- ⁇ is related to the voltage drop
- ⁇ is related to the time of the voltage drop.
- FIG. 2 A graph of voltage (volts) versus time (milliseconds) illustrates the battery voltage 22 as a load is applied. All times and voltages mentioned below are approximate. Furthermore, other voltages, delta voltages, times, and delta times may apply depending on the load and battery type and capacity. Initially, the voltage on the battery is 3.94 volts (at a time before and up to zero milliseconds). A current pulse (the load is coupled to the battery) is applied at a time of zero. A current pulse up to 2.0 amps is foreseeable; however, 1.0 amp is preferred. For lower amperage, more time is required to make the determination of residual power.
- the voltage is 3.78 volts at t 1 .
- the voltage is measured to be 3.77 volts.
- Time t 2 is determined to be 25 milliseconds.
- time t 3 is determined to be 170 milliseconds.
- the method for determining a residual charge on a battery comprises applying a discharge pulse to the battery 12 and measuring a first voltage on the battery 12 at a first time t 1 . Additional voltages on the battery are measured at additional times t 2 , t 3 subsequent to the first time t 1 . Delta voltages ⁇ V 1 , ⁇ V 2 are determined by subtracting each of the additional voltages from the first voltage and delta times ⁇ t 1 , ⁇ t 2 are determined by subtracting the first time from each of the additional times.
- Regression equation coefficients ⁇ , ⁇ are determined from regression of the delta voltages and delta times, and are applied to a database for determining the residual charge. More specifically, and as shown in FIG.
- the method comprises applying 31 a current pulse to a battery, measuring 32 a first voltage on the battery at a time t 1 , measuring 33 a second voltage on the battery at a time t 2 , measuring 34 a third voltage on the battery at a time t 3 , determining 35 a first delta voltage from the second voltage minus the first voltage, determining 36 a second delta voltage from the third voltage minus the first voltage, determining 37 a first delta time from the times t 2 minus t 1 , determining 38 a second delta time from the times t 3 minus t 1 , determining 39 regression equation coefficients by regression analysis of the first and second delta voltage and delta times, applying 40 the equation coefficients to a database for determining the residual charge.
Abstract
Description
ΔV=(α)1n(1+Δt/ε)
where
Δt 1 =t 1−td=25−10=15 milliseconds,
Δt 2 =t 2−td=170−10=160 milliseconds,
ΔV 1=3.78−3.77=0.01 volts, and
ΔV 2=3.78−3.74=0.04 volts.
