- This specification relates to information presentation.
- Interactive media e.g., the Internet
- content e.g., advertisements or “ads”
- some websites provide information search functionality that is based on keywords entered by the user seeking information.
- a user query can be an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by a content provider, it is possible to provide relevant content to the user.
- Another form of online advertising is ad syndication, which allows advertisers to extend their marketing reach by distributing ads to additional partners.
- third party online publishers can place an advertiser's text or image ads on web properties and mobile applications with desirable content to drive online customers to the advertiser's website.
- the methods include receiving one or more first bids that have associated fixed prices, receiving one or more second bids that have dynamic prices that are adjusted at a time of auction in consideration of other bids in the auction, conducting an auction including pricing the one or more first bids and the one or more second bids, the one or more first bids being priced at their respective fixed prices and the one or more second bids being priced at respective amounts that maintain each second bid in a position marginally above a next-highest bid in the auction, and serving content based on one or more winning bids from the auction.

- the one or more second bids are priced in accordance with rules associated with the second price auction.
- the content includes one or more advertisements.
- a future bid of a first bidder associated with the winning first bid is adjusted based at least in part on the correction factor.
- Correction factors are accumulated per bidder and one or more accumulated correction factors are applied to a future bid of a first bidder associated with the winning first bid so as to allow the future bid to be a winning bid.
- Adjusting a future bid includes increasing the bid to a higher amount without charging the first bidder the higher amount.
- Adjusting a future bid includes reducing an amount charged to the first bidder for a winning future bid based on the correction factor.
- Adjusting the future bid includes decrementing the correction factor from an accumulation account associated with the first bidder

- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an exemplary process for providing a mixed auction.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an exemplary process for providing a mixed auction.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram of an example computing system.
- Content providers e.g., advertisers
- may provide one or more bids in an auction whose price is fixed at a time of bid e.g., “first price” bids that are based on a fixed price, and whose price does not depend on the price of other bids in the auction.
- some content providers may provide one or more bids in an auction whose price depends on other bids in the auction (e.g., “second price” bids, whose price depends on one or more lower ranked bids in the auction).
- Techniques are described for pricing both types of bids and for carrying out an auction that includes both types of bids to effect efficient delivery of content through a content delivery system.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online content delivery system 100 .
- one or more content providers (e.g., advertisers) 102 can directly, or indirectly, enter, and maintain content (e.g., advertisement) information in a content management system 104 .
- content e.g., advertisement
- the content may be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of any of such components, etc.
- the content may also include embedded information, such as links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more publishers 106 and/or one or more user devices may submit requests for content to the content management system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending content to the requesting publisher 106 (or directly to an end user) for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content).
- the content can include embedded links to landing pages, e.g., pages on the advertisers 102 websites, that a user is directed to when the user clicks an content item presented on a publisher website.
- Other entities such as users 108 and the content providers 102 , can provide usage information to the system 104 , such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or click-through related to a content item has occurred.
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to content that has been served.
- the system 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the content providers 102 based on the usage information.
- a computer network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects the content providers 102 , the system 104 , the publishers 106 , and the users 108 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet or a combination thereof, connects the content providers 102 , the system 104 , the publishers 106 , and the users 108 .
- a publisher 106 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the content server (or a user that is accessing the content source by way of a redirect) may submit a request for ads to an ad server in the system 104 .
- the ad request may include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request may also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page or other content document
- category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- the content server can combine the requested content with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 .
- This combined content and ads can be sent to the user 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content can be combined at a user's device (e.g., by combining in a user's browser content from the content source with ads provided by the system 104 ).
- the content server can transmit information about the ads back to the ad server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- An additional example of a publisher is a mobile application for providing content to a user, e.g., news, games, and other information.
- Content items e.g., ads
- Providing content items for display within the mobile application includes determining a pricing model for the mobile application.
- search service can receive queries for search results. In response, the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- An exemplary search service is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, both of which are incorporated herein by reference each in their entirety.
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search service can submit a request for ads to the system 104 .
- the request may include a number of ads desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, etc. In some implementations, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for ads may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the user 108 that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- the search service can transmit information about the ad and when, where, and/or how the ad was to be rendered back to the system 104 .
- the content management system 104 can serve publishers 106 , such as content servers and search services.
- the system 104 permits serving of content targeted to documents served by content servers.
- a network or inter-network may include an ad server serving targeted ads in response to requests from a search service with ad spots for sale.
- the search service crawls much or all of the content.
- Some of this content will include ad spots (also referred to as “inventory”) available.
- one or more content servers may include one or more documents.
- Documents may include web pages, email, content, embedded information (e.g., embedded media), meta-information and machine executable instructions, and ad spots available.
- the ads inserted into ad spots in a document can vary each time the document is served or, alternatively, can have a static association with a given document.
- the content management system 104 may include an auction process to select content.
- Content providers e.g., advertisers
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay for each click of advertisement based on targeting criteria (e.g., one or more keywords).
- targeting criteria e.g., one or more keywords.
- advertisers A, B, and C all select, or bid, a maximum cost-per-click of $0.50, $0.75, and $1.00, respectively.
- the maximum amount advertiser A will pay for a click is $0.50
- the maximum amount advertiser B will pay is $0.75
- the maximum amount advertiser C will pay is $1.00.
- the rank of an advertisement that is displayed can be determined, in some implementations, by multiplying the maximum cost-per-click for the advertisement by a quality score of the advertisement.
- the advertisement can then be placed among other advertisements in order of increasing or decreasing rank. For example, suppose the quality score of advertisers A, B, and C are “3,” “1,” and “1,” respectively.
- the advertisers can be ranked as follows:
- Content items can also be priced and ordered according to a second price auction.
- a second price auction may adjust the price of bid by considering the amount selected or bid by the advertiser directly ranked below a given bid.
- the “second price” (sometimes referred to as an “actual cost per click”) of an advertisement can be the price that is necessary to keep a bid position above the next highest bid in the rank ordering.
- the system 104 can determine how much the provider in position 1 would have to pay to give them a rank equal to the provider in position 2, and then the system 104 adds a unit amount, e.g., $0.01, to this determined amount.
- the rank of the bid in position 2 can be divided by the quality score of position 1. Thereafter, the system can add the nominal amount to determine the bid amount.
- the last provider in the list can be attributed a minimum score (e.g., a minimum rank, as shown above) or a minimum bid amount. Using this approach, the last provider can be second priced against the minimum score or minimum bid amount. In some examples, the last provider can be associated with both a minimum cost-per-click as well as a minimum score, and the maximum of the two parameters can be used to determine the last provider's bid amount.
- A would only have to pay $0.34 to hold the first position in the list of providers.
- C would have to pay $0.76 to hold the second position.
- Provider B would be required to pay the minimum cost-per-click amount of $0.20.
- eCPM cost-per-thousand impressions
- eCPM 1000 ⁇ CPC ⁇ (Probability of Click)
- the probability of click factor can be supplied based on historical data associated with an advertisement, a merchant, industry-wide data, or other factors.
- the eCPM formula can represent an advertiser's estimated earnings for every 1000 impressions received.
- Second price auctions such as those described above can also use eCPM values to create a second price value for an advertisement.
- a provider instead of bidding for a slot on a cost-per-click basis, a provider might prefer to place bids based on other factors.
- an advertiser may wish to bid using a revenue sharing bid.
- a revenue sharing bid is a bid based on a fraction of the sales which are attributable to a given advertisement, and may be sales associated with a single product, related products, categories of products, or plural categories, or alternatively may be related to sales at a location, in a given time, or in accordance with other agreed upon sharing of revenue.
- Other forms of revenue sharing are possible as agreed to between the advertiser and the advertising management system.
- an auction may include both one or more bids that will be priced using the second price approach (sometimes referred to as “second price bids”), as well as one or more bids that will be priced using only the first price approach (sometimes referred to as “first price bids”).
- second price bids the second price approach
- first price bids the first price bids
- a mechanism is needed for considering both bids that will be subject to the second price approach, and bids that will be priced according to the first price approach.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for conducting an auction that includes both first price bids and second price bids in an auction.
- First bids are received that have associated fixed prices ( 202 ).
- the content management system 104 may receive first price bids from a provider 102 that include a fixed price.
- the fixed price may include a fixed cost-per-click that the advertiser is willing to pay regardless of the price of any bids that rank below the first price bids in the auction.
- Second bids are received that have dynamic prices that are adjusted at a time of auction in consideration of other bids in the auction ( 204 ).
- the content management system 104 may receive second price bids whose prices are adjusted at a time of auction based on prices of other bids in the auction (e.g., a bid ranked directly below the second price bid in question).
- An auction is conducted including pricing the first bids and the second bids, where the first bids are priced at their respective fixed prices and the second bids are priced at respective amounts that maintain each second bid in a position marginally above a next-highest bid in the auction ( 206 ).
- the content management system 104 conducts an auction where the first price bids are priced according to the fixed prices specified by their corresponding providers, and the second price bids are priced based on the prices of other bids (including one or both of first price bids and second price bids) in the auction.
- An exemplary auction includes bids A, B, and C, where bid C is a first price bid, and bids A and B are second price bids.
- the advertisers can be ranked as follows:
- the quality score of the bid in position 2 can be divided by the quality score of position 1 and $0.01 can be added to that amount.
- B :minimum cost-per-click (e.g., $0.20)
- the provider associated with second price bid A would pay $0.34, even though the first price bid below bid A (bid C) is priced at $1.00.
- This technique allows the advertiser associated with bid C to pay a fixed cost while maintaining the integrity of the second price auction process for other bids (e.g., second price bids A and B).
- Content is identified/served based on one or more winning bids from the auction ( 208 ).
- the content management system 104 could determine that bid A is the winning bid and could then serve content that is associated with bid A.
- Serving content associated with the winning bid can include serving (e.g., presenting on a web page in an advertisement slot) one or more advertisements that are associated with the winning bid.
- FIG. 3 represents an example process 300 for countering this type of behavior.
- first bids are received that have associated fixed prices ( 302 ).
- the content management system 104 may receive first price bids from a provider 102 that include a fixed price.
- the fixed price may include a fixed cost-per-click that the advertiser is willing to pay regardless of the price of any bids that rank below the first price bids in the auction.
- Second bids are received that have dynamic prices that are adjusted at a time of auction in consideration of other bids in the auction ( 304 ).
- the content management system 104 may receive second price bids whose prices are adjusted at a time of auction based on prices of other bids in the auction (e.g., a bid ranked directly below the second price bid in question).
- an auction is conducted including pricing the first bids and the second bids, where the first bids are priced at their respective fixed prices and the second bids are priced at respective amounts that maintain each second bid in a position marginally above a next-highest bid in the auction ( 306 ).
- the content management system 104 conducts an auction where the first price bids are priced according to the fixed prices specified by their corresponding advertisers, and the second price bids are priced based on the prices of other bids (including one or both of first price bids and second price bids) in the auction.
- a correction factor is determined that represents a difference between a fixed price associated with the winning first bid and a second price for the winning first bid ( 310 ). For example, after conducting the auction, the content management system 104 may determine that a first price bid is the highest ranked bid in the auction. Even though a first price bid may win an auction, it is possible for a first price bidder to pay more as a first price bidder than he would have paid had the bid been a second price bid. Thus, determining the correction factor can include determining a second price for the first price bid, even though the second price is not used directly for determining the price of the bid in the actual auction.
- a difference between the first price (e.g., the “fixed” price associated with the first price bid) and the mock second price can be determined. For example, if bid X is a winning first bid with a fixed price of $1.00, the content management system 104 could calculate a mock second price for bid X with a value of $0.50. Thus, in this example, the correction factor would be the difference between the first price and the mock second price, or $0.50 ($1.00 ⁇ $0.50).
- the correction factor is stored ( 312 ).
- the content management system 104 could store a correction factor of $0.50 for bid X.
- Storing the correction factor can include accumulating correction factors across multiple auctions to maintain an aggregate correction factor.
- Correction factors (and aggregate correction factors) can be stored in an account associated with one or more content providers.
- the content management system 104 could allow the bidder associated with the aggregate correction factor to have a bid augmented or enhanced (causing the bidder to move up a position in a subsequent auction). In some implementations, the content management system 104 adjusts the value of a subsequent first price bid in order to position the first price bid in a winning position in the subsequent auction.
- the second prices in future auctions could be calculated relative to the adjusted value of the first price bid, and a loss in auction value equal or proportional to the adjusted amount could be deducted from the aggregate correction factor. For example, if the bidder has accumulated $3.00 as an aggregate correction factor as a result of setting a first price greater than a mock second price in several auctions, the $3.00 (or a portion thereof) could be applied to that bidder's bids in future auctions, which may have the result of raising second prices for other second price bids in those auctions. Accordingly, lost auction value can be recovered from the aggregate correction factor value which, in some examples, represents money overpaid by a first price bidder.
- a first price bidder can be compensated as a result of overpaying on a first price bid.
- the content management system 104 could deduct an amount of money from a first price bidder's future bids based on the aggregate correction factor. For example, if a first price bidder has accumulated an aggregate correction factor of $3.00, this amount could be credited to the first price bidder in a future auction by reducing the price that the first price bidder would normally have to pay by some amount (e.g., $3.00) that is based at least in part on the aggregate correction factor.
- Content is served based on one or more winning bids from the auction ( 314 ). For example, if the first price bid represents the winning bid in an auction, the content management system 104 could serve one or more advertisements on a web page that are associated with the winning first price bid.
