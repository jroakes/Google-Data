- This specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction.
- content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for crediting an entity for a conversion.
- the method includes: providing an interface that is externally exposed to an eCommerce entity, the interface being configured to receive transaction information associated with transactions by entities with the eCommerce entity that are known to a content serving system; receiving through the interface transaction information associated with a first transaction; creating a token; providing the token to the eCommerce entity; storing the transaction information in association with the token in a first log; receiving from the eCommerce entity a user identifier associated with the transaction along with the token; associating the user identifier with the token in a second log; determining a linking between impressions and conversions based on the token, the first log, and the second log including using the token to determine a relevant user identifier and transaction details, and using the determined relevant user identifier to locate prior impressions made to the user; and debiting a content sponsor associated with the prior impression and crediting a publisher that published the impression, and the eCommerce entity that provided the transaction information when a linking impression
- a computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions.
- the instructions when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: provide an interface that is externally exposed to an eCommerce entity, the interface being configured to receive transaction information associated with transactions by entities with the eCommerce entity that are known to a content serving system; receive through the interface transaction information associated with a first transaction; create a token; provide the token to the eCommerce entity; store the transaction information in association with the token in a first log; receive from the eCommerce entity a user identifier associated with the transaction along with the token; associate the user identifier with the token in a second log; determine a linking between impressions and conversions based on the token, the first log, and the second log including using the token to determine a relevant user identifier and transaction details, and using the determined relevant user identifier to locate prior impressions made to the user; and debit a content sponsor associated with the prior impression and crediting a publisher that published the
- a system includes one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions.

- the content management system 110 can select (e.g., from a content items data store 119 ) content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request.
- the content management system 110 can, for example, select a content item having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot.
- content items having selection criteria e.g., keywords
- resource keywords in the search query 117 or keywords included in the search results 118 may be selected as eligible content items by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can identify a content item in the content items datastore 119 that is associated with a keyword that matches a keyword included in a user profile associated with the requesting user device 106 .
- the content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction.
- content providers 108 can provide bids specifying amounts that the content providers 108 are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items.
- an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated to content providers 108 according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item.
- the slot can be allocated to the content provider 108 that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure).
- a quality score can be determined, for example, based on a quality of match between, for example, a keyword associated with a content item and keywords associated with a resource that includes the slot associated with the request. As another example, a quality score can be determined based on a quality of match between a keyword associated with a content item and keywords included in a user device profile associated with the requesting user device 106 .
- One or more selected content items can be provided to the user device 106 in association with providing an associated resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the provided content item(s) can be presented on the user device 106 , in one or more respective slots.
- Some of the content providers 108 can configure one or more brand campaigns that include one or more brand content items.
- a brand campaign is characterized as one that includes information related to a brand, but does not solicit specific user interaction.
- the content providers 108 may desire to track conversions that can be attributed to a brand campaign.
- a user of a user device 106 can, for example, execute a transaction (e.g., purchase a product or service) related to the brand, such as from an eCommerce entity 122 .
- the user device might not be logged into the content management system 110 when the transaction is performed.
- the content management system 110 and the eCommerce entity 122 can be configured to the match the conversion with a prior presentation of content from a brand campaign.
- What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways.
- a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item, is referred to a web page, and then consummates a purchase before leaving that web page.
- Actions that constitute a conversion can be specified by each content provider 108 on a content provider by content provider basis.
- each content provider 108 can select, as a conversion, one or more measurable/observable user actions such as, for example, downloading a white paper, installing a software item, registering for a subscription, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or web page, or registering on a website.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- a conversion can be defined to occur upon the occurrence of a final action that is used to define the conversion. For example, if a user visiting five web pages defines a conversion, the conversion occurs upon the user's request for the fifth web page, and the four page views that occurred prior to the request for the fifth web page are considered to have occurred prior to the conversion.
- An impression logger 124 can log impressions of content items on user devices 106 .
- the impression logger 124 can store impression information in an impression log 126 .
- Information in the impression log can include, for example, impression information keyed by user device identifiers.
- Some impressions presented on user devices 106 can be brand impressions.
- a user who views a brand impression may decide to purchase a product or service associated with the brand.
- an eCommerce entity 122 can sell products and/or services associated with a plurality of brands including a brand associated with the content provider 108 who provided the brand impression.
- a user of a user device 106 can purchase a product or service associated with the brand from a website of an eCommerce entity 122 .
- a transaction information receiver 130 can receive transaction information from the eCommerce entity 122 , such as from an API (Application Programming Interface).
- the content management system 110 can expose the API to the eCommerce entity 128 and the transaction information receiver 130 can receive transaction information using the API.
- the transaction information can include, for example, an identifier of the eCommerce entity 122 , price amount(s), transaction date, and information about purchased products and/or services.
- the transaction information receiver 130 can create a token to be associated with the transaction information and can return the token to the eCommerce entity 122 through the API.
- the transaction information receiver 130 can store the transaction information in a transaction log 132 , keyed by the token.
- a user/transaction linker 134 can associate a user/user device 106 with a transaction (e.g., linking a user that made a purchase with particular purchased items).
- a resource associated with the eCommerce entity 122 can include an iFrame or other component that is loaded after a conversion is completed.
- a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the iFrame can be amended to include the token.
- the token can be associated with the iFrame in other ways.
- the user/transaction linker 134 can receive, using the iFrame, the user/user device identifier along with the token and can store a mapping of the user/user device identifier to the token in a user/token map 136 .
- An impression/conversion linker 138 can identify a relationship between an impression and a conversion. For example, the impression/conversion linker 138 can determine which transactions in the transaction log 132 correspond to an impression in the impression log 126 . The impression/conversion linker 138 can identify relationships using, at least in part, entries in the user/token map 136 . Determining linking impressions and conversions is described in more detail below.
- a credit/debit system 140 can issue credits and/or debits to entities that participate in the conversion transaction. For example, a publisher 109 who published a resource on which the impression occurred can be credited. The eCommerce entity 122 with whom the transaction occurred (and who reported the conversion) can be credited, such as with an electronic funds credit or with a credit that can be used to purchase services offered by the content management system 110 (e.g., the eCommerce entity 122 can use a credit to create a content campaign managed by the content management system 110 ). The content provider 108 can be debited for the impression.
- the credit/debit system 140 debits the content provider 108 based at least in part on a conversion basis, wherein the content provider 108 is not charged or is not completely charged until a subsequent conversion is determined to have occurred (e.g., based on an impression/conversion linking as determined by the impression/conversion linker 138 ).
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system 200 for presenting content.
- a web page 202 is presented on a user device 204 .
- the web page 202 includes a content slot 206 .
- a content request for a content item to present in the content slot 206 can be sent to a content server 208 .
- the content server 208 can select a content item and provide the content item to the user device 204 , for presentation in the content slot 206 , as illustrated by a presented content item 210 .
- the content item 210 in this example is a brand content item provided by an XYZ Shoes content sponsor.
- the content server 208 can log information associated with the impression of the content item 210 , such as in an impression log 212 .
- a row 216 associated with the impression of the content item 210 can be stored, along with other rows associated with other impressions.

- Other information can be stored in the row 216 .
- the user of the user device 204 can use the user device 204 (or another device) to view one or more web pages provided by an eCommerce entity 218 (e.g., an online retailer).
- the eCommerce entity 218 can sell products and/or services associated with the content sponsor (e.g., XYZ Shoes) of the content item 210 and products or services associated with other entities.
- the user of the user device 204 can, for example, perform an interaction that is associated with a conversion event (e.g., purchase a product associated with the content sponsor using one or more web pages provided by the eCommerce entity 218 ).
- the eCommerce entity 218 can provide, for example, one or more web pages or other resources from a web resources repository 220 .
- the provided web pages can include an order summary web page 222 which can be provided to and presented on the user device 204 after the user of the user device 204 has completed a purchase from the eCommerce entity 218 .
- the content server 208 can expose an interface, such as an API, to the eCommerce entity 218 .
- the eCommerce entity 218 can use the interface to provide information about transactions to the content server 208 .
- the transaction information can include, for example, a transaction date/time, a transaction amount, information describing purchased products or services, and/or other information.
- the eCommerce entity 218 can gather information, for example, from a transaction database accessible to the eCommerce entity 218 and/or from information gathered during the transaction.
- the content server 208 can receive the transaction information using the interface. In response to receiving the transaction information, the content server 208 can generate a token to be associated with a specific transaction and can provide the token to the eCommerce entity 218 .
- the content server 208 can store the transaction information in association with the token, such as in a transaction log 224 .
- a row 228 can be stored.
- the row 228 includes a transaction date of April 2 , a token (e.g., “Token1”), a transaction identifier (e.g., 123456 (in some implementations, the token serves as a transaction identifier)), a transaction amount (e.g., $79.99), an item-purchased identifier (e.g., XYZ-444), and item-purchased keywords (e.g., “XYZ shoes basketball”).
- a token e.g., “Token1”
- a transaction identifier e.g., 123456 (in some implementations, the token serves as a transaction identifier)
- a transaction amount e.g., $79.99
- an item-purchased identifier e.g., XYZ-444
- item-purchased keywords e.g.,
- the content server 208 can receive from the eCommerce entity 218 a user/user device identifier associated with the transaction.
- the eCommerce entity 218 can generate a web page component, such as an iFrame, as part of the transaction conducted with the user device 204 .
- an iFrame component 230 can be included in the order summary web page 222 .
- the iFrame component 230 can, for example, be hidden (e.g., not visible to the user of the user device 204 ).
- the eCommerce entity 218 can include data in or otherwise associate data with the iFrame component 230 .
- a user/user device identifier 232 e.g., “Device 1 ”
- a token 234 received from the content server 208 e.g., “Token 1 ”
- the iFrame component 230 is associated with a domain of the content server 208 .
- the content server 208 can use (e.g., communicate with) the iFrame component 230 to retrieve the user/user device identifier 232 and the token 234 .
- the content server 208 can store the user/user device identifier 232 in association with the token 234 , such as in a user device/token log 236 .
- example user device/token data 238 includes a row 240 which maps the user/user device identifier 232 (e.g., “Device 1 ”) to the token 234 (e.g., “Token 1 ”).
- the user device/token log 236 and the transaction log 224 are shown as different logs, in some implementations, data items shown in the user device/token log 236 and the transaction log 224 are stored in a same data structure.
- the content server 208 can process the user device/token log 236 , the transaction log 224 , and the impression log 212 to determine a linking between an impression and a conversion. For example, the content server 208 can perform such processing on a periodic (e.g., daily) basis, or can perform such processing, for example, in response to receiving transaction information from an eCommerce entity such as the eCommerce entity 218 .
- the content server 208 can determine a linking between impressions and conversions by using a respective token to determine a relevant user/user device identifier and transaction details, and using the determined relevant user/user device identifier to locate prior impressions presented on the user device.
- the content server 208 can, as part of processing the row 240 , identify the row 228 as being associated with the row 240 , such as based on both the row 240 and the row 228 each including a same token value (e.g., “Token 1 ”).
- the content server 208 can determine that the transaction information included in the row 228 , including a transaction date/time of April 2, is relevant transaction information that is associated with the user device identifier (e.g., “Device 1 ”) stored in the row 228 .
- the content server 208 can locate entries in the impression log 212 that represent impressions made on the user device with identifier of “Device 1 ” that are prior to the relevant transaction date of April 2 .
- the row 216 can be located.
- the content server 208 can evaluate the located impression(s) to determine whether one or more impressions are related to the transaction. For example, the content server 208 can determine a brand (e.g., XYZ shoes) associated with the impression and determine that the brand is associated with the relevant transaction information. For example, the content server 208 can determine a brand of “XYZ” that is associated with the content sponsor associated with the row 216 and can determine that the brand “XYZ” is associated with the relevant transaction information (e.g., based on the purchased item of “XYZ- 444 ” and/or on the purchased item keyword of “XYZ”). Accordingly, the content server 208 can determine a linking between the impression associated with the row 216 and a conversion associated with the row 228 . When such a linking is determined, the content server 208 can debit the content sponsor of the content item 210 (e.g., based on a bid associated with the content item 210 ). The content server 208 can credit the eCommerce entity 218 based on the determined linking

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium for crediting an entity for a conversion. A method includes: providing an interface to an entity; receiving transaction information from the entity through the interface; creating a token; providing the token to the entity; storing the transaction information in association with the token in a first log; receiving from the entity a user identifier associated with the transaction along with the token; associating the user identifier with the token in a second log; determining a linking between impressions and conversions including using the token to determine a relevant user identifier and transaction details, and using the determined relevant user identifier to locate prior impressions made to the user; and debiting a content sponsor associated with the prior impression, and crediting a publisher that published the impression and the entity, when a linking impression and conversion is located.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for crediting an entity for a conversion. The method includes: providing an interface that is externally exposed to an eCommerce entity, the interface being configured to receive transaction information associated with transactions by entities with the eCommerce entity that are known to a content serving system; receiving through the interface transaction information associated with a first transaction; creating a token; providing the token to the eCommerce entity; storing the transaction information in association with the token in a first log; receiving from the eCommerce entity a user identifier associated with the transaction along with the token; associating the user identifier with the token in a second log; determining a linking between impressions and conversions based on the token, the first log, and the second log including using the token to determine a relevant user identifier and transaction details, and using the determined relevant user identifier to locate prior impressions made to the user; and debiting a content sponsor associated with the prior impression and crediting a publisher that published the impression, and the eCommerce entity that provided the transaction information when a linking impression and conversion is located.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products. A computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: provide an interface that is externally exposed to an eCommerce entity, the interface being configured to receive transaction information associated with transactions by entities with the eCommerce entity that are known to a content serving system; receive through the interface transaction information associated with a first transaction; create a token; provide the token to the eCommerce entity; store the transaction information in association with the token in a first log; receive from the eCommerce entity a user identifier associated with the transaction along with the token; associate the user identifier with the token in a second log; determine a linking between impressions and conversions based on the token, the first log, and the second log including using the token to determine a relevant user identifier and transaction details, and using the determined relevant user identifier to locate prior impressions made to the user; and debit a content sponsor associated with the prior impression and crediting a publisher that published the impression, and the eCommerce entity that provided the transaction information when a linking impression and conversion is located.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems. A system includes one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: provide an interface that is externally exposed to an eCommerce entity, the interface being configured to receive transaction information associated with transactions by entities with the eCommerce entity that are known to a content serving system; receive through the interface transaction information associated with a first transaction; create a token; provide the token to the eCommerce entity; store the transaction information in association with the token in a first log; receive from the eCommerce entity a user identifier associated with the transaction along with the token; associate the user identifier with the token in a second log; determine a linking between impressions and conversions based on the token, the first log, and the second log including using the token to determine a relevant user identifier and transaction details, and using the determined relevant user identifier to locate prior impressions made to the user; and debit a content sponsor associated with the prior impression and crediting a publisher that published the impression, and the eCommerce entity that provided the transaction information when a linking impression and conversion is located..
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Providing the interface can include providing an API. The user identifier can be received as a result of an iFrame being generated as part of the transaction. The iFrame can be associated with a domain of the content serving system. Receiving the user identifier can include receiving a cookie responsive to an iFrame being presented in association with the transaction. Prior impressions for the relevant user identifier can be identified. One or more impressions of content that have been made prior to a time associated with the transaction to a user associated can be located using the relevant user identifier. Transaction information for the transaction can be identified based on the token and the first log. The one or more impressions and transaction information can be evaluated to determine that they are related. Evaluating the one or more impressions and transaction information can include determining a brand associated with the impression and determining that the brand is associated with products or services identified in the transaction information. Evaluating the one or more impressions and transaction information can include determining a brand associated with a product or service that is part of the transaction and locating one or more impressions that relate to the brand. A log of impressions can be provided. The log can include user identifier information for entities that were presented content, and information describing the presented content. The information describing the presented content can include brand information. Bids can be received from content sponsors for conversions based on an initial brand impression. The bids can be stored in an inventory. Requests for content can be received and brand impressions from the inventory can be served responsive to the received request without debiting a content sponsor associated with a respective brand impression until a subsequent conversion is determined to have occurred based on the determined linking.
- Aspects of the invention can include none, one or more of the following advantages. A conversion associated with an impression of a brand content item can be tracked. Brand-related conversions associated with a content management system can be tracked without a user being logged in to the content management system. An entity can be credited for participating in conversion tracking.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 5 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- A content server can provide an interface to an entity (an eCommerce entity) and can receive transaction information through the interface. In response to receiving transaction information for a specific transaction, the content server can create a token, return the token to the entity, and store the transaction information in association with the token in a first log. Subsequently, the content server can receive a user identifier associated with the transaction and the token from the entity. The content server can associate the user identifier with the token in a second log. The content server can determine a linking between impressions and conversions based on the token, the first log, and the second log, such as by using the token to determine a relevant user identifier and transaction details, and using the determined relevant user identifier to locate prior impressions made to a user identified by the user identifier. The content server can debit a content sponsor associated with the prior impression and credit a publisher that published the impression and the entity that provided the transaction information.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server.

Other types of content providers are possible. - A
content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to thecontent provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device. - A
content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, providecampaign parameters 112 which define a content campaign. The content campaign can be created and activated for thecontent provider 108 according to theparameters 112 specified by thecontent provider 108. Thecampaign parameters 112 can be stored in acampaign database 113.Campaign parameters 112 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria. Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and/or one or more selection terms. The selection terms, can include, for example, one or more keywords. The selection terms can be used in evaluating when to serve content items in response to received requests for content. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. Anexample website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by apublisher 109, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105.Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. Theresources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, videos, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, tablet computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), televisions, set top boxes, personal digital assistants and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The web browser can interact with various types of web applications, such as a game, a map application, or an e-mail application, to name a few examples. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106.User devices 106 can also submitsearch queries 117 to thesearch system 115 over thenetwork 102. In response to asearch query 117, thesearch system 115 can, for example, access the indexedcache 116 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 117. Thesearch system 115 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 115 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 117, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - The data representing the
resource 105 or the search results 118 can also include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 orsearch results 118 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots or impressions. An example slot is an advertisement slot. - When a
resource 105 orsearch results 118 are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results 118. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots or impressions that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results 118. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to theresource 105 orsearch results 118 for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requestedresource 105 or asearch query 117 for which searchresults 118 are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to theresource 105 orsearch query 117. An identifier (e.g., cookie) associated with theuser device 106 and location information associated with theuser device 106 can be received with the request for content. - Based, for example, on data included in the request for content, the
content management system 110 can select (e.g., from a content items data store 119) content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request. Thecontent management system 110 can, for example, select a content item having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot. As another example, content items having selection criteria (e.g., keywords) that match resource keywords in thesearch query 117 or keywords included in the search results 118 may be selected as eligible content items by thecontent management system 110. As yet another example, thecontent management system 110 can identify a content item in the content items datastore 119 that is associated with a keyword that matches a keyword included in a user profile associated with the requestinguser device 106. - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction. For example,content providers 108 can provide bids specifying amounts that thecontent providers 108 are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items. In turn, an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated tocontent providers 108 according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item. For example, when a slot is being allocated in an auction, the slot can be allocated to thecontent provider 108 that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure). A quality score can be determined, for example, based on a quality of match between, for example, a keyword associated with a content item and keywords associated with a resource that includes the slot associated with the request. As another example, a quality score can be determined based on a quality of match between a keyword associated with a content item and keywords included in a user device profile associated with the requestinguser device 106. One or more selected content items can be provided to theuser device 106 in association with providing an associatedresource 105 or search results 118. The provided content item(s) can be presented on theuser device 106, in one or more respective slots. - Some of the
content providers 108 can configure one or more brand campaigns that include one or more brand content items. In some implementations, a brand campaign is characterized as one that includes information related to a brand, but does not solicit specific user interaction. Thecontent providers 108 may desire to track conversions that can be attributed to a brand campaign. A user of auser device 106 can, for example, execute a transaction (e.g., purchase a product or service) related to the brand, such as from aneCommerce entity 122. In some implementations, the user device might not be logged into thecontent management system 110 when the transaction is performed. As described in more detail below, thecontent management system 110 and theeCommerce entity 122 can be configured to the match the conversion with a prior presentation of content from a brand campaign. - What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item, is referred to a web page, and then consummates a purchase before leaving that web page. Actions that constitute a conversion can be specified by each
content provider 108 on a content provider by content provider basis. For example, eachcontent provider 108 can select, as a conversion, one or more measurable/observable user actions such as, for example, downloading a white paper, installing a software item, registering for a subscription, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or web page, or registering on a website. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used. A conversion can be defined to occur upon the occurrence of a final action that is used to define the conversion. For example, if a user visiting five web pages defines a conversion, the conversion occurs upon the user's request for the fifth web page, and the four page views that occurred prior to the request for the fifth web page are considered to have occurred prior to the conversion. - An
impression logger 124 can log impressions of content items onuser devices 106. For example, theimpression logger 124 can store impression information in animpression log 126. Information in the impression log can include, for example, impression information keyed by user device identifiers. Some impressions presented onuser devices 106 can be brand impressions. A user who views a brand impression may decide to purchase a product or service associated with the brand. For example, aneCommerce entity 122 can sell products and/or services associated with a plurality of brands including a brand associated with thecontent provider 108 who provided the brand impression. A user of auser device 106 can purchase a product or service associated with the brand from a website of aneCommerce entity 122. - A
transaction information receiver 130 can receive transaction information from theeCommerce entity 122, such as from an API (Application Programming Interface). Thecontent management system 110 can expose the API to the eCommerce entity 128 and thetransaction information receiver 130 can receive transaction information using the API. The transaction information can include, for example, an identifier of theeCommerce entity 122, price amount(s), transaction date, and information about purchased products and/or services. Thetransaction information receiver 130 can create a token to be associated with the transaction information and can return the token to theeCommerce entity 122 through the API. In some implementations, thetransaction information receiver 130 can store the transaction information in atransaction log 132, keyed by the token. - A user/
transaction linker 134 can associate a user/user device 106 with a transaction (e.g., linking a user that made a purchase with particular purchased items). For example, a resource associated with theeCommerce entity 122 can include an iFrame or other component that is loaded after a conversion is completed. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the iFrame can be amended to include the token. The token can be associated with the iFrame in other ways. The user/transaction linker 134 can receive, using the iFrame, the user/user device identifier along with the token and can store a mapping of the user/user device identifier to the token in a user/token map 136. - An impression/
conversion linker 138 can identify a relationship between an impression and a conversion. For example, the impression/conversion linker 138 can determine which transactions in the transaction log 132 correspond to an impression in theimpression log 126. The impression/conversion linker 138 can identify relationships using, at least in part, entries in the user/token map 136. Determining linking impressions and conversions is described in more detail below. - A credit/debit system 140 can issue credits and/or debits to entities that participate in the conversion transaction. For example, a
publisher 109 who published a resource on which the impression occurred can be credited. TheeCommerce entity 122 with whom the transaction occurred (and who reported the conversion) can be credited, such as with an electronic funds credit or with a credit that can be used to purchase services offered by the content management system 110 (e.g., theeCommerce entity 122 can use a credit to create a content campaign managed by the content management system 110). Thecontent provider 108 can be debited for the impression. In some implementations, the credit/debit system 140 debits thecontent provider 108 based at least in part on a conversion basis, wherein thecontent provider 108 is not charged or is not completely charged until a subsequent conversion is determined to have occurred (e.g., based on an impression/conversion linking as determined by the impression/conversion linker 138). -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of anexample system 200 for presenting content. Aweb page 202 is presented on auser device 204. Theweb page 202 includes acontent slot 206. A content request for a content item to present in thecontent slot 206 can be sent to acontent server 208. Thecontent server 208 can select a content item and provide the content item to theuser device 204, for presentation in thecontent slot 206, as illustrated by a presentedcontent item 210. Thecontent item 210 in this example is a brand content item provided by an XYZ Shoes content sponsor. - The
content server 208 can log information associated with the impression of thecontent item 210, such as in animpression log 212. For example, as shown inexample log data 214, arow 216 associated with the impression of thecontent item 210 can be stored, along with other rows associated with other impressions. Therow 216 includes an impression date of March 29, a device identifier (e.g. “Device1”) for theuser device 204, a content item identifier (e.g., “Item1”) for thecontent item 210, a content sponsor identifier (e.g., “XYZ Shoes”) which identifies the content sponsor of thecontent item 210, and selection criteria (e.g., “shoes”) associated with the content request for thecontent slot 206. Other information can be stored in therow 216. - Subsequent to the impression of the
content item 210 on theuser device 204, the user of theuser device 204 can use the user device 204 (or another device) to view one or more web pages provided by an eCommerce entity 218 (e.g., an online retailer). TheeCommerce entity 218 can sell products and/or services associated with the content sponsor (e.g., XYZ Shoes) of thecontent item 210 and products or services associated with other entities. The user of theuser device 204 can, for example, perform an interaction that is associated with a conversion event (e.g., purchase a product associated with the content sponsor using one or more web pages provided by the eCommerce entity 218). TheeCommerce entity 218 can provide, for example, one or more web pages or other resources from aweb resources repository 220. For example, the provided web pages can include an ordersummary web page 222 which can be provided to and presented on theuser device 204 after the user of theuser device 204 has completed a purchase from theeCommerce entity 218. - The
content server 208 can expose an interface, such as an API, to theeCommerce entity 218. TheeCommerce entity 218 can use the interface to provide information about transactions to thecontent server 208. The transaction information can include, for example, a transaction date/time, a transaction amount, information describing purchased products or services, and/or other information. TheeCommerce entity 218 can gather information, for example, from a transaction database accessible to theeCommerce entity 218 and/or from information gathered during the transaction. Thecontent server 208 can receive the transaction information using the interface. In response to receiving the transaction information, thecontent server 208 can generate a token to be associated with a specific transaction and can provide the token to theeCommerce entity 218. - The
content server 208 can store the transaction information in association with the token, such as in atransaction log 224. For example, as illustrated in exampletransaction log data 226, a row 228 can be stored. The row 228 includes a transaction date of April 2, a token (e.g., “Token1”), a transaction identifier (e.g., 123456 (in some implementations, the token serves as a transaction identifier)), a transaction amount (e.g., $79.99), an item-purchased identifier (e.g., XYZ-444), and item-purchased keywords (e.g., “XYZ shoes basketball”). - The
content server 208 can receive from the eCommerce entity 218 a user/user device identifier associated with the transaction. For example, theeCommerce entity 218 can generate a web page component, such as an iFrame, as part of the transaction conducted with theuser device 204. For example, an iFrame component 230 can be included in the ordersummary web page 222. The iFrame component 230 can, for example, be hidden (e.g., not visible to the user of the user device 204). TheeCommerce entity 218 can include data in or otherwise associate data with the iFrame component 230. For example, a user/user device identifier 232 (e.g., “Device1”) and a token 234 received from the content server 208 (e.g., “Token1”) are associated with the iFrame component 230. - In some implementations, the iFrame component 230 is associated with a domain of the
content server 208. Thecontent server 208 can use (e.g., communicate with) the iFrame component 230 to retrieve the user/user device identifier 232 and the token 234. Thecontent server 208 can store the user/user device identifier 232 in association with the token 234, such as in a user device/token log 236. In some implementations, example user device/token data 238 includes arow 240 which maps the user/user device identifier 232 (e.g., “Device1”) to the token 234 (e.g., “Token1”). Although the user device/token log 236 and thetransaction log 224 are shown as different logs, in some implementations, data items shown in the user device/token log 236 and thetransaction log 224 are stored in a same data structure. - The
content server 208 can process the user device/token log 236, thetransaction log 224, and the impression log 212 to determine a linking between an impression and a conversion. For example, thecontent server 208 can perform such processing on a periodic (e.g., daily) basis, or can perform such processing, for example, in response to receiving transaction information from an eCommerce entity such as theeCommerce entity 218. Thecontent server 208 can determine a linking between impressions and conversions by using a respective token to determine a relevant user/user device identifier and transaction details, and using the determined relevant user/user device identifier to locate prior impressions presented on the user device. - For example, the
content server 208 can, as part of processing therow 240, identify the row 228 as being associated with therow 240, such as based on both therow 240 and the row 228 each including a same token value (e.g., “Token1”). Thecontent server 208 can determine that the transaction information included in the row 228, including a transaction date/time of April 2, is relevant transaction information that is associated with the user device identifier (e.g., “Device1”) stored in the row 228. Thecontent server 208 can locate entries in the impression log 212 that represent impressions made on the user device with identifier of “Device1” that are prior to the relevant transaction date of April 2. For example, therow 216 can be located. - The
content server 208 can evaluate the located impression(s) to determine whether one or more impressions are related to the transaction. For example, thecontent server 208 can determine a brand (e.g., XYZ shoes) associated with the impression and determine that the brand is associated with the relevant transaction information. For example, thecontent server 208 can determine a brand of “XYZ” that is associated with the content sponsor associated with therow 216 and can determine that the brand “XYZ” is associated with the relevant transaction information (e.g., based on the purchased item of “XYZ-444” and/or on the purchased item keyword of “XYZ”). Accordingly, thecontent server 208 can determine a linking between the impression associated with therow 216 and a conversion associated with the row 228. When such a linking is determined, thecontent server 208 can debit the content sponsor of the content item 210 (e.g., based on a bid associated with the content item 210). Thecontent server 208 can credit theeCommerce entity 218 based on the determined linking -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for crediting an entity for a conversion.Arrow 301 represents acontent serving system 302 providing an interface to aneCommerce entity 304. For example, the interface can be externally exposed to theeCommerce entity 304 by thecontent serving system 302. As described below, the interface is configured to receive transaction information from theeCommerce entity 304. - As illustrated by
arrow 306, acontent sponsor 308 can associate a content item with a campaign that is managed by thecontent serving system 302. For example, selection criteria can be associated with the content item and/or the campaign. The content item can be provided to user devices in response to a request for content, such as for a content slot that is included in a publisher resource. - For example, a
user device 310 can request a publisher resource from apublisher 312, as illustrated byarrow 314. The publisher resource can be, for example, a web page. Thepublisher 312 can provide the requested resource to theuser device 310, as illustrated by arrow 316. The publisher resource can, as mentioned, include a content slot. When the publisher resource is presented on theuser device 310, a content request for the content slot can be sent to thecontent serving system 302, as illustrated byarrow 318. In some implementations, thepublisher 312, rather than theuser device 310, sends a content request for the content slot. Thecontent serving system 302 can select a content item to be provided in response to the request for content, such as the content item provided by thecontent sponsor 308. The selected content item can be provided to theuser device 310, as illustrated byarrow 320, for presentation in the content slot. Thecontent serving system 302 can log the impression of the content item (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 322), such as in an impression log. - Subsequent to the impression of the content item on the
user device 310, the user of theuser device 310 can visit a web page of theeCommerce entity 304. For example,arrow 324 illustrates theuser device 310 requesting a resource (e.g., web page) from theeCommerce entity 304. The eCommerce entity can provide the requested resource (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 326). The user of theuser device 310 can interact with one or more resources (e.g., web pages) of theeCommerce entity 304 to make an online purchase from the eCommerce entity 304 (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 328). - The
eCommerce entity 304 can send transaction information related to the transaction (e.g., online purchase) to the content serving system 302 (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 330), using the interface provided by thecontent serving system 302. Thecontent serving system 302, in response to receiving the transaction information, can create a token to be associated with the transaction information (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 332). Thecontent serving system 302 can send the token to the eCommerce entity (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 334). Thecontent serving system 302 can store the transaction information in association with the token, such as in a transaction log (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 336). - Upon receiving the token from the
content serving system 302, theeCommerce entity 304 can generate an iFrame component (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 338) and provide the iFrame component to the user device 310 (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 340). For example, the iFrame component can be included (e.g., as a hidden iFrame component) in a transaction confirmation web page that is provided to theuser device 310. The iFrame component can include the token provided to theeCommerce entity 304 and a user/user device identifier associated with theuser device 310. A domain of the iFrame component can be configured to be associated with a domain of thecontent serving system 302. - The
content serving system 302 can use the generated iFrame component to receive the user/user device identifier along with the token (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 342). Thecontent serving system 302 can store the user/user device identifier in association with the token (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 344), such as in a user-token log. Thecontent serving system 302 can determine a linking between impressions and conversions based on the token, the transaction log, and the user-token log (e.g., as illustrated by arrow 346). For example, thecontent serving system 302 can use the token to determine a relevant user identifier and transaction details, and use the determined relevant user identifier to locate prior impressions made to the user (e.g., in the impression log, such as including the impression associated with the content item provided by the content sponsor 308). - When a linking impression and conversion are located, the
content serving system 302 can credit the publisher that published the impression (e.g., the publisher 312), as illustrated byarrow 348. Thecontent serving system 302 can credit the eCommerce entity that provided the transaction information (e.g., the eCommerce entity 304), as illustrated byarrow 350. Thecontent serving system 302 can debit the content sponsor associated with the prior impression (e.g., the content sponsor 308), as illustrated byarrow 352. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of anexample process 400 for crediting an entity for a conversion. Theprocess 400 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 and/or thecontent server 208 described above with respect toFIG. 2 . - An interface is provided that is externally exposed to an eCommerce entity (402). The interface can be, for example, an API. The interface can be configured to receive transaction information associated with transactions by entities with the eCommerce entity that are known to a content serving system. For example, the transaction information can be associated with transactions performed by users and/or user devices known to the content serving system.
- Transaction information associated with a first transaction is received through the interface (404). The transaction information can include, for example, a transaction date/time, a transaction amount, information describing purchased products or services, and/or other information.
- A token is created (406). The token can be, for example, an identifier that has a value that is different from values of other tokens.
- The token is provided to the entity (e.g., the eCommerce entity) (408). For example, the token can be provided as a value that is returned, using the interface, to the eCommerce entity in response to receipt of the transaction information.
- The transaction information is stored in association with the token in a first log (410). The transaction information can be, for example, keyed by the token.
- A user identifier associated with the transaction is received from the entity along with the token (412). For example, the user identifier (e.g., a cookie) can be received as a result of an iFrame being generated as part of the transaction. The iFrame can be associated with a domain of the content serving system. The identifier can be received in response to the iFrame being presented in association with the transaction.
- The user identifier is associated with the token in a second log (414). For example, an entry can be added to the second log that includes the user identifier and the token. The entry can have one or more associated keys. For example, the keys can include one or more of the user identifier, the token, and/or a combination of the user identifier and the token.
- A linking between impressions and conversions is determined based on the token, the first log, and the second log (416). The token can be used to determine a relevant user identifier and transaction details. The determined relevant user identifier can be used to locate prior impressions made to the user. For example, one or more impressions of content can be located that have been made prior to a time associated with the transaction to a user associated with the relevant user identifier. For example, a log of impressions can be queried. The log can include user identifier information for entities that were presented content, and information describing the presented content. The information describing the presented content can include, for example, brand information.
- Transaction information can be identified, such as by querying the first log using the token. The located impression(s) and the transaction information can be evaluated to determine that the transaction information is related to one or more of the located impression(s). For example, a brand associated with an impression can be determined and a determination can be made that the brand is associated with products or services included in the transaction information. As another example, a brand associated with a product or service that is part of the transaction can be determined and one or more of the located impression(s) that relate to the brand can be identified.
- A content sponsor associated with the prior impression is debited and a publisher that published the impression and the eCommerce entity that provided the transaction information are credited when a linking impression and conversion is located (418). The crediting and/or debiting can occur on a periodic (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) basis, or in real time in response to the locating of the linking impression(s) and conversion.

FIG. 5 is a block diagram ofcomputing devices Computing device 500 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 550 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be illustrative only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document. -
Computing device 500 includes a processor 502,memory 504, astorage device 506, a high-speed interface 508 connecting tomemory 504 and high-speed expansion ports 510, and alow speed interface 512 connecting tolow speed bus 514 andstorage device 506. Each of thecomponents computing device 500, including instructions stored in thememory 504 or on thestorage device 506 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 516 coupled tohigh speed interface 508. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also,multiple computing devices 500 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 504 stores information within thecomputing device 500. In one implementation, thememory 504 is a computer-readable medium. The computer-readable medium is not a propagating signal. In one implementation, thememory 504 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 504 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. - The
storage device 506 is capable of providing mass storage for thecomputing device 500. In one implementation, thestorage device 506 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, thestorage device 506 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above.
