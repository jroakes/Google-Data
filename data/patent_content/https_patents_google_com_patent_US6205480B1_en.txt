Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to networked computer systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to user authentication and access to back-end or external applications via a web server.
- a web server In a typical web-based server application, user access to information is achieved via a web server, with the application requiring the user to be authenticated by, e.g., a user id and/or a password.
- a new application such as a database management system (DBMS) engine; new applications will often have a different configuration and/or manufacturer than the initial application
- DBMS database management system
- NTLM new technology LAN manager
- U.S. Pat. No. 5,689,638 to Sadovsky discloses a method and system for accessing independent network resources without prompting the user for authentication data.
- system logon and server authentication data is autonomously supplied to the independent network resource without further user interaction.
- Sadovsky is not concerned with a worldwide web hypertext transfer protocol environment, and is not concerned with authentication information based on the user's role.
- a password cache is maintained in the main memory of a local computer system.
- the password cache contains a server name, user name and password for each server to be accessed by a particular user.
- network software searches the password cache structure for the server authentication information before passing it on to the server to be accessed.
- U.S. Pat. No. 5,678,041 to Baker et al. discloses a system and method that restricts a user's access of Internet information based on a rating category and/or ID associated with a particular terminal through the implementation of a firewall internal to a user's computer network.
- the firewall prevents the user from accessing certain types of Internet information (e.g., prevents children from accessing obscene material, prevents workers from accessing non-work related material, etc.).
- Baker is concerned with an internal authorization to access remote resources (which are presumed to be public resources), and is not concerned with a system in which authentication information is required by the remote resources.
- the present invention overcomes the above-described problems, and achieves additional advantages, by providing for a system and method for authenticating a user in a web server environment, by providing for an authentication scheme in which users are logged in and authenticated a single time, yet can access multiple applications via a web server.
- an initial authentication is performed to access a first application via a first server, and the user's identity is mapped into a network credential which includes a user role.
- Additional applications are accessed by providing the network credential to a script, retrieving script access values for the additional applications based on the network credential and presenting the script access values (as, for example, user name and password) to the additional applications.
- the authentication scheme according to the present invention allows a user to access numerous protected resources with a single authentication procedure, greatly improving the user's ease of system use. Further, the use of role-based authentication simplifies system administration burdens.
- the present invention is particularly advantageous in an intranet environment.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an intranet network in which the present invention can be implemented.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart describing a method of automatically authenticating a user to back end applications in a network according to the present invention.
- the network includes a plurality of computer workstations 10 and a plurality of servers 12 residing on host machine 13 .
- Each workstation 10 includes a web browser 14 which serves as a user interface to allow the user to access resources in the network.
- Each server 12 acts as a gateway to provide the user access to various resources, including static HTML (web) pages 18 , back-end applications 20 (e.g., a database management system running on the same machine as the web server) and external applications 22 (which run on a different machine than the web server). Access to the back end or external applications is provided through a script or application 17 .
- Each server 12 is configured to allow access by a user to the server resources only upon user authentication to the server.
- the network also includes an X.500 or other suitable directory 16 , which is a network wide data storage resource. More details about X.500 directories are contained in document ITU-T Rec.X.500 (1993) “Information Technology-Open Systems Interconnection—The Directory: Overview of Concepts, Models and Services.”
- an initial user authentication is performed, such as by a user inputting authentication information into one of the computer workstations 10 .
- the initial authentication information is mapped to a role of the user.
- roles can include, but are not limited to, “executive”, “clerk”, “accounting” etc.
- Roles can be related to particular departments of an organization, with special designations for department heads. It is assumed that the number of potential user roles will be less than the number of potential users of the network. The user's role determines which applications, and hence which network resources, can be accessed by that user. For purposes of explanation, it is assumed that the network of FIG. 1 is part of an intranet.
- an intranet is a network which uses the same types of software and components as the Internet, but the intranet is reserved for private use only. It is increasingly common for private entities to have web servers which are accessible only to certain persons. While the discussion assumes an intranet environment, it will of course be appreciated that the principles of the present invention can be readily adapted for use in other network environments.
- the directory 16 stores information which allows the user's authentication information to be mapped into a network credential which includes a role of the user.
- the network credential can then be formed into a cookie.
- the user inputs a request to access additional resources, which may be associated with the user's initial server or a new server in the network.
- Access to the back end or external application is achieved using a script (a series of commands which can be executed without user interaction) or other similar means accessible as a web server resource.
- the script is written by the system administrator, stored on the same host machine as the web server, and provides the login code for the server/application.
- the user name and password are not hardcoded into the script, but rather are stored in script access procedure variables (SV) having names chosen by the system administrator.
- the password values are preferably encrypted to enhance security.
- the SV's are stored in a database which can be the directory 16 or another suitable database (such as database 19 associated with the server host 13 ) accessible to the server.
- the script in response to a user request through the browser, retrieves the SV value from the directory 16 based on an SV name contained in the script, the user's role and identity (contained in a cookie provided to the script). In this manner, the identity and password used by the user to access the third party application are determined by the user's role and individual identity.
- step 100 a user logs on to the network (e.g., the network shown in FIG. 1) using any conventional login procedure, and the browser accesses a web server.
- step 102 an initial authentication procedure is performed, and is accepted by the server to establish a user identity to the server.
- the initial authentication can be achieved using basic authentication (which requires user interaction), NTLM (which requires no user interaction), X.509 certificate (which may or may not require user interaction), or other suitable means.
- step 104 it is determined whether the user already has a cookie containing a network credential. If there is not yet a user cookie, one is created in step 106 by consulting the directory 16 to map the user's identity to an intermediate identity and a user role, which are used to form a network credential. If no mapping can be found between the user's local identity and a network credential, a “no-map” cookie is created to prevent repeated failed lookups.
- the user's network credential is formed into a cookie by appending the identity of the user's terminal to the credential, and making a cryptographic seal of the result.
- the cookie is then preferably encoded.
- a cookie is a message given to a web browser by a web server to record aspects of the interaction history between the browser and server, and which is stored by the web browser to facilitate access to additional server resources.
- the cookie is preferably configured to disappear when the browser program is closed by the user.
- the cookie is returned to the browser.
- step 110 the process skips steps 106 and 108 , and proceeds to step 110 .
- step 110 the user attempts access to a new application (a back-end application resident on the same host machine as the web server or an external application not resident on the same host machine as the web server) by inputting a request to the browser, which then attempts to access the requested resources. These additional resources may or may not be accessible to the user based on the user's assigned role.
- the browser obtains authentication information, in the form of SV values necessary to access the back-end or external application, by accessing a script for single sign on stored with the web server, and transferring the cookie to the script.
- the script retrieves the script access variable for the back-end or external application based on the network credential (including the user role), and presents the SV values to the new application.
- Step 112 is performed automatically by the browser without any action required on the part of the user beyond presenting the request in step 108 .
- the desired application grants access based on the authentication information obtained in step 112 .
