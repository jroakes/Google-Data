- FIG. 2 illustrates an example system for serving shared content on a video sharing web site 200 .
- the system 200 may be implemented on the computer 100 of FIG. 1 .
- the system 200 includes a video database 210 , a shared content database 220 , a playlist database 230 , a playlist analyzer 240 , and shared content insertion unit 250 .
- the system 200 communicates via network 260 to a video sharing web site 270 .
- the video sharing web site 270 may be stored on a video sharing web site server 280 .
- the system 200 may be implemented on the video sharing web site server 280 .
- the video database 210 stores various videos that are received from the video sharing web site 270 .
- the videos may be sourced from the video sharing web site 270 users, the video sharing web site 270 itself, or third-party partners.
- the videos may range in subject matter from professionally produced videos (i.e. a movie trailers, music videos, for example) to those that are personal in nature (i.e. wedding videos, children's birthday parties, school recitals, for example).
- personal videos may employ audio or other shared content from other sources.
- a music label may authorize that a song it owns be employed in personal videos.
- a user may overlay a personal video with the authorized song. In this way, a user is given control to enhance the user's video with authorized content.
- users may remix or present the original content in a different way. Users may mix multiple songs or content items into a single video.
- the video sharing web site 270 allows a user to use original content only when the original owner of the content being remixed or altered has given express authorization to do so.
- the shared content database 220 includes a video shared content database 221 and an audio shared content database 222 .
- the video shared content database 221 stores video shared content; such as, a trailer to an upcoming movie.
- Video shared content may serve the dual purpose of providing both visual and audio information to the user of the video sharing web site 270 .
- Audio-only shared content database 222 stores audio-only shared content.
- Audio-only shared content may contain audio-only information, or refer to shared content tailored to disseminate information primarily via audio (i.e. audio-only shared content may employ visual cues as well, such as banners or videos).
- Audio-only shared content may be in a form similar to a radio segment, for example. Audio-only shared content may rely on lesser resources to distribute, as bandwidth usually dedicated to video or click-through meta information may be avoided.
- An implementer of system 200 may determine that a monetization amount associated with video shared content differs than that associated with audio-only shared content.
- the playlist database 230 stores various playlists created by users on the video sharing web site 270 , or by an automatic playlist generator.
- Video sharing web site 270 users may search for specific videos, and queue them for playing. While a user is viewing one video, the user may search for other videos to queue for future playing.
- the video sharing web site 270 also may also employ an automatic playlist generator 235 .
- the video sharing web site 270 may store a user's preferences.
- the video sharing web site 270 may create a playlist based on this knowledge. For example, if the video sharing web site 270 contains data that the user likes a specific artist, or genre, the automatic playlist generator 235 may populate a playlist with content similar to the specific artist or genre.
- the video sharing web site 270 may utilize the stored user preferences to generate the playlist via the automatic playlist generator 235 .
- the system 200 via the automatic playlist generator 235 , may track the user's browsing and consumption history, and create a playlist based on this information.
- the playlist analyzer 240 receives a generated playlist from the playlist database 230 .
- the playlist analyzer 240 may analyze the various items queued in the playlist.
- the playlist analyzer 240 may identify, using content-id, an original authorized content item associated with the various items queued in the playlist. For example, if the playlist has two videos queued, the playlist analyzer 240 may determine that the audio associated with both videos is sourced from the same artist or genre.
- the playlist analyzer 240 also may determine an attribute of the user associated with the playlist. For example, if the playlist is associated with an artist whose primary audience is people over the age of 40, the playlist analyzer 240 may determine that the user is over the age of 40.
- the playlist analyzer 240 also may determine whether the playlist is directed towards a user consuming the video and audio content of the individual media items, or merely just the audio associated with the content.
- the playlist analyzer 240 receives a playlist from the playlist database 230 .
- the playlist analyzer 240 determines if the playlist is suitable for audio-only shared content. If the playlist analyzer 240 makes this determination, the playlist analyzer 240 sends the playlist to the shared content insertion unit 250 , with the instruction to add audio-only shared content.
- the playlist analyzer 240 may accomplish this by determining that a certain percentage of the various items of the playlist are associated with a single artist, or music from a specific genre. Thus, if the playlist is populated primarily with videos associated with music, the playlist analyzer 240 may determine that the user is not actively viewing the videos associated with each item.
- the playlist analyzer 240 may determine that the media item is primarily listened to, by determining that the motion in a video is under a threshold amount. For example, if the video is of a college professor presenting a lecture, and the college professor is primarily located in one spot, i.e. a podium, the playlist analyzer 240 may determine that the video is primarily audio in nature.
- the playlist analyzer 240 may also determine that the media is primarily listened to by determining that a user is accessing the video sharing web site 270 with a mobile device. The playlist analyzer 240 may augment this determination by detecting that the user is moving, and thus determine that the user is utilizing the video sharing web site 270 as a source for primarily listened to content.
- the playlist analyzer 240 might analyze certain segments of the playlist as well. For example, if the playlist has 5 songs, the playlist analyzer 240 might ascertain that songs 1 and 2 are related to a similar topic, artist or genre. By locally analyzing segments of the playlist, the playlist analyzer 240 may determine shared content to be used as a transition between each item of a playlist. A pre-defined threshold for the number of songs falling within a specific category (i.e. genre, artist, theme) may be set for the purposes of analyzing the playlist.
- a specific category i.e. genre, artist, theme
- the playlist analyzer 240 may retrieve specific shared content from the shared content database 220 .
- the shared content database 220 may retrieve audio-only shared content for a user above the age of 40.
- the shared content insertion unit 250 may insert shared content from the shared content database 240 within the playlist, such as in between two distinct media items belonging to the playlist. Relying on the example used above, if the playlist has 5 songs, and the playlist analyzer 240 determines that songs 1 and 2 are from a specific artist, the shared content insertion unit 250 may insert the shared content retrieved based on analysis performed by the playlist analyzer 240 . For example, the advertisement insertion unit 250 may insert audio-only shared content for a concert related to the specific artist associated with songs 1 and 2.
- the system 200 may deliver, via network 260 , the playlist with shared content inserted, to the video sharing web site 270 .
- a user when accessing the video sharing web site 270 , may select a playlist, and based on the playlist modified by system 200 , experience the media associated with the playlist, with shared content embedded therein.
- the shared content insertion unit 250 may insert audio-only shared content in between various items in the playlist.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a method for serving shared content on a video sharing web site via system 200 .
- a playlist is retrieved.
- the playlist may be user-created, automatically generated, or be a combination of both.
- the playlist may be automatically generated by the user's preference or browsing history.
- the playlist is analyzed to determine the media consumption associated with content of the playlist.
- the playlist may be analyzed to ascertain if the media will primarily be listened to or watched.
- One such technique is to ascertain whether the audio associated with the media of each item in the playlist is related through a common thread, such as being directed to the same artist, genre or theme.
- the system 200 may estimate the user is either a video and audio consumer, or an audio-only media consumer. In performing this analysis, the system 200 may employ content-id to determine the media's audio source. Thus, if a user is authorized to do so, and places a song from a popular artist over their video, the analysis of operation 301 may classify that the audio is sourced from the popular artist.
- the playlist may also be analyzed to ascertain a user preference or attribute.
- the playlist may be analyzed, and it may be determined that the playlist is directed towards media from an artist popular amongst users over the age of 40.
- Various other attributes may also be determined, such as artist preferences, musical genre preferences, and the like.
- the system 200 retrieves shared content.
- the system 200 may determine that the user is only listening to the media sourced from the video sharing web site 270 . In this case, the system 200 may retrieve audio-only shared content. Conversely, if it appears as though the user is also actively watching the videos that constitute the playlist, the system 200 may insert video and audio shared content.
- the system 200 may determine shared content to include based on the user preference.
- shared content might be selected that describes goods or services that are ideally directed to users over the age of 40. In this way, by analyzing the playlist, and estimating the user's preference, shared content correlating to the user's preferences may be delivered to the user.
- the shared content retrieved in operation 304 is inserted in between various items contained in the playlist.
- the shared content insertion may be localized within the playlists, i.e. if two items are directly on point to the shared content, the shared content may be inserted in between those two items.
- a user primarily listening to the media, while not viewing the associated video may be delivered primarily audio-only shared content.
- effective shared content may be delivered to the user, while not wasting bandwidth on video shared content when a user is not viewing the videos.
- an optional monetization operation may occur.
- the video sharing web site 270 may determine that media items that were used to determine the analysis may share in revenue generated from the insertion of the shared content.
- the video sharing web site 270 may determine that both the proceeding media item, as well as the succeeding media item may share in the revenue generated from audio-only shared content inserted in between both media items.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example transformation of a playlist according to the method described in FIG. 3 .
- Playlist 400 has two media items, entry 410 ‘Beethoven's Symphony’ and entry 420 ‘A wedding video using a Mozart piece as a background’.
- the system 200 analyzes the playlist 400 , and generates playlist 450 .
- the system 200 analyzes that entry 410 and entry 420 are both directed to classical music.
- the system 200 may ascertain that entry 420 is directed to classical music by relying on content-id technology.
- an entry 415 ‘Shared Content for a Classical Music Concert’ is inserted in between entry 410 and entry 420 .
- the system 200 may also determine that the user playing playlist 400 is focused on the audio properties of the various media items contained in playlist 400 .
- the system 200 may insert entry 415 as audio-only shared content.
- the computing system includes a processor (CPU) and a system bus that couples various system components including a system memory such as read only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM), to the processor. Other system memory may be available for use as well.

Abstract
Description
- This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/080,696 filed on Oct. 25, 2022, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/790,562 filed on Mar. 3, 2013. The disclosures of the prior applications are considered part of and are incorporated by reference in the disclosure of this application.
- A video sharing web site allows users to distribute, index and consume videos sourced from other users via the Internet. Thus, one user may upload a video, while another user may consume the video. The video sharing web site stores the video, while providing an interface for users to upload, search for and view the video.
- A user may generate a video, and upload the video for other users to view. In certain cases, the user may want to edit the video by adding authorized content from other sources. Authorized content refers to a media item, such as audio owned by a publisher or owner of the rights to the audio, in which the publisher or owner has given permission to include as part of a user-created video. Additionally, videos may be sourced from the video sharing web site, or from a third-party content provider.
- Often times, authorized content such as a popular song, may be associated with a user-created or chosen video. For example, a user may employ a popular song to be distributed over a video of the user's wedding. Thus, when another user searches for the popular song, the other user may be directed to the user-created video of their wedding. The video sharing web site may employ a content identification technique (content-id) to determine that the audio associated with the user-created video is sourced from the popular song. Similarly, the video sharing web site may employ a similar process for determining if remixes or altered forms of the popular song also are incorporated as part of the user-created video.
- A video viewer may select certain videos stored on the video sharing web site, and request that the videos be played in succession. The selected videos may be referred collectively as a playlist. The playlist may be wholly created by the video viewer, or alternatively or in addition to, created by an automatic selection process employed by the video sharing web site. For example, the video sharing web site may ascertain that the video viewer enjoys a specific genre of music. The video sharing web site then may automatically retrieve videos related to the specific genre, and auto-populate the playlist.
- Certain users may create a playlist for mainly audio listening purposes. For example, a restaurant owner may select videos to create a playlist. The playlist may then be reproduced over a sound system at the restaurant owner's location. As a result, video content associated with the selected videos may be wholly ignored or irrelevant to the restaurant owner's playlist consumption.

FIG. 4 illustrates an example transformation of a playlist according to the method described inFIG. 3 . - A video sharing web site distributes videos over the Internet to various users. The videos may have both visual and audio components, and some users, depending on their preferences, may be interested in only visual components, or only the audio components. A user not viewing the video may not experience certain visual cues contained in video. Thus, if a user uses the video sharing web site primarily for listening purposes, the user may fail to experience all the information conveyed via shared content distributed along with the video.
- Disclosed herein are examples of methods and systems for serving shared content based on a playlist sourced from a video sharing web site. The methods and systems disclosed herein employ a concept of analyzing a playlist, determining the content associated with the playlist, and serving shared content based on the analysis. By employing the methods and systems disclosed herein, the video sharing web site may ensure that shared content that is effective at disseminating information to specific users is directed to users of the video sharing web site.
- For example, where a restaurant owner creates a playlist, mainly for distributing the audio associated with the playlist items, a video sharing web site may determine that the playlist is used primarily for audio-only purposes. Thus, the video sharing web site may be programmed to analyze the content associated with the playlist and choose an audio-only shared content to be interested in between various playlist items. In this way, a video sharing web site may employ effective shared content for disseminating information based on the playlist being primarily listened to.
- Further, by utilizing content-id in performing the analysis of the playlist, the video sharing web site may be more effective at analyzing the playlist to ensure that it is being consumed primarily for its audio content. For example, if a user selects two videos, a song from a popular artist and a user-created video that employs another song from the same artist, by utilizing content-id, the video sharing web site may determine that the playlist is focused on content from the popular artist. Thus, audio-only shared content may be directed to the user based on the shared content being related to the popular artist.
- In situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.

FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating anexample computer 100. Thecomputer 100 includes at least oneprocessor 102 coupled to achipset 104. Thechipset 104 includes amemory controller hub 120 and an input/output (I/O)controller hub 122. Amemory 106 and a graphics adapter 112 are coupled to thememory controller hub 120, and adisplay 118 is coupled to the graphics adapter 112. Astorage device 108,keyboard 110, pointing device 114, andnetwork adapter 116 are coupled to the I/O controller hub 122. Other embodiments of thecomputer 100 may have different architectures. - The
storage device 108 is a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium such as a hard drive, compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), DVD, or a solid-state memory device. Thememory 106 holds instructions and data used by theprocessor 102. The pointing device 114 is a mouse, track ball, or other type of pointing device, and is used in combination with thekeyboard 110 to input data into thecomputer system 100. The graphics adapter 112 displays images and other information on thedisplay 118. Thenetwork adapter 116 couples thecomputer system 100 to one or more computer networks. - The
computer 100 is adapted to execute computer program modules for providing functionality described herein. As used herein, the term “module” refers to computer program logic used to provide the specified functionality. Thus, a module can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software. In one embodiment, program modules are stored on thestorage device 108, loaded into thememory 106, and executed by theprocessor 102. - The types of computers used by the entities and processes disclosed herein can vary depending upon the embodiment and the processing power required by the entity. The
computer 100 may be a mobile device, tablet, smartphone or any sort of computing element with the above-listed elements. For example, a video corpus, such as a hard disk, solid state memory or storage device, might be stored in a distributed database system comprising multiple blade servers working together to provide the functionality described herein. Thecomputer 100 may be implemented without some of the components described above, such askeyboards 110, graphics adapters 112, and displays 118. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an example system for serving shared content on a video sharingweb site 200. Thesystem 200 may be implemented on thecomputer 100 ofFIG. 1 . Thesystem 200 includes avideo database 210, a sharedcontent database 220, aplaylist database 230, aplaylist analyzer 240, and sharedcontent insertion unit 250. As illustrated inFIG. 2 , thesystem 200 communicates vianetwork 260 to a video sharingweb site 270. The video sharingweb site 270 may be stored on a video sharingweb site server 280. Alternatively, thesystem 200 may be implemented on the video sharingweb site server 280. - The
video database 210 stores various videos that are received from the video sharingweb site 270. The videos may be sourced from the video sharingweb site 270 users, the video sharingweb site 270 itself, or third-party partners. The videos may range in subject matter from professionally produced videos (i.e. a movie trailers, music videos, for example) to those that are personal in nature (i.e. wedding videos, children's birthday parties, school recitals, for example). - In certain cases, personal videos may employ audio or other shared content from other sources. For example, a music label may authorize that a song it owns be employed in personal videos. Thus, if authorized, a user may overlay a personal video with the authorized song. In this way, a user is given control to enhance the user's video with authorized content.
- Additionally, users may remix or present the original content in a different way. Users may mix multiple songs or content items into a single video. Once again, the video sharing
web site 270 allows a user to use original content only when the original owner of the content being remixed or altered has given express authorization to do so. - The shared
content database 220 includes a video sharedcontent database 221 and an audio sharedcontent database 222. The video sharedcontent database 221 stores video shared content; such as, a trailer to an upcoming movie. Video shared content may serve the dual purpose of providing both visual and audio information to the user of the video sharingweb site 270. - An audio shared
content database 222 stores audio-only shared content. Audio-only shared content may contain audio-only information, or refer to shared content tailored to disseminate information primarily via audio (i.e. audio-only shared content may employ visual cues as well, such as banners or videos). Audio-only shared content may be in a form similar to a radio segment, for example. Audio-only shared content may rely on lesser resources to distribute, as bandwidth usually dedicated to video or click-through meta information may be avoided. - An implementer of
system 200 may determine that a monetization amount associated with video shared content differs than that associated with audio-only shared content. - The
playlist database 230 stores various playlists created by users on the video sharingweb site 270, or by an automatic playlist generator. Video sharingweb site 270 users may search for specific videos, and queue them for playing. While a user is viewing one video, the user may search for other videos to queue for future playing. - The video sharing
web site 270 also may also employ anautomatic playlist generator 235. The video sharingweb site 270 may store a user's preferences. The video sharingweb site 270 may create a playlist based on this knowledge. For example, if the video sharingweb site 270 contains data that the user likes a specific artist, or genre, theautomatic playlist generator 235 may populate a playlist with content similar to the specific artist or genre. The video sharingweb site 270 may utilize the stored user preferences to generate the playlist via theautomatic playlist generator 235. Alternatively, if the user has given express permission to do so, thesystem 200, via theautomatic playlist generator 235, may track the user's browsing and consumption history, and create a playlist based on this information. - The
playlist analyzer 240 receives a generated playlist from theplaylist database 230. Theplaylist analyzer 240 may analyze the various items queued in the playlist. Theplaylist analyzer 240 may identify, using content-id, an original authorized content item associated with the various items queued in the playlist. For example, if the playlist has two videos queued, theplaylist analyzer 240 may determine that the audio associated with both videos is sourced from the same artist or genre. - The
playlist analyzer 240 also may determine an attribute of the user associated with the playlist. For example, if the playlist is associated with an artist whose primary audience is people over the age of 40, theplaylist analyzer 240 may determine that the user is over the age of 40. - The
playlist analyzer 240 also may determine whether the playlist is directed towards a user consuming the video and audio content of the individual media items, or merely just the audio associated with the content. Theplaylist analyzer 240 receives a playlist from theplaylist database 230. Theplaylist analyzer 240 determines if the playlist is suitable for audio-only shared content. If theplaylist analyzer 240 makes this determination, theplaylist analyzer 240 sends the playlist to the sharedcontent insertion unit 250, with the instruction to add audio-only shared content. - For example, the
playlist analyzer 240 may accomplish this by determining that a certain percentage of the various items of the playlist are associated with a single artist, or music from a specific genre. Thus, if the playlist is populated primarily with videos associated with music, theplaylist analyzer 240 may determine that the user is not actively viewing the videos associated with each item. - The
playlist analyzer 240 may determine that the media item is primarily listened to, by determining that the motion in a video is under a threshold amount. For example, if the video is of a college professor presenting a lecture, and the college professor is primarily located in one spot, i.e. a podium, theplaylist analyzer 240 may determine that the video is primarily audio in nature. - The
playlist analyzer 240 may also determine that the media is primarily listened to by determining that a user is accessing the video sharingweb site 270 with a mobile device. Theplaylist analyzer 240 may augment this determination by detecting that the user is moving, and thus determine that the user is utilizing the video sharingweb site 270 as a source for primarily listened to content. - In addition to analyzing the playlist as a whole, the
playlist analyzer 240 might analyze certain segments of the playlist as well. For example, if the playlist has 5 songs, theplaylist analyzer 240 might ascertain that songs 1 and 2 are related to a similar topic, artist or genre. By locally analyzing segments of the playlist, theplaylist analyzer 240 may determine shared content to be used as a transition between each item of a playlist. A pre-defined threshold for the number of songs falling within a specific category (i.e. genre, artist, theme) may be set for the purposes of analyzing the playlist. - Once the
playlist analyzer 240 has ascertained certain aspects about the user, and how the user is consuming media from the video sharingweb site 270, theplaylist analyzer 240 may retrieve specific shared content from the sharedcontent database 220. Thus, if the user is identified as over the age of 40, and an audio-only media consumer, the sharedcontent database 220 may retrieve audio-only shared content for a user above the age of 40. - The shared
content insertion unit 250 may insert shared content from the sharedcontent database 240 within the playlist, such as in between two distinct media items belonging to the playlist. Relying on the example used above, if the playlist has 5 songs, and theplaylist analyzer 240 determines that songs 1 and 2 are from a specific artist, the sharedcontent insertion unit 250 may insert the shared content retrieved based on analysis performed by theplaylist analyzer 240. For example, theadvertisement insertion unit 250 may insert audio-only shared content for a concert related to the specific artist associated with songs 1 and 2. - The
system 200 may deliver, vianetwork 260, the playlist with shared content inserted, to the video sharingweb site 270. A user, when accessing the video sharingweb site 270, may select a playlist, and based on the playlist modified bysystem 200, experience the media associated with the playlist, with shared content embedded therein. Thus, if the user is consuming the playlist for the purposes of audio-only (or a majority of audio-only) consumption, the sharedcontent insertion unit 250 may insert audio-only shared content in between various items in the playlist. -
FIG. 3 illustrates a method for serving shared content on a video sharing web site viasystem 200. - In
operation 301, a playlist is retrieved. The playlist may be user-created, automatically generated, or be a combination of both. The playlist may be automatically generated by the user's preference or browsing history. - In
operation 302, the playlist is analyzed to determine the media consumption associated with content of the playlist. For example, the playlist may be analyzed to ascertain if the media will primarily be listened to or watched. One such technique is to ascertain whether the audio associated with the media of each item in the playlist is related through a common thread, such as being directed to the same artist, genre or theme. Inoperation 302, thesystem 200 may estimate the user is either a video and audio consumer, or an audio-only media consumer. In performing this analysis, thesystem 200 may employ content-id to determine the media's audio source. Thus, if a user is authorized to do so, and places a song from a popular artist over their video, the analysis ofoperation 301 may classify that the audio is sourced from the popular artist. - In
operation 303, the playlist may also be analyzed to ascertain a user preference or attribute. For example, the playlist may be analyzed, and it may be determined that the playlist is directed towards media from an artist popular amongst users over the age of 40. Various other attributes may also be determined, such as artist preferences, musical genre preferences, and the like. - In
operation 304, based on the playlist analysis performed inoperations system 200 retrieves shared content. Thus, thesystem 200 may determine that the user is only listening to the media sourced from the video sharingweb site 270. In this case, thesystem 200 may retrieve audio-only shared content. Conversely, if it appears as though the user is also actively watching the videos that constitute the playlist, thesystem 200 may insert video and audio shared content. - Additionally, based on the analysis performed in
operation 303, thesystem 200 may determine shared content to include based on the user preference. Thus, if thesystem 200 determines that the media associated with the playlist is popular amongst users over the age of 40, shared content might be selected that describes goods or services that are ideally directed to users over the age of 40. In this way, by analyzing the playlist, and estimating the user's preference, shared content correlating to the user's preferences may be delivered to the user. - In
operation 305, the shared content retrieved inoperation 304 is inserted in between various items contained in the playlist. The shared content insertion may be localized within the playlists, i.e. if two items are directly on point to the shared content, the shared content may be inserted in between those two items. Based on the operations disclosed above, a user primarily listening to the media, while not viewing the associated video, may be delivered primarily audio-only shared content. Thus, effective shared content may be delivered to the user, while not wasting bandwidth on video shared content when a user is not viewing the videos. - In
operation 306, an optional monetization operation may occur. The video sharingweb site 270 may determine that media items that were used to determine the analysis may share in revenue generated from the insertion of the shared content. The video sharingweb site 270 may determine that both the proceeding media item, as well as the succeeding media item may share in the revenue generated from audio-only shared content inserted in between both media items. -
FIG. 4 illustrates an example transformation of a playlist according to the method described inFIG. 3 . - Referring to a
FIG. 4 , an original playlist is shown,playlist 400.Playlist 400 has two media items, entry 410 ‘Beethoven's Symphony’ and entry 420 ‘A wedding video using a Mozart piece as a background’. - In response to
playlist 400 being selected by a user to play on a video sharingweb site 270, thesystem 200 analyzes theplaylist 400, and generatesplaylist 450. Thesystem 200 analyzes thatentry 410 andentry 420 are both directed to classical music. Thesystem 200 may ascertain thatentry 420 is directed to classical music by relying on content-id technology. As shown inplaylist 450, an entry 415 ‘Shared Content for a Classical Music Concert’ is inserted in betweenentry 410 andentry 420. Thesystem 200 may also determine that theuser playing playlist 400 is focused on the audio properties of the various media items contained inplaylist 400. Thus, thesystem 200 may insertentry 415 as audio-only shared content. - Certain of the devices shown in
FIG. 1 include a computing system. The computing system includes a processor (CPU) and a system bus that couples various system components including a system memory such as read only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM), to the processor.
