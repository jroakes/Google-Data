Definitions
- This specification relates to Internet search engines.
- Internet search engines aim to identify resources, e.g., web pages, images, text documents, and multimedia content, that are relevant to a user's information needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user.
- resources e.g., web pages, images, text documents, and multimedia content
- Internet search engines generally return a set of search results, each identifying a respective resource, in response to a user-submitted query.
- This specification describes technologies that relate to generating contextual search presentations.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of obtaining selection data identifying a term selected by a user from a document displayed to the user, the term comprising one or more adjacent words, and context data comprising one or more other words in the document; determining whether or not the context data and the selection data satisfy one or more criteria for presenting any of one or more types of special case contextual search presentations, wherein each type of special case contextual search presentation includes a formatted presentation of a different type of content; in response to determining that the context data and the selection satisfy criteria for presenting a first type of special case contextual search presentation, generating a first special case contextual search presentation of the first type for the selected term; in response to determining that the context data and the selection data do not satisfy the criteria for presenting any of the types of special case contextual search presentations, generating a default contextual search presentation for the selected term; and providing the first special case contextual search presentation or the default contextual search presentation for presentation to the user.
- inventions of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a system of one or more computers to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the system has installed on it software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them that in operation cause the system to perform the operations or actions.
- one or more computer programs to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the one or more programs include instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the operations or actions.
- the default contextual search presentation can be a definitional answer box, wherein the definitional answer box is a formatted presentation of a definition of the term selected by the user, and wherein generating the contextual search presentation comprises obtaining the definitional answer box from a search engine in response to a first search query that includes the selected term.
- Generating the default contextual search presentation can include obtaining search results from the search engine for one or more search queries derived from the selected term.
- disambiguation system whether or not the selected term refers to an entity in context of the other words in the document.
- the actions can further include: determining that the selected term refers to an entity in context of the other words in the document; and generating an entity contextual search presentation for the selected term, comprising obtaining a knowledge panel for the entity referred to by the selected term from a search engine.
- the actions can further include: determining that the context data and the selection data identify an amount in an identified currency and that the identified currency is different from the currency associated with the user; and generating a currency contextual search presentation for the context data and the selection data, comprising obtaining, from a search engine, a currency answer box including an amount in the identified currency and a corresponding amount in the currency associated with the user.
- the actions can further include: determining that the language in which the selected term is written is different from the language associated with the user of the user device; and generating a translation contextual search presentation for the selected term, comprising obtaining, from a search engine, a translation answer box including a translation of the selected term into the language associated with the user.
- the actions can further include: determining that the selected term identifies a time in a particular time zone that is different from the time zone associated with the user; generating a time zone contextual search presentation for the selected term, comprising obtaining, from a search engine, a time zone answer box the time in the particular time zone and a corresponding time in the time zone associated with the user.
- a user viewing a document on a user device can easily obtain relevant information about a portion of a document, e.g., a word in the document, one or more adjacent words in the document, or another portion of the document.
- the relevant information is provided to the user in a manner that takes into account the context of the word in the document or the context that the user is in. Additionally, different kinds of information relevant to the portion of the document can be provided to the user depending on the context, improving the user experience.
- the relevant information can be provided to the user in a manner that allows the user to easily view the information while continuing to view the displayed document.
- the user can identify the portion of the document that he or she desires relevant information about through a simple gesture, e.g., a tap touch input or a long-press touch input on a touchscreen display.

- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for generating a contextual search presentation for a selected word.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process for determining whether criteria for presenting special case contextual search presentations are satisfied and generating special case contextual search presentations.
- FIG. 1A shows an example document 102 displayed on an example mobile device 104.
- the document 102 is displayed in a web browser executing on the mobile device 104.
- a user of the mobile device 104 has submitted a touch input 106 on the touchscreen display of the mobile device 104 to select a word, "Anders," in the document 102.
- FIG. IB shows an example drag-up bar 110 displayed on the example mobile device 104.
- the drag-up bar 1 10 is a user interface element that displays the name of an entity "Anders Fogh Rasmussen” that is referred to by the word selected by the user of the mobile device 104.
- the mobile device 104 has provided word selection data and context data to a search system.
- the word selection data identifies the word selected by the user, i.e., "Anders,” and the context data includes other words from the document 102.
- the context data can include each word within a threshold number of words of the selected word in the document.
- the context data can also include other words or terms associated with the document, e.g., the title of the document, headings in the document, captions of images in the document, or anchor text of in-links to the document.
- the search system has provided to the mobile device 104 data identifying the entity referred to by the selected word in the context of the other words in the document, and the mobile device 104 has used the data received from the search system to display the name of the entity in the drag-up bar 1 10.
- FIG. 1C shows a portion 120 of an example contextual search presentation displayed on the example mobile device 104.
- the user of the mobile device 104 has submitted a touch input 122 selecting and dragging the drag-up bar 1 10.
- the mobile device 104 has moved the drag-up bar 110 to the corresponding position to display the portion 120 of the contextual search presentation.
- the contextual search presentation is a presentation that is generated by the search system for the selected word using the word selection data and the context data received from the mobile device 104.
- the mobile device 104 has obtained the contextual search presentation from the search system before the user submitted the input 122, e.g., along with the data identifying the entity referred to by the selected word.
- the mobile device 104 has obtained the contextual search presentation from the search system in response to the user input selecting the drag-up bar.
- the contextual search presentation is an entity contextual search presentation that includes a knowledge panel 124 for the entity "Anders Fogh Rasmussen.”
- a knowledge panel is a user interface element generated by a search engine that includes a formatted presentation of content about an entity referred to by a received search query.
- the content includes textual representations of values of attributes associated with the entity and, optionally, other content relevant to the entity, e.g., images of the entity.
- the relevant content can vary depending on the type of the entity. For example, a knowledge panel for a monument or other geographic point of interest can include different information than a knowledge panel for a politician or other person of interest.
- a different kind of contextual search presentation can be generated that includes other kinds of formatted content, e.g., various kinds of answer boxes that present formatted content related to the selected word.
- FIG. ID shows a larger portion 130 of the example contextual search presentation displayed on the example mobile device 104.
- the mobile device 104 displays the larger portion 130 in response to the user of the mobile device continuing to drag the drag-up bar 110 to a new position.
- the mobile device continues to increase the size of the portion 130 after the user has stopped submitting the touch input 122. For example, after the user has stopped submitting the touch input 122, e.g., once the user has released his or her finger from the touch screen display, the mobile device 104 can continue to increase the size of the portion 130 until the portion 130 fills a pre-determined proportion, e.g., fifty percent, sixty percent, or seventy percent, of the display.
- the mobile device 104 can re-center the displayed document 102 so that the word selected by the user remains visible.
- the larger portion 130 of the contextual search presentation includes the knowledge panel 124 for the entity "Anders Fogh Rasmussen” and search results 134.
- the search results 134 are search results generated by a search engine in response to a search query identifying the entity referred to by the selected word.
- the user of the mobile device 104 can view additional search results by submitting an additional touch input to scroll down on the contextual search presentation or can return to viewing the document 102 by submitting a touch input pulling down on the drag-up bar 1 10.
- FIG. 2 shows an example search system 214.
- the search system 214 is an example of an information retrieval system implemented as computer programs on one or more computers in one or more locations, in which the systems, components, and techniques described below are implemented.
- a user 202 can interact with the search system 214 through a user device 204.
- the user device 204 will generally include a memory, e.g., a random access memory (RAM) 206, for storing instructions and data and a processor 208 for executing stored instructions.
- the memory can include both read only and writable memory.
- the user device 204 can be a computer, e.g., a smartphone, coupled to the search system 214 through a data communication network 212, e.g., local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet, or a combination of networks, any of which may include wireless links.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the search system 214 provides a user interface to the user device 204 through which the user 202 can interact with the search system 214.
- the search system 214 can provide a user interface in the form of web pages that are rendered by a web browser running on the user device 204, in an app installed on the user device 204, e.g., on a mobile device, or otherwise.
- a user 202 can use the user device 204 to submit a query 210 to a search system 214.
- a search engine 230 within the search system 214 performs a search to identify resources matching the query.
- the query 210 may be transmitted through the network 212 to the search system 224.
- the search system 214 includes an index 222 and the search engine 230.
- the search system 214 responds to the search query 210 by generating search results 218, which are transmitted through the network 212 to the user device 204 for presentation to the user 202, e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed by a web browser running on the user device 204.
- the search engine 230 When the query 210 is received by the search engine 230, the search engine 230 identifies resources that satisfy the query 210.
- the search engine 230 will generally include an indexing engine 220 that indexes resources, an index 222 that stores the index information, and a ranking engine 252 or other software that generates scores for the resources that satisfy the query 210 and that ranks the resources according to their respective scores.
- Registered users of the search system 214 may provide data to the search system that is stored in a user profile data repository 260. That is, the user 202 may log in to a user account with the search system 214, e.g., through a web browser executing on the user device 204, and provide data identifying values of particular user attributes, e.g., the user's birthday, the user's city of residence, places the user has vacationed, and so on, that are stored in the user profile data repository 260.
- particular user attributes e.g., the user's birthday, the user's city of residence, places the user has vacationed, and so on
- the search system 214 includes or can communicate with a contextual search engine 250.
- the contextual search engine 250 receives word selection data and context data from user devices and, in response, generates an appropriate contextual search presentation for the selected word identified by the word selection data.
- the contextual search presentation includes a formatted presentation of content that is relevant to the selected word.
- the contextual search presentation can also include search results obtained from the search engine 230.
- the contextual search engine 250 can communicate with an entity disambiguation system 270.
- the entity disambiguation system 270 receives data identifying a word from a document and context data for the word, i.e., data identifying other words in the same document as the identified word, and classifies the word as either not referring to any entity or referring to a particular entity.
- Example entities include people, places, countries, landmarks, animals, historical events, organizations, businesses, sports teams, sporting events, movies, songs, albums, games, works of art, fictional characters, and so on.
- the entity disambiguation system 270 may be a system that analyzes documents or portions of documents and determines which words in the document refer to entities identified in a database that stores information about entities, e.g., a database of structured data that includes nodes that represent entities and identifies the type of each entity represented by a node.
- a database of structured data that includes nodes that represent entities and identifies the type of each entity represented by a node.
- An example of an online database of structured data that exists is the Freebase database that is accessible on the Internet at
- the contextual search engine 250 may receive an identifier for a user account as part of the context data for a selected word and may use user profile data for the user account that is stored in the user profile data repository 260 in selecting an appropriate contextual search presentation.
- the contextual search engine 250 may computationally infer user attribute values for the user from attribute values of the user device from which the search query is received. The contextual search engine 250 may then use the inferred user attribute values in place of user profile data in selecting the appropriate contextual search presentation.
- the search system 214 transmits the contextual search presentation to the user device from which the word selection data and the context data were received for presentation to the user.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for generating a contextual search presentation for a selected word.
- the process 300 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., the search system 214 of FIG. 2, appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform the process 300.
- the system receives word selection data and context data from a user device (step 302).
- the word selection data identifies a word selected by a user in a document displayed to the user on the user device.
- the context data includes one or more other words in the document displayed to the user.
- the context data may include each word that is within a threshold number of words of the selected word in the displayed document.
- the context data may also include additional information.
- the additional information can include user information, e.g., an identifier for a user account with the system that the user is currently logged into on the user device.
- the additional information can also include user device information, e.g., location data that identifies the geographic location of the user device, language data that identifies a preferred language setting on the user device, sensor data, e.g., temperature data, and so on.
- user device information e.g., location data that identifies the geographic location of the user device, language data that identifies a preferred language setting on the user device, sensor data, e.g., temperature data, and so on.
- the system determines, from the word selection data and the context data, whether one or more criteria for presenting any of a set of types of special case contextual search presentations are satisfied (step 304). Determining whether the criteria for presenting a special case contextual presentation are satisfied is described below with reference to FIG. 4.
- the system If the word selection data and the context data satisfy the criteria for presenting one of the types of special case contextual search presentations, the system generates a special case contextual search presentation of the type for the word selected by the user (step 306). Generating a special case contextual search presentation is described below with reference to FIG. 4. If the word selection data and the context data do not satisfy the criteria for any of the types of special case presentations, the system generates a default contextual search presentation for the word selected by the user (step 308).
- the default contextual search presentation is a definitional contextual search presentation.
- a definitional contextual search presentation is a presentation that includes a definitional answer box for the word selected by the user.
- an answer box is generated by a search engine, e.g., the search engine 230 of FIG. 2, in response to a received search query and includes a formatted presentation of content that is relevant to the received search query.
- a definitional answer box is an answer box generated by the search engine that includes a definition for a word in a received search query.
- the system requests a definitional answer box for the word selected by the user from the search engine.
- the system can request the definitional answer box by submitting a search query having a pre-determined syntax to the search engine, e.g., "[word] definition,” “define: [word],” or “define [word],” where [word] is the word selected by the user.
- the definitional contextual search presentation may also include search results obtained from the search engine.
- the search results may include one or more of search results obtained in response to the search query derived from the selected word, search results from other result sources, or search results for other interpretations of the search query.
- the search results may include search results for another search query that is different from the search query submitted to the search engine in order to obtain the definitional answer box.
- the system obtains the definitional answer box and, optionally, the search results for the other search query from the search engine and generates a definitional answer box that includes the definitional answer box and, if search results were obtained, the search results.
- the system provides the generated contextual search presentation for presentation to the user on the user device (step 310).
- the system generates and provides the contextual search presentation to the user device without receiving any additional user input after the word selection data and the context data is received.
- the system may only generate and provide the contextual search presentation after the user has submitted an additional input, e.g., selecting and dragging a drag-up bar user interface element on the user device, e.g., the drag-up bar 110 of FIGS. IB-ID.
- some or all of the steps of the process 300 are performed by the user device.
- the user device can receive the user input selecting the word, generate the context data for the selected word, and determine whether a special case or default contextual search presentation is to be presented.
- the system can provide data identifying the contextual search presentation, the word selection data, and the context data to the remote system for use in generating an appropriate contextual search presentation.
- all of the steps of the process 300 can be performed by the user device.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for determining whether criteria for presenting special case contextual search presentations are satisfied and generating special case contextual search presentations.
- the process 400 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., the search system 214 of FIG. 2, appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform the process 400.
- the system receives word selection data and context data (step 402).
- the system determines whether the selected word refers to an entity using the context data (step 404). In order to make this determination, the system provides data identifying the selected word and data identifying the other words in the document to an entity disambiguation system, e.g., the entity disambiguation system 270 of FIG. 2. In response, the system obtains from the entity disambiguation system data indicating whether the selected word refers to an entity in the context of the other words in the document and, if so, the entity referred to by the selected word.
- an entity disambiguation system e.g., the entity disambiguation system 270 of FIG. 2.
- the system obtains from the entity disambiguation system data indicating whether the selected word refers to an entity in the context of the other words in the document and, if so, the entity referred to by the selected word.
- the system determines that the criteria for presenting an entity contextual search presentation are satisfied (step 406) and generates an entity contextual search presentation for the entity referred to by the selected word (step 408).
- An entity contextual search presentation is a presentation that includes a knowledge card for the entity referred to by the word selected by the user.
- the system requests a knowledge card for the word selected by the user from the search engine.
- the system can request the knowledge card by submitting a search query derived from a name of the entity to the search engine, e.g., a search query that includes the name of the entity and, optionally, one or more terms that disambiguate the entity from other entities having similar names, e.g., "[entity] [type],” where [entity] is the name of the entity and [type] is the type of the entity.
- a search query derived from a name of the entity to the search engine, e.g., a search query that includes the name of the entity and, optionally, one or more terms that disambiguate the entity from other entities having similar names, e.g., "[entity] [type]," where [entity] is the name of the entity and [type] is the type of the entity.
- the search query submitted to the search engine may be "Michael Jordan basketball player.”
- the search query submitted to the search engine may be "Michael Jordan actor.”
- the system can request the knowledge card from the search engine by providing to the search engine an identifier for a node that represents the entity in an online database of structured data.
- the entity contextual search presentation may optionally also include search results obtained from the search engine in response to the search query derived from the name of the entity referred to by the selected word.
- the system determines whether the criteria for presenting any other special case contextual search presentations are satisfied (step 410) and, if the criteria for presenting any of the other special cases are satisfied, the system generates a special case contextual search presentation for the selected word (step 412).
- the other special case contextual search presentations may include a currency contextual search presentation.
- a currency contextual search presentation is a contextual search presentation that includes a currency answer box.
- a currency answer box is an answer box that presents an amount in one currency and a corresponding amount in another currency according to a current exchange rate.
- the system determines whether the word selected by the user identifies a particular currency and, if so, whether the particular currency is different from a currency associated with the user.
- the system can determine that the word selected by the user identifies the currency when the user has selected a currency name, e.g., "euro," sign, e.g., " €,” or code, e.g., "EUR.”
- the system can also determine that the word selected by the user identifies a currency when the user has selected a number or a number word and the context data includes a currency name, sign, or code.
- the system can determine whether the particular currency is different from the currency associated with the user from the received context data.
- the system can determine, from user profile data for the user account, the country of residence of the user and can determine whether the particular currency is different from the official currency or currencies for the country of residence.
- the system can determine, from location data for the user device, the country where the user device is located and can determine whether the particular currency is different from the official currency or currencies for that country.
- the system determines that the currency associated with the user is the official currency of the country where the user device is located even if data identifying the official currency of the country of residence is available, e.g., to account for users travelling in foreign countries and selecting currency amounts in their home currency wanting to know the corresponding amount in the foreign currency.
- the system determines that the criteria for presenting a currency contextual search presentation are satisfied and generates a currency contextual search presentation for the entity referred to by the selected word.
- the system requests a currency answer box for the word selected by the user from the search engine that presents an amount in the particular currency and a corresponding amount in the currency associated with the user.
- the system can request the conversion answer box by submitting a search query having a predetermined syntax to the search engine, e.g., "[amount] [particular currency] to [currency associated with the user]” or "how much is [amount] [particular currency] in [currency associated with the user]," where [amount] is either a default amount or an amount identified by the word selection or context data, [particular currency] is the particular currency, and [currency associated with the user] is the currency associated with the user.
- a search query having a predetermined syntax
- the search engine e.g., "[amount] [particular currency] to [currency associated with the user]” or “how much is [amount] [particular currency] in [currency associated with the user]”
- [amount] is either a default amount or an amount identified by the word selection or context data
- [particular currency] is the particular currency
