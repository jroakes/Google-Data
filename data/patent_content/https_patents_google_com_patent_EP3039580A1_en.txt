- the instruction module 114 may perform aspects of one or more of the steps of FIG. 2 such as step 230.
- the entity cluster module 112 determines sets of search results based on entities associated with the search results 108 that are responsive to the search query 104.
- the sets of search results are determined so that each set includes one or more search results that are each associated with at least one shared entity. For example, the entity cluster module 112 may determine a first set of search results that are all associated with a shared entity A and a second set of search results that are all associated with a shared entity B.
- the search results 108 responsive to a search query 104 for which sets of search results are determined may be all search results responsive to the query or may be a subset of search results.
- the search results responsive to a query for which sets of search results are initially determined may be those search results that will be included on the initial search results webpage.
- the entity cluster module 112 may determine an entity that is associated with a search result by referencing index 125 and/or other database that contains information related to one or more entities associated with a search result and/or a document associated with a search result.
- index 125 may contain, for each of a plurality of documents, a mapping between the document and one or more entities related with the document.
- the index 125 may be referenced to identify one or more entities associated with the search result document that is associated with a search result.
- the entity cluster module 112 determines a single entity for each search result. For example, in some implementations the index 125 and/or other database may only identify, for each document, the single entity most strongly associated with that document. Also, for example, in some implementations the index 125 and/or other database may identify, for each document, one or more entities related to that document and the entity cluster module 112 may select a single entity from the one or more entities. For example, each entity for a document may be associated with an entity score that indicates the strength of the association of the entity to the document and one of the entities may be selected based on the entity score. For example, scores from 0 to 1 may be associated with each of the entities, with 1 being most indicative of relation of the entity to the document, and the entity associated with the highest entity score may be selected.

- a search result may be non-associated with an entity based on insufficient data related to the search result document associated with the search result and/or based on no entity being associated strongly enough with the search result document.
- entity scores may be associated with each entity associated with a document and a search result may be non- associated with an entity if no entity score satisfies a threshold entity score indicative of at least a threshold strength of association with the document.
- the entity cluster module 112 determines multiple entities for one or more search results. For example, in some implementations the index 125 and/or other database may identify, for each document, all entities associated with that document. Also, for example, in some implementations the index 125 and/or other database may identify, for each document, one or more entities related to that document and the entity cluster module 112 may select a subset of one or more of the entities. For example, each entity for a document may be associated with an entity score that indicates the strength of the association of the entity with the document and multiple entities may be selected based on the entity score. For example, scores from 0 to 1 may be associated with each of the entities, with 1 being most indicative of association of the entity to the document, and any entities satisfying a threshold entity score indicative of at least a threshold strength of association to the document may be selected.

- the amount of dimming associated with the search result IF is greater tha n the a mount of dimming associated with search results 1C and IF due to the two dismissal actions associated with the first set of search results as compared to the single dismissal action associated with the second set of search results.
- scrolling down in the search results webpage may lead to further modification of the search results. For example, in some implementations scrolling past search result IF may lead to further dimming of search results associated with the first set of search results and/or may lead to complete hiding of search results associated with the first set of search results.
- additional search results webpages may be selected via, for example, a listing of search results pages at the bottom of the search results webpage. An additional search results webpage may present a new search results webpage that includes additional search results responsive to the search query

- the graphical element 4 may be indicative of a mouse- click on the search result 2A followed by dragging away of the search result 2A, a swiping away gesture over the search result 2A by a user's finger on a presence-sensitive input mechanism, an eye-movement based swiping away directed toward the search result 2A, and/or any other appropriate swiping away mechanism.
- FIGS. 6B, 6C, and 6D are example graphical user interfaces illustrating three separate examples of a modified display of the search results of FIG. 6A based on the user dismissal action associated with the search result 2A of FIG. 6A. Additional and/or alternative graphical user interfaces may be utilized, including those that combine aspects from one or more of the examples of FIGS. 6B, 6C, and 6D. Also, in some implementations scrolling away dismissal actions, such as that described with respect to FIGS. 5A-5D, may be combined with the swiping away dismissal action described with respect to FIGS. 6A-6D. For example, a search results webpage may modify search results based on dismissal actions via scrolling and/or via swiping away.
- the modification of the search results may depend on the type of dismissal action. For example, in some implementations swiping away of a search result of a first search result set may lead to omission of other search results from the search result set, whereas scrolling past a search result of a search results set may lead to dimming of other search results from the search result sets. Also, for example, in some implementations swiping away of a search result of a first search result set may lead to dimming of other search results from the search result set to a first degree, whereas scrolling past a search result of a first search result set may lead to dimming of other search results from the search result sets to a second degree that is less extreme than the first degree.

- the amount of dimming has been increased for those search results that are members of the first set of search results that were provided on the search results webpage of FIG. 6A.
- the amount of dimming is increased for search results 2A, 2B, and 2E that are members of the first set of search results.
- FIG. 6D illustrates both dimming and demoting of the display position of the search results that are members of the first set, in some implementations only demoting of the display position may be utilized.
