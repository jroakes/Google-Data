Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to electronic communication.
- the present disclosure relates to identifying prospective employee candidates via employee connections.
- a system includes an employee identification module, a candidate identification module, and an interface module.
- the employee identification module identifies at least one first user as an employee of an employer based at least in part on employer information.
- the candidate identification module identifies at least one second user as a prospective employee candidate based at least in part on social graph connection information including at least a social graph connection between the first user and the second user.
- the candidate identification module is coupled to the employee identification module or an information source to receive information describing the second user.
- the interface module generates a summary of the second user as the prospective employee candidate and provides the summary for display to a third user.
- the interface module is coupled to a communication unit to provide the summary for display to the third user.
- a computer-implemented method includes receiving, using one or more computing devices, social graph connection information.
- the social graph connection information includes at least a social graph connection between a first user and a second user.
- the method includes receiving employer information for an employer; receiving a request for a prospective employee candidate for the employer from a third user; identifying the first user as an employee of the employer based at least in part on the employer information;
- the implementations described herein are particularly advantageous in a number of respects. For instance, they can automatically identify suitable employee candidates who have connections to a given employer by performing a simple search; they can identify which employee or employees a given candidate is connected to, and how they are connected, which is advantageous as the employer can initially identify the candidate without involving the employee, and once identified, can then confer with the employee, for example, via the social network about the candidate or can then engage the candidate directly, for example, via the social network; they can refine and rank the candidates to surface the most suitable candidates for an employment position; etc. It should be understood that this list of features and advantages is provided by way of example and is not all-inclusive, as many additional features and advantages fall within the scope of the present disclosure. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the present disclosure has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the subject matter disclosed herein.

- the method 300 continues by receiving 306 a request for one or more prospective employee candidates.
- the method 300 may be initiated by receipt of a search request which includes the employer information identifying the employer. For example, a recruiter interesting in viewing what employees are connected to an employer can submit a search request that includes information describing the employer via a user interface displayed on the recruiter's user device 116, and the controller 202 may receive the request and parse it to determine the identity of the employer.
- the method 300 continues by identifying 308 the employees of the employer using the employer information.
- the method 300 may identify 308 the employees of the employer by querying an information store storing information associating one or more employees with the employer. For example, using the employer information, the method 300 may search the social data store 108 of the social network server 102 for users having profiles that identify them as employed by the employer. The results returned by the search may include data describing the employees along with their personal and/or professional information.
- the method 300 identifies 310 one or more users as prospective employee candidates based on the social graph connection information received in block 302.
- the candidate identification module 206 identifies users as prospective employee candidates by querying the social graph of each user identified in block 310 as an employee for individuals who are connected to the employee/user. As discussed above, embodiments will include having appropriate data privacy measures in place to protect users' social graph data.
- the candidate identification module 208 may query each employee's social graph via the API module 204. The results returned by the query may identify the individuals connected to the each employee in the social network along with personal, professional, and social graph information for each of the individuals. In some embodiments, these results may be refined by using one or more employment criteria.
- the method 300 continues by generating 312 a summary of the users identified as prospective employee candidates in block 310.
- the summary may include personal or professional information, such as information from each user's profile on the social network.
- the summary may include a photograph, a short biographical description, information indicating how the candidate is connected to corresponding employee or employees, and a visual indication of the strength of the connection(s). For instance, if a candidate is connected to multiple employees of employer, those connections can be included in the summary for that candidate.
- the method 300 then provides 314 the summary for display to a user.
- processing in blocks 302-310 may be done automatically at periodic intervals, and processing in blocks 312 and 314 may be initiated in response to receiving a request for the summary.
- the method 300 may be initiated by receiving a search request for identifying prospective employee candidates based on the connections of an employer's employees. Other variations of method 300 are also contemplated and fall within the scope of the present disclosure. The method 300 is then complete and ends.
- Figures 4A and 4B are flowcharts of another example method 400 for identifying prospective employee candidates via employee connections.
- the method 400 includes blocks similar to or the same as those described above for the method 300.
- those blocks have the same reference numerals and perform the same or similar functions, and their description is incorporated by internal reference as indicated.
- the method 400 begins by receiving 402 a request for a summary of prospective employee candidates, and parsing 404 the request for search parameters such as employer information and employment criteria.
- the employer information may specify the names/identifiers of one or more employers that should be used for the search.
- the employment criteria may specify one or more employment-related attributes that should be met by any prospective employee candidates. For example, the employment criteria may specify a field of employment, geographic region, etc.
- the method 400 continues by performing the operations described by block
- the method 400 ends. However, if one or more employees are identified in block 304, the method 400 continues by performing the operations described by block 304 as discussed above with reference to at least Figure 3. If no prospective employee candidates are identified in block 408, the method 400 ends. However, if one or more prospective employee candidates are identified in block 408, the method 400 continues by ranking 410 the prospective employee candidates based on at least one criterion. In some embodiments, the prospective employee candidates may be ranked based on one or more criteria. For example, the ranking module 210 could rank the candidates based on the number or strength of their connections to the employees of the employer and/or other professionals within a particular profession.
- the ranking module 210 could rank the candidates using scores generated by the ranking module 210.
- the method 400 performs the operations described by blocks 308 and 310 as discussed above with reference to Figure 3. The method 400 then terminates.
- Figures 5A and 5B are flowcharts of yet another example method 500 for identifying prospective employee candidates via employee connections.
- the method 500 includes blocks similar to or the same as those described above for the methods 300 and 400.
- those blocks have the same reference numerals and perform the same or similar functions, and their description is incorporated by internal reference as indicated.
- the method 500 begins by performing the operations described by blocks 402 and 404, as discussed above with reference to Figure 4.
- the method determines whether to query the social data store 108 using an API, or a local repository directly for one or more employees of the employer. If the method 500 determines to search the social data store 108, the method 500 queries it via an API using the employer information. For example, to query the social data store 108 via the API, the employee identification module 206 interacts with the API module 204 as discussed above with reference to at least Figure 2. If the method 500 determines to query a local repository, the method 500 queries it directly using employer information.
- the local repository may be the memory 216, the employment data store 222, or another information source. In some embodiments, the information stored in the local repository is retrieved from the social data store 108 by executing a batch job periodically.
- method 500 determines in block 508 that no employees were identified in block 504 or block 506, method is complete and ends.
- the method 500 may notify the user who submitted the request in block 402 that no employees were found.
- interface module 212 may generate and send a notification for display to the user by the user application 1 18 informing the user that no employees were found based on the request, or may suggest a refined or expanded search that yields results including one or more employees.
- the method 500 determines in block 508 that one or more employees were identified in block 504 or block 506, the method 500 continues by determining 510 whether to query the social data store 108 via an API, or to query a local repository directly for one or more prospective employee candidates. If the method 500 determines 510 to query the social data store 108 via an API, then, the social graph of each employee, which is stored in the social data store 108, is queried 512 for prospective employee candidates using the one or more employment criteria parsed in block 404. For example, the candidate identification module 208 may interact with the API module 204 to query the social data store 108, as discussed above with reference to at least Figure 2.
- the method 500 determines 514 to query a local repository directly then, the social graph of each employee, which is stored in the local repository, is queried 514 for prospective employee candidates using the one or more employment criteria parsed in block 404.
- the local repository may be the memory 216, the employment data store 222, or another information source.
- information stored in the local repository is retrieved from the social data store 108 using periodic batch processing.
- the method 500 continues by determining 516 whether any prospective candidates were identified in blocks 512 or 514. If no prospective candidates were identified, the method 500 is complete and ends. In some embodiments, prior to completing, the method 500 may notify the user who submitted the request in block 402 that no prospective employee candidates were found. For example, interface module 212 may generate and send a notification for display to the user by the user application 1 18 informing the user that no prospective employee candidates were found based on the request. [0092] If one or more prospective employee candidates were identified in blocks 512 or 514, the method 500 continues by analyzing 518 a user profile and social graph of each prospective employee candidate and ranking the prospective employee candidates based on the analysis performed in block 518.
- the ranking module 210 generates a score for each candidate reflecting the analysis and ranks the candidates based on the scores.
- the method 500 generates 522 a summary of the one or more prospective employee candidates based on the ranking performed in block 520.
- the summary may include personal and professional information for each prospective employee candidate, which employees each prospective employee candidate is connected with, how they are connected, etc.
- the method 500 provides 310 the summary for display to the user who submitted the request, as discussed above with reference to Figure 3. The method 500 is then complete and ends.
- Figure 6 is a graphic representation of an example user interface for displaying prospective employee candidates identified via employee connections.
- the user interface 600 which may be generated and displayed by the user application 1 18, includes a browser window including a menu bar 604, a sidebar region 606, and the content display region 612.
- the menu bar 604 includes selectors for navigating back to a search interface, setting or modifying user-configurable preferences, etc.
- the sidebar region 606 includes a navigation region 608 including electronic links (e.g., hyperlinks) to other associated content, and a tag region 610 which includes search criteria used to filter the prospective employee candidates displayed in the candidate region 616 of the content display region 612.
- the tags included in the tag region 610 may include a cancel selector for canceling out the filtering effect of the tags.
- the prospective employee candidate results displayed in the candidate region 616 may be updated automatically to reflect the removal of the criterion.
- the user application 118 may send an updated request with updated employment criteria to the prospective candidate identification engine 106, and the prospective candidate identification engine 106 may process the request and provide an updated summary including a revised list of prospective employee candidates for display in the candidate region 616.
- the content display region 612 also includes a job position region 614 for displaying a job for which the prospective employee candidates are being sought.
- one or more of the attributes for the job displayed in the job position region 614 can be used by the candidate identification module 208 to filter the prospective employee candidates displayed in the candidate region 616.
- the prospective employee candidates displayed in the candidate region 616 may be ranked by the ranking module 210 in order of who is best suited for or most closely matches the requirements for the position displayed in the content display region 612. For example, the first candidate, George Johnson, may have more experience in product management; may have more connections to the employees of ACME; etc., than Jill Clark or Jeff Anderson.
