Definitions
- This specification relates to content selection.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation along with a web page, for example, in a pop-up window.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include the actions of identifying a first content item for display on a website; determining a category of the first content item; determining one or more characteristics of the first content item; identifying one or more other well-performing content items in the category; determining one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items; contrasting the one or more characteristics of the first content item with the one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items; based on the contrasting, providing a recommendation to a sponsor associated with the first content item wherein the recommendation includes at least one suggested change to the first content item that if implemented would create more similarity between the one or more characteristics of the first content item and the one or more characteristics of the other well-performing content items than originally existed; and receiving, from the sponsor, at least one of (i) a command to submit the first content item for serving, (ii) a replacement content item, or (iii) an approval of the one or more suggested changes.
- the one or more well-performing content items are those with click through rates above a threshold.
- determining one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items includes using logistic regression on data obtained from using log analysis on click-through data or inpression data of the one or more other well-performing content items.
- the replacement content item includes revisions to the first content item that (i) are similar to the at least one suggested change to the first content item, and (ii) create more similarity between the one or more characteristics of the first content item and the one or more characteristics of the other well-performing content items.
- the approval of the one or more suggested changes includes receiving from the sponsor a command to accept the one or more suggested changes and to submit the first content item for serving.
- the actions further include receiving, from the sponsor, one or more commands to contrast the one or more characteristics of a revised content item with the one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items; and rejecting the revised content item for additional contrasting after receiving a particular number of the one or more commands to contrast the one or more characteristics of a revised content item with the one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items.
- determining a category of the content item includes receiving, from the sponsor associated with the content item, the category of the content item.
- User warnings for content items can improve content item performance.
- User warnings for content items can improve a user's web browsing experience by presenting better quality content items.
- User warning for content items can improve future content items created by sponsors who learn what characteristics typically belong to well performing content items.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example content serving environment.
- FIG. 2 is another example content serving system.
- FIGS. 3A and 3B are example screen shots of a user interface that is used to create content and receive recommendations regarding the content.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process for providing recommendations to content sponsors.
- FIG. 5 is block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to create campaigns and allocate content in response to resource requests.
- a sponsor can create a content item by completing an online form that specifies different fields that together make up a content item. For example, the sponsor can specify a title, subheading, a website address, a physical address, and a phone number. The sponsor can also specify a category that best fits the content item such as bakery or dentist.
- a system reviews the content item and compares it to other content items in the same category that have performed well. The system provides recommendations to the sponsor about what qualities the well-performing content items have that may be missing in the sponsor's content item. The sponsor may elect to follow the recommendations or submit the content item for serving as part of an online campaign.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a content management system 110 manages content delivery.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 , and the content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , and content sponsors 108 .
- a website 104 is one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a publisher, which is a sponsor that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 is any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few.
- PDF portable document format
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, tablet devices, set top boxes, smart phones and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which sponsored content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots.
- the environment can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which sponsored content can be presented.
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content to be provided with the resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can receive a request for content outside of a search system. For example, an email provider, website publisher, or a social network provider may request content.
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content items that are relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content”).
- eligible content can include content having characteristics matching the characteristics of slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- content items having associated keywords that match the resource keywords or the search query 116 are selected as eligible content by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can select the eligible content items that are provided for presentation in the slots of a resource or search results page based on results of an auction.
- the content management system 110 can receive bids from content sponsors and allocate the slots to the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction.
- the bids are amounts that the sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page.
- a bid can specify an amount that a sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the bid can specify an amount that the sponsor is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content or a “conversion” following selection of the content.
- the highest bidders can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from any number of factors including performance, landing page scores, and the like.
- FIG. 2 is an example content serving system 200 that enables sponsors to provide content items that are to be evaluated by the system and provided to users.
- the content serving system 200 is similar to the example environment 100 and the components of the network 102 , the user devices 106 , the sponsors 108 , and the content management system 110 have similar counterparts in the content serving system 200 .
- the system 200 includes a client device 203 , similar to one of the user devices 106 , and a sponsor device 206 , similar to sponsors 108 , coupled to a content management system 209 , similar to content management system 110 , over a network 212 , similar to network 110 .
- the content management system 209 receives a rough draft 215 from the sponsor device 206 over the network 212 , and the content management system 209 provides a recommendation 218 related to the rough draft 215 to the sponsor device 206 over the network 212 . Additionally, the content management system 209 receives a request 221 from the client device 203 over the network 212 , and the content management system 209 provides a relevant content item 224 to the client device 203 over the network 212 . The content management system 209 provides additional detail not shown in content management system 110 .
- the recommendation 218 provided by the content management system 209 can include one or more suggestions to the sponsor on how to improve the rough draft 215 .
- the recommendation 218 can be generated in numerous ways, including comparing the rough draft 215 to well performing content items 227 .
- the relevant content 224 provided by the content management system 209 can include one or more content items for presentation to the user of client device 203 .
- the relevant content 224 can be generated in numerous ways, including examining data included in the request 221 .
- the content management system 209 can generate the recommendation 218 by analyzing the rough draft 215 . In some implementations, the content management system 209 compares the rough draft 215 to other content items that have performed well. In some implementations, the content management system 209 compares the rough draft 215 to other content items in a same category as the content associated with the rough draft 215 . The category can be specified by the sponsor when providing the rough draft 215 or can be determined by the content management system 209 . For example, given the example rough draft 215 :
- the content management system 209 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- the content management system 209 includes a content management system (“CMS”) front end 230 (or “gateway server”) to coordinate requests between other parts of the content management system 209 and the sponsor device 206 .
- CMS content management system
- the content management system 209 also includes a content engine 233 and a comparison engine 236 .
- An “engine” can refer to a software implemented input/output system that provides an output that is different than the input.
- An engine may be an encoded block of functionality, such as a library, a platform, Software Development Kit (“SDK”), or an object.
- the network 120 may include, for example, a wireless cellular network, a wireless local area network (“WLAN”) or Wi-Fi network, a Third Generation (3G) or Fourth Generation (4G) mobile telecommunications network, a wired Ethernet network, a private network such as an intranet, a public network such as the Internet, or any appropriate combination thereof.
- the CMS front end 230 , content engine 233 , and comparison engine 236 can be implemented on any type of computing device (e.g., servers, mobile phones, tablet computers, music players, e-book readers, laptop or desktop computers, PDAs, smart phones, or other stationary portable devices) that includes one or more processors and computer readable media.
- the sponsor device 206 and client device 203 both include one or more processors, computer readable media that store software applications (e.g., a browser layout engine), an input module (e.g., a keyboard or mouse), communication interface, and a display.
- the computing device or devices that implement the CMS front end 230 , the content engine 233 , and the comparison engine 236 may include similar or different components.
- the CMS front end 230 receives the rough draft 215 from the content management system 209 and routes the rough draft 215 to the appropriate engines so that the recommendation 218 may be generated. In some implementations, routing occurs by referencing static routing tables, or routing may occur based on the current network load of an engine, so as to accomplish a load balancing function.
- the CMS front end 230 also provides the resulting recommendation 218 to the content management system 209 . In doing so, the CMS front end 230 acts as a gateway, or interface, between the content management system 209 and the content engine 233 .
- the content management system 209 contains many hundreds or thousands of computing devices to process the content from the content management system 209 and provide the content items to the client device 203 .
- a sponsor provides a rough draft 215 during state (A), and the sponsor device 206 communicates the rough draft 215 to the content management system 209 over the network 212 .
- the sponsor may submit the rough draft 215 by typing or speaking the desired text of the rough draft 206 into the sponsor device 206 , then pressing a submit, next, review, or other type of control button on the sponsor device 206 .
- the sponsor submits the rough draft 215 in various pieces.
- the sponsor can submit a headline, text, a landing page address, physical address, phone number, a category, or any combination of these items.
- the headline is the name of the sponsor.
- the text can be a short description of the product/service the sponsor is trying to sell or a short description of the sponsor's business.
- the landing page address is an address of a webpage that a user is directed to when the user interacts with (e.g., clicks on) the content item.
- the physical address and phone number can be those of the sponsor.
- the category is not shown in the content item, but is used by the content management system 209 for comparison to other content.
- the CMS front end 230 receives the rough draft 215 and communicates a structured rough draft 239 to the comparison engine 236 .
- the comparison engine 236 uses content from the content database 242 to compare to the structured rough draft 239 .
- the structured rough draft 239 is the text of the rough draft 215 with additional markers to specify the different items in the content item.
- the rough draft 215 could be:
- the comparison engine 236 compares the rough draft 239 to well performing content items 227 in the content database 242 that are in the same category and delivers comparison results 245 to the CMS front end 230 .
- the well performing content items 227 are represented as a series of characteristics that the comparison engine 236 has gathered from all the well performing content items.
- the comparison engine 236 can review the content items in each category in the content database 242 to see which ones have the highest click through rate.
- the comparison engine 236 may observe that the content items in the bakery category that perform well use some capitalization in the text.
- the comparison engine 236 may observe that the content items in the bakery category that perform well have more than ten characters in the title.
- the comparison engine 236 may observe that the structured rough draft 239 violates particular rules of the content management system 209 .
- the comparison engine 236 may observe that the title contains exclamation marks and, depending on the settings, that may violate a rule against exclamation mark in a content item.
- the data related to well-performing content items can be compiled online in real time. For example, when a user clicks on a content item on the client device 203 , data indicating a click-through for the content item can be updated. Another example, is when the content management system 209 selects a content item for display on the client device 203 , then data indicating a display of the content item can be updated. A display of the content item is also called an impression.
- the data related to well performing content items can be gathered when the content management system 209 is online but not processed until the content management system 209 is offline. For example, click-through and display data can be gathered and stored in a log file. When the content management system 209 is offline, it or another system can process the log file and update each content item in the content database 242 with the click-through and display data.
- the well-performing content items 227 can be the content items with the highest click through rate or the ones that are displayed the most.
- the click through rates or the impressions can be normalized to account for content items that have been in the content database 242 longer. For example, click through rates and display rates can be calculated on a per day, week, year, etc. basis.
- well performing content items are determined using log file analysis. For example, by counting how many impressions of an content item were shown and how many corresponding click-throughs are recorded, the click-through rate of a content item can be determined. Other metrics could be computed in a similar fashion, for example, revenue and cost per click.
- the content management system 209 can compare how well a particular content item is performing relative to other content items in the same category.
- the content items can be grouped in deciles in order of performance such that the lowest performing content items are in the bottom 10 percent and the highest performing content items are in the top 10 percent.
- the threshold for well-performing content items is measured in terms of a certain percentile with respect to other content items in the database.
- well performing content items 227 can be the ones which are in the top twenty percent of click through rates or number of displays or both.
- the well performing content items 227 can be a content item at the median or above of click through rates or number of displays.
- the comparison engine 236 can gather common qualities of the well performing content items. For example, the comparison engine 236 may observe that well performing content items have at least ten characters in the title. The comparison engine 236 may observe that well performing content items use a mix of capital and lowercase letters in the text portion of the content item.
- the CMS front end 230 presents, to the sponsor on the sponsor device 206 , the recommendation 218 that was determined by the comparison engine 236 .
- the recommendation 218 is color coded to indicate an importance level of the feedback. For example, if more than ninety percent of the well performing content items contained greater than ten words in their title, then the recommendation 218 could be displayed in a color associated with a high importance item (such as red). If between sixty and ninety percent of the well performing content items used capitalization in their text, then the recommendation 218 could be displayed in a color associated with a moderate importance level (such as yellow).
- the recommendation 218 can be notices that a rule of the content management system 209 was violated and those notices can be formatted differently also. For example, if the content item contained exclamation points, then the recommendation 218 could be underlined. Any combination of font, font size, font color, bold, underline, italics, etc. can be used to differentiate different levels of the recommendation 218 .
- an indicator bar is provided next to the recommendation 218 . For example, if the recommendation 218 was one that was followed by 90 percent of the well performing content items 227 , then the indicator bar can be 90 percent full. If the recommendation 218 was followed by 50 percent of the well performing content items 227 , then the indicator bar can be 50 percent full.
- the sponsor responds to the recommendation 218 with edits 248 using the sponsor device 206 and through the network 212 .
- the sponsor does not follow the recommendation 218 and the submission (e.g., edits 248 ) are the same as the rough draft 215 .
- the sponsor changes one or more aspect of the content item and sends a second rough draft for review again by the content management system 209 .
- the same procedure outlined in states (A) through (D) can be repeated for a second rough draft.
- the sponsor may be limited in the number of revisions that the sponsor can send through the content management system 209 .
- the content management system 209 may limit the number of revisions to ten. After ten revisions, the sponsor may be required to submit the content item to the content engine 233 or withdraw his/her content item from the content management system 209 .
- the CMS front end 230 sends the finalized content item 251 to the content engine 233 .
- the CMS front end 230 formats the finalized content item 251 so that it can be stored in the content database 242 .
- the content item For example, the content item
- the client device 203 requests a content item from the content management system 209 by sending a request 221 to the content management system 209 through the network 212 .
- the content engine 233 selects a relevant content item 224 from the content database 242 based on the data in the request 221 .
- the relevant content item 224 is delivered to the client device 203 through the network 212 .
- FIG. 3A is an example screen shot of a user interface 300 a that is used by a sponsor to create content and receive feedback regarding the content.
- the user interface 300 a presents an instruction box 303 a for presenting instructions to the sponsor.
- the instructions assist the sponsor in creating a content item in input box 306 a .
- the preview box 309 a displays the text of the content item that the sponsor provides into input box 306 a.
- the instruction box 303 a contains an instruction area 312 a that displays instructions or tips or both for the sponsor.
- the instruction area 312 a also contains an instruction area title 315 a that provides a summary of the presented instruction.
- the sponsor can select an instruction control button 318 a .
- selection of the instruction control button 318 a causes the instruction area 312 a to display more detail regarding the instructions.
- selection of the instruction control button 318 a causes another window to open where the sponsor can navigate more detailed instructions.
- the instruction box 303 a contains an example box 321 a where example content items can be displayed.
- the example box 321 a contains an example content item with an example title 324 a , an example landing page address 327 a , an example text 330 a , and an example physical address and phone number 333 a .
- control buttons 336 a that the sponsor can select to navigate through the different sample content items.
- the sample content items are in the same category as the category selected by the sponsor.
- the content items are in categories that the content management system 209 considers most relevant to the entered content item.
- the sample content items are selected from the well-performing content items in the same category selected by the sponsor.
- the example content item is a fully functioning content. For example, if the sponsor selected the “Directions” link on the example address 333 a , then the sponsor would be directed to a page that provides directions to the address in example physical address and phone number 333 a . If the sponsor selected the example landing page address 327 a , then the sponsor would be directed to the landing page.
- the input box 306 a contains several areas for the sponsor to input one or several portions of a content item.
- the headline input area 339 a is an input area for the headline of the content item.
- the sponsor can input the title of the business in the headline input area 339 a such as “Tartine Bakery.”
- the text input area 342 a is an input area for the subheading of the content item.
- the sponsor can input “try our award winning bread” in one line and “we use 100% whole wheat” in the other line.
- the text input area 342 a can contain a specific number of lines to accept input.
- the sponsor can select the number of lines for text input area 342 a .
- the landing page address input area 345 a is an input area for the landing page address.
- the landing page address is the web page address that the content item viewer is directed to when the viewer interacts with (e.g., clicks on) the content item.
- the sponsor can input “plus.google.com/tartinebakery” and the content item viewer will be directed to this link when the viewer clicks on the content item.
- the physical address selection box 348 a and the phone number selection box 351 a allow the sponsor to select whether or not to display the physical address or phone number or both of the sponsor. In some implementations, the sponsor's account already contains the address and phone data, thus only a selection box is needed.
- the sponsor can input the address and phone data directly into an input area in input box 306 a .
- the sponsor may be limited by the number of characters that the sponsor can input into the input areas. For example, each line may be limited to 30 characters and additional input may not be displayed beyond 30 characters. Furthermore, input into these areas need not be by way of a keyboard.
- voice input or touch screen input can be used to fill in the input areas.
- Some data can be filled automatically by retrieving it from a database if the data is already known. For example, a business address of the sponsor is frequently known at the time of signup if the sponsor has already signed up for a related account.
- the preview box 309 a contains a preview of the content item that the sponsor inputted into the input box 306 a .
- the preview box 309 a updates as the sponsor inputs characters into the input box 306 a .
- the sponsor types “Tartine Bakery” into the headline input area 339 a
- the headline preview 354 a updates in real time.
- an text preview 357 a , a landing page address preview 360 a , and a physical address and phone number preview 363 a display a preview of the content item as their respective input area is updated by the sponsor.
- the preview box 309 a includes live links that the sponsor can select.
- the sponsor can click on the content item in the preview box 309 a and be directed to the landing page from the landing page address input area 345 a .
- the sponsor can select the directions link in the physical address and phone number preview 363 a and be directed to a page displaying directions to the address listed.
- the preview box 309 a may not update in real time as the sponsor inputs data into the input box 306 a , but rather update as the sponsor switches between input areas.
- the sponsor can input “Tartine Bakery” into headline input area 339 a , then upon switching to input data into the text input area 342 a , the headline preview 354 a can update with “Tartine Bakery.”
- the user interface 300 a contains a control element 366 a that the sponsor can select when the sponsor has completed input of the content item.
- the sponsor selects the control element 366 a to send the content item to the comparison engine 336 a .
- user interface 300 a may contain a control element to save the content item for display on client devices or a control element to exit the user interface 300 a and abandon the content item or both.
- some of the control elements may be unavailable for selection by the sponsor. For example, if the sponsor has submitted the content item for review too many times, then a submit for review control element may be visible but unavailable for selection.
- FIG. 3B is an example screen shot of a user interface 300 b that is used to create content and receive feedback regarding the content.
- the user interface 300 b is displayed after a sponsor selects the control element 366 a .
- the user interface 300 b contains an instruction box 303 b that contains instructions, tips, and sample content items; an input box 306 b for the sponsor to edit and revise the content item, in addition to view various suggestions; and a preview box 309 b for the sponsor to preview the content item inputted into the input box 306 b.
- the user interface 300 b contains the recommendation 218 from the content management system 209 .
- the user interface 300 b contains a review notice 369 b which presents to the sponsor a message that some data that the sponsor inputted into the input box 306 b needs the sponsor's attention.
- the review notice 369 b can be a static message which will update upon selection of control element 366 b , or the review notice 369 b can be a dynamic message which will update or cease to be displayed once the sponsor has satisfied the requirements noted in input box 306 b .
- the review notice 369 b can be displayed in different fonts or colors. For example, the review notice 369 b can be displayed in yellow if the feedback contains only suggested revisions. The review notice 369 b can be displayed in red if the feedback contains required revisions. In some implementations, the review notice 369 b is displayed with a status bar that indicates the level of editing required.
- headline notice 372 b contains a message to the sponsor regarding a content rule violation or content suggestion.
- the headline notice 372 b can be category specific. For example, a headline notice 372 b may display that exclamation points are not allowed when reviewing a content item for a sponsor in the bakery business. In another example, there may not be a headline notice 372 b even if there are exclamation points in the headline area 339 because the sponsor's business is in the editing and typing category.
- the headline notice 372 b can be displayed in different colors depending on the suggestion. For example, if the headline notice 372 b displays the message “Reviewed: no apparent problems,” then the headline notice 372 b may be displayed in green.
- the headline notice 372 b displays the message “Headline cannot contain ‘best,’” then the headline notice 372 b may be displayed in red. If the headline notice 372 b displays the message “Headlines with more than 10 characters typically perform better,” then the headline notice 372 b may be displayed in yellow.
- the headline notice 372 b is paired with a status bar which indicates a level/importance of rule presented in the headline notice 372 b .
- the status bar may indicate a low level suggestion be displayed in green, a medium level suggestion related to improving content performance be displayed in yellow, or a high level rule violation be displayed in red. If a status bar is used, then the headline notice 372 b may be displayed in black font.
- the status bar can be filled to a low level for a low level suggestion, to a medium level for a suggestion related to improving content performance, or a high level for a rule violation.
- text notice 375 b contains a message to the sponsor regarding a suggestion.
- text notice 375 b displays “Ads without capitalization typically perform poorly.”
- the messages can be category specific.
- the comparison engine 236 may conclude “Ads without capitalization typically perform poorly.”
- capitalization may not be a common characteristic of well performing content items, and therefore, no text notice 375 b is displayed or a text notice 375 b is displayed that reads “Reviewed: no apparent problems.”
- the text notice 375 b can be displayed in different fonts or colors or a status bar can be displayed or both.
- both the text notice 375 b and the headline notice 372 b can be static or dynamic. For example, once the exclamation points are removed from “Tartine bakery !!!,” then the text notice 375 b can be updated.
- Additional notice messages may be displayed in the user interface 300 b .
- the comparison engine 236 determines that a business address or a phone number or both are typically displayed in well performing content items, then a notice message may be displayed near the address selection box 348 b or the phone number selection box 351 b.
- the sponsor updates the input areas where the notices were displayed and then selects the control element 366 b .
- a control element may display “Resubmit for review.”
- a control element may display “Resubmit and select a new category.”
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for providing feedback to content sponsors.
- the process 400 analyzes a content item provided by a sponsor against other well performing content items in the same sponsor-selected category and provides feedback to the sponsor.
- the process 400 will be described as being performed by a computer system comprising one or more computers, for example, the content management system 209 as shown in FIG. 2 .
- the system identifies a content item for display on a website ( 405 ).
- the system identifies a content item from data input from a sponsor. For example, a sponsor logs into the content management system 209 and begins to enter data for a content item to display online to users of the client device 203 , then the system can package and create a content item for display to the user while the user is using the client device 203 .
- the data includes the sponsor's business name, a description of the business, a web address of a landing page, a physical address of the sponsor, a phone number, or any combination of these items.
- the data is stored within the sponsor's account in the content management system 209 and does not need to be entered for each new content item.
- the sponsor's physical address or phone number may be stored in the sponsor's profile.
- the content item is an advertisement.
- the system determines a category of the content item ( 410 ).
- the category of the content item is provided by the sponsor.
- a sponsor in the bakery business may select bakery as the category for the content item.
- the category is selected by the content management system 209 based on the characteristics of the content item or sponsor. For example, the category may be based on the text of the content item, the name of the sponsor, data from the landing page, or any other data associated with the sponsor in the content management system 209 .
- the category can be selected by the sponsor, then submitted to the content management system 209 .
- the content management system 209 can recommend alternate categories based upon the submitted content item and the selected category.
- the sponsor can choose one of the recommended categories or maintain the sponsor's category choice.
- the content management system 209 can suggest categories based upon the content item provided by the sponsor. The sponsor may choose from the suggested categories or select a different category that the sponsor believes better represents the content item.
- the category can be constant for each content item entered by the sponsor or the category can be different for each content item entered by the sponsor. In some implementations, the category may only be from a set of predetermined categories.
- the system determines characteristics of the content item ( 415 ). Characteristics can relate to any aspect of the content item including the title, the text, the landing page address, the landing page content, the physical address, or the phone number. The characteristics can relate to number of characters, punctuation, grammar, word relationships, or number of words. For example, the system can determine that the title does not contain any capitalized letters. The system can determine that the title contains ten characters or that there is no phone number included in the content item. The system can determine that the landing page address does not match well with the title such as if the title was “Tartine Bakery” and the landing page address was “plus.google.com/aardvarkschool.”
- the system identifies one or more other well-performing content items in the category ( 420 ).
- the content management system 209 gathers the click-through rates of the other content items in the same category as the entered content item.
- the content items with the highest click through rates are determined to be well-performing ones.
- the content items with click through rates in the highest percentile are determined to be well performing.
- the click through rates are normalized to account for different lengths of time each content item is in the content management system 209 .
- a content item with 10 click throughs that has been in the content management system 209 for 10 days will be ranked the same as a content item with 50 click throughs that has been in the content management system 209 for 50 days.
- a content item has a number of click throughs that is higher than a threshold, then it is considered well performing.
- a content item has a normalized click through rate higher than a threshold then it is considered well performing.
- Well performing items can also be identified based on the number of times the content item is displayed to a user on a client device. For example, a content item that has been displayed more times than another content item is more likely to be considered well performing. In some implementations, the content items with displays in a certain percentile are considered well performing. For example, content items with a number of displays in the top 10 percent of content items are considered well performing. In some implementations, the content management system 209 normalizes the number of displays based on time. For example, a content item with 10 displays that has been in the content management system 209 for 10 days will be ranked the same as a content item with 50 displays that has been in the system for 50 days.
- a content item if a content item has a number of displays that is higher than a threshold, then it is considered well performing. In some implementations, if a content item has a normalized number of displays higher than a threshold, then it is considered well performing. In some implementations, the click through rate normalized by the number of displays is used to determine the content items that are well performing. For example, a content item with 10 clicks and 20 displays will be ranked higher than a content item with 20 clicks and 100 displays. In some implementations, there is a minimum number of click throughs, displays, or time in the content management system 209 before a content item can be considered well performing.
- the system determines one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items ( 425 ).
- the one or more characteristics are determined by aggregating the well performing content items and determining which characteristics are common to all of them or a particular percentage of them. For example, fifty percent of the well performing content items may use capitalization, or all of the well performing content items may have more than 10 characters in the title. Characteristics can relate to any aspect of the content items including the title, the text, the landing page address, the landing page content, the physical address, or the phone number.
- the one or more characteristics can be determined using logistic regression on data obtained from log analysis. For example, by creating independent variables for use in a logistic regression model such as the number of characters in each line, punctuation characters used, capitalization of words used, and other characteristics, the content management system 209 can calculate the change in probability that a content item will perform well. With these characteristics and by examining weights that can assigned to each one, the content management system 209 may find that at least one word other than at the beginning of the line should be capitalized, that question marks at the end of the title are detrimental to performance of the content item, or that having words related to the category in the title is beneficial.
- logistic regression model such as the number of characters in each line, punctuation characters used, capitalization of words used, and other characteristics
- the system can contrast the one or more characteristics of the first content item with the one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items ( 430 ).
- only particular characteristics of the content item are compared to the characteristics of the well performing content items. For example, only the title and text may be compared to the characteristics. Thus, only the title and the text would be analyzed to determine if they contained, for example, capitalization or a threshold number of characters.
- the system provides a recommendation to a sponsor associated with the content item.
- the recommendation includes at least one suggested change to the first content item that if implemented would create more similarity between the one or more characteristics of the first content item and the one or more characteristics of the other well-performing content items than originally existed ( 435 ).
- the content management system 209 After comparing the sponsor's content item to the well performing content items, the content management system 209 generates recommendations for display to the sponsor in the user interface 300 b .
- the recommendations are color coded. For example, a recommendation that the sponsor must follow is in red and a recommendation that the sponsor may follow is in yellow.
- the recommendations are paired with a visual indicator that can display the level of recommendation.
- a visual indicator that is a status bar may be full. If the sponsor may follow the recommendation, then a visual indicator that is a status bar may be half full.
- the visual indicator is tied to the number of well performing content items that share the characteristic. For example, twenty percent of the well performing content items have a title with greater than ten characters, then the visual indicator may be twenty percent full.
- the visual indicator may be tied to the expected performance of the sponsor's content item. For example, if the number of well performing ads that share the recommended characteristic have an average click through rate, then that average click through rate can be displayed on the visual indicator.
- the system receives, from the sponsor, at least one of (i) a command to submit the content item for serving, (ii) a replacement content item, or (iii) approval of the one or more suggested changes ( 440 ).
- the sponsor decides whether to accept it or not. For example, the sponsor can revise the content item and resubmit the content item to the content management system 209 for another review.
- the sponsor can also replace the content item with a new content item and the new content item may be submitted for serving to a client device or submitted for review.
- the sponsor can also submit the content item for serving to a client device without revising the content item according to the recommendation.
- the sponsor can also log out from the content management system 209 and not submit the content item for serving to a client device.
- the content management system 209 increments a counter. If the counter reaches a certain threshold, then the sponsor may not be allowed to resubmit the content item for further review. For example, if a sponsor submits for review and revises a content item ten times, then on the eleventh time, the sponsor does not have the choice to submit the content item for review. The sponsor may only submit the content item for serving on client devices or abandon the content item.
- the sponsor may have a total number of reviews for all the sponsor's content items and once the sponsor exceeds that number, then the sponsor may only be able to choose between selecting the content item for serving to a client device or abandoning the content item.
- the number of reviews may be based on a period of time. For example, the sponsor may have 10 reviews of content items per day. In some implementations, the sponsor may purchase additional reviews.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for user warnings for content items projected to underperform. In one aspect a method includes identifying a first content item for display on a website. The method further includes determining a category of the first content item. The method further includes determining characteristics of the first content item, and identifying other well-performing content items in the category. The method further includes determining characteristics of the other well-performing content items, and contrasting the characteristics of the first content item with the characteristics of the other well-performing content items. In response to these contrasts, a recommendation is provided to a sponsor associated with the content item. The method further includes receiving, from the sponsor, at least one of a command, a replacement content item, or approval of the suggested changes.
Description
- This specification relates to content selection.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation along with a web page, for example, in a pop-up window.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include the actions of identifying a first content item for display on a website; determining a category of the first content item; determining one or more characteristics of the first content item; identifying one or more other well-performing content items in the category; determining one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items; contrasting the one or more characteristics of the first content item with the one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items; based on the contrasting, providing a recommendation to a sponsor associated with the first content item wherein the recommendation includes at least one suggested change to the first content item that if implemented would create more similarity between the one or more characteristics of the first content item and the one or more characteristics of the other well-performing content items than originally existed; and receiving, from the sponsor, at least one of (i) a command to submit the first content item for serving, (ii) a replacement content item, or (iii) an approval of the one or more suggested changes.
- These and some implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. In some implementations, the one or more well-performing content items are those with click through rates above a threshold. In some implementations, determining one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items includes using logistic regression on data obtained from using log analysis on click-through data or inpression data of the one or more other well-performing content items. In some implementations, the replacement content item includes revisions to the first content item that (i) are similar to the at least one suggested change to the first content item, and (ii) create more similarity between the one or more characteristics of the first content item and the one or more characteristics of the other well-performing content items. In some implementations, the approval of the one or more suggested changes includes receiving from the sponsor a command to accept the one or more suggested changes and to submit the first content item for serving. The actions further include receiving, from the sponsor, one or more commands to contrast the one or more characteristics of a revised content item with the one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items; and rejecting the revised content item for additional contrasting after receiving a particular number of the one or more commands to contrast the one or more characteristics of a revised content item with the one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items. In some implementations, determining a category of the content item includes receiving, from the sponsor associated with the content item, the category of the content item.
- Particular implementations may realize one or more of the following advantages. User warnings for content items can improve content item performance. User warnings for content items can improve a user's web browsing experience by presenting better quality content items. User warning for content items can improve future content items created by sponsors who learn what characteristics typically belong to well performing content items.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 5 is block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to create campaigns and allocate content in response to resource requests. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Small and medium size sponsors may not be familiar with how to create a successful online campaign. The success of an online campaign can often turn on a content item's formatting, capitalization, punctuation, or a combination of these and other characteristics of the content. In order to create successful online campaigns, a sponsor can create a content item by completing an online form that specifies different fields that together make up a content item. For example, the sponsor can specify a title, subheading, a website address, a physical address, and a phone number. The sponsor can also specify a category that best fits the content item such as bakery or dentist. Upon providing the content item, a system reviews the content item and compares it to other content items in the same category that have performed well. The system provides recommendations to the sponsor about what qualities the well-performing content items have that may be missing in the sponsor's content item. The sponsor may elect to follow the recommendations or submit the content item for serving as part of an online campaign.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 in which acontent management system 110 manages content delivery. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108, and thecontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, andcontent sponsors 108. - A
website 104 is one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 is maintained by a publisher, which is a sponsor that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 is any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, tablet devices, set top boxes, smart phones and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which sponsored content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots. - To facilitate searching of these resources, the environment can include a
search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexedcache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 accesses the indexedcache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns thesearch results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which sponsored content can be presented. - When a
resource 105 orsearch results 118 are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results 118. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. In other implementations, thecontent management system 110 can receive a request for content outside of a search system. For example, an email provider, website publisher, or a social network provider may request content. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content items that are relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content”). For example, eligible content can include content having characteristics matching the characteristics of slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In some implementations, content items having associated keywords that match the resource keywords or thesearch query 116 are selected as eligible content by thecontent management system 110. - The
content management system 110 can select the eligible content items that are provided for presentation in the slots of a resource or search results page based on results of an auction. For example, thecontent management system 110 can receive bids from content sponsors and allocate the slots to the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction. The bids are amounts that the sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page. For example, a bid can specify an amount that a sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the sponsor is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content or a “conversion” following selection of the content. The highest bidders can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from any number of factors including performance, landing page scores, and the like. -
FIG. 2 is an examplecontent serving system 200 that enables sponsors to provide content items that are to be evaluated by the system and provided to users. Thecontent serving system 200 is similar to theexample environment 100 and the components of thenetwork 102, theuser devices 106, thesponsors 108, and thecontent management system 110 have similar counterparts in thecontent serving system 200. In general, thesystem 200 includes aclient device 203, similar to one of theuser devices 106, and asponsor device 206, similar tosponsors 108, coupled to acontent management system 209, similar tocontent management system 110, over anetwork 212, similar tonetwork 110. Thecontent management system 209 receives arough draft 215 from thesponsor device 206 over thenetwork 212, and thecontent management system 209 provides arecommendation 218 related to therough draft 215 to thesponsor device 206 over thenetwork 212. Additionally, thecontent management system 209 receives arequest 221 from theclient device 203 over thenetwork 212, and thecontent management system 209 provides arelevant content item 224 to theclient device 203 over thenetwork 212. Thecontent management system 209 provides additional detail not shown incontent management system 110. - The
recommendation 218 provided by thecontent management system 209 can include one or more suggestions to the sponsor on how to improve therough draft 215. Therecommendation 218 can be generated in numerous ways, including comparing therough draft 215 to well performingcontent items 227. - The
relevant content 224 provided by thecontent management system 209 can include one or more content items for presentation to the user ofclient device 203. Therelevant content 224 can be generated in numerous ways, including examining data included in therequest 221. - In some implementations, the
content management system 209 can generate therecommendation 218 by analyzing therough draft 215. In some implementations, thecontent management system 209 compares therough draft 215 to other content items that have performed well. In some implementations, thecontent management system 209 compares therough draft 215 to other content items in a same category as the content associated with therough draft 215. The category can be specified by the sponsor when providing therough draft 215 or can be determined by thecontent management system 209. For example, given the example rough draft 215: -
- Tartine Bakery!!!!
- we have some of the best bread
- try some today
and the sponsor specified category of “bakery,” thecontent management system 209 can provide therecommendation 218 such as “Content without capitalization typically performs poorly” after comparing the content to other well performing content items in the bakery category. In other implementations, therecommendation 218 may include a suggested revision. For example, therecommendation 218 may be “Revise ‘we have some of the best bread’ to ‘We Have Some of the Best Bread.’” The suggested revision can be a type of revision that complies with a characteristic of the well performingcontent items 227. The system may present the option of accepting the suggested revision.
- The
content management system 209 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network. In some implementations, thecontent management system 209 includes a content management system (“CMS”) front end 230 (or “gateway server”) to coordinate requests between other parts of thecontent management system 209 and thesponsor device 206. Thecontent management system 209 also includes a content engine 233 and acomparison engine 236. - An “engine” (or “software engine”) can refer to a software implemented input/output system that provides an output that is different than the input. An engine may be an encoded block of functionality, such as a library, a platform, Software Development Kit (“SDK”), or an object. The
network 120 may include, for example, a wireless cellular network, a wireless local area network (“WLAN”) or Wi-Fi network, a Third Generation (3G) or Fourth Generation (4G) mobile telecommunications network, a wired Ethernet network, a private network such as an intranet, a public network such as the Internet, or any appropriate combination thereof. - The CMS
front end 230, content engine 233, andcomparison engine 236 can be implemented on any type of computing device (e.g., servers, mobile phones, tablet computers, music players, e-book readers, laptop or desktop computers, PDAs, smart phones, or other stationary portable devices) that includes one or more processors and computer readable media. Among other components, thesponsor device 206 andclient device 203 both include one or more processors, computer readable media that store software applications (e.g., a browser layout engine), an input module (e.g., a keyboard or mouse), communication interface, and a display. The computing device or devices that implement the CMSfront end 230, the content engine 233, and thecomparison engine 236 may include similar or different components. - In general, the CMS
front end 230 receives therough draft 215 from thecontent management system 209 and routes therough draft 215 to the appropriate engines so that therecommendation 218 may be generated. In some implementations, routing occurs by referencing static routing tables, or routing may occur based on the current network load of an engine, so as to accomplish a load balancing function. The CMSfront end 230 also provides the resultingrecommendation 218 to thecontent management system 209. In doing so, the CMSfront end 230 acts as a gateway, or interface, between thecontent management system 209 and the content engine 233. In some implementations, thecontent management system 209 contains many hundreds or thousands of computing devices to process the content from thecontent management system 209 and provide the content items to theclient device 203. - In
FIG. 1 , a sponsor provides arough draft 215 during state (A), and thesponsor device 206 communicates therough draft 215 to thecontent management system 209 over thenetwork 212. The sponsor may submit therough draft 215 by typing or speaking the desired text of therough draft 206 into thesponsor device 206, then pressing a submit, next, review, or other type of control button on thesponsor device 206. - In some implementations, the sponsor submits the
rough draft 215 in various pieces. For example, the sponsor can submit a headline, text, a landing page address, physical address, phone number, a category, or any combination of these items. In some implementations, the headline is the name of the sponsor. The text can be a short description of the product/service the sponsor is trying to sell or a short description of the sponsor's business. The landing page address is an address of a webpage that a user is directed to when the user interacts with (e.g., clicks on) the content item. The physical address and phone number can be those of the sponsor. In some implementations, the category is not shown in the content item, but is used by thecontent management system 209 for comparison to other content. - During state (B), the CMS
front end 230 receives therough draft 215 and communicates a structuredrough draft 239 to thecomparison engine 236. Thecomparison engine 236 uses content from thecontent database 242 to compare to the structuredrough draft 239. In some implementations, the structuredrough draft 239 is the text of therough draft 215 with additional markers to specify the different items in the content item. For example, therough draft 215 could be: -
- Tartine Bakery!!!!
- we have some of the best bread
- try some today
and the structuredrough draft 239 could be (“Tartine Bakery!!!!”, “we have some of the best bread”, “try some today”, “plus.google.com/tartinebakery”, “bakery”, 1, 1) (headline,text line 1, text line 2, landing page address, category, physical address flag, phone number flag).
- During state (C), the
comparison engine 236 compares therough draft 239 to well performingcontent items 227 in thecontent database 242 that are in the same category and delivers comparison results 245 to the CMSfront end 230. In some implementations, the well performingcontent items 227 are represented as a series of characteristics that thecomparison engine 236 has gathered from all the well performing content items. For example, thecomparison engine 236 can review the content items in each category in thecontent database 242 to see which ones have the highest click through rate. Thecomparison engine 236 may observe that the content items in the bakery category that perform well use some capitalization in the text. Thecomparison engine 236 may observe that the content items in the bakery category that perform well have more than ten characters in the title. Further, thecomparison engine 236 may observe that the structuredrough draft 239 violates particular rules of thecontent management system 209. For example, thecomparison engine 236 may observe that the title contains exclamation marks and, depending on the settings, that may violate a rule against exclamation mark in a content item. - The data related to well-performing content items can be compiled online in real time. For example, when a user clicks on a content item on the
client device 203, data indicating a click-through for the content item can be updated. Another example, is when thecontent management system 209 selects a content item for display on theclient device 203, then data indicating a display of the content item can be updated. A display of the content item is also called an impression. In some implementations, the data related to well performing content items can be gathered when thecontent management system 209 is online but not processed until thecontent management system 209 is offline. For example, click-through and display data can be gathered and stored in a log file. When thecontent management system 209 is offline, it or another system can process the log file and update each content item in thecontent database 242 with the click-through and display data. - In some implementations, the well-performing
content items 227 can be the content items with the highest click through rate or the ones that are displayed the most. In some implementations, the click through rates or the impressions can be normalized to account for content items that have been in thecontent database 242 longer. For example, click through rates and display rates can be calculated on a per day, week, year, etc. basis. In some implementations, well performing content items are determined using log file analysis. For example, by counting how many impressions of an content item were shown and how many corresponding click-throughs are recorded, the click-through rate of a content item can be determined. Other metrics could be computed in a similar fashion, for example, revenue and cost per click. By grouping these metrics of the content items by category, thecontent management system 209 can compare how well a particular content item is performing relative to other content items in the same category. The content items can be grouped in deciles in order of performance such that the lowest performing content items are in the bottom 10 percent and the highest performing content items are in the top 10 percent. In some implementations, the threshold for well-performing content items is measured in terms of a certain percentile with respect to other content items in the database. For example, well performingcontent items 227 can be the ones which are in the top twenty percent of click through rates or number of displays or both. In some implementations, the well performingcontent items 227 can be a content item at the median or above of click through rates or number of displays. - Once the well-performing
content items 227 are identified by thecomparison engine 236, thecomparison engine 236 can gather common qualities of the well performing content items. For example, thecomparison engine 236 may observe that well performing content items have at least ten characters in the title. Thecomparison engine 236 may observe that well performing content items use a mix of capital and lowercase letters in the text portion of the content item. - During state (D), the CMS
front end 230, presents, to the sponsor on thesponsor device 206, therecommendation 218 that was determined by thecomparison engine 236. In some implementations, therecommendation 218 is color coded to indicate an importance level of the feedback. For example, if more than ninety percent of the well performing content items contained greater than ten words in their title, then therecommendation 218 could be displayed in a color associated with a high importance item (such as red). If between sixty and ninety percent of the well performing content items used capitalization in their text, then therecommendation 218 could be displayed in a color associated with a moderate importance level (such as yellow). In some implementations, therecommendation 218 can be notices that a rule of thecontent management system 209 was violated and those notices can be formatted differently also. For example, if the content item contained exclamation points, then therecommendation 218 could be underlined. Any combination of font, font size, font color, bold, underline, italics, etc. can be used to differentiate different levels of therecommendation 218. In some implementations an indicator bar is provided next to therecommendation 218. For example, if therecommendation 218 was one that was followed by 90 percent of the well performingcontent items 227, then the indicator bar can be 90 percent full. If therecommendation 218 was followed by 50 percent of the well performingcontent items 227, then the indicator bar can be 50 percent full. - During state (E), the sponsor responds to the
recommendation 218 withedits 248 using thesponsor device 206 and through thenetwork 212. In some implementations, the sponsor does not follow therecommendation 218 and the submission (e.g., edits 248) are the same as therough draft 215. In some implementations, the sponsor changes one or more aspect of the content item and sends a second rough draft for review again by thecontent management system 209. The same procedure outlined in states (A) through (D) can be repeated for a second rough draft. In some implementations, the sponsor may be limited in the number of revisions that the sponsor can send through thecontent management system 209. For example, thecontent management system 209 may limit the number of revisions to ten. After ten revisions, the sponsor may be required to submit the content item to the content engine 233 or withdraw his/her content item from thecontent management system 209. - During state (F), the CMS
front end 230 sends the finalizedcontent item 251 to the content engine 233. In some implementations, the CMSfront end 230 formats the finalizedcontent item 251 so that it can be stored in thecontent database 242. For example, the content item -
- Tartine Bakery
- We have some delicious bread
- Try some today
may be formatted in the following manner: (“Tartine Bakery”, “We have some delicious bread”, “Try some today”, “plus.google.com/tartinebakery”, “bakery”, 1, 1) (headline,text line 1, text line 2, landing page address, category, physical address flag, phone number flag). Once the finalizedcontent item 251 is stored in thecontent database 242, thecontent management system 209 can then serve the finalizedcontent item 251 to theclient device 203 through thenetwork 212.
- During state (G), the
client device 203 requests a content item from thecontent management system 209 by sending arequest 221 to thecontent management system 209 through thenetwork 212. - During state (H), the content engine 233 selects a
relevant content item 224 from thecontent database 242 based on the data in therequest 221. Therelevant content item 224 is delivered to theclient device 203 through thenetwork 212. -
FIG. 3A is an example screen shot of auser interface 300 a that is used by a sponsor to create content and receive feedback regarding the content. Theuser interface 300 a presents aninstruction box 303 a for presenting instructions to the sponsor. The instructions assist the sponsor in creating a content item ininput box 306 a. Thepreview box 309 a displays the text of the content item that the sponsor provides intoinput box 306 a. - The
instruction box 303 a contains an instruction area 312 a that displays instructions or tips or both for the sponsor. In the implementation shown, the instruction area 312 a also contains aninstruction area title 315 a that provides a summary of the presented instruction. To learn more about the instruction, the sponsor can select aninstruction control button 318 a. In some implementations, selection of theinstruction control button 318 a causes the instruction area 312 a to display more detail regarding the instructions. In some implementations, selection of theinstruction control button 318 a causes another window to open where the sponsor can navigate more detailed instructions. - The
instruction box 303 a contains anexample box 321 a where example content items can be displayed. Theexample box 321 a contains an example content item with anexample title 324 a, an examplelanding page address 327 a, anexample text 330 a, and an example physical address andphone number 333 a. In close proximity to theexample box 321 a arecontrol buttons 336 a that the sponsor can select to navigate through the different sample content items. In some implementations, the sample content items are in the same category as the category selected by the sponsor. In some implementations, the content items are in categories that thecontent management system 209 considers most relevant to the entered content item. In some implementations, the sample content items are selected from the well-performing content items in the same category selected by the sponsor. In some implementations, the example content item is a fully functioning content. For example, if the sponsor selected the “Directions” link on theexample address 333 a, then the sponsor would be directed to a page that provides directions to the address in example physical address andphone number 333 a. If the sponsor selected the examplelanding page address 327 a, then the sponsor would be directed to the landing page. - The
input box 306 a contains several areas for the sponsor to input one or several portions of a content item. Theheadline input area 339 a is an input area for the headline of the content item. For example, the sponsor can input the title of the business in theheadline input area 339 a such as “Tartine Bakery.” Thetext input area 342 a is an input area for the subheading of the content item. For example, the sponsor can input “try our award winning bread” in one line and “we use 100% whole wheat” in the other line. In some implementations, thetext input area 342 a can contain a specific number of lines to accept input. In some implementations, the sponsor can select the number of lines fortext input area 342 a. The landing pageaddress input area 345 a is an input area for the landing page address. The landing page address is the web page address that the content item viewer is directed to when the viewer interacts with (e.g., clicks on) the content item. For example, the sponsor can input “plus.google.com/tartinebakery” and the content item viewer will be directed to this link when the viewer clicks on the content item. The physicaladdress selection box 348 a and the phonenumber selection box 351 a allow the sponsor to select whether or not to display the physical address or phone number or both of the sponsor. In some implementations, the sponsor's account already contains the address and phone data, thus only a selection box is needed. In some implementations, the sponsor can input the address and phone data directly into an input area ininput box 306 a. In some implementations, the sponsor may be limited by the number of characters that the sponsor can input into the input areas. For example, each line may be limited to 30 characters and additional input may not be displayed beyond 30 characters. Furthermore, input into these areas need not be by way of a keyboard. In some implementations, voice input or touch screen input can be used to fill in the input areas. Some data can be filled automatically by retrieving it from a database if the data is already known. For example, a business address of the sponsor is frequently known at the time of signup if the sponsor has already signed up for a related account. - The
preview box 309 a contains a preview of the content item that the sponsor inputted into theinput box 306 a. In some implementations, thepreview box 309 a updates as the sponsor inputs characters into theinput box 306 a. For example, as the sponsor types “Tartine Bakery” into theheadline input area 339 a, theheadline preview 354 a updates in real time. Additionally, antext preview 357 a, a landing page address preview 360 a, and a physical address andphone number preview 363 a display a preview of the content item as their respective input area is updated by the sponsor. In some implementations, thepreview box 309 a includes live links that the sponsor can select. For example, the sponsor can click on the content item in thepreview box 309 a and be directed to the landing page from the landing pageaddress input area 345 a. Additionally, the sponsor can select the directions link in the physical address andphone number preview 363 a and be directed to a page displaying directions to the address listed. In some implementations, thepreview box 309 a may not update in real time as the sponsor inputs data into theinput box 306 a, but rather update as the sponsor switches between input areas. For example, the sponsor can input “Tartine Bakery” intoheadline input area 339 a, then upon switching to input data into thetext input area 342 a, theheadline preview 354 a can update with “Tartine Bakery.” - In some implementations, the
user interface 300 a contains acontrol element 366 a that the sponsor can select when the sponsor has completed input of the content item. In some implementations, the sponsor selects thecontrol element 366 a to send the content item to thecomparison engine 336 a. In some implementations, there are multiple control elements. For example,user interface 300 a may contain a control element to save the content item for display on client devices or a control element to exit theuser interface 300 a and abandon the content item or both. In some implementations, some of the control elements may be unavailable for selection by the sponsor. For example, if the sponsor has submitted the content item for review too many times, then a submit for review control element may be visible but unavailable for selection. -
FIG. 3B is an example screen shot of auser interface 300 b that is used to create content and receive feedback regarding the content. In some implementations, theuser interface 300 b is displayed after a sponsor selects thecontrol element 366 a. Similar touser interface 300 a, theuser interface 300 b contains aninstruction box 303 b that contains instructions, tips, and sample content items; aninput box 306 b for the sponsor to edit and revise the content item, in addition to view various suggestions; and apreview box 309 b for the sponsor to preview the content item inputted into theinput box 306 b. - The
user interface 300 b contains therecommendation 218 from thecontent management system 209. For example, theuser interface 300 b contains areview notice 369 b which presents to the sponsor a message that some data that the sponsor inputted into theinput box 306 b needs the sponsor's attention. Thereview notice 369 b can be a static message which will update upon selection ofcontrol element 366 b, or thereview notice 369 b can be a dynamic message which will update or cease to be displayed once the sponsor has satisfied the requirements noted ininput box 306 b. Thereview notice 369 b can be displayed in different fonts or colors. For example, thereview notice 369 b can be displayed in yellow if the feedback contains only suggested revisions. Thereview notice 369 b can be displayed in red if the feedback contains required revisions. In some implementations, thereview notice 369 b is displayed with a status bar that indicates the level of editing required. - In the
user interface 300 b,headline notice 372 b contains a message to the sponsor regarding a content rule violation or content suggestion. In some implementations, theheadline notice 372 b can be category specific. For example, aheadline notice 372 b may display that exclamation points are not allowed when reviewing a content item for a sponsor in the bakery business. In another example, there may not be aheadline notice 372 b even if there are exclamation points in the headline area 339 because the sponsor's business is in the editing and typing category. In some implementations, theheadline notice 372 b can be displayed in different colors depending on the suggestion. For example, if theheadline notice 372 b displays the message “Reviewed: no apparent problems,” then theheadline notice 372 b may be displayed in green. If theheadline notice 372 b displays the message “Headline cannot contain ‘best,’” then theheadline notice 372 b may be displayed in red. If theheadline notice 372 b displays the message “Headlines with more than 10 characters typically perform better,” then theheadline notice 372 b may be displayed in yellow. In some implementations, theheadline notice 372 b is paired with a status bar which indicates a level/importance of rule presented in theheadline notice 372 b. For example, the status bar may indicate a low level suggestion be displayed in green, a medium level suggestion related to improving content performance be displayed in yellow, or a high level rule violation be displayed in red. If a status bar is used, then theheadline notice 372 b may be displayed in black font. The status bar can be filled to a low level for a low level suggestion, to a medium level for a suggestion related to improving content performance, or a high level for a rule violation. - In the
user interface 300 b,text notice 375 b contains a message to the sponsor regarding a suggestion. For example,text notice 375 b displays “Ads without capitalization typically perform poorly.” In some implementations, the messages can be category specific. For example, in the bakery category, thecomparison engine 236 may conclude “Ads without capitalization typically perform poorly.” In the photography category, capitalization may not be a common characteristic of well performing content items, and therefore, notext notice 375 b is displayed or atext notice 375 b is displayed that reads “Reviewed: no apparent problems.” Similar toheadline notice 375 b, thetext notice 375 b can be displayed in different fonts or colors or a status bar can be displayed or both. - In some implementations, both the
text notice 375 b and theheadline notice 372 b can be static or dynamic. For example, once the exclamation points are removed from “Tartine bakery !!!!,” then thetext notice 375 b can be updated. - Additional notice messages may be displayed in the
user interface 300 b. For example, if thecomparison engine 236 determines that a business address or a phone number or both are typically displayed in well performing content items, then a notice message may be displayed near theaddress selection box 348 b or the phonenumber selection box 351 b. - In the
user interface 300 b, the sponsor updates the input areas where the notices were displayed and then selects thecontrol element 366 b. In some implementations, there is an additional control element that allows the sponsor to resubmit the content item for review to thecomparison engine 236. For example, a control element may display “Resubmit for review.” In other examples, a control element may display “Resubmit and select a new category.” -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for providing feedback to content sponsors. In general, the process 400 analyzes a content item provided by a sponsor against other well performing content items in the same sponsor-selected category and provides feedback to the sponsor. The process 400 will be described as being performed by a computer system comprising one or more computers, for example, thecontent management system 209 as shown inFIG. 2 . - The system identifies a content item for display on a website (405). In some implementations, the system identifies a content item from data input from a sponsor. For example, a sponsor logs into the
content management system 209 and begins to enter data for a content item to display online to users of theclient device 203, then the system can package and create a content item for display to the user while the user is using theclient device 203. In some implementations, the data includes the sponsor's business name, a description of the business, a web address of a landing page, a physical address of the sponsor, a phone number, or any combination of these items. In some implementations, the data is stored within the sponsor's account in thecontent management system 209 and does not need to be entered for each new content item. For example, the sponsor's physical address or phone number may be stored in the sponsor's profile. In some implementations, the content item is an advertisement. - The system determines a category of the content item (410). In some implementations, the category of the content item is provided by the sponsor. For example, a sponsor in the bakery business may select bakery as the category for the content item. In some implementations, the category is selected by the
content management system 209 based on the characteristics of the content item or sponsor. For example, the category may be based on the text of the content item, the name of the sponsor, data from the landing page, or any other data associated with the sponsor in thecontent management system 209. In some implementations, the category can be selected by the sponsor, then submitted to thecontent management system 209. Thecontent management system 209 can recommend alternate categories based upon the submitted content item and the selected category. The sponsor can choose one of the recommended categories or maintain the sponsor's category choice. In some implementations, thecontent management system 209 can suggest categories based upon the content item provided by the sponsor. The sponsor may choose from the suggested categories or select a different category that the sponsor believes better represents the content item. In some implementations, the category can be constant for each content item entered by the sponsor or the category can be different for each content item entered by the sponsor. In some implementations, the category may only be from a set of predetermined categories. - The system determines characteristics of the content item (415). Characteristics can relate to any aspect of the content item including the title, the text, the landing page address, the landing page content, the physical address, or the phone number. The characteristics can relate to number of characters, punctuation, grammar, word relationships, or number of words. For example, the system can determine that the title does not contain any capitalized letters. The system can determine that the title contains ten characters or that there is no phone number included in the content item. The system can determine that the landing page address does not match well with the title such as if the title was “Tartine Bakery” and the landing page address was “plus.google.com/aardvarkschool.”
- The system identifies one or more other well-performing content items in the category (420). In some implementations, the
content management system 209 gathers the click-through rates of the other content items in the same category as the entered content item. The content items with the highest click through rates are determined to be well-performing ones. In some implementations, the content items with click through rates in the highest percentile are determined to be well performing. For example, the content items with click through rates in the top ten percent of click through rates are determined to be well performing. In some implementations the click through rates are normalized to account for different lengths of time each content item is in thecontent management system 209. For example, a content item with 10 click throughs that has been in thecontent management system 209 for 10 days will be ranked the same as a content item with 50 click throughs that has been in thecontent management system 209 for 50 days. In some implementations, if a content item has a number of click throughs that is higher than a threshold, then it is considered well performing. In some implementations, if a content item has a normalized click through rate higher than a threshold, then it is considered well performing. - Well performing items can also be identified based on the number of times the content item is displayed to a user on a client device. For example, a content item that has been displayed more times than another content item is more likely to be considered well performing. In some implementations, the content items with displays in a certain percentile are considered well performing. For example, content items with a number of displays in the top 10 percent of content items are considered well performing. In some implementations, the
content management system 209 normalizes the number of displays based on time. For example, a content item with 10 displays that has been in thecontent management system 209 for 10 days will be ranked the same as a content item with 50 displays that has been in the system for 50 days. In some implementations, if a content item has a number of displays that is higher than a threshold, then it is considered well performing. In some implementations, if a content item has a normalized number of displays higher than a threshold, then it is considered well performing. In some implementations, the click through rate normalized by the number of displays is used to determine the content items that are well performing. For example, a content item with 10 clicks and 20 displays will be ranked higher than a content item with 20 clicks and 100 displays. In some implementations, there is a minimum number of click throughs, displays, or time in thecontent management system 209 before a content item can be considered well performing. - The system determines one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items (425). In some implementations, the one or more characteristics are determined by aggregating the well performing content items and determining which characteristics are common to all of them or a particular percentage of them. For example, fifty percent of the well performing content items may use capitalization, or all of the well performing content items may have more than 10 characters in the title. Characteristics can relate to any aspect of the content items including the title, the text, the landing page address, the landing page content, the physical address, or the phone number.
- In some implementations, the one or more characteristics can be determined using logistic regression on data obtained from log analysis. For example, by creating independent variables for use in a logistic regression model such as the number of characters in each line, punctuation characters used, capitalization of words used, and other characteristics, the
content management system 209 can calculate the change in probability that a content item will perform well. With these characteristics and by examining weights that can assigned to each one, thecontent management system 209 may find that at least one word other than at the beginning of the line should be capitalized, that question marks at the end of the title are detrimental to performance of the content item, or that having words related to the category in the title is beneficial. - The system can contrast the one or more characteristics of the first content item with the one or more characteristics of the one or more other well-performing content items (430). In some implementations, only particular characteristics of the content item are compared to the characteristics of the well performing content items. For example, only the title and text may be compared to the characteristics. Thus, only the title and the text would be analyzed to determine if they contained, for example, capitalization or a threshold number of characters.
- The system provides a recommendation to a sponsor associated with the content item. The recommendation includes at least one suggested change to the first content item that if implemented would create more similarity between the one or more characteristics of the first content item and the one or more characteristics of the other well-performing content items than originally existed (435). After comparing the sponsor's content item to the well performing content items, the
content management system 209 generates recommendations for display to the sponsor in theuser interface 300 b. In some implementations, the recommendations are color coded. For example, a recommendation that the sponsor must follow is in red and a recommendation that the sponsor may follow is in yellow. In some implementations, the recommendations are paired with a visual indicator that can display the level of recommendation. For example, if the sponsor must follow the recommendation, then a visual indicator that is a status bar may be full. If the sponsor may follow the recommendation, then a visual indicator that is a status bar may be half full. In some implementations, the visual indicator is tied to the number of well performing content items that share the characteristic. For example, twenty percent of the well performing content items have a title with greater than ten characters, then the visual indicator may be twenty percent full. In some implementations, the visual indicator may be tied to the expected performance of the sponsor's content item. For example, if the number of well performing ads that share the recommended characteristic have an average click through rate, then that average click through rate can be displayed on the visual indicator. - The system receives, from the sponsor, at least one of (i) a command to submit the content item for serving, (ii) a replacement content item, or (iii) approval of the one or more suggested changes (440). Once the
content management system 209 has displayed a recommendation to the sponsor, the sponsor decides whether to accept it or not. For example, the sponsor can revise the content item and resubmit the content item to thecontent management system 209 for another review. The sponsor can also replace the content item with a new content item and the new content item may be submitted for serving to a client device or submitted for review. The sponsor can also submit the content item for serving to a client device without revising the content item according to the recommendation. The sponsor can also log out from thecontent management system 209 and not submit the content item for serving to a client device. - In some implementations, each time a sponsor resubmits a content item for review, the
content management system 209 increments a counter. If the counter reaches a certain threshold, then the sponsor may not be allowed to resubmit the content item for further review. For example, if a sponsor submits for review and revises a content item ten times, then on the eleventh time, the sponsor does not have the choice to submit the content item for review. The sponsor may only submit the content item for serving on client devices or abandon the content item. In some implementations, the sponsor may have a total number of reviews for all the sponsor's content items and once the sponsor exceeds that number, then the sponsor may only be able to choose between selecting the content item for serving to a client device or abandoning the content item. In some implementations, the number of reviews may be based on a period of time. For example, the sponsor may have 10 reviews of content items per day. In some implementations, the sponsor may purchase additional reviews. -

Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few.

Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.
