Systems that simulate materials (e.g., properties of materials) using quantum calculations may be used to simulate a physical system described by a limited hamiltonian volume in the presence of a relevant environment. In addition, quantum computers can accurately simulate physical systems in time that is at most a polynomial of system size. Therefore, unlike other systems, systems that use quantum computing simulation materials are fundamentally not limited by the classical computing accuracy used in the simulation process. For example, classical techniques to simulate a physical system, such as Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET), density matrix reforming group (Density Matrix Renormalization Group), hartree-focus, or Coupled Cluster (Coupled Cluster), can only achieve target accuracy in modeling a physical system at a cost that is an index of the physical system size.

However, systems that use quantum computing simulation materials extend the scope of classical approaches and can be used to simulate a wide variety of physical systems, including those that exhibit strong correlation quantities. Example physical systems include materials such as polymers in aircraft wings and rockets, solar cells, batteries, catalytic converters, or thin film electronics. Other example physical systems include systems that exhibit high temperature superconductivity.

Detailed Description
An apparatus and method for simulating a physical system using quantum computation is described. The apparatus and method model bulk properties (bulk properties) of a physical system by modeling regions around a unit cell of the physical system using a technique of embedding hamiltonian, such as Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET).
Typically, DMET techniques use classical methods to find the ground state of embedded hamiltonians, such as density matrix reorganization clusters, hartree-Fock, coupled clusters, or full set of state interactions. These classical methods can only achieve a target accuracy in modeling a physical system at a cost that is an index of the physical system size. This specification describes techniques for combining classical computing (e.g., DMET-based computing) with quantum computing to generate a hybrid quantum-classical approach for emulating a physical system. The hybrid quantum-classical approach is able to emulate a general physical system, such as that described by a finite hamiltonian with strong correlation.
Example operating Environment
FIG. 1 depicts an example system 100 for simulating a physical system using quantum computing. Example system 100 is an example of a system implemented as a classical or quantum computer program on one or more classical or quantum computing devices in one or more locations, in which the systems, components, and techniques described below may be implemented.
The system 100 may include quantum hardware 102 in data communication with a classical processor 104. The system 100 may receive as input data, for example, input data 106, which may include data representing a physical system of interest. The system 100 may generate output data, e.g., output data 108, for simulating the physical system of interest.
The received data (e.g., input data 106) representative of the physical system of interest may include data representative of the physical system to be modeled or simulated. In some embodiments, the received data may represent a physical system as a material (e.g., metal or polymer). In some embodiments, the received data may represent a physical system describing high temperature superconductivity. The physical system represented by the received data may include a plurality of unit cells. The unit cell represents the smallest group of components in the physical system that constitute the repeating pattern (repeating pattern) in the physical system. Thus, the unit cell defines the symmetry and structure of the overall physical system.
The generated data for simulating the physical system of interest, such as output data 108 representing the ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region, may include data that may be used to determine the physical system properties. Due to the structure of the physical system, as described above, the approximate ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region describes the properties of the physical system as a whole. Thus, data representing the output of the ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region can be used to describe the properties of the entire physical system. For example, as described above, in some embodiments, the physical system may be a material, such as a metal. In these cases, data representing the ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region may be used to determine properties of the metal, such as conductivity.
Generating data for simulating the physical system of interest, such as output data 108 representing the ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region, may include performing quantum calculations. For example, in some embodiments, methods including both quantum and classical calculations may be used to generate data representing the ground state of a physical system in a unit cell region, such as output data 108.
The system 100 may be configured to perform classical computation in conjunction with quantum computation using quantum hardware 102 and classical processor 104. In some implementations, classical processor 104 may be configured to perform techniques based on density matrix embedding theory to help system 100 model the bulk properties of a physical system of interest by modeling only the area around the unit cell of the physical system, as described below with reference to fig. 2-4.
For example, a physical system of interest may be composed of a system having an associated ground state ψ sys Hamilton quantity H of (V) sys To describe. Similarly, one of the unit cells constituting the physical system of interest may be composed of a material having an associated ground state ψ cell Hamilton quantity H of (V) cell To describe. The system 100 may be configured to determine its associated ground state ψ using a classical processor 104 and quantum hardware 102 emb And the ground state ψ in a local region of the unit cell sys Matched embedded Hamiltonian H emb 。
In some implementations, the ground state of the embedded hamiltonian may be determined using quantum calculations. The system 100 may be configured to perform quantum computation using quantum hardware 102. Quantum hardware 102 may include components for performing quantum computation. For example, quantum hardware 102 may include quantum system 110. Quantum system 110 may include one or more multi-level quantum subsystems, such as qubits (qubits or qubits). In some embodiments, the multi-level quantum subsystem may be a superconducting qubit, such as Gmon qubit. The type of multi-level electronics subsystem used by the system 100 depends on the physical system of interest. For example, in some cases, it may be convenient to include one or more resonators attached to one or more superconducting qubits (e.g., gmon or Xmon qubits). In other cases, ion traps, photonic devices, or superconducting cavities (with which states can be prepared without the need for qubits) may be used. Further examples of implementing a multi-level quantum subsystem include fluxmon qubits, silicon quantum dots, or phosphorous impurity qubits. In some cases, the multi-level quantum subsystem may be part of a quantum circuit. In this case, quantum hardware 102 may include one or more control devices 112, such as one or more quantum logic gates, operating on quantum system 110.
The quantum hardware 102 may be configured to determine the ground state of the embedded hamiltonian using a variational method, such as a variational sub-eigensolver. For example, quantum hardware 102 may include data specifying a variable analysis arrangement (ansatz) that uses information about quantum hardware 102, such as control device 112 and control parameters associated with control device 112, to determine a parameterization of a state of quantum system 112. In some implementations, quantum hardware 102 may be used directly to parameterize the design, that is, the variation categories of parameters forming the variation device may include control parameters of control device 112, such as control parameters of one or more logic gates.
Quantum hardware 102 may be configured to perform quantum measurements on quantum system 110 and send the measurement results to classical processor 104. Further, quantum hardware 102 may be configured to receive updated parameterized data, such as updated physical control parameter values, specifying the state of quantum system 110 from classical processor 104. Quantum hardware 102 can update the state of quantum system 110 using the parameterization of the received update. The use of quantum hardware to perform the variational method is described in more detail below with reference to fig. 4.
As described above, classical processor 104 may be configured to receive measurements from quantum hardware 102. Classical processor 104 may determine a minimization parameterization of quantum system 110 by performing a minimization method on the received measurements, such as a gradient-free greedy method, such as the Powell's method or Nelder-Mead. Further, classical processor 104 may be configured to send updated parameterized data specifying the state of quantum system 110 based on the determined minimized parameterization.
The ground state of the physical system in the approximate unit cell region is described in detail below with reference to fig. 2 to 4.
Programming hardware
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for simulating a physical system. For convenience, process 200 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more classical or quantum computing devices located in one or more locations. For example, a quantum computing system, such as system 100 simulating a material using quantum computing 100 of fig. 1, suitably programmed in accordance with the present description, may perform process 200.
The system determines the physical system of interest (step 202). The physical system of interest may be a physical system to be modeled or emulated. In some embodiments, the physical system may be a material, such as a metal or a polymer. In some embodiments, the physical system may be a system that exhibits high temperature superconductivity.
The physical system includes a plurality of unit cells. The unit cell represents the smallest group of components in the physical system that constitute the repeating pattern in the physical system. Thus, the unit cell defines the symmetry and structure of the overall physical system. The size of the unit cell (e.g., as measured by the plurality of components in the unit cell) depends on the physical system determined. In some embodiments, a unit cell may interact with an adjacent unit cell, and the physical system may exhibit strong correlation.
For example, some molecular systems, such as metals, have periodic crystal structures and are referred to as "regular". The crystal structure of the system can be described in terms of a unit cell, which represents the smallest group of atoms in three dimensions that make up the repeating pattern in the system. The unit cells stacked in three-dimensional space describe the bulk arrangement of atoms in the crystal. The unit cell may be represented by one or more parameters, such as a lattice parameter (lattice parameter), which represents the length of the edges of the lattice and the angle between the edges. The position of an atom in a unit cell can be described by a set of atom positions (e.g., lattice points) measured relative to the edges of the cell.
The system performs quantum computation to approximate the ground state of the physical system in the region of one of the unit cells (step 204). Due to the structure of the physical system, the approximate ground state of the physical system in the region of one of the unit cells may be used to describe the properties of the physical system as a whole, as described above with reference to step 202. In some implementations, the system may perform quantum computation to approximate the higher order eigenstates of the physical system in the region of one of the unit cells.
By performing quantum calculations to approximate the ground state of a physical system in the region of one of the unit cells, the system can approximate the ground state to any accuracy, for example, where the cost of accuracy does not increase exponentially across the system size. This may enable the system to take into account physical systems that are otherwise too complex to simulate, for example, using classical methods. Performing quantum calculations to approximate the ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region is described in more detail below with reference to fig. 3.
The system provides as output the approximate ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region (step 206). As described above, the approximate ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region describes the characteristics of the physical system as a whole. Thus, the system may simulate a physical system using the approximate ground state of the output. For example, in some implementations, the system may use the approximate ground state of the output to determine properties of the physical system. Where the physical system of interest is a material, this may include simulating global properties of the material using the approximate ground state of the material in the unit cell region, e.g., simulating the conductivity of the metal using the output ground state.
Process 200 may be used to simulate properties of various physical systems, including systems composed of large unit cells and/or unit cells that exhibit strong correlations. For example, process 200 may be used to simulate or determine properties of polymers in aircraft wings and rockets, solar cells, batteries, catalytic converters, or thin film electrons.
Fig. 3 is a flow chart of an example process 300 for approximating a ground state of a physical system in a unit cell region. For example, the process 300 may describe the ground state of the physical system in the approximate unit cell region as part of simulating the physical system of interest, as described in step 204 of fig. 2. For convenience, process 300 will be described as being performed by one or more computing devices located at one or more locations. For example, a quantum computing system, such as system 100 simulating a material using quantum computing 100 of fig. 1, suitably programmed in accordance with the present description, may perform process 300.
The system defines the initial ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region as the ground state of the hamiltonian amount of the unit cell (step 302). For example, hamiltonian H describes a physical system sys Can be matched with the ground state psi of a physical system sys Associated with, and describing, a Hamiltonian amount H of one of the unit cells constituting the physical system cell Can be matched with the ground state psi of the unit cell cell And (5) associating. Using this notation, the system can define the initial ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region by:
ψ (0) ＝ψ cell
the system iteratively processes the initial ground state and the subsequent ground state until completion of the event occurs, wherein quantum computation is performed for each iteration (step 304). As described above with reference to fig. 2, in some embodiments, each of the plurality of unit cells that make up the physical system interacts with other unit cells in the physical system, such as with respective adjacent unit cells. Due to these interactions, the ground state of the unit cellψ cell May not provide the ground state ψ about the physical system as a whole sys Is a piece of information of interest. However, due to the structure of the physical system, such as the regularity and symmetry described above with reference to fig. 2, the ground state ψ of the physical system as a whole is concerned sys Can be derived from the ground state ψ of a physical system in a local area around the unit cell sys To determine.
Thus, the system iteratively processes the initial ground state and the subsequent ground state until a completion event occurs to determine an approximate ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region. In some implementations, completion of an event occurs when the processed ground state of an iteration converges with the processed ground state of a previous iteration, e.g., when the processed ground state of an iteration is within a predetermined distance from the processed ground state of a previous iteration in hilbert space. The processing of the ground state ψ is described in detail below with reference to fig. 4 (j) Iterating with an example that approximates the ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region.
Fig. 4 is a flow chart of an example iteration 400 of processing a ground state to approximate the ground state of a physical system in a unit cell region. For example, process 400 may describe a jth iteration of processing an initial or subsequent ground state until completion of an event occurrence, as described above at step 204 of FIG. 2. For convenience, process 400 will be described as being performed by one or more computing devices located at one or more locations. For example, a quantum computing system, such as system 100 simulating a material using quantum computing 100 of fig. 1, suitably programmed in accordance with the present description, may perform process 400.
The system determines an iterative embedded hamiltonian amount (step 402). Embedding Hamiltonian volume H emb Is Hamiltonian volume, its ground state psi emb Statistically close to the ground state ψ in the unit cell region sys . Hamiltonian volume H emb Not greater than Hamiltonian H describing the unit cell cell . The system may determine the iterative hamiltonian by performing classical calculations
In some embodimentsIn this manner, performing classical calculations may include applying Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) to determine an iterative embedded hamiltonian. Applying DMET to determine the embedded hamiltonian may include applying an embedding algorithm subroutine a that will take the ground state of the previous iterationAs input and generates a corresponding embedded hamiltonian>As output, namely:
the system performs quantum computation to determine an iterative embedded hamiltonianIs +.>(step 404). In some implementations, performing quantum computation to determine a ground state of the iterative embedded hamiltonian may include performing a variational method. The variational approach may be used to determine the eigenstates, e.g., ground states, of a given quantum system. For example, a variational approach may be used to determine the quantum state |ψ of a quantum system>It is the lowest energy eigenstate of hamiltonian H, such that h|ψ>＝E 0 |ψ>. For example, some variational methods may depend on the vector +.>Polynomial quantity of the parameters represented by parameterized guess wave function +.>To approximately prepare |psi>This guess wave function is called a fitting. The quantum variation principle considers that:

In some implementations, the variation method includes a variation component sub-eigensolver (variational quantum eigensolver, VQE) process. The VQE process is performed by applying the initial state |phi>Is a parameterized quantum circuitIs parameterized by the action of->Namely:
initial state |phi>May be a quantum state that is very easy to prepare with a quantum circuit, such as a product state in a standard base (standard basis). Conversely, parameterized stateMay be a quantum state that is very complex to prepare. For example, parameterized status->May be quantum states spanning a number of base states in a standard base, and thusEven when the unitary operator U is relatively shallow (e.g., due to memory limitations) cannot be represented on any classical computer. Mapping->May be represented as a cascade of parameterized quantum gates, for example:
wherein each U i (θ i ) Representing quantum circuit elements broken down into universal quantum gates, andrepresents n scalar values { θ } i }。
Parameterizing accordinglyThereafter, the VQE process performs quantum computation. The VQE process uses quantum hardware to measure hamiltonian H relative to parameterized quantum states +.>Is a desired value of (2). For this purpose, the VQE process repeatedly prepares quantum statesDuplicate and perform repeated measurements on the local hamiltonian entries defining H. For example, generally any hamiltonian H can be decomposed into a sum of terms:
wherein a is γ Represents a real scalar, and each H γ Representing a hamiltonian amount, for example a 1-sparse hamiltonian amount that can be easily measured. It should be noted that such a decomposition in this way is always possible, so that L is at most polynomial large. Because ofThe VQE process measures each term in the above expression to obtainIs given as follows:
the last step of the VQE process includes minimizing the amountBy advice parameter->Is a new set of (a) is a new set of (b) s. In some embodiments, the minimizing amount +.>May be performed using a classical computer. In this case, example methods used include a gradient-free greedy method, such as the Powell's method or Nelder-Mead. The VQE process can be iterated until +.>Based on which the quantum state can be detected experimentally +.>All attributes.
As described above, performing the variational method may include performing one or more quantum computations and one or more classical computations. For example, as described with reference to the VQE process, the method may include preparing a parameterized quantum state and measuring an expected value of the embedded hamiltonian relative to the parameterized quantum state using quantum hardware. The measurement results may be provided to a classical computer that performs minimization of the energy landscape to determine updated values of the quantum state parameters that, upon convergence, describe the ground state of the iterative embedded hamiltonian.
The system determines whether a completion event has occurred (step 406). For example, as described above with reference to step 304 of fig. 3, in some embodiments, completion of an event occurs when the processed ground state of an iteration converges with the processed ground state of a previous iteration.
In response to determining that the completion event has not occurred, the system provides the ground state of the determined iterative embedded hamiltonian as a subsequent state (step 408 a). The system may then repeat steps 402-406 until it is determined that a completion event has occurred.
In response to determining that a completion event has occurred, the system defines the determined ground state of the embedded hamiltonian as an approximate ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region (step 408 b). As described above with reference to fig. 2, the approximate ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region describes the properties of the physical system as a whole. Thus, the system may define the determined ground state of the embedded hamiltonian as an approximate ground state of the physical system in the unit cell region and simulate the physical system using the approximate ground state.

Typically, digital data communication networks are not capable of transmitting quantum data, however quantum data communication networks may transmit both quantum data and digital data.
The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable digital and/or quantum computers, optionally in conjunction with one or more digital and/or quantum processors, executing one or more digital and/or quantum computer programs to perform functions by operating on input digital and quantum data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA or ASIC, or a quantum simulator, or a combination of special purpose logic circuitry or a quantum simulator and one or more programmed digital and/or quantum computers.
For a system to be "configured to" one or more digital and/or quantum computers performing a particular operation or action, it is meant that the system has installed thereon software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof that, in operation, causes the system to perform the operation or action. For one or more digital and/or quantum computer programs configured to perform a particular operation or action, it is meant that the one or more programs comprise instructions that, when executed by a digital and/or quantum data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the operation or action. A quantum computer may receive instructions from a digital computer that, when executed by the quantum computing device, cause the device to perform operations or actions.
Digital and/or quantum computers suitable for executing digital and/or quantum computer programs may be based on general or special purpose digital and/or quantum processors or both, or any other type of central digital and/or quantum processing unit. Typically, the central digital and/or quantum processing unit will receive instructions and digital and/or quantum data from a read-only memory, a random access memory, or a quantum system suitable for transmitting quantum data (e.g., photons), or a combination thereof.
The essential elements of a digital and/or quantum computer are a central processing unit for executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and digital and/or quantum data. The central processing unit and memory may be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry or quantum simulators. Typically, a digital and/or quantum computer will also include or be operably coupled to receive digital and/or quantum data from, or transfer digital and/or quantum data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices (e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or quantum systems suitable for storing quantum information). However, digital and/or quantum computers do not require such devices.
Digital and/or quantum computer readable media suitable for storing digital and/or quantum computer program instructions and digital and/or quantum data include all forms of non-volatile digital and/or quantum memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disk; CD-ROM and DVD-ROM discs; and quantum systems, such as trapped atoms or electrons. It should be appreciated that quantum memories are devices capable of storing quantum data with high fidelity and high efficiency for long periods of time, such as light-substance interfaces that use light for transmission, and substances for storing and preserving quantum features (such as superposition or quantum coherence) of quantum data.
The control of the various systems described in this specification, or portions thereof, can be implemented in a digital and/or quantum computer program product comprising instructions stored on one or more non-transitory machine-readable storage media, and the instructions can be executed on one or more digital and/or quantum processing devices. The systems described in this specification, or portions thereof, may each be implemented as an apparatus, method, or system that may include one or more digital and/or quantum processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to perform operations described in this specification.
While this specification contains many specifics of embodiments, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular embodiments. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments can also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Furthermore, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
Similarly, although operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In some cases, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system modules and components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
Specific embodiments of the subject matter have been described. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. For example, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. As one example, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In some cases, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
