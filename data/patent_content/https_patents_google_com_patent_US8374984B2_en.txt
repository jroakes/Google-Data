Definitions
- the present invention is related generally to monitoring consumption of electronic content and, more particularly, to enhancing social interactions.
- outlets include, for example, television, radio, media playback devices (e.g., VCRs, DVRs, CD and DVD players), e-mail, text messaging, and web-based content (either live or cached).
- media playback devices e.g., VCRs, DVRs, CD and DVD players
- e-mail e.g., text messaging
- web-based content either live or cached
- media consumption is made more social by suggesting a time when users in a group may engage in live communications while consuming media.
- media-consumption activities of the users in the group are monitored.
- the set-top boxes of a cable television system monitor when and what each user watches.
- times when each user will be available for live communications are predicted.
- the individual predictions are correlated and, if possible, a future time is suggested when a largest possible number of the users in the group will be available for live communications.
- the members of the group are self-selecting, e.g., they are members of a social network.
- Some embodiments use other information, such as electronic calendars, to predict when users may be available.
- the suggested time for live communications may be presented to the users in the group along with such information as which members of the group are expected to be available and what content is suggested for consuming (possibly based on ratings of content assigned by members of the group).
- the suggested time may be shown on an electronic program guide for a user watching television and may be added to each user's electronic calendar.
- a communication channel can be automatically opened that supports live communications among those users in the group who are predicted to be available.
- FIG. 1 is an overview of a representational environment in which the present invention may be practiced
- FIG. 2 is a schematic of a device for consuming content and for gathering information on a user's content consumption
- FIGS. 3 a and 3 b together are a flowchart of a method for suggesting a time for live communications.
- this discussion focuses on ways of enhancing social interactions among users in a social group.
- Each user in the group is in an environment that supports both communications and media-consumption.
- FIG. 1 presents one typical communications and media-consumption environment 100 for a user in the social group.
- This is a cable-television environment, wherein the cable operator provides head-end equipment 102 to connect the user's devices 110 , 112 , 114 to various communications and media-consumption services, including, for example, television, telephony, and Internet-based services.
- the equipment at the head-end 102 can be very complex. That complexity is not important to the present discussion, so the head-end 102 is depicted in a simplified way by one server 104 .
- the head-end 102 is connected via a cable (coaxial or fiber optic) 106 to the user's premises.
- a set-top box 108 connects to the cable 106 and provides television services via a monitor 110 .
- communications and media-consumption services can be provided by satellite or wireless systems (e.g., cellular) instead of, or in addition to, the cable 106 of FIG. 1 .
- a laptop computer 112 is shown in FIG. 1 that uses the cable 106 to connect to the Internet.
- a telephone 114 access the Public Switched Telephone Network via the cable 106 .
- Users in the group may have communications and media-consumption environments that are similar to or completely different from the representative environment 100 shown in FIG. 1 .
- the environment of one user may include a cable television, a separate data line for Internet access, and a dedicated telephone line.
- a user's environment may consist solely of a cellphone. There is no expectation or requirement that the users in the group all have similar environments.
- FIG. 2 shows the major components of a media-consumption device. While FIG. 2 is specifically directed toward the set-top box 108 of FIG. 1 , it is easily generalized to other media-consumption and communications devices such as cellphones and personal computers 112 .
- the set-top box 108 has a cable interface 200 connected to the cable 106 provided by the cable operator. Other devices support other communications interfaces such as DSL, cellular, WiFi, BlueTooth, and the like.
- a processor 202 controls the set-top box 108 and performs aspects of the method discussed below in reference to FIGS. 3 a and 3 b .
- the set-top box 108 is designed to drive an external monitor 110 via the monitor interface 204 .
- the monitor is built into the device itself, so the interface 204 is all internal.
- the device 108 includes a user interface 206 that, on various devices, includes such features as a keyboard, mouse, touch screen, infrared remote receiver, and the like. All of this hardware is well known in the art.
- step 300 content-consumption information is gathered about users in the group.
- This information can include, for example, what types of content each user consumes and when and where that content is consumed.
- the content can include, for example, live or recorded television or radio programs, music, web services, telephone conversations, and the like. Different devices are expected to have different capabilities for gathering this information. As one example, a simple power monitor can report when the television monitor 110 is turned on but cannot tell what program is playing.
- the set-top box 108 both mediates commands to the cable system and delivers the resulting programming to the monitor 110 , so the set-top box 108 can collect very detailed information on the media that the user consumes. However, most set-top boxes 108 cannot tell whether or not the television monitor 110 is actually turned on.
- the laptop 112 can also collect such information.
- a cellphone (not shown in FIG. 1 ) can collect the same information as the laptop 112 . The cellphone can also record information from more traditional telephone services, from on-device content-consumption applications, and from on-device communication-centric applications.
- Step 302 presents the possibility of gathering information in addition to the media-consumption information of step 300 .
- This other information is directed toward predicting the communications availability of the user.
- the user may keep an electronic calendar on the laptop 112 .
- Certain events on the calendar e.g., a business call
- other events e.g., an entry for a baseball game
- step 300 different media-consumption and communication devices are able to record different types of information about the user.
- the suggestions made by aspects of the present invention are more useful the more information, and the more types of information, are gathered and analyzed. Further, the longer the period over which information is gathered, the better the particular habits of a user can be known.
- step 304 the information gathered about a user is analyzed to predict when that user will be available for live communications. As can easily be imagined, these predictions may be solid or very tentative depending upon the type and amount of information gathered, and also upon the regularity of the user's habits. In some situations, a user may explicitly state that he will either be busy or available at a certain time, or that he will tentatively be busy.
- the set-top box 108 is centrally located among the user's devices in the environment 100 of FIG. 1 , making it a good candidate for gathering and analyzing the information.
- the set-top box 108 should be shielded from “snooping” by the cable operator.
- other user devices e.g., a cellphone, can periodically download information gathered in steps 300 and 302 to the set-top box 108 via a short-range radio link.
- Step 306 attempts to correlate the predictions made in step 304 across all users in the social group.
- this correlation may be very simplistic and will just produce a list of times when all users (or a majority of users) in the group appear to be available.
- Other embodiments may limit the results of the correlation to predicted times when all (or a majority) of the users are predicted to be engaged in similar activities (e.g., all watching television or all watching the same television program).
- the users can rate various media, and the correlation can be restricted to only those times when media rated above a certain threshold by a certain number of users will be available for consumption.
- Step 306 can be performed in a distributed manner among devices (e.g., laptops 112 ) owned by the users in the group.
- Other implementations may choose to use a central server (e.g., the server 104 ) to correlate the individuals predictions made in step 304 . These choices are made based on ease of implementation and on security considerations.
- step 308 the correlation of step 306 finds a time when all users in the group appear to be available for live communications. That time is then suggested to the users.
- step 310 suggests a time when at least some of the users are expected to be available.
- the suggestions of step 310 can be limited to only times when, for example, a majority of users are expected to be available.
- step 306 It may happen, of course, that the correlation of step 306 does not find any time. This eventuality is reported in step 312 . It is possible that a user, seeing this result, can change his information collected in steps 300 and 302 (e.g., by freeing up some time on his electronic calendar). This change would affect the predictions in step 304 and, possibly, the correlation results of step 306 .
- the suggested time can be added to an electronic calendar of a user or added to a on-screen program guide for viewing on the television monitor 110 .
- Information related to the suggested time can also be presented. Some embodiments list the users in the group who are expected to be available at the suggested time. In optional step 316 , content is suggested for consumption during the suggested time. (This content suggestion may be based on ratings previously produced by users in the group.)
- Optional step 318 sets up a communication channel at the suggested time.
- the channel may be a simple telephone call or a laptop-based meeting supporting voice and data communications.
- Some cable-television environments provide a communications channel that supports voice and video mediated by the set-top box 108 and the television monitor 110 (along with a microphone and camera, of course) and carried by the cable 106 .
- the channel can be set up among those users expected to be available (or who have responded positively to an entry for this time added to their electronic calendars) and can also include users in the group who, though not expected to be available, are not positively known to be unavailable. These latter users can be invited by others in their social group to participate, if they are indeed available at this time.
- FIGS. 3 a and 3 b It is anticipated that the method of FIGS. 3 a and 3 b is not performed only once but is repeated to gather more information and to suggest future times for live social interaction.
