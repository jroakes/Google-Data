Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to image color balancing. More specifically, the present invention relates to a new method for estimating the mapping required to transform one color distribution into another.
- the present invention includes the use of various technologies referenced and described in the documents identified in the following LIST OF REFERENCES:
- a major problem in the post production industry is matching the color between different shots possibly taken at different times in the day. This process is part of the large activity of film grading in which the film material is digitally manipulated to have consistent grain and color.
- color grading will be used specifically to refer to the matching of color. Color grading is important because shots taken at different times under natural light can have a substantially different ‘feel’ due to even slight changes in lighting.
- color balancing is achieved by experienced artists who use edit hardware and software to manually match the color between frames by tuning parameters. For instance, in an effort to balance the red color, the digital samples in the red channel in one frame may be multiplied by some factor and the output image viewed and compared to the color of some other target frame. The factor is then adjusted if the match in color is not quite right.
- the amount of adjustment and whether it is an increase or decrease depends crucially on the experience of the artist. This is because it is a delicate task since the change in lighting conditions induces a very complex change of illumination. It would be beneficial to automate this task in some way.
- An object of the present invention is to estimate a color mapping that will transform a first (source) color distribution into a second (target) color distribution via matching operations.
- the following are considered to be novel aspects of the invention, which can be used either separately or in combination with known methods.
- the invention uses multiple one-dimensional histogram matching operations. These one-dimensional histograms are derived from projections along multiple directions in the color space.
- each one-dimensional histogram matching operation is preferably non-linear.
- the net effect of using multiple one-dimensional histogram matching operations is therefore a non-linear transformation of color space.
- the invention is preferably iterative using successive one-dimensional histogram matching operations preferably until the one-dimensional histograms of both the source and target images match within some predefined error.
- the invention uses exclusively one-dimensional histogram manipulation instead of multidimensional as in [10, 11, 13], and is iterative.
- the method is known to converge. Particularly it will yield a final color distribution without further intervention or change of operation in a finite time.
- the method is preferably completely non-parametric and is very effective at matching arbitrary color distributions.
- the method preferably uses the raw image data to create the histograms required.
- direct measurements from the image are sufficient to use the method, which does not rely on mathematical models or assumptions.
- the color distribution can be gained directly from the image without introducing additional parameters or making use of explicit models or assumptions.
- the invention is combined with a noise removal stage. This reduces the grain artifact caused by many histogram matching tools. As a consequence, the method yields an improved quality of the output image.
- a preferred variant of the noise removal step of the present invention includes the novel element of constraining the gradients in the output image to be close to those in the input image. It will be understood by a person skilled in this area that this step can be employed independently of the matching aspect of the invention as described above.
- an automated method for transforming a first color distribution based on a second color distribution comprising: (1) determining, for each of the first and second color distributions, a one-dimensional histogram along a direction in a color space; (2) matching the one-dimensional histogram determined for the first color distribution and the one-dimensional histogram determined for the second color distribution so as to generate a transform mapping; (3) transforming the first color distribution based on the generated transform mapping; and (4) repeating the determining, matching, and transforming steps for other directions in the color space until the generated transform mapping converges.
- FIG. 1 is an example (right image) of color transfer using Reinhard's Color Transfer [15] illustrating how the transfer of a source image (center image) fails to re-synthesize the color scheme of the target image (left image), and that human interaction is required to make the process successful;
- FIG. 2 is an example of a one-dimensional (1D) pdf transfer on grayscale pictures with FIG. 2A showing a source and a target image, and FIG. 2B showing the source and target histograms and a matching function that can transform pixels from the source to match the histogram of the target;
- FIGS. 3A-3D illustrate a outline flow diagram ( FIG. 3A ) and various stages of a more detailed flow chart ( FIGS. 3B-3D ) with the first part of the process being optional, but capable of handling very effectively linear transformations, whilst the second step of the process can handle any non-linear transformation and at the end of the iterations, when no more improvement is visible, the two set of samples share the exact same statistics; while using this process for matching colors in images, a grain artifact can appear and the noise smoothing module is used to address this problem;
- FIG. 4 is an example of the new color transfer process as applied to a target image (a) and a source image (b) picture using three iterations (c-e), with the final result (f) having the same color distribution as the target image (a);
- FIG. 5 illustrates the result of noise smoothing on grayscale images where two consecutive archive frames (a) and (b) suffer from extreme brightness variation and the corresponding mapping transformation (e) is overstretched resulting in an increased level of noise on the mapped original frame (c) whilst the proposed grain artifact reducer is able to reproduce the noise level of the original picture though leaving the top of the original picture saturated and not retrieved but succeeding in preserving the soft gradient in image (d);
- FIG. 6 illustrates the result of noise smoothing for a color picture with the details of the picture being preserved, while the spurious graininess in sky has been washed out;
- FIG. 7 is an example of employing the novel color grading process for matching lighting conditions by using the color properties of the sunset to synthesize the ‘evening’ scene depicted at sunset in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the embodiments may be described as a process which is depicted as a flowchart, a flow diagram, a data flow diagram, a structure diagram, or a block diagram. Although a flowchart may describe the operations as a sequential process, many of the operations can be performed in parallel or concurrently. In addition, the order of the operations may be re-arranged.
- a process is terminated when its operations are completed, but could have additional steps not included in the figure.
- a process may correspond to a method, a function, a procedure, a subroutine, a subprogram, etc. When a process corresponds to a function, its termination corresponds to a return of the function to the calling function or the main function.
- embodiments may be implemented by hardware, software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description languages, or any combination thereof.
- the program code or code segments to perform the necessary tasks may be stored in a machine readable medium such as storage medium.
- a processor(s) may perform the necessary tasks.
- An embodiment of the present invention is a process for automating the color grading or color balancing task even when the lighting conditions have dramatically changed, as shown in FIG. 1 . It resolves many of the problems with previous work and is computationally extremely efficient. Its implementation based on the below description in dedicated or purposely designed circuitry is possible, but an implementation exploiting the Graphics Subsystem of general purpose processors is described as a more economic manner of implementing the present invention.
- One aspect of this invention is to notice that if a colorspace transformation (a rotation of the colorspace) is applied to the color data between each iteration of 1D matching, this causes the entire color surface distribution of the center image of FIG. 1 to eventually warp into the shape of the color distribution of the target image on the left of FIG. 1 .
- the image on the right of FIG. 1 shows the final color transfer appearance in which source image has been colored with the colors in the target image.
- the invention proposes in this example that if 1D slices of the multidimensional color space are matched independently, eventually the entire multidimensional surface will be mapped effectively. To understand this aspect of the invention, it may be beneficial to discuss some background on image histograms.
- An image histogram can be understood as the frequency distribution of color in the image.
- the histogram of a gray scale image is 1D because pixels assume only scalar values of gray—typically from 0 to 255 for instance.
- FIG. 2B shows this.
- the histogram of a color image is 3D because each pixel has associated with it 3 values for red, green and blue (in RGB space), or luminance, and two color components (in YUV space).
- Matching 1D histograms is a well understood process and used in histogram equalization for instance.
- To do so requires mapping each of the 256 gray scale values in the image on the right to some other grayscale value such that the resulting brightness of source image is the same as target image.
- a technique for creating this mapping is well known [4].
- a process may be represented as the following steps.
- step 301 the color space before performing the histogram matching (steps 302 and 303 ), and then repeating this process iteratively 305 , as shown in the diagram of FIG. 3A .
- step 304 the rotation is then undone in step 304 or reversed after each mapping.
- the matching operation for multiple directions, i.e., more that just the three conventional axes, in the color space until the changes to the pixels are no longer significant, even color images can be successfully matched.
- the central part of the process outlined above is illustrated in greater detail in FIG. 3C .
- the image pixels involved are the current image I (k) (which has been transformed up to iteration k) and the image data from G, the target image.
- G is the image containing the color distribution that is required.
- the first step 321 of the iteration is to change the coordinate system by rotating both the color of the samples of I (k) and the samples of G.
- This operation is can be also referred to as a color space conversion rotating one set of axes in the color space into different set of axes in color space.
- a second step 322 the samples of both distributions are projected onto the new axis by summing in the relevant direction. Hence summing along the transformed red and green color axes yields a projection along the transformed blue axis. This yields three histograms for the three color planes in each sequence. These histograms for the new axes are defined as H I 1 , H I 2 , H I 3 and H G 1 , H G 2 , H G 3 for the current and target image, respectively.
- mappings t 1 , t 2 , t 3 that transform the histograms H I 1 , H I 2 , H I 3 into H G 1 , H G 2 , H G 3 .
- step 324 of the samples by R ⁇ 1 to return in the original coordinate system.
- a full process according to an example of the invention includes an initialization step 311 and optional steps 312 , 313 to accelerate the process as shown in FIG. 3B .
- This full process includes the following steps.
- the above method can be applied to any kind of mapping, it might be desirable as a first step 312 , 313 to use a different technique for registering global transformations between the two distributions.
- the novel method is not naturally designed to find rotation between the original and target dataset. This is not to be confused with the rotations used in the PDF transfer process of FIG. 3C .
- the rotation considered here is the rotation between the two distributions, whereas the rotations mentioned in the PDF transfer process above are applied to both distributions and only describe a change of coordinate system.
- the color distribution of the image I (0) shares the average value, variance and global color directions with the target image G. This operation cannot handle non-linear transformations but offers an accelerated process if it is used as a first step, i.e., before the actual pdf transfer process.
- the eigenvectors in U I and U G have to correspond. This is achieved by ordering them with respect to the magnitude of the corresponding eigenvalues and making sure that they do not point in opposite directions. i.e. ⁇ i ⁇ 3, t u I i ⁇ u G i >0 (6)
- the color mapping to the original picture transfers correctly the target color palette to the original picture but it might also produce some grain artifacts, as shown in FIG. 5 .
- the resulting mapping function can be stretched on some parts (see particularly FIG. 5 ), and thus enhances the noise level.
- a solution to this noise problem in accordance with an variant of the present invention is to reduce the grain by executing a post-processing process, as shown in FIG. 3D , that forces the level of noise to remain the same or approximately the same.
- this variant includes the step 333 of adjusting the gradient field of the picture result so that it matches the original picture. If the gradient of both pictures are similar, the level of noise will be the same or at least approximately the same. Matching the gradient of a picture has been addressed in different applications such as image stitching [12] or high dynamic range compression [3], and it can be efficiently solved using a variational approach to be described in the following.
- N i corresponds to the four neighboring pixels of i.
- weight fields ⁇ and ⁇ affect the importance of both terms of expression (7). Numerous expressions for ⁇ and ⁇ are possible. For example, the weight field ⁇ can emphasize that only flat areas have to remain flat but that gradient can change at object border, in which case:
- ⁇ ⁇ 0 1 + ⁇ ( ⁇ t ) ⁇ ( I ) ⁇ ( 9 )
- ⁇ 0 constant and ( ⁇ t)(I) refers to the gradient of t for the color I.
- the final process is identical to a two-dimensional infinite impulse response (2D IIR) filter in which the coefficients a, b, c, d, e and f only dependent on the original picture I and the mapped picture t(I) and which thus can be computed beforehand.
- 2D IIR infinite impulse response
- the unknown result picture J can be solved by standard iterative methods 333 like SOR, Gauss-Seidel with multigrid approach. Implementations of these numerical solvers are widely available and one can refer for instance to the respective numerical recipes [14].
- FIG. 5 illustrates the result of noise smoothing on grayscale images where two consecutive archive frames (a) and (b) suffer from extreme brightness variation and the corresponding mapping transformation (e) is overstretched resulting in an increased level of noise on the mapped original frame (c) whilst the proposed grain artifact reducer is able to reproduce the noise level of the original picture, though leaving the top of the original picture saturated and not retrieved but succeeding in preserving the soft gradient in image (d).
- FIG. 6 illustrates the result of noise smoothing for a color picture with the details of the picture being preserved, while the spurious graininess in sky has been washed out.
- FIG. 7 is an example of employing the novel color grading process for matching lighting conditions by using the color properties of the sunset to synthesize the ‘evening’ scene depicted at sunset in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the main step of these methods is to solve iteratively for J(x,y) as follows.
- J ( k + 1 ) ⁇ ( x , y ) 1 e ⁇ ( x , y ) ⁇ ( f ⁇ ( x , y ) - a ⁇ ( x , y ) ⁇ J ( k ) ⁇ ( x , y - 1 ) - b ⁇ ( x , y ) ⁇ J ( k ) ⁇ ( x , y + 1 ) - c ⁇ ( x , y ) ⁇ J ( k ) ⁇ ( x - 1 , y ) - d ⁇ ( x , y ) ⁇ J ( k ) ⁇ ( x + 1 , y ) )
- the main computational demands in the first step of the full process are the colorspace conversion and the look up table for mapping pixels.
- the solution of the system requires a substantial amount of spatial processing. It is possible to propose the use of Graphics Hardware from companies such as NVIDIA and ATI to provide a hardware embodiment.
- An efficient system can be created by using a general purpose CPU for control and data management while employing the Graphics subsystem for data processing.
- the main subsystems are proposed as below.
