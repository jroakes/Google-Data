As everyone knows, conventional cheap inertial navigation system is due to axle misalignment, zero-deviation and integrator drift generation error.Slightly coarse reading of linear acceleration (accelerometer) and angular speed (gyroscope) can (in time) add up to become large velocity error gradually, and these large velocity errors form larger site error.What more have challenge is the motion of pedestrian.Different from the motion of aircraft, automobile or other vehicles, the motion of pedestrian normally " non-smoothly ".Such as, mobile device can be carried in the different time in a different manner by different people.From noise, tell real signal is almost impossible.
In order to by minimum, utilize non-intervention alignment mechanism on the one hand.In one example in which, can use and be called that the moving direction of pedestrian is determined in the process of " vibrational energy model " (VEM) based on equiparition theorem herein.Equiparition theorem shows energy mean allocation between all degrees of freedom.Calibration process provides the foundation to carry out location, position to implement efficient multimodal signal fused for obtaining accurate sensor reading.In one scenario, particle filter can be used for blending algorithm.Calibration makes the reading of each INS more accurate.The multiple that vibrational energy model uses the signal collected from INS to calculate in " energy " field the direction of motion to be exaggerated to reduce error, thus ensure either large or small or calibration or unregulated error too seriously exaggerated.Merge and the result from INS is combined with external signal the accuracy and the efficiency that improve position prediction further.

As shown in Figure 1, client terminal device 104 also can comprise the geo-location assembly 130 for determining geographical position.Such as, each client terminal device 104 can comprise the gps receiver for the approximate latitude of determining device, longitude and height and position.Thus, when client terminal device 104 changes position (such as passing through physical motion), gps receiver can determine new current location.Geo-location assembly 130 also can comprise the software of the position of other signals for receiving based on client terminal device 104 (signal that the antenna of such as mobile device receives from one or more cell tower) determining device.
Client terminal device 104 also can comprise onboard sensor 132, the transducer of such as orienting device and other types.Such as, onboard sensor 132 can comprise gyroscope 134, accelerometer 136, compass 138, pedometer 140, magnetic field detector 142 and temperature sensor (such as thermometer 144).Onboard sensor can be used for (such as, combining with software) determines the position of the client terminal device 104 in the interior space.Such as, orienting device can indicating device towards direction.Client terminal device 104 can use from the data of gyroscope 134 and determine that client terminal device is relative to gradient, the deflection (yaw) of gravity direction or perpendicular plane or roll (or change) from the input of accelerometer 136.
In this respect, it should be understood that the bearing data being supplied to client terminal device of setting forth can be supplied to client terminal device automatically herein.Alternatively or extraly, server 102 or other devices can be transferred to be further processed or record from this bearing data of onboard sensor 130 or other data.Personal data are not had to need transmission.For user data provides secret protection, such as comprise the anonymization of personally identifiable information, data aggregate, the filtration of sensitive information, encryption, sensitive information hash or filter to remove personal attribute, time restriction that information stores or the restriction that data use or share.User can select not use any this sensitive information.
The bearing data received from onboard sensor 130 can use in every way.Such as, by running the mean value of accekeration to confirm which direction (towards ground) down, gyroscope 134 or accelerometer 136 can be used as pedometer.Motion whenever is in downward direction greater than the threshold value that experience is determined, pedometer can be determined to there occurs a step.The approximate step-length of end user or speed can be similar to the distance often walked.
When user moves in the interior space, the onboard sensor 130 of client terminal device 140 can be used for the motion determining user.Such as, gyroscope 134 can indicate the speed (such as, how soon user rotates) of Angulation changes.Such as, these data can be combined with the data from accelerometer 136 or pedometer 140 to determine the position of client terminal device in preset time.
Onboard sensor 130 also can provide the general measure of position.But the impact that the measurement from gyroscope or other transducers may be drifted about, therefore may become inaccuracy in time.Therefore, onboard sensor is measured and can be compared with the measurement obtained by other means and location estimation termly.Such as, use wireless network data or the measurement of other acquisition of informations discussed and location estimation to can be used for calibration coiling property or other Inertial Navigation Units herein, or improve location estimation (such as when people is positioned at indoor environment).

The position using INS device to locate people can be divided into two classes substantially according to the mode how INS unit is placed.The inertance element that one class uses foot to install performs indoor pedestrian position blank.Another kind of setting INS unit is worn on waist.Two class schemes all ensure that the motor pattern of their INS unit is predictable.When foot installs, when foot's kiss the earth, INS unit receives clear signal to start stride (stride), and periodically performs this replacement.When waist worn, INS unit is contemplated to and stably moves.But the INS unit embedded in the mobile phone can not have these advantages.Mobile phone can be worn on waist, is placed in wallet, is placed in pocket, or swing in hand.
The pedometer being built in phone can use accelerometer.Although the step number estimated may not be very reliable, it can provide the good estimation to travel distance when without directional information.Compass can be used for the direction of estimating user; But reliable reading needs user to hold phone by this way: the direction of phone is always consistent with the direction of user.And the compass on mobile phone may unusual inaccuracy, such as, due to the severe jamming of other electronic units from mobile phone.Some technology may be used for addressing these problems, but may be only effective when the direction of phone infrequently changes.These use the existing method of INS can not provide the available strategy preventing the cumulative errors produced by various INS noise.
High-end pick up calibration often needs expensive mechanical platform, by this mechanical platform, can accurately controlling party to and rotary speed.Then transducer is exported and compare with the external calibration value gone out by known mechanical platform calculation of parameter.This high cost and the method for intrusive mood are unsuitable for calibrating the INS unit on mobile phone or other handset user devices.In order to solve the INS calibration problem of mobile phone, cheap equipment (such as optical tracker) is proposed.But, require that the buyer of mobile phone or other hand-held devices also buys this calibration station, or the device going shopping to calibrate termly them is infeasible.On the contrary, an aspect of of the present present invention provides a kind of calibration needing the minimum effort of the user of hand-held moving device just can effectively carry out.
Because the MEMS inertial sensor embedded in the mobile phone has larger noise floor, it is very important for therefore before MEMS inertial sensor is used for accurately locating, carrying out calibration to them.Have can calibrate the inertance element in mobile phone two opportunitys: at place of manufacturer be in.Outside price apparatus can be relied in the calibration process at place of manufacturer.But once user has bought mobile phone or other this portable units back, the calibration process of being in has been contemplated to be disposable, non-intervention type and should have disobeyed outer part device (such as rotating platform).
Accelerometer through the device be usually used in mobile client device.The same with other assemblies for inertial navigation, accelerometer may need calibration, because it may be subject to the impact of larger noise floor.Carry out simple experiment to help to analyze Sum decomposition noise floor, thus analogue noise substrate.Especially, by placed side by side for two smart mobile phones, first lie on the table, then stand against the wall vertical.The most responsive axis of three axis accelerometer is the axis closest to paralleling with gravity.The isolation of the axis expecting to become the most responsive is considered in aforesaid two kinds of placements, but does not need any axle of smart mobile phone or accelerometer and horizontal direction accurately parallel or vertical.
In often kind of placement of experiment, smart mobile phone keeps static at least 30 seconds.The size of the acceleration measured during this period of time as shown in Figure 2.Can observe the error of three types: random error, biased error and errors of proportional factor.Although two mobile phones are all static, the size of acceleration analysis is still shaken clearly, and this illustrates the existence of random noise.When two mobile phones are placed on two different positions, the impact of the biased error that Fig. 2 indicates two mobile phones to be subject to and errors of proportional factor, because two mobile phones are all different at the acceleration of diverse location with same mobile phone at the acceleration of same position.First, at least large 0.2m/s of acceleration that the acceleration magnitude ratio measured by the second mobile phone is measured by the first mobile phone
2.Secondly, when changing the most responsive axis about gravity, identical mobile phone for measuring goes out different acceleration magnitude.3rd, the size of the acceleration that two smart mobile phones are measured all departs from acceleration of gravity (9.8015m/s
2).This result indicates consumingly should calibrate each mobile phone separately.Equation 1 is used to carry out modeling to three kinds of acceleration errors discussed above, wherein three axis accelerometer reading a below

Wherein scaling matrices (S) is:

Critical nature for acceleration calibration be phone or other devices static time the size of acceleration measured must equal acceleration of gravity.Intuitively, if any error do not introduced by accelerometer, then the acceleration (being expressed as three-phase (triple)) measured in resting position should forming radius be the spherical of the size of acceleration of gravity.Biased and scale factor is drawn into irregular ellipse by spherical, and random error upsets oval.The object of accelerometer calibration process determines that parameter in error model is to transform back into the spherical of expectation by ellipse.
Because random error V is not constant value and different in time and different, the effective ways therefore eliminating randomness comprise averages to the acceleration readings in seclected time window.Allan variance is for determining the time span that time window should continue.First Allan variance is proposed by David Allan with measuring oscillator unsteadiness in the time domain, and is also a kind of effective ways random noise being expressed as the function of average time.Herein, represent average time between the time span that sample is averaged together.Allan variance can be expressed by the following equation:
Wherein y (i, T) is i-th mean value, and each mean value crosses over T second.
In a test, collect static accelerometer signal 160 minutes.Average time, T changed to 400 seconds (N=23) from 1 second (N=9599).Fig. 3 illustrates the Allan variance when changing to 15 seconds from 1 second average time.As shown in the figure, the Allan variance being embedded in the z-axis of the accelerometer in test mobile phone spends the maximum duration section of 6 seconds to restrain.This shows that the calibration of testing mobile phone needs mobile phone to carry out Removing Random No to obtain stable mean value in static at least 6 seconds, so that mean value can not change significantly within any 6 second time period afterwards.
The average time longer than 6 seconds may reduce Allan variance a little; But, for field calibration, expect that the alignment time is short as much as possible.Therefore about 6 seconds (such as, add or deduct 2 seconds, at least 3 seconds, or be less than 10 seconds) can be selected as suitable value.This random noise removal step and select arbitrarily one second interval as average time window length formed and contrast.The mean value that the accelerometer signal of only a second is crossed in the Allan variance instruction of measuring is all different in each second.
By being averaged after Removing Random No to crossing over the acceleration readings of at least 6 seconds, the next step of calibration determines biased and scale factor, i.e. six parameters: Sx, Sy, Sz, bx, by and bz.Owing to there being six parameters, careful way has abundant data to form overdetermination (over-determined) system.In a test, two boxes are used to help mobile phone is fixed into different attitudes to obtain stable acceleration analysis.Two boxes are placed on flat surfaces, reserve some spaces therebetween.Then, mobile phone is placed against the face of a box, and another box is used for preventing mobile phone from slipping.Two boxes keep mobile phone to be in resting position at least 6 seconds.The average three axis accelerometer signal crossing over 6 seconds forms calibration data set.Afterwards, the attitude of mobile phone is changed by rotating mobile or expansion/space reduced between two boxes.Given n collection, calibration uses to calculate (Sx, Sy, Sz, bx, by, bz) according to cost function as described below:
Be combined the process that Nelder-Mead simplex method and gradient descent method can minimize cost function f (S, b).In one example, because simplex method misses global minimum sometimes when using different value to carry out initialization, therefore gradient descent method is comprised.The result of simplex method is used as the initial starting value of gradient descent method.The result of gradient descent method is for opening the simplex method of next round.After some iteration, complete minimization process.
According on the one hand, after the accelerometer of mobile device has been calibrated, inertial navigation can be begun through and followed the tracks of pedestrian.Pedestrian follows the tracks of the direction of motion comprising and follow the tracks of pedestrian, and follows the tracks of the distance of pedestrian's distance specified point.To this, expect to maintain two tuples with the form of (direction, distance).Such as, these data can be stored in the daily record 146 (see Fig. 1) of the time index of client terminal device.Direction by pedestrian towards and specific compass direction between angle represent.Such as, compass direction can be south, and such as, south is considered to 0 °, and east is 90 °, and west is-90 °, and the north is 180 ° (or-180 °).The rice number that distance has been walked from last trace point with pedestrian is measured.In one example, two tuples are sent to blending algorithm with the speed of 1Hz.Derive direction by vibrational energy model treatment, calculate distance by step number is multiplied by step-length, below will be described both.
When people's walking, they seldom swing their arm perpendicular to the direction of their walking.Such as, her arm can be swung along the direction being parallel to her walking with the pedestrian of direction walking from south to north, but not Chao Dong or be exposed to the west.If pedestrian holds certain thing (such as phone or palmtop PC) and her arm of stopping swinging, the direction that she can be parallel to her walking swings her health to keep her balance.As extreme case, even if pedestrian imagines that crab equally laterally walks, she still needs the health swinging her as crab, especially, to be parallel to the mode in walking direction.This phenomenon can theoretical explanation be seem that pedestrian is walking stored energy when swinging her arm.Swing is considered to stored energy.According to equiparition theorem, pedestrian is alternately consumption/stored energy between walking/swing.Therefore, the direction of swinging arm also can be understood to the direction of pedestrian.An aspect of of the present present invention use swing energy, vibrational energy or other vibrations (being collectively referred to as " vibration kinetic energy " or " vibrational energy ") signal as the prompting of the direction of motion of user.
Fig. 4 A illustrates the schematic diagram 400 describing walking Move Mode.Herein, pedestrian can be modeled as unit 402.The walking movement of pedestrian can be evaluated as two major parts.One is translational motion, and another is oscillating movement.According to equiparition theorem, these two motions are (or a period of motion) distribute energy fifty-fifty that strides.As shown in Figure 4 A, these two motions are usually along the direction of motion 404.Linearly translational motion is shown by the arrow 406 along the direction of motion 404.On the contrary, oscillating movement can occur in along in the curved path 408 of the direction of motion 404.System is by the information of measuring vibrations inferred motion about translational motion.
Processing procedure is from determining that absolute reference system is (by vector A
a=(A
ax, A
ay, A
az)
trepresent) in acceleration start with the direction of motion (that is, the angle between the direction of motion and assigned direction (such as south)) obtaining pedestrian.Gyroscope and three axis accelerometer determination acceleration can be used.In the example of this absolute reference system, X-axis is level and points to south, and Y-axis is vertical and points to east, and Z axis points to ground.Such as, but the acceleration of accelerometer generator in reference coordinate of mobile phone or other mancarried device inside, wherein all axis are all relative to before screen.
Measure the magnetic field sensor of surrounding magnetic field and all be can be used for the initial rotation vector determining the reference coordinate of mobile device to be converted to absolute reference coordinate by the acceleration of gravity of accelerometer measures.During tracking operation, adopt gyrostatic measurement updaue spin matrix.In one embodiment, the direction of motion of pedestrian is determined as follows:
A
high=HPF (A
a) (equation 4)
According to equation 4, vector A
afeed back to high pass filter (HPF) to obtain the high fdrequency component A keeping oscillating motion
high.The information of the Z axis along absolute reference system can not be considered, because system pays close attention to the direction of the pedestrian determined along two dimensional surface (such as XY plane).
According to this equation, A
energybe the symmetrical matrix of 2 × 2, can be by
Represent.Herein, energy refers to the elastic potential energy of the storage be directly proportional to acceleration.In one embodiment, a and b can be obtained by acceleration readings and attitude signal.Herein, a represents acceleration, and b represents error.
A
lowEnergy=LPF (A
energy) (equation 6)
Herein, in order to level and smooth object, linear low-pass filters is adopted to extract A
energylow frequency component.Because low pass filter is linear, so A
lowEnergymaintenance is symmetrical, therefore A
lowEnergyelement can be expressed as:
A
lowEnergymaximum in all directions to the projection in the direction of motion.In other words, by f (α)=LPF ((acos α+bsin α)
2) maximized α is the angle of the direction of motion of pedestrian.Utilize
can derive:
(equation 8)
In fact, there are two α values to be minimized by f (α), this two α values can be checked out by these value generations of α are entered f (α).Two remaining α values represent the possible direction of moving, because system can only the direction of wobble detection.Swaying direction is parallel with the direction of walking, but can be contrary with it.Signal fused can use the information from WiFi signal and cartographic information to determine the direction of moving.The information be associated with above-mentioned process can be stored as the sensor calibration data 148 (see Fig. 1) of the daily record 146 of such as time index and/or the memory of mobile device.In one example, mobile client end device can store information, carry out accelerometer calibration and vibrational energy model treatment.Alternatively, in another example, some or all of information can transfer to server 102 for analyzing, process and/or storing.In further example, mobile client end device and service device 102 can share storage, treatment and analysis operation.When some information is sent to server 102 for the treatment of; personal data are not had to need transmission; and for user data provides secret protection, such as comprise the anonymization of personally identifiable information, data aggregate, the filtration of sensitive information, encryption, sensitive information hash or filter to remove personal attribute, time restriction that information stores or the restriction that data use or share.User can select not use any this sensitive information.
Fig. 4 B illustrates the example 420 of vibrational energy model treatment according to aspects of the present invention.First, in block 422, obtain (such as, retrieving from memory 120) or otherwise receive acceleration readings.Expect to use gyroscope and three axis accelerometer to calculate acceleration.As mentioned above, before the operation of block 422, accelerometer can be passed through calibration process.Then, as shown in block 424 *, high-pass filtering is carried out to obtain high fdrequency component A
high.As discussed above, A
highretain the oscillating motion generated when pedestrian's Tape movement device is walked in his or her hand.In block 426, can ask square to be directly proportional to energy to the data after filtering.Then, vibrational energy (A is determined
energy), such as, as described in above-mentioned equation 5.Once get vibrational energy, in block 430 by low-pass filtering operation to its smoothingization, produce " smoothly " vibrational energy (block 430).Then, the principal direction of moving is determined at block 434.Export the direction generated, such as, be used for by signal fused structure the position determining indoor pedestrian (i.e. the user of mobile device).Given this, the position of motion and principal direction can be used for for the user of mobile device provide map application, location-based service or targeted ads at least one.Although illustrate with particular order, some operation of example 420 can be carried out with different orders or carry out simultaneously.In addition, also can add or omit extra operation in process.
Fig. 5 illustrates at above-mentioned vibrational energy model treatment for detecting an example of the operation (direction) of pedestrian.In this example, suppose that pedestrian holds mancarried device (such as mobile phone).When she walks, pedestrian waves her arm, walks round block, first towards west, then towards south, Dong Hebei.This illustrates the direction of the pedestrian by vibrational energy model system (solid line) detection place, result and ground truth (dotted line) tight fit.
When pedestrian walks on level ground, the acceleration measured illustrates the obvious rhythm as shown in Fig. 6 A to 6C.Herein, the rhythm existed when diverse location the cell phone being equipped with accelerometer is assessed.Such as, Fig. 6 A represents the walking data when client terminal device is held in the hand of pedestrian, and wherein mobile device swings with user's walking.Data when Fig. 6 B represents that client terminal device is held in pedestrian's hand when phone to be stably held in face of them by pedestrian.Data when Fig. 6 C represents that client terminal device is placed on the breast pocket of the trousers of pedestrian.The size of acceleration is only shown in these figures.The sample frequency of accelerometer is approximately 30Hz.
Because the walking of pedestrian is by the liftoff cycle movement formed with toe heelstrike, a kind of rhythm of each placement display of accelerometer.But the position residing for client terminal device, rhythm has different performances.Such as, when pedestrian phone to be held in her hand and the arm waving her to keep balance time, acceleration analysis illustrates and often walks a corresponding spike, and in other scenes (Fig. 6 B and Fig. 6 C), exists and often walks corresponding two close spikes.The quantity of spike be not both because some after usually first toe being landed again heelstrike, this is by generation two spikes, but if phone is held in the hand of swinging arm, the impact of toe-is heelstrike unconspicuous.
No matter how pedestrian holds phone, level and smooth spike (smooth-spike) algorithm can be adopted to detect and often to walk.Such as, each of N number of sampling of aforesaid equation 1 pair of original acceleration meter reading can be first used to calibrate.Except eliminating biased error and errors of proportional factor and reducing except random error, two close spikes are also integrated into an only spike by calibration, calibration are called " smoothing " thus.Then, level and smooth acceleration formation sequence (is designated as a
si) and be sent to spike detection algorithm.If a
sibe greater than a
si-1and a
si+1, then a
sibe considered to spike and be marked as single step.In an experiment, N=5 provides suitable result, because almost do not have useful spike by smoothly, and is integrated into a spike due to toe-heel two spikes caused that move.Although level and smooth spike method is introduced delayed because averaging after having sampled at N time, N=5 and the sample rate of 30Hz make this delayed be 16 seconds left back, and this is acceptable.Fig. 7 A to Fig. 7 C illustrates the example of the gait testing result that three different phones are placed.In above-mentioned experiment, only miss out a step when phone is placed on the breast pocket of jeans.Step sizes can as Constandache etc., " Toward Mobile Phone Localization Without War-Driving ", INFOCOM collection of thesis, described in 2010,1-9 page, its disclosure is incorporated to herein by reference.
Can separate with the position prediction on given fixing floor from a floor to the motion detection of another floor.Such as, in order to detect floor change, vibrational energy model treatment is used to follow the tracks of user's motion between floors.If vibrational energy model treatment detects constant vertical energy, can be regarded as user and changing height (level) (such as, the floor of building), such as, by stair, escalator or lift.Once user arrives the floor (can show as vertical energy and maintain the time selected by rule of thumb) of expectation, can think and complete floor change.Boundary mark on that floor can provide confirmation.
In order to the position on the floor of tracing preset, particle filter process can be adopted as blending algorithm.Particle filter is generally used for estimating Bayes (Bayesian) model, in Bayesian model, latent variable connects into Markov (Markov) chain, wherein the state space of latent variable is continuous print (and discrete), and does not have enough restrictions to realize accurate tractable deduction.Under Markov hypothesis, event is by first events affecting subsequently, allows Bayesian filter to follow the tracks of dynamical system state in time.
But, it is known that particle filter increases and computation-intensive with the state space of latent variable, cause the particle of enormous quantity.Being that calculating is feasible on mobile device (such as mobile phone) in order to make framework, expecting to adopt floor plan and WiFi boundary mark as constraint with the quantity limiting particle.In the framework of position, particle has state s when time t

S

Herein, (x

tbe respectively horizontal level and the direction of user, landmark
tcan obtain the special polygon region of strong instruction from map, WiFi and INS unit and be the computed position of user.If it is noted that user is not near any boundary mark, landmark
tcan be empty.Owing to using vibrational energy model treatment to carry out separately, therefore without the need to highly state variable S will be stored in about user in the determination of which floor
tin.The input of particle filter expects to comprise the WiFi signal thermal map of floor plan, the reading in INS source, WiFi signal reading and on-site land survey.Export as the triumph particle S corresponding with the indoor location of user
t.
The object utilizing the inertial navigation system of calibration to locate pedestrian is the current location generating pedestrian.System can assess the accuracy of INS tracking and the efficiency of particle filter.The inertial navigation system of experiment to calibration discussed above in the different path and different placement that have used one group to have mobile phone is assessed.In one example, use the path that two groups different in an experiment, that is, pedestrian deasil and widdershins walks (being expressed as " clockwise rectangle " and " counterclockwise rectangle ") round the rectangle of 5m × 14.5m.In one scenario, mobile phone (or other devices) is positioned at three different placements, that is, the breast pocket of the trousers of static hand, the hand waved and wearer.Herein, static hand ride instead of walk passerby attempts the sight of the display screen seeing mobile device when walking.In a test, ask two people (a man and a woman) to be participated in the experimental data obtaining 12 groups altogether, comprise three different two different paths of placing with mobile phone.
The position using the inertial navigation system of calibration to generate with the speed of 1Hz and plot trace, result is as shown in Fig. 8 A to Fig. 8 C.Fig. 8 A illustrates that two pedestrians walk (counterclockwise rectangle) and the test result of mobile phone in their swinging arm counterclockwise.Fig. 8 B illustrates that two pedestrians walk (clockwise rectangle) and the test result of mobile phone in their static (non-swing) hand clockwise.As shown in the figure, no matter mobile phone in static hand or in the hand swung, vibrational energy model treatment all produces effective result.For two scenes, swing energy is obvious and can be used for the direction deriving pedestrian.At 72.5m
2region in, walk after 39 meters, the peak excursion of distance is confirmed as about 3 meters.But as shown in Figure 8 C, when mobile device is placed in the breast pocket of the trousers of pedestrian, the efficiency of this process reduces.This is because the amplitude of fluctuation of mobile device is not enough to the direction distinguishing pedestrian.But, comprise WiFi signal and indoor map to determine that the particle filter of the position of user can make to follow the tracks of more effective, the compensation vibration energy model calibration process when almost not having mobile device to wave.
In indoor environment, system mainly can rely on WiFi signal, and use inertial navigation system fills up the gap between any two continuous print WiFi signal.Therefore, system can increase the activation interval of vehicle-mounted GPS apparatus.Along with the increase at the activation interval of GPS, the energy consumption of mobile device reduces.Similarly, WiFi is called to determine that the increase at the interval of the position of mobile device also reduces the energy consumption of system.In one scenario, INS assembly can normally open with automatic rotation screen, the use of INS does not increase extra energy consumption thus.Therefore, system can save energy consumption by reducing to the dependence of GPS and WiFi signal.
