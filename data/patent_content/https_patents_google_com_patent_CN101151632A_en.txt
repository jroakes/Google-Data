Technical field
The present invention relates to broadcasting, and more specifically relate to and use a communication system to produce, monitor and report the blurbing that undertaken by one or more radio station and the broadcasting of radio programming layout.
Background technology
Many broadcaster and advertiser do one's utmost management and control broadcasting and advertising campaign, and manage to discern which broadcasting and advertisement effective, and the more important thing is that perhaps which broadcasting of identification and advertisement are invalid.For example, advertiser may spend several thousand dollars and spend the activity of preparing advertising of countless times, and subsequently these activities is monitored and management and control, to attempt the winning attention of selected or target audience and to make reaction maximization from these audiences.Advertiser manages by customized advertising active mediun, motion frequency, advertisement character and many other parameters advertisement to be aimed at the specific consumer group.Advertiser can step on advertisement at newspaper, magazine, trade journal, directly send by post on part, Yellow Page, radio and the TV.Regrettably, advertiser does not also have a kind of accurately and timely mechanism that is used to monitor and follow the tracks of to the transmission or the broadcasting of its activity at present, says nothing of the reaction to its activity.This problem may be aggravated in broadcast radio, because advertiser may reach the checking that does not receive in time several weeks about advertising campaign transmission or broadcasting after activity is scheduled to carry out in broadcast radio.Up to now, the those skilled in the art do not learn as yet a kind of can for advertiser provide about transmit and transmitted which advertising campaign and program and on which radio station and when transmit in real time, customization and the automated system of report accurately.
To identification and follow the tracks of when where to reach the radio broadcasting selecting the trial of blurbing activity and radio broadcast program layout to comprise so far to use the computer automation that is deployed in the geographic market or artificial listening station to write down, register and analyze to be undertaken by radio broadcasting with identification song, advertisement and selected Promgramming by radio.Advertiser can sign a contract to receive about broadcasting the report of which advertisement and radio programming layout with broadcasting monitoring company.This kind mechanism is easily made mistakes, efficient is low and outdated.Dealer and advertiser often focus on to increase to sell and promote and product and demand for services therefore have no time to wait for the generation of report that especially when waiting for a report even after waiting for a report, described report may comprise deviation and mistake.
Advertiser may carry out advertising campaign of a high price according to a very compact timetable, and may need by find alternative advertising opportunity come on a certain radio station or the transmission of the failure in a certain market or broadcasting take measures.If advertiser can verify immediately whether described activity transmits, then can realize this kind method.Mensal recitation or report often are not enough to satisfy gray needs.Vital information for advertiser is not often write down in report, and report reaches geographical overall audience size of dividing per capita when advertisement transmits because this kind report is failed usually at least.This kind information can't or be reported to serve usually and obtain by any existing radio advertisement and Promgramming audit.Yet this kind information may have much value and most important to advertiser.Advertiser may preference identification listen to audience and those potential consumers of advertisement, and directly these are measured and compare with reaction and sales figure.
Up to now, the those skilled in the art does not learn a kind of actual mechanism for advertiser's monitoring and the transmission of tracking blurbing as yet.
Therefore, need a kind of system and method to come to reach report accurately for broadcaster/advertiser provides real-time, the customization about the transmitting which broadcasting and advertising campaign and program that comprise station information, so that broadcaster/advertiser can discern audience and those potential consumers of broadcast listening and advertisement, and can directly these be measured and compare with reaction and sales figure.
In addition, wireless station for example usually handles and not to sell the advertisement stock every day of being caused because of Market demand factors, not good audience rating, radio station poor efficiency, transaction logistics, Promgramming logistics and third party's parameter, for example public service ads, advertisement with lottery, unsold and/or remaining advertisement and can preempt advertisement.Not selling the advertisement stock this every day on average can be up to 30% of advertisement every day.
Particularly, a local station can be packed the advertisement order into and can be produced record gap and space in the transaction system and when the described timetable of contrast is ranked these advertisements.This may be because of due to the advertisement that is not ranked during a certain time slot.Usually, system with public service ads, with lottery advertisement and/low-priority advertisements fills these gaps to fill up described timetable.
The actual mechanism that the stock is not sold in a kind of monitoring and monetization is not still understood by the technician in affiliated field so far.Therefore, need a kind ofly to be used for that the stock is not sold in list file monetization service time and to replace the system and method for not selling the stock with paid advertisement.

Referring now to Fig. 3,, a synoptic diagram of the information flow among the figure in displayed map 1 and 2 the communication system.Fig. 3 display message flow process 300.Information flow 300 comprises two principle regions RAS 230 and flow process 310.RAS 230 can comprise timetable file 320 and audio file 330.Flow process 310 can comprise audio advertisement files 340, publisher 350 and master controller 360.Hereinafter set forth information flow with reference to the numbering of the arrow of mark representative information flow process.
RAS 230 can comprise that one is used for the information flow of a new timetable file 1.Described new timetable file can come from timetable file 320 and be transferred to one first chain Agent 370.This transmission can be by announcing that to RAS 230 file system the external software of a new timetable file carries out by one.One first chain Agent 370 detects new timetable file 320 by a catalogue monitor processing procedure, and from the disk readout time list file 320.Described new timetable file 320 is derived from or takes from some systems in the described wireless station or the outside position (under the situation of telecommunication network Promgramming) of described broadcasting studio itself.Finally, but formation time list file 320 but keep not being published to RAD 230.Filling algorithm can be locality, and the rule that is used to fill described stock both can not be dynamic, also can not take into account a maximize revenue function.For example, third party's groups today will be in advance " purchase " unsold stock and give described radio station 1-N described radio station and can " fill " advertisement of not selling the stock.In the case, described radio station is not having one to guarantee to sell unsold stock in advance under the situation of timetable.
The first chain Agent 370 that resides among the RAS 230 can be passed to information one flow process 310.In Fig. 3, this retrieval to a new timetable file 320 can be considered as link 4.This information can be passed to an analysis and a storing step that is positioned at flow process 310.When RAS chain Agent 370 time for reading list files 320, can be with described file transfer to flow process 310.Can analyze dD according to timetable file 320 can preempt advertisement effectiveness (dD Avails) and its storage is supplied further processing.In order to keep accounts, can to take into account audit objective, can store original time list file 320.Shown in and described this analysis of in flow process 310, carrying out and the storage can realize at broadcasting studio 140 places.
After analyzing and storing described timetable file, described information transmission is extremely wherein given described activity assignment the IMS of timetable file 320.This transmission is shown by mark 5 and can carry out in flow process 310.This representative transmits dD Avails to IMS.Be not that described unsold stock is collected in the center, the center of following the tracks of advertisement validity can be published to the result each radio station and local station software and can use this information to carry out " intelligence " on the stock and insert selling.Described advertisement available may need to come forth or be sent to radio station 140 and radio station 140 may need to receive about these movable information datas, so that local engine can make decisions.
Similarly, after analyzing and storing described timetable file, a validator is searched the possible mistake that is ranked.Information transmission to described validator is shown by mark 6.Described validator can import this information and analysis time list file 320 to search mistake, label frequency mistake, the radio station contractual obligation mistake (for example the minimum of phase is counted weekly) in the label construction and to have other mistake known to the personnel of general technology of association area.Carry out though be shown as in flow process 310, this checking also can be carried out in hub 150 this locality.Described validator can export the information that whether is verified about described timetable file to IMS.This validity feedback is shown by mark 23.In case IMS receives an appropriate responsive from described validator, IMS can handle described new dD Avails by giving concrete dB Avails assignment dD advertisement and concrete creation.Carry out though be shown as in flow process 310, this IMS also can carry out in hub 150 this locality.
After described IMS gave the activity of described timetable file designate, described processing can be finished, and the information in the timetable is transported to a publisher as described in shown in mark 25.The result of dBAvails is one specifically at the dB timetable in each radio station.Though be shown as carrying out in flow process 310, this creation also can be carried out hub 150 this locality, ground.After announcing described timetable, can be shown in mark 7 with information transmission to master controller.Described master controller can move as drafting brain that not selling of preemption a little carry out " transaction " behind in to dB timetable file.Described master controller receives the song feed (comprising advertisement) about current positive play content on the radio station.Described master controller uses this to present to determine the position of a radio station in the current time table.In case described point has moved, described master controller is the replacement of management and control advertisement and gaining of primary advertising just.Carry out though be shown as in flow process 310, master controller also can carry out in hub 150 this locality.
