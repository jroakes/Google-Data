- the notification may notify the target user that an image has been tagged that is owned by the target user, where another person other than the target user is tagged or commented on. In some implementations, the notification may notify the target user that one or more images has comments, where the comments refer to the target user, and where the one or more images may be owned by the target user or may be owned by another user. In some implementations, the notification may notify the target user of images, where a tag of the target user or a comment referring to the target user is removed.

- the predefined selection criteria include a determination that the target user is in an image.
- the predetermined selection criteria include a determination that the target user is tagged in an image.
- system 102 may determine a relevancy score for each image based on various relevancy factors (e.g., the presence of the target user in a given image, whether the person who took a given photo of the target user is socially connected to the target user, etc.).
- various relevancy factors e.g., the presence of the target user in a given image, whether the person who took a given photo of the target user is socially connected to the target user, etc.
- Example implementations directed to relevancy factors and other factors are described in more detail below.
- the term photo is used to describe an image that is captured with a camera device.
- An image is a collection of pixels, which may be generated in a photo or may be generated outside the context of a photo (e.g., using an illustration tool, etc.). Implementations described herein apply to photos and images, depending on the particular implementation.
- the predefined selection criteria may include whether the target user attended an event associated with photos that another user has captured at the event.
- system 102 may determine that the target user attended the event based on various factors. For example, system 102 may determine that the target user has attended the event if the user has checked in at the event. System 102 may also determine that the target user has attended the event by determining that the target user is in a photo taken at the event and/or tagged in an image in a photo taken at the event. System 102 may also confirm that the target user was expected at the event (e.g., as an invitee).
- system 102 may determine a relevancy score for each image based on any combination of the target user being in a given image, the image being associated with a particular event, the target user being an invitee and/or attendee at the event, etc.).
- the predefined selection criteria may include social affinity criteria.
- the social affinity criteria may include whether a friend or family member of the target user is in a given image with the target user.
- System 102 may determine the target user and other people in a given image using any suitable facial recognition algorithm. Implementations associated with various facial recognition algorithms are described in more detail below. System 102 may determine whether other people in the image are friends or family members of target user based on the social graph of the target user.
- system 102 may determine a relevancy score for each image based on any combination of the target user socially connected to the person who owns the image (e.g., took the photos with the image, etc.), the degree of social connection (e.g., friends, family, etc.) between the target user and the image owner, etc.
- the predefined selection criteria may include image quality criteria.
- system 102 may determine an image quality score for each image based on various image quality attributes (e.g., clearness, resolution, brightness, contrast, etc.).
- the predefined selection criteria may include image space allotment criteria.
- system 102 may determine an amount of allotted space for a given notification. For each image, system 102 may determine modification and cropping potential if each image in relation to the amount of allotted space. For example, in some implementations, system 102 may determine if an object (e.g., face of the target user) in a given image can be adjusted in size and cropped such that the object is clearly visible in the notification. For instance, close-up image of the target user may be more suitable for re-sizing and cropping than a distant view of the target user in crowd of people. In some implementations, system 102 may determine a space suitability score for each image based on the content of the image, the space allocation in the notification, etc.
- object e.g., face of the target user
- system 102 obtains the one or more images associated with notification.
- System 102 then ranks the images based on the one or more predefined selection criteria. For example, system 102 may rank the images based on scores associated with relevance (e.g., relevance, social affinity, image quality, space allotment, etc.).
- System 102 selects one or more of the images based on the ranking. For example, system 102 may select the highest ranking images.
- system 102 crops one or more of the selected images based on one or more predefined cropping criteria.
- system 102 may locate objects in each image in order to isolate and crop such objects.
- system 102 may determine how much space to allot to each image. System 102 may then intelligently crop the selected images accordingly based on the one or more predefined cropping criteria, and based on filling the allotted space.
- system 102 reads tagged image data in order to determine the bounding box of the face of the person being tagged.
- the tagged image data may include, for example, facial coordinates and/or other object coordinates to facilitate system 102 in determining the bounding box.
- system 102 may use a facial recognition algorithm to determining the bounding box. Example implementations related to facial recognition are described in more detail below.
- the cropping criteria may include the relevancy of each cropped section to the target user.
- system 102 may use cropping criteria crop the images in order to show the most relevant section of each image, such as the face of the target user, etc. If a user receives a notification that the user has been tagged in an album for a previous event (e.g., last week's barbeque), the user will see the notification right away when checking notifications of the images which are cropped to the user's face.
- system 102 may crop a given image such that two or more discrete objects (e.g., the target user's face, a monument, etc.) are cropped into separate images and then combined into one. This may be done in order to minimize empty space in the resulting image. This may be preferable, because more of the allotted space is filled with interesting visual information instead of empty space.
- two or more discrete objects e.g., the target user's face, a monument, etc.
- system 102 may resize (e.g., reduce/shrink, enlarge, etc.) the size of one or more given images to a particular height (e.g., to fit an allocated space) and keep the same aspect ratio in order to optimize the images to best fit into an allotted space.
- resize e.g., reduce/shrink, enlarge, etc.
- system 102 may modify the aspect ratio of one or more given images in order to optimize the images to best fit into an allotted space.
- system 102 causes the cropped images to be displayed with the notification.
- the cropped images are displayed in an initial view of the notification (e.g., in a notifications section).
- system 102 may order the displayed images based on their rankings. For example, system 102 may cause the highest ranking images to be positioned on the far left of a group of displayed images. System may cause the second highest image to be positioned in the second position from the left of the group of displayed images.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example simplified user interface 300 , according to some implementations.
- FIG. 3 shows notifications 302 , 304 , and 306 .
- Notification 302 indicates that a user U 1 tagged the target user in a photo album.
- system 102 show a cropped preview 308 of an image of the target user (e.g., user U 2 ), as well as cropped previews of other images in the photo album that might be of interest to the target user.
- Notification 304 indicates that user U 1 shared a photo album with the target user.
- system 102 may also show various cropped previews such as preview 310 , which may be of interest to the target user.
- Notification 306 indicates that a user U 3 commented on an image of the target user. Notification 306 shows a preview 312 of the image commented on.
- the resulting notification provides the target user with a visual indication as to which images have received an action (e.g., images have been tagged, commented on, etc.). Similarly, the user is able to identify the other user(s) performing actions on images. Such implementations establish a stronger connection between the user's images and actions that have occurred.
- system 102 determines an order in which the images will appear to the user. In some implementations, system 102 causes images most relevant to the user to be displayed first in the initial view of a notification.
- system 102 may use smart crop data provided by an image service and displays the most relevant crop of the image.
- system 102 may generate notifications that refer to a group of images (e.g., an album of photos).
- a group of images e.g., an album of photos
- system 102 may expand the notification to a detailed view.
- the detailed view may display details and show one or more images associated with the notification. Such details may include text accompanying a given image, such as the text shown in FIG. 3 . Such text may vary depending on the particular implementations.
- the notification text may include: “Someone added a tag in a photo you own,” “Someone tagged your face in a photo,” “Someone tagged your face in multiple photos,” “Someone commented on a photo that you were tagged in,” “Someone commented on/mentioned a photo/post that you were tagged in,” “Many of your photos were automatically uploaded from your camera,” etc.
- An example implementation of a detailed view is shown below in connection with FIG. 5 .
- system 102 causes one or more of the images associated with a given notification to be displayed in the preview. If there is not sufficient space, system 102 may display the highest ranking images in accordance with implementations described herein.
- the previews may provide sufficient information for the target user to understand the nature of the notification. For example, if the user sees his or her image in the preview, the user may quickly understand that the notification shows that he or she was tagged. As such, the target user may not feel the need to select the notification in order to see the details. In other words, implementations may reduce the number of times that a given target user selects (e.g., clicks) notifications.
- system 102 may still provide some notifications with text or without particular images (e.g., if an image associated with a notification is deleted, too small, and/or if a tag is removed, etc.).
- the different previews show images cropped in various ways, which will be described in more detail below in connection with FIGS. 4, 5, and 6 .
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example simplified image 400 , according to some implementations.
- Image 400 is an image of the target user U 2 . Comparing image 400 to preview 308 of FIG. 3 , system 102 has cropped image 400 in preview 308 to better frame and emphasize the face, which is the most interesting portion of the image.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example simplified detailed view 500 of a notification, according to some implementations.
- Detailed view 500 includes an image 502 that corresponds to preview 310 of FIG. 3 .
- Detailed view 500 also includes a comment box 504 .
- Comment box 504 provides a convenient way to comment directly on a notification encourages target user feedback which may be helpful to system 102 in more accurately ranking other images associated with the target user.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example image 600 , according to some implementations. Comparing image 600 to preview 312 of FIG. 3 , system 102 has cropped image 600 in preview 312 to better show a portion the item in image 600 in order to make preview 312 more interesting, as well as to better fill the allotted space.
- system 102 is described as performing the steps as described in the implementations herein, any suitable component or combination of components of system 102 or any suitable processor or processors associated with system 102 may perform the steps described.
- system 102 may utilize a variety of recognition algorithms to recognize faces, landmarks, objects, etc. in images. Such recognition algorithms may be integral to system 102 . System 102 may also access recognition algorithms provided by software that is external to system 102 and that system 102 accesses.
- system 102 enables users of the social network system to specify and/or consent to the use of personal information, which may include system 102 using their faces in images or using their identity information in recognizing people identified in images.
- system 102 may provide users with multiple selections directed to specifying and/or consenting to the use of personal information.
- selections with regard to specifying and/or consenting may be associated with individual images, all images, individual photo albums, all photo albums, etc.

- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- system 102 obtains reference images of users of the social network system, where each reference image includes an image of a face that is associated with a known user.
- the user is known, in that system 102 has the user's identity information such as the user's name and other profile information.
- a reference image may be, for example, a profile image that the user has uploaded.
- a reference image may be based on a composite of a group of reference images.
- system 102 may compare the face (e.g., image of the face) and match the face to reference images of users of the social network system.
- face e.g., image of the face
- image of the face are used interchangeably.
- recognition of one face is described in some of the example implementations described herein. These implementations may also apply to each face of multiple faces to be recognized.
- system 102 may search reference images in order to identify any one or more reference images that are similar to the face in the image.
- system 102 may extract features from the image of the face in an image for analysis, and then compare those features to those of one or more reference images.
- system 102 may analyze the relative position, size, and/or shape of facial features such as eyes, nose, cheekbones, mouth, jaw, etc.
- system 102 may use data gathered from the analysis to match the face in the image to one more reference images with matching or similar features.
- system 102 may normalize multiple reference images, and compress face data from those images into a composite representation having information (e.g., facial feature data), and then compare the face in the image to the composite representation for facial recognition.
- the face in the image may be similar to multiple reference images associated with the same user. As such, there would be a high probability that the person associated with the face in the image is the same person associated with the reference images.
- the face in the image may be similar to multiple reference images associated with different users. As such, there would be a moderately high yet decreased probability that the person in the image matches any given person associated with the reference images.
- system 102 may use various types of facial recognition algorithms to narrow the possibilities, ideally down to one best candidate.
- system 102 may use geometric facial recognition algorithms, which are based on feature discrimination.
- System 102 may also use photometric algorithms, which are based on a statistical approach that distills a facial feature into values for comparison.
- a combination of the geometric and photometric approaches could also be used when comparing the face in the image to one or more references.
- system 102 may use facial recognition algorithms that use one or more of principal component analysis, linear discriminate analysis, elastic bunch graph matching, hidden Markov models, and dynamic link matching. It will be appreciated that system 102 may use other known or later developed facial recognition algorithms, techniques, and/or systems.
- system 102 may generate an output indicating a likelihood (or probability) that the face in the image matches a given reference image.
- the output may be represented as a metric (or numerical value) such as a percentage associated with the confidence that the face in the image matches a given reference image. For example, a value of 1.0 may represent 100% confidence of a match. This could occur, for example, when compared images are identical or nearly identical. The value could be lower, for example 0.5 when there is a 50% chance of a match. Other types of outputs are possible.
- the output may be a confidence score for matching.
- Implementations described herein provide various benefits. For example, when the user views the user's notifications window, the user views the most relevant images with notifications (e.g., that the user has been tagged), and also views the most relevant portions of each image. Furthermore, implementations display a large number of relevant images using minimal screen real estate, where the user can quickly visually scan the images.
