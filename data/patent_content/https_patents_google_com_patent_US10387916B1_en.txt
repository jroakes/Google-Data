Definitions
- a content item may be selected to be displayed to a user based on its success in a content item auction.
- the content item auction uses several measurements, such as quality score and bid amount to determine which content item to display. The methods and systems described herein ensure that a relevant content item is provided to the user.
- the method includes receiving, from a server, a request to provide a content item for display at a device.
- the method further includes calculating, by one or more processors, a quality score for the content item based on a loading speed of a web page, a bandwidth of a channel between a content source and the device, and a size of the content item.
- the method also includes, based on the quality score, selecting the content item for presentation on the device.
- Another implementation disclosed herein is a system including one or more processors configured to receive a request to provide a content item for display at a device.
- the one or more processors may also be configured to calculate a quality score for the content item based on a loading speed of a web page, a bandwidth of a channel between a content source and the device, and a size of the content item.
- the one or more processors may further be configured to, based on the quality score, select the content item for presentation on the device.
- a computer-readable storage medium having machine instructions stored therein, the instructions being executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform operations.
- the operations may include receiving a request to provide a content item for display at a device.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system in which third-party content is selected for presentation with first-party content, according to one implementation
- FIG. 2 is an example web page of the display of one or more content items with search results, according to one implementation
- FIG. 3A is a flow chart of a process for selecting a content item based on an altered quality score, according to one implementation
- FIG. 3B is a flow chart for a process for determining a factor used to alter the quality score, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of a process for providing a content item to a user based on a quality score, according to one implementation.
- the quality score measures a variety of factors to determine the ranking and pricing of a content item (e.g., an advertisement). Therefore, the factors are used to provide relevant content items to a user.
- the bandwidth, connection and so forth of a user's device may change the loading speed of the web page, which can alter the experience the user has with the web page. For example, if a web page includes high quality images or flash-based images, then, the web page may slowly load on the user's device if it is a mobile phone. In this case, the quality score may be low due to the user's device. Therefore, the relationship between the bandwidth and the loading speed of the web page should be determined and provided as a factor for the quality score.

- a campaign or other grouping of third-party content created via content selection service 104 may also include selection parameters that control when a bid is placed on behalf of a third-party content provider in a content auction. Any specified content selection parameters may be stored as part of the account of the provider. If the third-party content is to be presented in conjunction with search results from a search engine, for example, the content selection parameters may include one or more sets of search keywords. For example, the third-party content provider may only participate in content auctions in which a search query for “golf resorts in California” is sent to a search engine.
- Other content selection parameters that control when a bid is placed on behalf of a third-party content provider may include, but are not limited to, a topic identified using a device identifier's history data (e.g., based on webpages visited by the device identifier), the topic of a webpage or other first-party content with which the third-party content is to be presented, a geographic location of the client device that will be presenting the content (e.g., a zip code, city, state, country, etc.), a geographic location specified as part of a search query, or a device type (e.g., mobile devices, desktop devices, tablet devices, etc.).
- a selection parameter may designate a specific webpage, website, or group of websites with which the third-party content is to be presented. For example, an advertiser selling golf equipment may specify that they wish to place an advertisement on the sports page of an particular online newspaper.
- Content selection service 104 may be configured to apportion a percentage of earnings from a third-party content provider to the provider of the first-party content with which the third-party content is presented. For example, content selection service 104 may apportion 40% of the revenues received from a third-party content provider to the operator of content source 108 whenever the third-party content is selected for presentation on a website from content source 108 . Thus, a first-party content provider may receive revenues in exchange for allowing third-party content to be provided with the provider's content.
- Revenues apportioned to a first-party content provider by content selection service 104 may be based on the number of times third-party content was provided to devices (e.g., based on a number of impressions), based on whether or not a user clicked on the third-party content (e.g., a click count), or based on any other performance metric.
- An account of a first-party content provider in content selection service 104 may also include any number of content selection parameters that control which third-party content is eligible for presentation with the content from the first-party provider.
- a first-party content provider may specify to content selection service 104 the topics of third-party content eligible for selection for the provider's content.
- Another content selection parameter may control whether third-party content to appear with the provider's content may be selected based on an interest category (e.g., the third-party content may be unrelated to the topic of the first-party content, but determined to be of relevance to a particular user).
- Other content selection parameters may allow or prevent content from specific third-party content providers, specific web addresses, specific websites, or the like.
- Content selection service 104 may be configured to determine performance metrics for a content provider.
- performance metrics may correspond to revenues earned by a first-party content provider.
- performance metrics may correspond to how users responded to third-party content selected by content selection service 104 .
- content selection service 104 may determine an impression count (e.g., how many times third-party content was presented), a click count (e.g., how many times the presented third-party content was clicked), a conversion count (e.g., how many times the clicked third-party content led to a sale or other desired online action), a click through rate (CTR), or a conversion rate (CVR).
- CTR click through rate
- CVR conversion rate
- performance metrics determined by content selection service 104 may be subdivided according to any number of different traffic characteristics.
- Potential traffic characteristics for the performance metrics may include, but are not limited to, the geographic locations of devices accessing the content, the types of devices accessing the content (e.g., mobile devices, tablet devices, desktop devices, etc.), the particular configuration of the devices accessing the content (e.g., operating systems, hardware settings, etc.), interest categories used to select the third-party content, the times in which the content is accessed (e.g., broken down by minute, hour, day, week, month, etc.), predicted information about the users accessing the content, combinations thereof, or the like.
- the geographic locations of devices accessing the content e.g., the types of devices accessing the content (e.g., mobile devices, tablet devices, desktop devices, etc.), the particular configuration of the devices accessing the content (e.g., operating systems, hardware settings, etc.), interest categories used to select the third-party content, the times in which the content is accessed (e.g., broken down by minute, hour, day, week, month, etc.), predicted information about the users accessing the
- content selection service 104 may be configured to monitor the performance metrics of a content provider across any number of different traffic characteristics or other classifications used to subdivide the performance metrics. For example, content selection service 104 may monitor the revenues earned by a first-party content provider broken down by the different device types that access content from the provider (e.g., revenues for mobile devices, revenues for desktop devices, etc.). In one implementation, content selection service 104 may detect a change in the relationships between the subdivided performance metrics. For example, content selection service 104 may determine that the revenues of the provider attributable to devices located in the United States have overtaken the revenues of the provider attributable to devices located in India.
- content selection service 104 may predict whether a change in performance metrics across one or more traffic characteristics will continue. For example, content selection service 104 may determine whether a shift in the provider's revenues is likely to continue or is a temporary shift. Content selection service 104 may also generate and provide a notification to a content provider if a shift is detected in the performance metrics of the provider. For example, content selection service 104 may provide a notification to a device of a content provider indicating that mobile revenues have surpassed desktop revenues and that the trend is predicted to continue. Such a notification may be used by the content provider to tailor the provider's content accordingly or on a purely informational basis. For example, a first-party content provider may optimize his or her website for mobile devices if the provider's revenues have shifted towards an emphasis on mobile devices.
- content selection service 104 may generate a notification based on an action or event associated with a content provider.
- An action or event triggering the monitoring of performance metrics by content selection service 104 may include changes made to the provider's account (e.g., by changing content selection parameters in the provider's account), changes made to the provider's content (e.g., by redesigning the provider's website), or the like.
- Content selection service 104 may monitor any performance metric changes subsequent to the action or event in response to a request from the provider to do so (e.g., the provider elects to receive notifications) or automatically in response to the action or event.
- content selection service 104 may generate and provide a notification to the provider regarding the performance change. For example, content selection service 104 may generate a notification for a first-party content provider indicating that the provider's revenues have dropped by a certain amount or percentage as a result of the provider blocking certain types of third-party content from appearing on the provider's website.

- search result 208 may be the “most relevant” result, because of its position at the top of web page 200 .
- Content item 210 provides additional information and more opportunities to purchase “stuff.”
- Content items 206 , 210 may be selected by content selection service 104 based on associated bid amounts. For example, a content item provider may select/bid an amount that they would be willing to pay for each impression, click, engagement, etc. of a content item, i.e., an amount each time a user clicks on the content item.
- the position of content items 206 , 210 may be selected by content selection service 104 based on their quality score. For example, the location at the top of web page 200 , which includes content item 206 , may be associated with the “most relevant” content item according to the quality score, while the location at the side of web page 200 , which includes content item 210 , may be associated with “less relevant” content items, according to the quality score. In some implementations, the positioning of the content items 206 , 210 may be associated with the quality, as measured by the quality score, of the content items 206 , 210 .
- FIG. 3A is a flow chart of a process 300 for selecting a content item based on an altered quality score, according to one implementation.
- Process 300 may begin by a request for a content item being obtained (step 302 ).
- the request for the content item may be from a client device and provided to content selection service 104 .
- the request for the content item includes a factor.
- the factor may be determined based on assessing positive and negative components.
- Such components may include the relevancy of a keyword, a content item provider's landing page, or the content item.
- the content provider's landing page transparency, navigability and speed are also components in the assessment of quality. For example, if the content on the content provider's landing page is duplicative or spam, then this can lead to a negative assessment of quality.
- the relationship between the bandwidth, the loading speed of the web page, and the content item size, type (e.g., flash, high-definition, etc.), etc. may also be assessed for quality. For example, a user having a slow Internet connection may click on a content item that directs them to the content provider's landing web page, which includes images, videos, third-party scripts (e.g., analytics, social networking links, other content items), etc.
- This landing web page uses a large amount of bandwidth, therefore, the content provider may have to increase the bid amount to provide a content item. Therefore, the relationship, in this example, is a negative component. In this example, if the user had a fast Internet connection, then the relationship may have been a positive component or not had an impact on the quality score.
- Other components may include, but are not limited to, a click-through rate of the content item, the size of the content item, the overall historical keyword performance, the pagerank of the content item provider's landing page, etc.
- the selection of the content item may be based on the altered quality score (step 306 ).
- the altered quality score may be used to determine the rank of the content item.
- the content item may be placed among other content items in order of increasing to decreasing rank.
- the position of the content item on the web page that is displayed to a user may be determined by multiplying the maximum cost per click, cost per impression, cost per engagement, cost per conversion, etc. by the quality score.
- FIG. 3B is a flow chart for a process 310 for determining the factor used to alter the quality score, according to one implementation.
- Process 300 may begin by a request for a content item being obtained (step 302 ).
- the request for the content item may be from a client device and provided to content selection service 104 .
- the request for the content item includes a factor.
- the factor may be discounted, based on the bandwidth of the user vs. the speed of the landing page of the content item provider, i.e., how fast the landing page loads on the user's device.
- the landing page of the advertiser may be determined, either dynamically or historically.
- the content selection service may receive the content item request via a third party module (at step 314 ).
- the third party module may determine the speed of the landing page at real-time when the content item request is received by the content selection service or may access a database to retrieve the speed of the landing page.
- the discount may be calculated each time a content item request is received.
- the discount may be determined based on a threshold, such as comparing the landing speed of the web page to other landing page speeds by retrieving the speeds from a database, i.e., a look up table containing various multipliers. For example, if the landing speed of the web page exceeds a target speed by X, then the factor may be discounted by X. Therefore, if a bid amount specified by a content item provider is Y, then the bid amount may be discounted by X.
- the factor is then determined after the discounting and/or altering (at step 316 ).
- the factor may be determined by assigning weights to different assessments and combining the weights to determine the factor.
- the assessments may be combined, weighted, etc. in any manner.
- the positive and negative assessments may be added together to determine the factor.
- Certain assessment values may be multiplied by a corresponding weight and the resulting values totaled to determine the factor.
- the factor is then applied to the quality score to determine the content item to serve to the user.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of a process for providing a content item to a user based on a quality score, according to one implementation.
- Process 400 generally includes receiving, from a server, a request to provide a content item for display at a device (step 402 ), calculating, by one or more processors, a quality score for the content item based on a loading speed of a web page, a bandwidth of a channel between a content source and the device, and a size of the content item (step 404 ); based on the quality score, selecting the content item for presentation on the device (step 406 ).
- process 400 includes receiving, at a server, a request to provide a content item for display at a device (step 402 ).
- the request may accompany a request for web page content to be displayed with the content item at the device, such as a search query.

For example, these factors are included in the quality score in real time, not just historical averages of the loading speed of the web page.
- the user's device and its connection may be detected in real time. For example, if the user's device has a fast connection, but the device is also downloading, streaming, sharing the connection, etc., the quality score may be affected.
- the quality score may be provided to a content item auction.
- the content item auction also receives a bid amount, e.g., an amount the content provider is willing to pay for each interaction with the content item.

Abstract
A method for providing a content item for display based on a relationship between a loading speed of a web page, a bandwidth of a channel between a content source and a device, and a size of the content item including receiving, from a server, a request to provide a content item for display at a device. The method further includes calculating, by one or more processors, a quality score for the content item based on a loading speed of a web page, a bandwidth of a channel between a content source and the device, and a size of the content item. The method also includes, based on the quality score, selecting the content item for presentation on the device.
Description
A content item may be selected to be displayed to a user based on its success in a content item auction. The content item auction uses several measurements, such as quality score and bid amount to determine which content item to display. The methods and systems described herein ensure that a relevant content item is provided to the user.
One implementation disclosed herein is a method. The method includes receiving, from a server, a request to provide a content item for display at a device. The method further includes calculating, by one or more processors, a quality score for the content item based on a loading speed of a web page, a bandwidth of a channel between a content source and the device, and a size of the content item. The method also includes, based on the quality score, selecting the content item for presentation on the device.
Another implementation disclosed herein is a system including one or more processors configured to receive a request to provide a content item for display at a device. The one or more processors may also be configured to calculate a quality score for the content item based on a loading speed of a web page, a bandwidth of a channel between a content source and the device, and a size of the content item. The one or more processors may further be configured to, based on the quality score, select the content item for presentation on the device.
In yet a further implementation disclosed herein is a computer-readable storage medium having machine instructions stored therein, the instructions being executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform operations. The operations may include receiving a request to provide a content item for display at a device. The operations may also include calculating a quality score for the content item based on a loading speed of a web page, a bandwidth of a channel between a content source and the device, and a size of the content item. The operations may further include, based on the quality score, selecting the content item for presentation on the device.
The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims, in which:
The quality score measures a variety of factors to determine the ranking and pricing of a content item (e.g., an advertisement). Therefore, the factors are used to provide relevant content items to a user.
These factors may include the device of the user, the Internet capabilities of the device, the loading speed of a content provider's webpage (e.g., an advertiser's landing page), etc. The relationship between these factors may also be used to determine the quality score. For example, the bandwidth, connection and so forth of a user's device may change the loading speed of the web page, which can alter the experience the user has with the web page. For example, if a web page includes high quality images or flash-based images, then, the web page may slowly load on the user's device if it is a mobile phone. In this case, the quality score may be low due to the user's device. Therefore, the relationship between the bandwidth and the loading speed of the web page should be determined and provided as a factor for the quality score.
Referring to FIG. 1 , a block diagram of a computer system 100 in accordance with a described implementation is shown. System 100 includes a client device 102 which communicates with other computing devices via a network 106. Client device 102 may execute a web browser or other application (e.g., a video game, a messenger program, a media player, a social networking application, etc.) to retrieve content from other devices over network 106. For example, client device 102 may communicate with any number of content sources 108, 110 (e.g., a first content source through nth content source). Content sources 108, 110 may provide webpage data and/or other content, such as images, video, and audio, to client device 102. Computer system 100 may also include a content selection service 104 configured to select third-party content to be provided to client device 102. For example, content source 108 may provide a first-party webpage to client device 102 that includes additional third-party content selected by content selection service 104.
Network 106 may be any form of computer network that relays information between client device 102, content sources 108, 110, and content selection service 104. For example, network 106 may include the Internet and/or other types of data networks, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a cellular network, satellite network, or other types of data networks. Network 106 may also include any number of computing devices (e.g., computer, servers, routers, network switches, etc.) that are configured to receive and/or transmit data within network 106. Network 106 may further include any number of hardwired and/or wireless connections. For example, client device 102 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radio, etc.) with a transceiver that is hardwired (e.g., via a fiber optic cable, a CAT6 cable, etc.) to other computing devices in network 106.
According to various implementations, any of content sources 108, 110 may provide first-party webpage data to client device 102 that includes one or more content tags. In general, a content tag refers to any piece of webpage code associated with the action of including third-party content with a first-party webpage. For example, a content tag may define a slot on a webpage for third-party content, a slot for out of page third-party content (e.g., an interstitial slot), whether third-party content should be loaded asynchronously or synchronously, whether the loading of third-party content should be disabled on the webpage, whether third-party content that loaded unsuccessfully should be refreshed, the network location of a content source that provides the third-party content (e.g., content sources 108, 110, content selection service 104, etc.), a network location (e.g., a URL) associated with clicking on the third-party content, how the third-party content is to be rendered on a display, a command that causes client device 102 to set a browser cookie (e.g., via a pixel tag that sets a cookie via an image request), one or more keywords used to retrieve the third-party content, and other functions associated with providing third-party content with a first-party webpage. For example, content source 108 may serve first-party webpage data to client device 102 that causes client device 102 to retrieve third-party content from content selection service 104. In another implementation, content may be selected by content selection service 104 and provided by content source 108 as part of the first-party webpage data sent to client device 102. In a further example, content selection service 104 may cause client device 102 to retrieve third-party content from a specified location, such as memory 114 or content sources 108, 110.
In some implementations, content selection service 104 may be configured to select content based on a device identifier associated with client device 102. In general, a device identifier refers to any form of data that may be used to represent a device or software that receives content selected by content selection service 104. In some implementations, a device identifier may be associated with one or more other device identifiers (e.g., a device identifier for a mobile device, a device identifier for a home computer, etc.). Device identifiers may include, but are not limited to, cookies, device serial numbers, user profile data, or network addresses. For example, a cookie set on client device 102 may be used to identify client device 102 to content selection service 104.
For situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about a user, or may make use of personal information, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control which programs or features collect such information, the types of information that may be collected (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, a user's current location, etc.), and/or how third-party content may be selected by content selection service 104 and presented to the user. Certain data, such as a device identifier, may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters) used by content selection service 104 to select third-party content. For example, a device identifier for client device 102 may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information about its corresponding user can be determined by content selection service 104 from it. In another example, a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a precise location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user of client device 102 may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by content selection service 104.
If the user of client device 102 has elected to allow content selection service 104 to use information regarding him or her, content selection service 104 may use history data associated with a device identifier to select relevant content for the corresponding user. History data may be any data associated with a device identifier that is indicative of an online event (e.g., visiting a webpage, interacting with presented content, conducting a search, making a purchase, downloading content, etc.). Based in part on the analyzed history data, content selection service 104 may select third-party content to be provided in conjunction with first-party content (e.g., as part of a displayed webpage, as a pop-up, within a video game, within another type of application, etc.). Additional data associated with a device identifier may include, but is not limited to, the device type of client device 102 (e.g., whether client device 102 is a desktop or mobile device), the location of client device 102, or a search query generated by client device 102. For example, content selection service 104 may select third-party content to be provided as part of a first-party webpage or in conjunction with search results from one of content sources 108, 110.
A campaign or other grouping of third-party content created via content selection service 104 may also include selection parameters that control when a bid is placed on behalf of a third-party content provider in a content auction. Any specified content selection parameters may be stored as part of the account of the provider. If the third-party content is to be presented in conjunction with search results from a search engine, for example, the content selection parameters may include one or more sets of search keywords. For example, the third-party content provider may only participate in content auctions in which a search query for “golf resorts in California” is sent to a search engine. Other content selection parameters that control when a bid is placed on behalf of a third-party content provider may include, but are not limited to, a topic identified using a device identifier's history data (e.g., based on webpages visited by the device identifier), the topic of a webpage or other first-party content with which the third-party content is to be presented, a geographic location of the client device that will be presenting the content (e.g., a zip code, city, state, country, etc.), a geographic location specified as part of a search query, or a device type (e.g., mobile devices, desktop devices, tablet devices, etc.). In some cases, a selection parameter may designate a specific webpage, website, or group of websites with which the third-party content is to be presented. For example, an advertiser selling golf equipment may specify that they wish to place an advertisement on the sports page of an particular online newspaper.
An account of a first-party content provider in content selection service 104 may also include any number of content selection parameters that control which third-party content is eligible for presentation with the content from the first-party provider. For example, a first-party content provider may specify to content selection service 104 the topics of third-party content eligible for selection for the provider's content. Another content selection parameter may control whether third-party content to appear with the provider's content may be selected based on an interest category (e.g., the third-party content may be unrelated to the topic of the first-party content, but determined to be of relevance to a particular user). Other content selection parameters may allow or prevent content from specific third-party content providers, specific web addresses, specific websites, or the like.
In some implementations, content selection service 104 may be configured to monitor the performance metrics of a content provider across any number of different traffic characteristics or other classifications used to subdivide the performance metrics. For example, content selection service 104 may monitor the revenues earned by a first-party content provider broken down by the different device types that access content from the provider (e.g., revenues for mobile devices, revenues for desktop devices, etc.). In one implementation, content selection service 104 may detect a change in the relationships between the subdivided performance metrics. For example, content selection service 104 may determine that the revenues of the provider attributable to devices located in the United States have overtaken the revenues of the provider attributable to devices located in India. In some implementations, content selection service 104 may predict whether a change in performance metrics across one or more traffic characteristics will continue. For example, content selection service 104 may determine whether a shift in the provider's revenues is likely to continue or is a temporary shift. Content selection service 104 may also generate and provide a notification to a content provider if a shift is detected in the performance metrics of the provider. For example, content selection service 104 may provide a notification to a device of a content provider indicating that mobile revenues have surpassed desktop revenues and that the trend is predicted to continue. Such a notification may be used by the content provider to tailor the provider's content accordingly or on a purely informational basis. For example, a first-party content provider may optimize his or her website for mobile devices if the provider's revenues have shifted towards an emphasis on mobile devices.
In one implementation, content selection service 104 may generate a notification based on an action or event associated with a content provider. An action or event triggering the monitoring of performance metrics by content selection service 104 may include changes made to the provider's account (e.g., by changing content selection parameters in the provider's account), changes made to the provider's content (e.g., by redesigning the provider's website), or the like. Content selection service 104 may monitor any performance metric changes subsequent to the action or event in response to a request from the provider to do so (e.g., the provider elects to receive notifications) or automatically in response to the action or event. If a change in the provider's performance metrics is detected and attributable to the triggering action or event, content selection service 104 may generate and provide a notification to the provider regarding the performance change. For example, content selection service 104 may generate a notification for a first-party content provider indicating that the provider's revenues have dropped by a certain amount or percentage as a result of the provider blocking certain types of third-party content from appearing on the provider's website.
As shown in FIG. 2 , web page 200 may include a query input field 204 and a search button 204. The entry of a query into field 204 along with a selection of button 204 causes a query to be submitted to a search engine/content provider. The content provider or search engine provides web page 200. As shown in FIG. 2 , web page 200 includes search result 208.
The position of content items 206, 210 may be selected by content selection service 104 based on their quality score. For example, the location at the top of web page 200, which includes content item 206, may be associated with the “most relevant” content item according to the quality score, while the location at the side of web page 200, which includes content item 210, may be associated with “less relevant” content items, according to the quality score. In some implementations, the positioning of the content items 206, 210 may be associated with the quality, as measured by the quality score, of the content items 206, 210.
The factor may be determined based on assessing positive and negative components. Such components may include the relevancy of a keyword, a content item provider's landing page, or the content item. The content provider's landing page transparency, navigability and speed are also components in the assessment of quality. For example, if the content on the content provider's landing page is duplicative or spam, then this can lead to a negative assessment of quality.
The relationship between the bandwidth, the loading speed of the web page, and the content item size, type (e.g., flash, high-definition, etc.), etc. may also be assessed for quality. For example, a user having a slow Internet connection may click on a content item that directs them to the content provider's landing web page, which includes images, videos, third-party scripts (e.g., analytics, social networking links, other content items), etc. This landing web page uses a large amount of bandwidth, therefore, the content provider may have to increase the bid amount to provide a content item. Therefore, the relationship, in this example, is a negative component. In this example, if the user had a fast Internet connection, then the relationship may have been a positive component or not had an impact on the quality score.
Other components may include, but are not limited to, a click-through rate of the content item, the size of the content item, the overall historical keyword performance, the pagerank of the content item provider's landing page, etc.
The selection of the content item may be based on the altered quality score (step 306). The altered quality score may be used to determine the rank of the content item. The content item may be placed among other content items in order of increasing to decreasing rank. The position of the content item on the web page that is displayed to a user may be determined by multiplying the maximum cost per click, cost per impression, cost per engagement, cost per conversion, etc. by the quality score.
In another example, the factor may be discounted, based on the bandwidth of the user vs. the speed of the landing page of the content item provider, i.e., how fast the landing page loads on the user's device. The landing page of the advertiser may be determined, either dynamically or historically. For example, the content selection service may receive the content item request via a third party module (at step 314). The third party module may determine the speed of the landing page at real-time when the content item request is received by the content selection service or may access a database to retrieve the speed of the landing page.
The discount may be calculated each time a content item request is received. In another implementation, the discount may be determined based on a threshold, such as comparing the landing speed of the web page to other landing page speeds by retrieving the speeds from a database, i.e., a look up table containing various multipliers. For example, if the landing speed of the web page exceeds a target speed by X, then the factor may be discounted by X. Therefore, if a bid amount specified by a content item provider is Y, then the bid amount may be discounted by X.
The factor is then determined after the discounting and/or altering (at step 316). In some implementations, the factor may be determined by assigning weights to different assessments and combining the weights to determine the factor. The assessments may be combined, weighted, etc. in any manner. The positive and negative assessments may be added together to determine the factor. Certain assessment values may be multiplied by a corresponding weight and the resulting values totaled to determine the factor. The factor is then applied to the quality score to determine the content item to serve to the user.
Referring to FIG. 4 , and in more detail, process 400 includes receiving, at a server, a request to provide a content item for display at a device (step 402). In some implementations, the request may accompany a request for web page content to be displayed with the content item at the device, such as a search query. For example, the user may provide a search query into a search engine. The web browser may provide the search query to a search engine associated with the server. The request for the content and the content item may include one or more keywords. For example, the content may be tagged with one or more keywords such that the keywords describe the content. The keyword may be used to select the content item that is responsive to the keyword or that includes the keyword.
Referring to FIG. 4 , and in more detail, process 400 includes calculating, by one or more processors, a quality score for the content item based on a loading speed of a web page, a bandwidth of a channel between a content source and the device, and a size of the content item (step 404).
In some implementations, the quality score measures a quality and relevance of the content item. The quality score may measure how relevant, transparent, and navigable the web page is to the user. The web page may be the landing page that is owned by the content provider. In another implementation, the web page may be hosted by a publisher.
The quality score may also measure the relationship between the loading speed of the web page, the bandwidth of the channel between the content source and the device, and a size of the content item. The quality score may also measure other factors that affect the loading speed of the web page such as, but not limited to, bandwidth throttling, network congestion, rate limiting, etc.
The device may be any electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving data over the network. The device may include a web browser that sends/receives the data over the network, such as requesting the content (web page) and the content item. The bandwidth of the device along with its connection speed may be determined for purposes of the quality score. The speed of the device in relation to the bandwidth necessary to present the content item may also be determined for purposes of the quality score.
The loading speed of the web page and the bandwidth of the channel between the content source and the device may be determined when the request for content and the request to provide the content item is received. For example, these factors are included in the quality score in real time, not just historical averages of the loading speed of the web page. In addition, the user's device and its connection may be detected in real time. For example, if the user's device has a fast connection, but the device is also downloading, streaming, sharing the connection, etc., the quality score may be affected.
The quality score may be provided to a content item auction. The content item auction also receives a bid amount, e.g., an amount the content provider is willing to pay for each interaction with the content item. The interaction may be a click, a conversion, an engagement, an impression, etc. The content provider may select the bid amount based on the impact of the relationship between the loading speed of the web page, the bandwidth, and the content item on the quality score.
Referring to FIG. 4 , and in more detail, process 400 includes based on the quality score, selecting the content item for presentation on the device (step 406). In some implementations, the quality score may be multiplied by the bid amount (e.g., cost per click, cost per conversion, etc.) to determine the rank, price, etc. of the content item within the content item auction. Along with this determination, a keyword included in web page content (e.g., search query) may be used to select the content item that is responsive to that keyword. If more than one content item matches the keyword, then the rank/price, etc. may be used to determine which content item to present on the device.
