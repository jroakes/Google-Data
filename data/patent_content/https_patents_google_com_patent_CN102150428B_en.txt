Abstract
A method for decoding compressed video information is disclosed. The video information can include a plurality of frames each having a plurality of blocks. The method includes reading from the video information a segment map that associates blocks in the frame with four segment identifiers. Each segment identifier is associated with one or more segment parameters, such as quantization parameters, loop filter type, loop filter strength and sub-pixel interpolation filter. The blocks in each segment are then decoded using the associated segment parameters. Segment parameters can persist to following frames unless overwritten by a subsequent frame. A frame can also include a bit suppressing segmentation, in which case default parameters are sued for all blocks in the frame.

Embodiment
Video compression typically refers to the data volume that reduces the expression vision signal by some redundant information in permanent elimination vision signal.Compression may need to meet various constraints, for example comprises bandwidth or storage demand.The example of this type of compression standard comprises MPEG and H.264.
Block-based video compression for example operates the neighbor group (being commonly referred to macro block) of solid shape.For example, H.264 standard has been specified the macro block of 16 * 16 pixels.Usually, each frame of video can be divided into some macro blocks, and wherein each macro block comprises the piece of a plurality of smaller szies.These pixel groups in macro block and piece compare with the data that find in present frame or the data that find in other frames, in order to formulate prediction data and rub-out signal.
Then for example use discrete cosine transform (DCT) to carry out conversion for the rub-out signal of each piece.The conversion coefficient that produces for each piece is quantized then, and the coefficient through quantizing is then according to such as the encoding scheme of context adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC), encoding.
The degree that conversion coefficient quantizes is called quantization level, and its impact is used for the number of bit of presentation video data and the quality of the decoded picture that produces.Usually, when the quantification rank was set to high value, more coefficient was set to 0, and this produces larger compression, but had also reduced the quality of image.On the contrary, when the quantification rank was set to lower value, less coefficient was set to 0, and but this produces improved picture quality has less compression.
Because the visual quality of video may depend on quantization level and how distribute in all frames of video sequence, the quantization level of controlling between every frame is useful.Some technology are applied uniform quantization level between every frame at present.Yet these technology do not allow to have the lower quantization level of part (such as people's face) application of higher visual importance in frame.Similarly, these uniform quantization rank technology do not allow to have the higher quantization level of part (such as background area) application of low visual importance in frame yet.
, in order to overcome these difficulties, may expect effectively to select for the quantization level of each macro block and not increase expense and the computation complexity of encoder/decoder.
Blocking effect shows as the discontinuity between contiguous block.This discontinuity is that vision is disturbed, and has also reduced the frame that will the rebuild validity as the fallout predictor for subsequent frame.
In order to remove these discontinuities, can be to the frame application loop filtering of rebuilding during reconstruction path, this will discuss hereinafter in further detail.The selection of loop filter and loop filter intensity can produce significant impact for picture quality.Too strong filter may cause the fuzzy of details and loss.Too weak filter may be not enough to suppress the discontinuity between adjacent block.
Therefore, described herein and be used for effectively transmitting the execution mode of effective adaptive segmentation scheme of piecewise graph and parameter set, wherein parameter set is such as the quantization level that will be applied to each segmentation in piecewise graph and loop filter type and/or intensity.
Although described the embodiment of adaptive segmentation innovation in the context of VP8 video code model, alternate embodiment of the present invention can realize in the context of other video coding algorithms.
Fig. 1 is the block diagram according to the generic video encoder 14 of the use loop filter 34 of one embodiment of the present invention.With reference to figure 1, for input video stream 16 is encoded, encoder 14 is carried out following function in order to produce encoded bit stream 26 in forward path (by the solid line connecting line, being illustrated): in frame/inter prediction 18, conversion 19, quantize 22 and entropy coding 24.Encoder 14 also comprises for the reconstruction path (by dotted line connecting line illustrated) of reconstruction frames so that other macro blocks are encoded.Encoder 14 is carried out following function in reconstruction path: go to quantize 28, inverse transformation 30, rebuild 32 and loop filtering 34.Other structural variant of encoder 14 also can be used for bit stream 26 is encoded.
With reference to figure 1, when providing input video stream 16 to be used for coding, each frame in input video stream 16 can be processed take macro block as unit.In frame/and the inter prediction stage 18, can use intra prediction mode or inter-frame forecast mode to encode to each macro block.In either case, can form predicted macroblock based on the frame of rebuilding.In the situation that infra-frame prediction can form predicted macroblock according to the sample that has been encoded before in present frame and rebuild.In the situation that inter prediction, can according to such as encoded and rebuild before or frame in the future one or more reference frames form predicted macroblock.
Next, continue with reference to figure 1, can deduct predicted macroblock from current macro, to produce residual error macro block (residual error).19 pairs of residual errors of conversion stages are carried out transition coding, and 22 pairs of residual errors of quantization stage quantize to produce one group of conversion coefficient through quantizing.This conversion coefficient through quantizing carries out the entropy coding by entropy coding stage 24 then.Through the coefficient of entropy coding and required information that macro block is decoded (such as, the predictive mode type, motion vector and the quantizer values that use) be output to together the bit stream 26 of compression.
Provide the reconstruction path in Fig. 1 both can use the same reference frame of to macro block, decoding required with the permission encoder.Reconstruction path comprises by going 28 pairs of conversion coefficients of quantization stage to go quantize and by inverse transformation stage 30 pairs of coefficients, carry out inverse transformation, to produce the residual error macro block (derivation residual error) of deriving, this reconstruction path is similar to the function that occurs during the decode procedure of more describing in detail hereinafter.At phase of regeneration 32, predicted macroblock can be added to derives residual error to create the macro block of rebuilding.The macro block that loop filter 34 can be applied to rebuild is to reduce blocking effect.
With reference to figure 2, according to an execution mode, for the bit stream 26 to compression is decoded, similar with the reconstruction path of previously discussed encoder 14, decoder 21 is carried out following functions to produce outputting video streams 35: entropy decoding 25, go to quantize 27, in inverse transformation 29, frame/inter prediction 23, rebuild 31, loop filter 34 and block-eliminating effect filtering 33.Other structural variant of decoder 21 also can be used for the bit stream 26 of compression is decoded.
When the bit stream 26 that compression is provided was used for decoding, data element can carry out the entropy decoding by entropy decode phase 25, to produce one group of coefficient that quantizes.Go 27 pairs of coefficients of quantization stage to go to quantize, and inverse transformation stage 29 pairs of coefficients carry out inverse transformation, to produce the derivation residual error identical with the derivation residual error that phase of regeneration was created in encoder 14.In frame/and the inter prediction stage 23, decoder 21 uses the header information that decodes from the bit stream 26 of compression, creates the predicted macroblock identical with the predicted macroblock that creates in encoder 14.At phase of regeneration 31, predicted macroblock can be added to the derivation residual error, to create, rebuilds macro block.Loop filter 34 can be applied to rebuild macro block to reduce blocking effect.Block elimination effect filter 33 can be applied to rebuild macro block, and further to be reduced to the piece distortion, and result can export outputting video streams 35 to.
Fig. 3 shows reference frame 44,48 and the current present frame of encoding or decoding 36.As discussed previously, each frame can be processed take macro block as unit, and in frame/the inter prediction stage 18, each macro block can use intra prediction mode or inter-frame forecast mode to encode.For example, current macro 38 can use inter prediction to encode or decode according to the macro block 46 of the reference frame 44 from previous coding.Similarly, current macro 38 ' can use inter prediction to encode or decode according to the macro block 50 of the reference frame 48 from previous coding.And, for example, current macro 38 " can use infra-frame prediction to encode or decode according to the macro block 52 in present frame 36.
Fig. 4 A-Fig. 4 B shows the exemplary piecewise graph for sample frame according to embodiment of the present invention.
With reference to figure 4A, exemplary segmentation Figure 100 is segmented into four segmentations with frame 110: three prospect segmentations 112,114 and 116 and background segmentations 118.according to an embodiment of the invention, all macro blocks corresponding with prospect segmentation 112 (as shown in white macro block) use identical quantization level and loop filter type and/or intensity to encode, all macro blocks corresponding with prospect segmentation 114 (as shown in the black macro block) use identical quantization level and loop filter type and/or intensity to encode, all macro blocks corresponding with prospect segmentation 116 (as adding some points as shown in macro block) use identical quantization level and loop filter type and/or intensity to encode, all macro blocks corresponding with background segmentation 118 (as shown in the striped macro block) use identical quantization level and loop filter type and/or intensity to encode.Therefore, each segmentation can have different quantization levels and loop filter type and/or intensity.
When encoder 14 was encoded to the frame that comprises the view data with prospect imaging and background imaging, segmentation Figure 100 may be very useful, wherein the view data in prospect compare with the background imaging between frame and frame change more.Frame sequence can be included in three people's that talk previously in house face.Three faces are examples of prospect imaging, and house is the example of background imaging.Because video quality may be at prospect segmentation 112,114 and 116 places than more important at background segmentation 118 places, so can be to the lower quantization level of prospect segmentation 112,114 and 116 application and loop filter type and/or intensity preferably.
With reference to figure 4B, exemplary segmentation Figure 200 is segmented into two segmentations with frame 210: a body segment 212 and a boundary segmentation 214.According to an embodiment of the invention, all macro blocks corresponding with body segment 212 (as adding some points as shown in macro block) use identical quantization level and loop filter and/or intensity to encode, and with corresponding all macro blocks of boundary segmentation 214, use identical quantization level and loop filter type and/or intensity encode (as shown in white macro block).
Encoding while having the enlarged image sequence when encoder 14, segmentation Figure 200 may be very useful.Because video quality may be at body segment 212 places than more important at boundary segmentation 221 places, so can be to the lower quantization level of body segment 212 application and loop filter type and/or intensity preferably.
Fig. 4 A and Fig. 4 B only provide the example of piecewise graph.Other piecewise graphs that are fit to are also available, and for example it comprises the segmentation of arbitrary number, comprises the segmentation of equivalent size or unequal size, comprises continuous or discrete macro block, or set in advance in user-defined or encoder.
Enable/selection (that is, the segmentation condition) and the definition of piecewise graph of disable fragmentation can determine by encoder, by applications, imported into or by the user, specified.As an example, video conference application can import figure into so that definition people's the residing segmentation of head.
Fig. 5 is the flow chart according to the method for the segmentation of the control video data of one embodiment of the present invention.With reference to figure 5, in step 300, encoder 14 received frame inputs.In step 302, encoder 14 determines that then whether present frame is in the situation that the frame of with reference to any other frame except itself, not encoding, and this is commonly referred to key frame.If present frame is key frame, encoder 14 resets to 0 in step 304 with parameter, and at step 306 replacement piecewise graph, so as with all macroblock map to same segment.Parameter is for example quantization level and loop filter intensity.Encoder 14 proceeds to step 308 then.
If present frame is not key frame, if perhaps present frame is key frame and encoder 14 reset parameter and piecewise graph, then in step 308, encoder 14 determines whether segmentation enables.Comprise and enabling or the individual bit of disable fragmentation for the bit stream header of each frame.Yet, can replace a bit with any suitable sign, data structure or other data record.If segmentation is disabled, encoder 14 can be given tacit consent to quantization parameter to whole frame application in step 310, and in step 312, to whole frame application, gives tacit consent to the loop filter intensity parameters.
Segmentation parameter can be for example the selection of quantization level, loop filter type, loop filter intensity, reference frame type or subpixel interpolation filter.Other segmentation parameters are also available.
As an example, one of segmentation parameter can be the reference frame type.The reference frame type can have the value of one or more previous frames that indication has been encoded and rebuild, frame or its certain combination in the future.Therefore, the reference frame type for example can comprise last frame, gold frame or alternative reference frame.Last frame can be the frame of previous coding before present frame.The gold frame can be from optional past frame before for a long time, as the fallout predictor of subsequent frame.Alternative reference frame can comprise the arbitrary frame that is not last frame or gold frame.For example, alternative reference can be past frame, the reference frame of frame or structure in the future.In addition, for example, the reference frame that builds can be disclosed reference frame in a patent application that is called " System and Method for Video Encoding Using Constructed Reference Frame ", above-mentioned patent application is transferred to assignee of the present invention, itself and the present invention submit to simultaneously, are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Encoder 14 and decoder 21 then can in the one or more reference frames by segmentation parameter indication corresponding to those macro block application choice renewals of given segmentation id.By this way, segmentation can be used the method for upgrading the part (for example background) in one or more in reference frame from the information of present frame, and need to be by means of the complete renewal of whole reference frame.
Although the execution mode of adaptive segmentation innovation has only been described two segmentation parameters (being quantization level and loop filter intensity), alternate embodiment of the present invention can realize with the segmentation parameter of different segmentation parameters or arbitrary number.
If segmentation is disabled, encoder 14 also can be ignored the piecewise graph of any previous transmission and the segmentation parameter of any previous transmission.Binary system switching is enabled/is forbidden in this segmentation or the segmentation condition makes expense minimize, and for segmentation wherein, less benefit is provided or the frame of benefit is not provided, and for the expense of every frame, is no more than 1 bit.
Still with reference to figure 5, yet if segmentation is activated, in step 314, encoder 14 can determine whether segmentation parameter will upgrade.If indication is not upgraded segmentation parameter, in step 316, encoder 14 can use the segmentation parameter value of previous transmission.In other words, can not upgrade segmentation parameter for current video frame.The switching of this renewal segmentation parameter binary system is by in the situation that can be used for present frame from the segmentation parameter of previous frame and do not retransmit segmentation parameter expense is minimized.
If indicated segmentation parameter is upgraded, encoder 14 can upgrade segmentation parameter.Particularly, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention embodiment, can upgrade the quantization level parameter in step 318, and can upgrade the loop filter intensity parameters in step 320.Segmentation parameter value through upgrading can be absolute value, can be alternatively perhaps increment (that is, increase or the reduce) value of adding on fiducial value.If parameter value is increment, but can realize that clamp mechanism surpasses allowed band to prevent the segmentation parameter value.
Still, with reference to figure 5, no matter whether upgrade segmentation parameter in step 314, in step 322, encoder 14 can determine whether to upgrade segmentation Figure 100,200.Do not upgrade segmentation Figure 100,200 if indicated, in step 324, encoder 14 can use the piecewise graph of previous transmission.This renewal piecewise graph binary system switching does not retransmit segmentation Figure 100,200 in the time of can being used for present frame by the piecewise graph from previous frame minimizes expense.
If indicated, segmentation Figure 100,200 is upgraded, in step 326, encoder 14 can upgrade in the segment identifiers bit probability of happening of each.After having upgraded probability of happening, in step 328, encoder 14 can upgrade the segment identifiers for the macro block in present frame.Return to the 4A with reference to figure, for example, segment identifiers is associated each macro block with the particular fragments 112,114,116,118 in segmentation Figure 100.Therefore,, if there are four segmentations 112,114,116,118, can have four segment identifiers, it for example can be designated 00,01,10 and 11.The process of Fig. 5 can be carried out repetition for each frame that is received by encoder 14.
Being used for achieve frame level header information illustrates as follows with the exemplary pseudo-code of the renewal of the segmentation parameter of controlling adaptive segmentation and piecewise graph:
With reference to above-mentioned false code, be below variable and array and to the list of the meaning of embodiment of the present invention:
SegmentationEnabled: the binary system switching is enabled/is forbidden in segmentation.
UpdateMbSegmentationMap: piecewise graph upgrade/does not upgrade the binary system switching.
UpdateMbSegmentationParams: segmentation parameter upgrade/does not upgrade the binary system switching.
MbSegmentAbsOrDelta: the value of the segmentation parameter in indication SegmentFeatureData is increment size or the switching of the binary system of absolute value.
SegmentFeatureData[i] [j]: the value of segmentation parameter (for example, quantizer or loop filter intensity)
MbSegmentTreeProbs[i]: tree node probability (with reference to following Fig. 6).
, with reference to false code, the SegmentationEnabled variable can be programmed in bit stream and whether enable with the indication segmentation.If do not enable segmentation, segmentation parameter and piecewise graph do not upgrade, and as discussed previously, and encoder 14 and decoder 21 are ignored segmentation parameter or the piecewise graph of any previous transmission.Yet,, if enabled segmentation, can write the UpdateMbSegmentationParams bit to indicate whether upgrading segmentation parameter, and can write UpdateMbSegmentationMap to indicate whether upgrading piecewise graph.Also can replace bit with any suitable sign, data structure or other data record.
If UpdateMbSegmentationParams is true, the MbSegmentAbsOrDelta bit can be programmed in bit stream is increment size or absolute value with the indication segmentation parameter.Then, for be used for four segmentations each two segmentation parameters (namely, quantizer values and loop filter intensity) in each, can be with SegmentFeatureData[i] data in [j] are programmed in bit stream, it has respective symbol position (if any).Also can replace bit with any suitable sign, data structure or other data record.
If UpdateMbSegmentationMap is true, encoder 14 can be by testing MbSegmentTreeProbs[i] whether any value is arranged in array is 255 to determine whether to upgrade MbSegmentTreeProbs[i] in data., if it is 255 that a value is arranged in array, should not upgrade specific node probability.Otherwise, can be with MbSegmentTreeProbs[i] in each node probability be programmed in bit stream.
More the cost of new node probability can occur in the frame rank, and can be minimum.According to above-mentioned false code, depend on upgrade what probability, cost can be any one in every frame 3-27 bit., at the low cost end, when the condition indication should not upgraded any node probability, produce 3 bits.Correspondingly, encoder 14 can be carried out Writebit (0) operation three times., at expensive end, when the condition indication should be upgraded all three node probability, produce 27 bits.Correspondingly, encoder 14 can be carried out Writebit (1) operation three times, and with the one-tenth of each 8 bit, originally writes from MbSegmentTreeProbs[i] three probable values.
Alternatively, in one embodiment, if UpdateMbSegmentationMap is true, always will be from MbSegmentTreeProbs[i], cost is programmed in bit stream for whole three probability of each 8 bit cost with 24 bits.The exemplary pseudo-code that this execution mode is shown illustrates as follows:
Fig. 6 shows for the binary tree with particular result 406,408,410 and 412 probability occurring segment identifiers being encoded.Each result 406,408, four segment identifiers 00 of 410 and 412 expressions, one of 01,10 and 11.As described above, embodiments of the present invention can have the segment identifiers of different numbers.Depend on the segmentation number in each execution mode, with the binary tree of correspondingly revising in Fig. 6 so that expression to given number the segmentation needed probability number of encoding.So for example, if an execution mode comprises 8 segmentations, binary tree will comprise 7 probability of 7 different Nodes, in order to 8 particular result are encoded.
Each node 400,402 and 404 has the probability that is associated, and it for example defines the possibility that can adopt left branch.As shown in Figure 6, left branch is corresponding to the bit of expression 0, and right branch is corresponding to the bit of expression 1.The possibility that can adopt left branch is the probability of the value value that may represent corresponding to each node 400,402 and 404 places.Therefore, the probability 1 expression value at node 400 places may be less than 2 possibility.In other words, probability 1 expression result 406,408 contingent possibilities, because they have respectively binary value 00 and binary value 01, it is less than 2.Formula 1-probability 1 can be used for the contingent possibility of right branch of computing node 400.In other words, 1-probability 1 expression result 410,412 contingent possibilities, because they have respectively binary value 10 and binary value 11, it is greater than 2.
The probability 2 expression values at node 402 places may equal 0 possibility.In other words, the probability 2 contingent possibilities of expression result 406, because it has binary value 00, it equals 0.Formula 1-probability 2 can be used for the contingent possibility of right branch of computing node 402.In other words, the 1-probability 2 contingent possibilities of expression result 408, because it has binary value 01, it is not equal to 0.
The probability 3 expression values at node 404 places may equal 2 possibility.In other words, the probability 3 contingent possibilities of expression result 410, because it has binary value 10, it equals 2.Formula 1-probability 3 can be used for the contingent possibility of right branch of computing node 404.In other words, the 1-probability 3 contingent possibilities of expression result 412, because it has binary value 11, it is not equal to 2.
Probability for example can be expressed as the integer in the 1-254 scope, and wherein 1 each node 400 of expression, 402 and 404 left branch least may occur, and 254 each node 400 of expression, 402 and 404 left branch most probable occur.Each probability has reflected the number that is assigned to the macro block of each segmentation.Therefore, if most of macro block is assigned to segmentation 00, probability 1 and probability 2 may be higher.Probability also can represent with different scopes or value, and can represent other implications, such as the possibility that may adopt right branch.
There are various types of encoding schemes, such as arithmetic coding or Huffman (Huffman) coding.Because arithmetic coding changes whole message sequence into a number, and huffman coding changes each symbol of message into a series of numerals, so arithmetic coding may be more efficient than huffman coding.Therefore, can use arithmetic coding in the preferred embodiment of the present invention.Can use other encoding schemes of being similar to huffman coding or the combination of encoding scheme in alternate embodiment of the present invention.
Arithmetic encoder can be used for use three probability each encode to 0 or 1 or at entropy decode phase 25 (referring to Fig. 2), to 0 or 1, decode in entropy coding stages 24 (referring to Fig. 1), in order to represent one of four segment identifiers.Arithmetic coding generally includes the single floating-point that message sequence is expressed as in given range and exports number.Usually, this scope can be from 0 to 1 probability line.Each symbol in message sequence (being segment identifiers) can be by the occupation probability line the scope of a part represent.If symbol has high probability, it can hold on the probability line in a big way, and if symbol has low probability, its can hold on the probability line more among a small circle.
During encoding, can formulate for the real number that represents message sequence based on the scope that each symbol falls into.Along with each symbol in message is processed, scope can be contracted to the part of distributing to this symbol., along with message becomes longer, it is represented that needed scope becomes less, and specify the needed bit number of this scope to increase.More possible symbol (that is, having the symbol of high probability) reduces less scope than more impossible symbol (that is, having the symbol of low probability), and adds less bit to message thus.
Return with reference to figure 6, if will encode to each segment identifiers independently, it can be the cost of each segment identifiers 2 bit.Yet, use above-mentioned arithmetic coding scheme, if used whole four segment identifiers, but some identifiers have higher probability than other identifiers, the average unit cost of encoded segment identifier may be much smaller than 2 bits.Be less than four segment identifiers if use, the cost of each segment identifiers of encoding may be still less.
The flow chart of the method that Fig. 7 encodes according to one embodiment of the present invention, to the segment identifiers for each macro block.In step 500, encoder 14 first macro blocks are set to ID and equal 1.ID represents current macro block identification number of encoding in frame.
Then, in step 502, encoder 14 determines whether segmentation enables., if segmentation is not enabled, for this macro block, segment identifiers is not encoded.If segmentation has been activated, in step 504, encoder 14 determines whether piecewise graph will upgrade., if not yet indicate the renewal to piecewise graph, for this macro block, new segment identifiers is not encoded, and can use previous piecewise graph in coding.
Yet,, if indicated renewal to piecewise graph, can come to assign segmentation ID for it in the position in piecewise graph based on macro block.Therefore, in step 506, encoder 14 determines whether will have the macroblock map of identification number ID to segmentation 0.If the macroblock map that will have identification number ID is to segmentation 0, in step 508, encoder 14 is encoded to segmentation 0 (Binary Zero 0) for the macro block with identification number ID.If will not have the macroblock map of identification number ID to segmentation 0, in step 510, encoder 14 determines whether will have the macroblock map of identification number ID to segmentation 1.If the macroblock map that will have identification number ID is to segmentation 1, in step 512, encoder 14 is encoded to segmentation 1 (Binary Zero 1) for the macro block with identification number ID.If will not have the macroblock map of identification number ID to segmentation 1, in step 514, encoder 14 determines whether will have the macroblock map of identification number ID to segmentation 2.If the macroblock map that will have identification number ID is to segmentation 2, in step 516, encoder 14 is encoded to segmentation 2 (binary one 0) for the macro block with identification number ID.If will not have the macroblock map of identification number ID to segmentation 2, in step 518, encoder 14 is encoded to segmentation 3 (binary one 1) for the macro block with identification number ID.
In case in step 508,512,516 or 518, for macro block, segment identifiers has been encoded, in step 520, whether encoder 14 determines ID less than NUM_OF_MBS, the macro block sum in its expression present frame., if ID is not less than the macro block sum, do not have more segment identifiers to encode for each macro block in present frame.Otherwise, if ID less than NUM_OF_MBS, in step 522, encoder 14 increases by 1 with ID, and repeats this process, until for present frame, all macro block segment identifiers are encoded.
The exemplary pseudo-code of step that is used for realizing the method for Fig. 7 illustrates as follows:
, with reference to above false code,, for each macro block in frame,, if segmentation is activated and piecewise graph upgrades, for example use EncodeBit (value, probability) function to encode to segment identifiers., by the EncodeBit function being carried out calling for twice in encoder, for each macro block, segment identifiers is encoded.To in the calling of EncodeBit function at every turn, encoder is by using one of three " probability " values as the context for cataloged procedure, input bit " value " to be encoded, and it is 0 or 1.These three probable values are appointed as the array of three values that are called MbSegmentTreeProbs.Context provides the guide of the probability distribution of each segment identifiers for encoder, this probability distribution depends on that it appears at the possibility size in list entries.
Above-mentioned exemplary pseudo-code is to support the realization of four segment identifiers.As mentioned above, the segmentation of other numbers can be supported, and false code can be correspondingly revised to represent correct segmentation number.In addition, exemplary pseudo-code is not intended to be limited to any certain programmed language and realization thereof.Be appreciated that multiple programming language and realization thereof can be used for realizing the instruction of embodiments of the present invention described here.
Although in conjunction with particular implementation, described the present invention, but be appreciated that, the invention is not restricted to disclosed execution mode, on the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included in the spirit and scope of the appended claims, this scope is intended to meet the most wide in range explanation, in order to comprise all this type of modification and equivalent structures that allow according to law.
