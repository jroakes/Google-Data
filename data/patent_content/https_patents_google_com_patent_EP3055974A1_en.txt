Definitions
- Hazard detectors use sensors to detect substances in the air that may be harmful or that may indicate the development of a hazardous situation.
- CO carbon monoxide
- radon gas are substances that can be harmful to humans and animals if exposed to high amounts.
- these substances are difficult to detect with the human senses because they are colorless, odorless, and tasteless.
- a hazard detector can detect the presence of these substances and prevent the harmful effects of exposure by alarming to notify a user.
- a substance such as smoke, while not necessarily harmful in and of itself, can indicate the development of a hazardous situation, such as fire. An early alarm of the presence of such a substance can prevent the hazardous situation from developing or minimize the harmful effects of the situation.
- Interconnected hazard detectors include detectors that are connected to a network, enabling communication between the detectors or with a central control unit. This provides several advantages over standalone detectors, including the ability to activate multiple alarms when a single detector is triggered.
- Hazard detectors may be certified under standards defined by governing bodies and/or by companies that perform safety testing, such as
- UL Underwriters Laboratories
- certain UL standards define thresholds for when smoke detectors and CO detectors should sound an alarm.
- Certain UL standards also define the required characteristics of the alarm, such as powering requirements and the volume, pitch, and pattern of the alarming sound.
- Embodiments of the invention provide methods and systems for facilitating the provisioning, set-up, configuration, control, and/or management of intelligent, network- connected, multi-sensing hazard detection units or smart hazard detectors.
- These smart hazard detectors may be used within a home, building, or structure to warn occupants of the home, building, or structure of a potential danger.
- a "pairing" of these network-connected smart hazard detectors and a user account on a cloud-based smart hazard detector management system or an online management account may be accomplished in a manner that reduces or minimizes an amount of user effort involved.
- Another smart hazard detector may communicate with the paired smart hazard detector using a second wireless protocol in order to receive instructions for pairing with the online management account.
- These smart hazard detectors may perform a variety of functions, e.g., generating visual effects associated with alerts (e.g., hazard detection alerts, status information alerts, and notification alerts).
- These smart hazard detectors may also receive requests to communicate and generate indicators associated with smart hazard detector status information, e.g., the Wi-Fi connection status of the smart hazard detector or the battery status of the hazard detector.
- a method for establishing a pairing between a smart- home hazard detector and an online management account established at a central server may be presented.
- the online management account may have an associated account identifier.
- the method may include instantiating, at a mobile computing device, an application designed for configuration and control of the hazard detector.
- the application may establish communication over the Internet with the central server.
- the method may also include receiving, at the mobile computing device, a first code from the central server.
- the method may additionally include receiving, at the mobile computing device, information derived from a printed surface on the hazard detector or a printed document or package physically accompanying the hazard detector at a setup location.
- the information may include a second code.
- the method may further include broadcasting, by the hazard detector, a Wi-Fi access point SSID hosted by the hazard detector.
- the method may also include receiving, at the mobile computing device, a selection of said access point SSID from a user and establishing a corresponding Wi-Fi connection with the hazard detector.
- the Wi-Fi connection may be authenticated using the second code.
- the method may additionally include receiving, at the mobile computing device, an identity of a home Wi-Fi network through which the hazard detector is to access the Internet.
- the method may further include sending, from the mobile computing device to the hazard detector, the first code and the identity of said home Wi-Fi network.
- the method may also include establishing, by the hazard detector, data communications with the central server using the home Wi-Fi network.
- the method may additionally include transmitting, by the hazard detector to the central server, a transmission including the first code.
- the transmission may be authenticated by the central server using information fixably stored in a memory of said hazard detector at a time of manufacture.
- the pairing may be achieved by the central server by (i) validating a pre- established matching relationship using said second code, and (ii) upon the validation, associating said hazard detector with said account identifier.
- the printed surface on the hazard detector or the printed document or package physically accompanying the hazard detector at a setup location may include a Quick Response (QR) code that graphically encodes the second code.
- the method may also include receiving, at the mobile computing device, a location within an enclosure where the hazard detector is to be installed at the setup location; and transmitting, by the mobile computing device to the central server, the location to be stored at the online management account.
- the selected location may include a bedroom, a bathroom, a family room, a living room, a kids bedroom, a master bedroom, a guest bedroom or a dining room.
- the second code may be printed in an
- the method may also include providing, by the hazard detector, a verbal command instructing the user to provide a user input to the hazard detector to begin the process of establishing the pairing between the hazard detector and the online management account.
- the method may additionally include providing, by the hazard detector, a verbal command instructing the user to instantiate the application at the mobile device.
- the command may include an instruction to download the application from an online application marketplace.
- the method may further include receiving, at the mobile computing device, configuration information from the central server.
- the configuration information may include information that enables the hazard detector to establish or join a local device network that is 802.15.4-compatible.
- the method may also include deleting, from the mobile computing devices, the identity of the home Wi-Fi network after the identity of the home Wi-Fi network is sent to the hazard detector.
- the method may also include transmitting, by the hazard detector to the central server, authentication information that is generated using a cryptographic key and/or certificate stored on the hazard detector during a manufacturing or post-manufacturing process.
- a system for establishing a pairing between a smart- home hazard detector and an online management account established at a central server may be presented.
- the online management account may have an associated account identifier.
- the system may include an application operating on a mobile computing device.
- the application may be designed for configuration and control of the hazard detector.
- the application may establish communication over the Internet with the central server.
- the application may be configured to receive a first code from the central server and receive information derived from a printed surface on the hazard detector or a printed document or package physically
- the information may include a second code.
- the application may also be configured to receive a selection of an access point SSID being broadcast by the hazard detector. The selection may be received from a user and establish a corresponding Wi-Fi connection with the hazard detector. The Wi-Fi connection may be authenticated using the second code.

- An occupant can use their registered device 166 to remotely control the smart devices of the home, such as when the occupant is at work or on vacation.
- the occupant may also use their registered device to control the smart devices when the occupant is actually located inside the home, such as when the occupant is sitting on a couch inside the home. It should be appreciated that instead of or in addition to registering devices 166, the smart-home environment 100 makes inferences about which individuals live in the home and are therefore occupants and which devices 166 are associated with those individuals. As such, the smart-home environment "learns" who is an occupant and permits the devices 166 associated with those individuals to control the smart devices of the home.

- the smart devices combine to create a mesh network of spokesman and low-power nodes in the smart-home environment 100, where some of the smart devices are “spokesman” nodes and others are “low-powered” nodes.
- Some of the smart devices in the smart-home environment 100 are battery powered, while others have a regular and reliable power source, such as by connecting to wiring (e.g., to 120V line voltage wires) behind the walls 154 of the smart-home environment.

- nodes are equipped with the capability of using any wireless protocol or manner to facilitate bidirectional communication with any of a variety of other devices in the smart-home environment 100 as well as with the central server or cloud-computing system 164.
- the devices that are battery powered are referred to as "low-power" nodes.
- These nodes tend to be smaller than spokesman nodes and can only communicate using wireless protocols that requires very little power, such as Zigbee, 6L0WPAN, etc. Further, some, but not all, low-power nodes are incapable of bidirectional communication. These low-power nodes send messages, but they are unable to "listen”. Thus, other devices in the smart-home environment 100, such as the spokesman nodes, cannot send information to these low-power nodes.
- the smart devices serve as low-power and spokesman nodes to create a mesh network in the smart-home environment 100.
- Individual low-power nodes in the smart- home environment regularly send out messages regarding what they are sensing, and the other low-powered nodes in the smart-home environment - in addition to sending out their own messages - repeat the messages, thereby causing the messages to travel from node to node (i.e., device to device) throughout the smart-home environment 100.
- the spokesman nodes in the smart-home environment 100 are able to "drop down" to low-powered communication protocols to receive these messages, translate the messages to other communication protocols, and send the translated messages to other spokesman nodes and/or the central server or cloud-computing system 164.
- the low-powered nodes using low-power communication protocols are able send messages across the entire smart-home environment 100 as well as over the Internet 162 to the central server or cloud-computing system 164.

- the spokesman nodes and some of the low-powered nodes are capable of "listening". Accordingly, users, other devices, and the central server or cloud-computing system 164 can communicate controls to the low-powered nodes.
- a user can use the portable electronic device (e.g., a smartphone) 166 to send commands over the Internet to the central server or cloud-computing system 164, which then relays the commands to the spokesman nodes in the smart-home environment 100.
- the spokesman nodes drop down to a low-power protocol to communicate the commands to the low-power nodes throughout the smart-home environment, as well as to other spokesman nodes that did not receive the commands directly from the central server or cloud-computing system 164.
- a low-power node is a smart nightlight 170.
- the smart nightlight 170 houses an occupancy sensor, such as an ultrasonic or passive IR sensor, and an ambient light sensor, such as a photoresistor or a single-pixel sensor that measures light in the room.
- the smart nightlight 170 is configured to activate the light source when its ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark and when its occupancy sensor detects that someone is in the room. In other embodiments, the smart nightlight 170 is simply configured to activate the light source when its ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark.
- the smart nightlight 170 includes a low-power wireless communication chip (e.g., ZigBee or other 802.15.4-based chip) that regularly sends out messages regarding the occupancy of the room and the amount of light in the room, including instantaneous messages coincident with the occupancy sensor detecting the presence of a person in the room.
- these messages may be sent wirelessly, using the mesh network, from node to node (i.e., smart device to smart device) within the smart- home environment 100 as well as over the Internet 162 to the central server or cloud-computing system 164.
- low-powered nodes include battery-operated versions of the smart hazard detectors 104.

- smart hazard detectors 104 can send messages that correspond to each of the respective sensors to the other devices and the central server or cloud-computing system 164, such as by using the mesh network as described above.
- Examples of spokesman nodes include smart doorbells 106, smart thermostats 102, smart wall switches 108, and smart wall plugs 110. These devices 102, 106, 108, and 110 are often located near and connected to a reliable power source, and therefore can include more power-consuming components, such as one or more communication chips capable of bidirectional communication in any variety of protocols.
- the mesh network can be used to automatically turn on and off lights as a person transitions from room to room.
- the low-powered and spokesman nodes e.g., devices 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, and 170
- the central server or cloud-computing system 164 or some other device activates and deactivates the smart wall switches 108 to automatically provide light as the person moves from room to room in the smart- home environment 100.
- users may provide pre-configuration information that indicates which smart wall plugs 110 provide power to lamps and other light sources, such as the smart nightlight 170.
- this mapping of light sources to wall plugs 110 can be done automatically (e.g., the smart wall plugs 110 detect when a light source is plugged into it, and it sends a corresponding message to the central server or cloud-computing system 164). Using this mapping information in combination with messages that indicate which rooms are occupied, the central server or cloud-computing system 164 or some other device activates and deactivates the smart wall plugs 110 that provide power to lamps and other light sources so as to track the person's movement and provide light as the person moves from room to room.
- the mesh network of low-powered and spokesman nodes can be used to provide exit lighting in the event of an emergency.
- users provide pre-configuration information that indicates exit routes in the smart-home environment 100. For example, for each room in the house, the user provides a map of the best exit route.
- the central server or cloud-computing system 164 or some other device could automatically determine the routes using uploaded maps, diagrams, architectural drawings of the smart-home house, as well as using a map generated based on positional information obtained from the nodes of the mesh network (e.g., positional information from the devices is used to construct a map of the house).
- the central server or cloud-computing system 164 or some other device uses occupancy information obtained from the low-powered and spokesman nodes to determine which rooms are occupied and then turns on lights (e.g., nightlights 170, wall switches 108, wall plugs 110 that power lamps, etc.) along the exit routes from the occupied rooms so as to provide emergency exit lighting.

- Tasks such as floor sweeping and floor washing can be considered as "away” or "while-away” tasks for purposes of the instant description, as it is generally more desirable for these tasks to be performed when the occupants are not present.
- one or more of the service robots 162 are configured to perform tasks such as playing music for an occupant, serving as a localized thermostat for an occupant, serving as a localized air monitor/purifier for an occupant, serving as a localized baby monitor, serving as a localized hazard detector for an occupant, and so forth, it being generally more desirable for such tasks to be carried out in the immediate presence of the human occupant.
- tasks can be considered as "human-facing" or "human-centric" tasks.

For example, the system processor can direct wireless data traffic on both high and low power wireless communications circuitry, access non-volatile memory, communicate with the safety processor, and cause audio to be emitted from speaker 550. As another example, the system processor can monitor interface sensors to determine whether any actions need to be taken (e.g., shut off a blaring alarm in response to a user detected action to hush the alarm).

- the user will also be able to set up a user account with the cloud server 164 if such an account does not already exist.
- the user may instruct the application to add a new smart-home device.
- smart-home devices in addition to the first hazard detector 400 can use this same method and system for pairing and provisioning.
- the application 814 need not even know what type of device is being added at this stage of the process. Instead, the user can simply select an option such as "add a new device.” In other embodiments, the user can specify that he/she is adding a new hazard detector specifically.
- the mobile computing device 816 can communicate through the home Wi-Fi network 1604 provided by a router 160.

- the first hazard detector 400 does not know the SSID or password for the home Wi-Fi network 1604 at this stage of the pairing and provisioning process.
- the first hazard detector 400 can generate the temporary Wi-Fi network 798, which can be detected and connected to by the mobile computing device 816.
- scanning the QR code will provide the temporary (rendezvous) Wi-Fi SSID being broadcast by the first hazard detector 400 to the mobile computing device 816.
- the application 814 can then automatically switch from the home Wi-Fi network 1604 to the temporary Wi-Fi network 798.
- the application 814 can switch the network connection back to the home Wi-Fi network 1604 for the mobile computing device 816 without requiring user notifications and/or inputs.
- the application 814 can inform the user that they need to manually switch their network connection to the temporary Wi-Fi network 798. Because the QR code included the temporary Wi-Fi SSID, the application 814 can display the name of the temporary Wi-Fi network 798 to which the mobile computing device 816 should connect, such as "NEST-22356.” The user can then navigate to the settings of the mobile computing device 816 and switch to the temporary Wi-Fi network 798.
- FIG. 7C illustrates how the mobile computing device 816 can provision the first hazard detector 400 to operate on the home Wi-Fi network 1604, according to some embodiments.
- the temporary Wi-Fi network 798 i.e. the local Wi-Fi hotspot
- the application 814 can secure the temporary Wi-Fi network session with the first hazard detector 400 using the local pairing code, which was provided to the mobile computing device 816 through the QR code or manually entered from the printed label of the first hazard detector 400.
- the first hazard detector 400 By transmitting the pairing code - or information from which the pairing code may be derived - from the mobile computing device 816 to the first hazard detector 400 through the temporary Wi-Fi network 798, the first hazard detector 400 will know that the correct and authorized computing device is present. In some embodiments, this may create a password authenticated session. By using a pairing code, the provisioning process protect against scenarios where multiple hazard detectors are being installed simultaneously in close proximity to each other, such as in an apartment building on Christmas morning. [0102] After establishing the communication session through the temporary Wi-Fi network 798, the mobile computing device 816 can send the configuration information received from the cloud server 164 to the first hazard detector 400.
- the configuration information includes data that can be used by the first hazard detector 400 in order to pair with the user account of the cloud server 164.
- the configuration information also includes data that may be required by the first hazard detector 400 to set up or join a local device network that is 802.15.4- compatible.
- the application 814 can store the home Wi-Fi network SSID and password and automatically provide this information to the first hazard detector 400.
- the application 814 can query the user to select the home Wi-Fi network SSID from a list of available Wi-Fi networks. The user can also be prompted to enter their password (e.g. WEP/WPA password) if necessary. This information can then be transmitted from the application 814 to the first hazard detector 400 over the temporary Wi-Fi network 798. After transmission, the application 814 can delete the SSID and password such that they are not stored permanently by the application. Note that in these embodiments, neither the application 816 or the cloud server 164 needs to store the credentials for the home Wi-Fi network 1604. This way, compromising the application 814 and/or the cloud server 164 will not give an attacker access to the user's home Wi-Fi network 1604.
- FIG. 7D illustrates how the first hazard detector 400 can pair itself with the cloud server 164 through the home Wi-Fi network 1604, according to some embodiments.
- the first hazard detector 400 can use the SSID and password received from the mobile computing device 816 to connect to the home Wi-Fi network 1604 and the router 160 and thus gain access to the Internet 1602.
- the first hazard detector 400 can then use the DNS hostname that identifies the Internet address for the cloud server 164 to connect with the cloud server 164.
- the first hazard detector 400 can also provide the service node ID that identifies itself based on the original request from the mobile computing device 816. Both the DNS hostname and the service node ID were included in the configuration information passed from the cloud server 164 to the computing device 816, and then to the first hazard detector 400.
- the first hazard detector 400 can use the PKI certificate and/or private cryptographic key that were stored on the first hazard detector 400 during a manufacturing or post-manufacturing process. This can generate a secure communication session based on the authenticated certificate.
- the PKI- based method of session authentication may be analogous to standard SSL/TSL.
- the first hazard detector can send the account ID and the account pairing token from the configuration information to the cloud server 164.
- the service can validate the account pairing token to determine that the first hazard detector 400 is the device for which the mobile computing device 816 made the original request.
- the cloud server 164 can then pair the first hazard detector 400 with the corresponding user account.
- the account pairing is complete, and the first hazard detector 400 has been provisioned to operate on the home Wi-Fi network 1604.
- the mobile computing device 816 can disconnect from the temporary Wi-Fi network 798 and reconnect to the home Wi-Fi network 1604. Some embodiments may make this connection automatically, while others may require a user to manually revert back to the home Wi-Fi network 1604 by changing the settings on their mobile computing device 816. Any subsequent configuration of the settings of the first hazard detector 400 can now be achieved through the home Wi-Fi network 1604. For example, users may select a location within the enclosure 150 for the first hazard detector 400, such as a bedroom, a kitchen, a hallway, and so forth. Users may also select/enable a "pathlight" feature that causes the first hazard detector 400 to operate as a nightlight when detecting a human presence in the dark.
- each of these additional setup processes may now be accomplished either through the home Wi-Fi network 1604, or through the Internet 162.
- the settings will be received by the mobile computing device 816 and transmitted to the cloud server 164.
- the cloud server 164 will send the settings through the Internet 1602 to the first hazard detector 400.
- future communications between the mobile computing device 816 and the first hazard detector 400 will be carried out through the cloud server 164 exclusively.
- FIG. 7E illustrates a flowchart of a method for establishing a pairing between a smart- home hazard detector and an online management account established at a central server, according to some embodiments.
- This method lists a subset of the steps described above in relation to FIGS. 7A-7D.
- various embodiments may add or remove any of the features described above without limitation.
- the method may include instantiating, at a mobile computing device, an application designed for configuration and control of the hazard detector (702).
- the application may establish communication over the Internet with the central server.
- the method may also include receiving, at the mobile computing device, a first code from the central server (704).
- the first code may comprise the account pairing token, and it may be received in response to a request to add a new device to the user account.
- the method may also include receiving information derived from a printed surface associated with the hazard detector (706).
- the printed surface may be printed on the hazard detector itself or on a printed document, sticker, and/or package physically accompanying the hazard detector at the setup location.
- the information derived from the printed surface may include a second code.
- the second code may comprise the local pairing code described above.
- the method may further include broadcasting, by the hazard detector, a Wi-Fi access point SSID. As described above, the hazard detector can receive a user input that causes it to broadcast a temporary Wi-Fi network.
- the method may additionally include receiving, at the mobile computing device, a selection of the access point SSID from a user (710).
- the user can select the temporary Wi-Fi network and establish a corresponding Wi-Fi connection with the hazard detector.
- the mobile computing device can transmit the second code (e.g., the local pairing code) to the hazard detector over the temporary Wi-Fi network.
- the method may also include receiving, at the mobile computing device, and identity of a home Wi-Fi network through which the hazard detector is to access the Internet (712).
- the user may enter/select the SSID and/or password for their home Wi-Fi network, which can then be sent to the hazard detector through the temporary Wi-Fi network. Therefore, the method may additionally include sending, from the mobile computing device to the hazard detector, the first code and the identity of the home Wi-Fi network (714).
- the hazard detector can then use the identity of the home Wi-Fi network to connect to the Internet.
- the method may then include establishing a connection between the central server and the hazard detector using the home Wi- Fi network (716). After establishing this connection, the method may further include
- a transmission that includes the first code (e.g., the account pairing token) (718).
- This transmission can be authenticated by the central server using information previously stored in a memory of the hazard detector at the time of manufacture. For example, the transmission can be authenticated using a PKI certificate and/or private key stored in the hazard detector.
- the method may additionally include pairing the hazard detector with the user account (720). This pairing can it be achieved by validating a pre-established matching relationship using the second code. For example, the account pairing token received by the central server can be validated against the account pairing token originally sent to the mobile computing device.
- FIG. 7F illustrates a method 700 performed by a server for establishing a pairing between a hazard detector and an online management account, according to an embodiment.
- method 700 may be used for smart home environments that do not already include one or more network connected hazard detectors.
- a central server or a cloud-computing system may receive input corresponding to a code. More specifically, the input may request a code from the cloud server in order to pair a new hazard detector with the user account. This requested code may be an account pairing token for the hazard detector. The code may also be associated with additional information stored on the cloud server,
- the central server or a cloud-computing system may receive input corresponding to credentials for accessing an online management account.
- the hazard detector may send credentials for the online management account, which credentials may have been previously stored on the hazard detector during a manufacturing process, to the cloud server 164. These credentials may have include information associated with a PKI certificate and/or a private key.
- the credentials for the online management account may then be provided to cloud server 164 via a home Wi-Fi network connected to the Internet.
- Online management accounts which may be uniquely identified by an email address (e.g., a user's email address), may allow users to access or otherwise benefit from online services, e.g., services 204 (shown in FIG. 2).
- an e-mail address as an account identifier during initial online account establishment (or otherwise as a required part of the online account creation process) advantageously provides a way to ensure online account name uniqueness for the service provider, and also provides some degree of security when the process requires the user to access their e-mail to retrieve and respond via e-mail to a verification message from the service provider.
- a central server or a cloud-computing system may associate the hazard detector with the online management account using a code, e.g., the account pairing token 832, and credentials for the online management account.
- a code e.g., the account pairing token 832
- data e.g., home data 202 (shown in FIG. 2)
- this association may allow for remote access and/or remote or distributed control of first hazard detector 400 via a user's online management account.
- the cloud server 164 may receive input corresponding to the location of first hazard detector 400.
- the information could be stored at the user's online management account and used to enhance the features of services 204 provided to the first hazard detector 400.
- the location information may further be used to further configure the first hazard detector 400, such as to apply different pre-alarm "heads-up" settings depending on the type of room in which it is located.
- the location of the first hazard detector 400 may be used to alter the way alerts are provided to users and/or how the first hazard detector 400interprets characteristics measured by its sensors.
- a central server or a cloud-computing system may associate the hazard detector with the location selected at step 711.
- step 713 may classify the first hazard detector 400according to the selected location at the online management account.
- This may allow services 204 to further interpret the data received at home data 202 and provide the user with analysis that takes into account the location of the first hazard detector 400. Additionally, this association may allow a user to differentiate hazard detectors by name and separately manage each at a single online management account.
- FIGS. 7G-1 and FIG. 7G-2 illustrate a method 730 performed by a user for establishing a pairing between the first hazard detector 400 and an online management account, according to an embodiment. Similar to method 700, method 730 may be used for smart home environments that do not already include one or more network connected hazard detectors. Each step of method 730 is discussed in detail below, and some steps are discussed with reference to additional figures (e.g., FIGS. 8A-T) that may provide physical illustrations related to the steps of method 730. [0119] In some embodiments, method 730 may include steps 732 and 734, which are optional steps of method 730 (as indicated by dashed lines in FIG. 7G-1).
- a user may determine how to proceed depending on whether the user has an online management account for managing the first hazard detector 400 and/or other smart devices. If the user does not have an online management account, the user may proceed with creating an online management account at optional step 734. If the user already has an online management account, the user may proceed directly to step 736, bypassing optional step 734. The user may already have an online management account because the user owns other smart devices that require the online management account or because the user previously realized the benefit of the online management account for managing the first hazard detector 400. [0120] At optional step 734, the user may create an online management account.
- the online management account may be created at an application (e.g., application 814 as discussed below) or a webpage configured to communicate with a server, e.g., cloud server 164, for hosting the online management account.
- a user may access a webpage at a desktop computer or an application at a smart phone in order to create an online management account.
- online management accounts may be uniquely identified by an email address (e.g., a user's email address) and allow users to access or otherwise benefit from online services, e.g., services 204 (shown in FIG. 2).
- FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate examples of the physical process associated with step 736, according to an embodiment.

- Information packet 806 may include instructions for the user to install and/or open an application or visit a webpage in order to access the cloud server 164 via internet 162. It may be necessary for the user to pull a battery tab in order to expose the terminals of the batteries, e.g., the batteries of battery pack 450 (shown in FIG. 4 A), and provide operating power or backup power to the first hazard detector 400.
- the first hazard detector 400 and the mounting plate 802 may include corresponding features such that first hazard detector 400 becomes locked onto mounting plate 802 when a user twists the first hazard detector 400 in a direction 808, as shown in FIG. 8C.
- the first hazard detector 400 may also include circuitry and sensors that cause the first hazard detector 400 to "boot up" or initiate its operating system when the sensors determine that the first hazard detector 400 has been mounted on mounting plate 802.
- An advantage of these mount detection sensors may be that the setup process for the first hazard detector 400 may not begin until it has been mounted on mounting plate 802 that may have already been mounted, e.g., on a wall or ceiling, within a home or other structure.
- the setup process may take into account the specific conditions, environments, and/or locations in which the first hazard detector 400 has been installed.
- the first hazard detector 400 may be connected to a network based on which network provides a strong signal to its mounted location and/or associated with the specific room of a home or other structure in which the first hazard detector 400 is mounted.

- the setup process of the first hazard detector 400 may begin immediately after the battery tab is pulled, even if the first hazard detector 400 has not been mounted on mounting plate 802. In this manner, the first hazard detector 400 may still be optionally located proximate to its eventual location of operation when the battery tab is pulled, but the device is not required to be mounted for the setup process to begin. This flexibility may be advantageous in some situations, e.g., where a user prefers to setup the first hazard detector 400 before mounting it and/or where the user is not interested in utilizing location based and/or networked connected features of the first hazard detector 400.

- an English speaking user could push a button on the first hazard detector 400 when they hear the phrase "Press the button now for English” announced by the first hazard detector 400.
- a pleasant greeting can be provided (e.g., the English phrase above would be "Hello from Nest [or Company Name], press the button now for English.”).
- a pleasant light display such as a blue glow, or a blue glow that appears to be in a rotating pattern, emanates from the halo light element 620 during the hello and language selection process which, along with the spoken words, is believed to bring about a pleasant, positive feeling in the user imparting confidence to proceed.
- the user may press button 600 in a direction 810, as shown in FIG. 8E, to begin communicating with first hazard detector 400.
- the user may use voice commands to begin communicating with first hazard detector 400.
- first hazard detector 400 may generate audio and/or visual indicators, as shown in FIG. 8F.
- first hazard detector 400 may tell the user "Device ready! Press again to test.”
- the voice may say, "This is only a test.
- the alarm will sound.
- the alarm is loud.
- the test starts in 10 seconds. Press or wave to cancel. 10, 9, 8, 7, " If the user does not press the button or issue a "gesture hush” or "wave-to-hush” command before the countdown reaches zero, the test will proceed, wherein the voice says "This is only a test.
- the blue glow or modulated blue glow of the halo light accompanies the spoken voice up until the test-alarming beeps, at which time the halo light glows red or modulated red. Subsequent to the test-alarming beeps, as the voice is saying "Everything is OK,” the halo light emits a green glow or modulated green glow, which enforces the reassurance that the hazard detector has tested OK.
- Audio and/or visual indicators similarly provided by the first hazard detector 400 may then direct or instruct the user to open an app or webpage on their smartphone or tablet, or other similarly capable computing device, which will, among other advantageous functions, facilitate the providing of the code.
- the first hazard detector 400 may generate pulsing blue light rays 812.
- the user may access cloud server 164 via internet 162.
- the user may follow the instructions contained in information packet 806 and install and/or open a hazard detector management application, e.g., application 814, on a computing device or visit a webpage on a computing device in order to communicate with cloud server 164 via internet 162.
- the application or webpage may ask the user to input at the application or webpage credentials (e.g., username and password) for accessing an online management account.
- a user may determine how to proceed depending on whether the user has an online management account for managing the first hazard detector 400 and/or other smart devices. If the user does not have an online management account, the user may proceed with creating an online management account at step 742. If the user already has an online
- the user may proceed to step 744.
- the user may already have an online management account because the user owns other smart devices that require the online management account, the user previously realized the benefit of the online management account for managing first hazard detector 400 or other reasons.
- the user may create an online management account.
- the online management account may be created at an application (e.g., application 814) or a webpage configured to communicate with a server, e.g., cloud server 164, for hosting the online management account.

- first hazard detector 400 may not begin until it has been mounted on mounting plate 802 that may have already been mounted, e.g., on a wall or ceiling, within a home or other structure. Accordingly, the setup process may take into account the specific conditions/environment/location in which first hazard detector 400 has been installed. For example, during the setup process, first hazard detector 400 may be connected to a network based on which network provides a strong signal to its mounted location and/or associated with the specific room of a home or other structure in which first hazard detector 400 is mounted.

- the hazard detectors broadcast interconnect signals to every other installed hazard detector in the house (or other structure) to enter into a functional verification mode, wherein each hazard detector performs a self-test and announces, using an audio speaker (e.g., speaker 550 shown in FIG. 5C), the results of that self-test as it is happening.
- the interconnect signal may be broadcasted using relatively low power wireless communications circuitry, e.g., an IPv6 over low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6L0WPAN) module or a ZigBee module capable of communicating according to an 802.15.4 protocol.
- the hazard detectors may generate the following audio: "Testing Smoke Detection alarm . . . (beep) (beep) (beep) smoke alarm test successful . . . testing CO alarm (boop) (boop) (boop) . . . CO alarm test successful" and so forth.
- each of the hazard detectors may have a pre-assigned ID number (e.g., number one through the number of installed hazard detectors) and may generate speech to repeatedly enunciate their respective ID numbers to indicate the broadcasted interconnect signal is being successfully received by the respective hazard detectors. All of the hazard detectors may perform one or both of these self-test simultaneously and until they are instructed to stop.
- the user may walk around the house or other structure to confirm that each unit is actively and properly going through its audible verification process as expected.
- Hazard detectors can be instructed to stop this process by another double -press of button 600 on any of the hazard detector units and/or by a command input at a smartphone app, e.g., application 814. If any of the self-tests fail, the user may troubleshoot the failure by relocating one or more hazard detectors, adding additional hazard detectors at strategic location to close the node loop, and/or confirming that each hazard detector has been properly setup.
- a method 790 may be used to test or verify network connectivity and/or mesh network connectivity of multiple hazard detectors mounted in a home or other structure, as illustrated in FIG. 71. This method may be triggered by mounting first hazard detector 400 on the wall, e.g., via mounting plate 802, at the conclusion of embodiments of methods 700/730/760 that do not include mounting first hazard detector 400.
- cloud server 164 may initiate a communication check or network connectivity verification in response to mounting first hazard detector 400. For example, cloud server 164 may receive a notification from a mesh networked hazard detector indicating that the hazard detector has been mounted.
- cloud server 164 may send instructions to the hazard detectors, e.g., first hazard detector 400, on the mesh network.
- the instructions received at the hazard detectors may cause each hazard detector to broadcast interconnect signals to each other using relatively low power wireless communications circuitry, e.g., an IPv6 over low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6L0WPAN) module or a ZigBee module capable of communicating according to an 802.15.4 protocol.
- relatively low power wireless communications circuitry e.g., an IPv6 over low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6L0WPAN) module or a ZigBee module capable of communicating according to an 802.15.4 protocol.
- cloud server 164 may receive the results of the communication check of step 792. These results may include a list of the hazard detectors that can be seen by each of the respective hazard detector. Each hazard detector may communicate their respective lists directly to cloud server 164. Alternatively, the mesh network may include a "spokesman" node hazard detector that communicates with other "lower power” node hazard detectors using low power communications circuitry and then conveys results received from the "low power" nodes to cloud server 164.
- cloud server 164 may communicate the results it received to application 814, which results (e.g., the living room, kitchen, master bedroom hazard detectors are viewable by the kids bedroom hazard detector) are then displayed on a Communication Check interface of application 814, as shown in FIG. 8U.
- application 814 may receive and display other communication check results, e.g., specifically which hazard detectors can be seen by each of the other hazard detectors.
- Each hazard detector may also display indicators, e.g., green lights generated at the hazard detectors, to signify that the hazard detectors can see at least one other hazard detector in the mesh network and/or that there is at least one network path between any hazard detector in the mesh and any other hazard detector.
- indicators e.g., green lights generated at the hazard detectors
- cloud server 164 may determine whether network connectivity has been verified, i.e., whether the mesh network is missing any hazard detectors. Cloud server 164 may make this determination by comparing the results with the history of hazard detectors paired with an online management account to determine if any hazard detectors are missing from the results of step 794. Alternatively, application 814 may similarly compare the results of step 794 with the history of hazard detectors paired with an online management account via application 814 or otherwise.
- steps 792 and 794 may need to be performed again. However, if the network connectivity is verified, method 790 may proceed directly to step 798, i.e., the communication check may conclude. In some cases, user input will not be required to manually verify network connectivity at step 796, as discussed above.
- the user may still provide input corresponding to the determination of step 796. For example, as shown in FIG. 8U, the user may select a "Okay, Great! button 850 if the user wants to verify network connectivity at step 796. The user may also select troubleshoot button 855 if problems were discovered with network connectivity. The user may troubleshoot by relocating one or more hazard detectors, adding additional hazard detectors at strategic location to close the node loop, confirming that each hazard detector has been properly setup and/or other methods.
- steps 792, 794 and 796 may be repeated as many times as necessary or desired by the user, server, and/or hazard detectors in order to resolve and confirm the resolution of network connectivity issues of the mesh network of hazard detectors in a home or other structure.
- a user may wish to add more than one hazard detector to a smart home environment to create a mesh network, as referred to above.
- methods 700, 730 and 760 may be repeated for additional hazard detectors in order to pair them with the online management account.
- the method for adding additional hazard detectors may vary from methods 700, 730 and 760 in a manner that reduces or minimizes an amount of user effort involved.
- An example of a method that uses method 700 (and methods 730 and 760) to add a first hazard detector and a modified version of method 700 (and methods 730 and 760) to add an additional hazard detector is shown in the following figure.
- FIG. 9 illustrates a method for pairing two or more hazard detectors (e.g., first hazard detector 400) and an online management account, according to an embodiment.
- an embodiment of method 700 may be performed by cloud server 164 in order to pair a first hazard detector and an online management account.
- Methods 730 and 760 may also be performed at step 905 from the perspective of user and hazard detector, respectively.
- step 910 instructions are transmitted that cause the first hazard detector to establish wireless communication between the first hazard detector and a second hazard detector.
- user may open or install and open an app, e.g., application 814, on a computing device, e.g., computing device 816.
- a webpage configured to communicate with the online management account may be used in performing step 910.
- an option to add another hazard detector, a second hazard detector may be selected at the app interface.
- the app may then transmit instructions via a server, e.g., cloud server 164 (shown in FIG. 1), and the Internet 162 (shown in FIG.
- the first hazard detector may be instructed to use a local device network that is separate from a home Wi-Fi network, such as an IPv6 over low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6L0WPAN) module capable of communicating according to an 802.15.4 protocol to provide a 6L0WPAN network.
- 6L0WPAN IPv6 over low power Wireless Personal Area Network
- a ZigBee module capable of communicating according to an 802.15.4 protocol may also be used to provide a network.
- a Thread module capable of communicating according to a protocol promulgated by the Thread Group and based on 802.15.4, IETF IPv6, and 6L0WPAN can be used to provide a network.
- the local device network provided by the first hazard may use a unique network name that may be recognized by other hazard detectors and/or assign itself one or more IPv6 addresses that include a rendezvous prefix.
- the rendezvous prefix may help a hazard detector to identify the networks it should join.
- the local device network may be provided in another manner that allows a second hazard detector to recognize it as a network that should be joined.
- the second hazard detector may also provide a local device network in a similar manner. When one hazard detector discovers another hazard detector's local device network, it may terminate its joining network and connect to the network provided by the other hazard detector. Thus, the first hazard detector may join the second hazard detector's network and vice versa.
- a wireless communication may be established in this manner between the first hazard detector and the second hazard detector over the local device network or another network operating with a low power wireless protocol.
- instructions are transmitted that cause the first hazard detector to share network credentials with the second hazard detector.
- the instructions may originate from an app and may be routed through the first hazard detector.
- the first hazard detector may leverage the wireless communication established between it and the second hazard detector over the second wireless protocol (i.e., the local device network) in order to the share network credentials.
- the network credentials may include a network router name and password for connecting to the Internet 162 through a home Wi-Fi network.
- This network router may also be the network router that the first hazard detector is using to receive the instructions of step 910.
- the second hazard detector may use the network credentials to connect to the internet 162. Thereafter, the first and second hazard detectors may disable their local device networks and use Wi-Fi to connect to the Internet via a network router in order to communicate with the app and/or an online management account located at cloud server 164.
- a modified version of method 700 may be performed in order to establish a new pairing between the second hazard detector and the online management account using the first wireless protocol.
- the modified version of method 700 of step 920 may include all the steps of embodiments and variations of method 700 with a few exceptions.
- step 920 may automatically use the online management account credentials already stored at the app to associate the second hazard detector with the online management account instead of creating or entering online management account credentials.
- step 920 would clearly not require connecting the second hazard detector to internet 162 because that connection was already accomplished at step 915 above.
- modified versions of methods 730 and 760 would not need to perform corresponding of methods 730 and 760, e.g., steps 740, 742, and 754 and steps 772, 774, 776 and 778, respectively.
- method 900 may allow for adding additional hazard detectors in a manner that requires less user effort than method 700.
- Steps 910-920 may be repeated for a third or other additional hazard detectors, substituting the next device for the second device in steps 910- 920, in order to add a third or other additional hazard detectors to a smart home environment.
- steps 910-920 may be repeated without involving the first device, e.g., using the second device to setup a third device, substituting the second device for the first device and the third device for the second device in steps 910-920.
- a hazard detector according to the present invention may provide audio and/or visual indicators during the setup process to guide and provide feedback to the user. Similar audio and/or visual feedback may be provided during method 900. Again, while a limited number of visual and audio indicators generated by first hazard detector 400 were described above, other indicators may also be generated by first hazard detector 400 during method 900. The following figures provide additional examples and a more complete discussion of how a first hazard detector can be used to provision additional hazard detectors.
- FIG. 10 illustrates some of the devices involved with provisioning a second hazard detector 1002, according to some embodiments.

- a first hazard detector 400 may already be installed and paired with a user account 1004 at the cloud server 164. The user may be able to
- the first hazard detector 400 can communicate with the first hazard detector 400 using a mobile communication device 816, such as a cell phone.
- a mobile communication device 816 such as a cell phone.
- the first hazard detector 400 can communicate through the router 160 and the Internet 162 with the cloud server 164 and the mobile computing device 816.
- a user may wish to install a second hazard detector 1002.
- the second hazard detector 1002 can be installed in another area of the structure 150.
- the first hazard detector 400 may be installed on a ground-level, while the second hazard detector 1002 may be installed on a second-floor level.
- the user can set up and pair the second hazard detector 1002 according to method 700 described above.
- Method 900 and the following discussion offer a more streamlined approach to setting up and pairing the second hazard detector 1002 that can greatly reduce the possibility of user error and the amount of time and effort required to set up the second hazard detector 1002.
- FIG. 11 illustrates a starting state for each of the devices involved in provisioning and pairing the second hazard detector 1002.
- FIG. 11 shows certain data that are stored on each device prior to activating the second hazard detector 1002. It will be understood that the data shown in FIG. 11 are not exhaustive, and they only highlight certain types of information that may be required during the pairing process.
- an account password 1114 may be stored.
- the account password 1114 may have been entered by a user previously when establishing the user account 1004 with the cloud server 164.
- the account password 1114 may be stored on the mobile computing device 816. Such storage may be in an encrypted format.
- the account password 1114 may be entered during setup and shared with the user account 1004.
- the cloud server 164 can transmit an authentication token to the mobile computing device 816.
- the mobile computing device 816 can share the authentication token with the cloud server 164 to prove to the cloud server 164 that the mobile computing device 816 should be allowed access to the user account 1004.
- the authentication token can be used to encrypt and/or sign communications that are sent from the mobile computing device 816 to the cloud server 164, thus preventing the need to transmit secret information such as a password during each communication.
- the mobile computing device 816 may also store an S SID 1110 and a LAN password 1112 for a home Wi-Fi network.
- the S SID 11 10 and the LAN password 1112 may be stored on the mobile computing device 816 such that they are not readily available to be shared with other devices such as the first hazard detector 400 and the second hazard detector 1002. Therefore, the SSID 1110 and/or the LAN password 1112 may need to be retransmitted to the mobile device 816 or manually entered into the mobile device 816 when pairing with the second hazard detector 1002. As will be described below, the SSID 1110 and the LAN password 1112 can be transmitted to the mobile device 816 from the first hazard detector 400 such that users do not need to enter this information for a second time.
- the router 160 may generally store the S SID 1110 and the LAN password 1112 for authenticating other devices that wish to communicate through the home Wi-Fi network.
- the user account 1004 can store an access token 1108 that is used during the pairing process as will be described in greater detail below.
- the access token 1108 comprises secret information that can be used to verify the identity of a device trying to communicate with the first hazard detector 400.
- the user account 1004 can also store the account password 1114. However, in most embodiments, the user account 1004 will instead store a hashed version of the password 1104.
- the account password 1114 can then be hashed by the mobile computing device 816 and transmitted to the cloud server 164 for verification.
- the first hazard detector 400 may include a first device code 1116 that was used in method 700 as described above. Because the first hazard detector 400 has already been paired with the user account 1004, the first hazard detector 400 will also store the SSID 1110 and the LAN password 1112 obtained during the first pairing process so that it can connect to the home Wi-Fi network. Also obtained during the first pairing process is an account certificate 1118.
- the account certificate comprises cryptographic information that can be used to verify that another device has the access token 1108. Further use of the account certificate 1118 will be described in greater detail below.
- the smart home devices in the enclosure 150 may communicate with each other via a local device network that is separate from the home Wi-Fi network.
- the local device network may be an 802.15.4- compatible network, such as a ZigBee network, or a Thread network.
- the local device network may be used to transmit alarm messages, status updates, health check information, and/or the like, between various smart home devices and used as a local mesh network.
- a message may be transmitted via the local device network to the second hazard detector 1002 such that both hazard detectors 400, 1002 sound an alarm for occupants of the enclosure 150 at the same time, even though the hazard was only detected by the first hazard detector 400.
- Information for joining the local device network will be stored by the first hazard detector 400 in the form of the device network information 1122.
- the second hazard detector 1002 may store a second device code 1120 that is unique to the second hazard detector 1002 and that is provided during a manufacturing or post- manufacturing process.
- the second device code 1 120 can be printed on a label on the back of the second hazard detector 1002 and/or encoded in a QR code, barcode, etc., that can be optically or electronically read by the mobile computing device 816.
- FIGS. 12A-12E illustrate user interfaces for an application 814 running on the mobile device 816 to begin the pairing process with the second hazard detector 1002.
- the streamlined setup process for the second hazard detector 1002 was made possible because another existing smart home devices already been paired with the user account 1004.
- the existing smart home device used in this disclosure will be the first hazard detector 400.
- other embodiments need not be so limited, and other smart home devices may also be used.

- the interface of FIG. 12A provides initial instructions to the user to make the second hazard detector 1002 available for the setup process.
- the user is instructed to remove the second hazard detector 1002 from the mounting plate if it has already been installed and to press continue.
- the application 814 will begin searching for other smart home devices that are registered with the user account 1004.
- the interface of FIG. 12B illustrates how a user can be informed that such a search is taking place.
- a user may already have a smart thermostat and a smart home security system installed along with the first hazard detector 400.
- some smart home devices may offer more extensive user interfaces than others.
- a smart thermostat may provide a more extensive user interface than the first hazard detector 400. It may be advantageous to allow the user to use or view the user interface of such devices instead of using the first hazard detector 400. Therefore, some embodiments may default to trying to connect to a smart home device with an advanced user interface, such as a screen and selectable user input capability before trying to connect to the first hazard detector 400.
- FIG. 12C illustrates how the application 814 can first attempt to connect to a smart thermostat.
- FIG. 12D illustrates when the first hazard detector 400 is selected for pairing the second hazard detector 1002 either by default, through selection, or because other devices were not available.
- the application 814 may display a graphical icon 1204 for the first hazard detector 400 and a second graphical icon 1206 for the second hazard detector 1002 such that the user can easily understand that the first hazard detector 400 is going to be used to install the second hazard detector 1002.

- the first hazard detector 400 may also generate pulsing blue lights 812.
- FIG. 12E illustrates an interface that the user will see as the mobile computing device 816 attempts to connect with the first hazard detector 400.
- FIG. 13 illustrates a flow diagram of the access token 1108 being passed to the mobile computing device 816, according to some embodiments.
- the access token 1108 can be passed to the mobile computing device 816 through the Internet 162 and/or the router 160. (Note that the mobile computing device may also connect directly to the Internet 162 without the router 160 via another available network or using cellular data technology.)
- the access token 1108 can be passed to the mobile computing device 816 anytime the mobile computing device 816 communicates with the cloud server 164.
- the access token 1108 provides a way for the mobile computing device 816 to authenticate itself while communicating directly with the first hazard detector 400 without needing to go through the Internet 162.
- the mobile computing device 816 can use the access token 1108 to prove that it should have access to the first hazard detector 400. Recall that the first hazard detector 400 has the account certificate 1118 that can be used to verify the access token 1108.
- the access token 1108 can be passed from the user account 1004 to the mobile computing device 816.
- the mobile device 816 can request the access token 1108 from the cloud server 164.
- FIG. 14 illustrates a flow diagram of information passed from the first hazard detector 400 to the mobile computing device 816, according to some embodiments.
- the mobile computing device 816 can establish a wireless connection with the first hazard detector 400 through the local Wi-Fi network created by the router 160. Note that this communication between the mobile computing device 816 and the first hazard detector 400 does not need to access an outside network, and thus does not need to communicate over the Internet 162 with the cloud server 164. Instead, the mobile computing device 816 can communicate via the local 802.11 Wi-Fi network according to known methods. In some cases, the mobile computing device 816 may have difficulty connecting to the first hazard detector 400 through the local Wi-Fi network.
- one or both devices may be in a local dead spot within the structure 150, or the local Wi-Fi network may receive temporary interference from outside electromagnetic sources.
- a backup routine may be followed wherein the first hazard detector 400 creates its own local Wi-Fi access point to which the mobile computing device 816 can join.
- the application 814 on the mobile computing device 816 can inform the user that the first hazard detector 400 has created a temporary Wi-Fi network that the mobile computing device 816 needs to connect to in order to complete the setup process.
- the application 814 can instruct the user to exit the setup program temporarily and switch the Wi-Fi settings of the mobile computing device 816 to the temporary Wi-Fi network created by the first hazard detector 400.
- the user can be instructed to switch the Wi-Fi network of the mobile computing device 816 to "Device- 659F38.” This way, the mobile computing device 816 and the first hazard detector 400 can still communicate temporarily during the setup process through a Wi-Fi protocol without using the router 160 and the home Wi-Fi network.
- the mobile computing device 816 can optionally authenticate itself to the first hazard detector 400. This authentication can be facilitated via the access token 1108 and the account certificate 1118. In some embodiments, the mobile computing device 816 can send a packet that is encrypted, signed, or otherwise altered using the account token 1108. The first hazard detector 400 can receive such information and verify that the information has been signed/encrypted/altered with the access token 1108 using the account certificate 1118, and thus authenticate the identity of the mobile computing device 816.
- the first hazard detector 400 can send selected information to the mobile computing device 816 through the home Wi-Fi network. (In cases where a connection through the home Wi-Fi network is not possible, the first hazard detector 400 can send selected information to the mobile computing device 816 through a temporary Wi-Fi network generated by the first hazard detector 400 as a backup.) In some embodiments, the first hazard detector 400 can send the SSID 110, the LAN password 1112, and/or the device network information 1122.
- the mobile computing device 816 By receiving the SSID 1110 and the LAN password 1112 from the first hazard detector 400, the mobile computing device 816 no longer needs to query the user to supply such information (e.g., the user does not have to select a home Wi-Fi network and enter their
- the mobile computing device 816 can send an indication to the first hazard detector 400 that the second hazard detector 1002 will be joining the network.
- This indication can be interpreted by the first hazard detector 400 as an indication that it should start broadcasting itself as discoverable on a local device network.
- the local device network may be established via relatively low power wireless communications circuitry on the first hazard detector 400 to broadcast on a low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6L0WPAN) module or a ZigBee module capable of communicating according to an 802.15.4 protocol, or a Thread module.
- the relatively low power wireless communications circuitry may be implemented using an Ember EM357 6L0WPAN module.
- the first hazard detector 400 can broadcast on a 802.15.4-compatible network such as a Thread network. This network will be referred to as "the local device network," and the smart home devices in the enclosure 100 can use this local device network to communicate amongst themselves.
- the first hazard detector 400 will broadcast on the local device network for a limited amount of time as being joinable. In other words, the first hazard detector 400 broadcasts a beacon that it is able to be joined by a smart home device such as the second hazard detector 1002 within a limited time window.
- the mobile computing device 816 can instruct the first hazard detector 402 not only to broadcast a beacon on the local device network, but to also expect the second hazard detector 1002 to eventually connect to the local device network in response.
- connection of the second hazard detector 1002 is provisional in that it has not yet gone through an account pairing process. Once such a connection by the second hazard detector 1002 is received by the first hazard detector 400, the first hazard detector 400 is further instructed to notify the mobile computing device 816. As will be described further below, the first hazard detector 400 can then act as a bridge between the second hazard detector 1002 on the local device network and the mobile computing device 816 on the home Wi-Fi network.

- the QR code and/or the alphanumeric code may be found on a sticker 828 that is located on back of the second hazard detector 1002 just as it was found on the backplate 420 of the first hazard detector 400.
- application 814 enters a camera mode interface in order to allow a user to take a picture of a QR code 830 located on sticker 828 and next to alphanumeric code 832.
- FIG. 81 application 814 enters a camera mode interface in order to allow a user to take a picture of a QR code 830 located on sticker 828 and next to alphanumeric code 832.
- alphanumeric code 832 inputted into field 822 shows alphanumeric code 832 inputted into field 822. Again, this may be accomplished by manually inputting alphanumeric code 832 into field 822 or by scanning QR code 830 (shown in FIG. 81) and allowing application 814 to determine and automatically input alphanumeric code 832 into field 822. The user may then press the done button 824 in order to indicate that the second device code 1120 was correctly received.
- FIGS. 15A-15C illustrate user interfaces for activating the second hazard detector 1002, according to some embodiments.
- the second hazard detector 1002 may be activated by pulling out a battery tab and thereby supplying power to the second hazard detector 1002. If the battery tab has already been pulled, then the user may press a button or other user input device on the second hazard detector 1002 in order to activate the second hazard detector 1002.
- the second hazard detector 1002 may indicate that it is ready by giving audio/visual indicators to the user. For example, the second hazard detector 1002 may audibly announce that it is awake and ready to test.
- the second hazard detector 1002 may provide a rotating colored ring of light around a center button as described above.
- FIG. 15A illustrates how a user may be instructed by the application 814 to activate the second hazard detector 1002.
- FIG. 15B illustrates acceptable audio/visual indicators such that the user can compare the response of the second hazard detector 1002 with the expected response as provided by the application 814.
- FIG. 15C illustrates an interface for selecting a language for the second hazard detector 1002.
- the second hazard detector 1002 can emit audio signals that indicate available languages.
- the second hazard detector 1002 may audibly say "English” in the English language, "Espanol” in the Spanish language, and so forth.
- the user can be instructed to provide a user input to the second hazard detector 1002 when the appropriate language is being said. For example, the user could push a button on the second hazard detector 1002 when he/she hears the word "English” announced by the second hazard detector 1002.
- the language-selection feature may be automated by the second hazard detector 1002.
- the second hazard detector 1002 could include a GPS device or a country code programmed during a manufacturing or post-manufacturing process. Either of these can be used to determine the proper language of the second hazard detector 1002 without requiring input from the user.
- the language of the second hazard detector 1002 may be determined by an IP address associated with a home Wi-Fi network once it is connected. In these embodiments, the second hazard detector 1002 need not query the user for a preferred language during the setup process, but can instead wait until after the setup is complete.
- the second hazard detector 1002 can use that information to determine the preferred language.
- the IP address, home address, GPS coordinates can be sent to the cloud server 164, and the cloud server 164 can make a determination as to the preferred language.
- the second hazard detector 1002 can prompt the user for additional input to select a preferred language. For example, some cities with large bilingual populations may not have a preferred language based simply on location, such as Los Angeles (English and Spanish) or Montreal
- the cloud server 164 can provide a list of possible preferred languages to the second hazard detector 1002 during or after the setup process, and the user can then be prompted to select between those two possible preferred languages.
- FIG. 16 illustrates the first hazard detector 400 acting as a bridge between the second hazard detector 1002 and the mobile computing device 816, according to some embodiments.
- the second hazard detector 1002 can automatically be placed in a "hunting" mode. While hunting, the second hazard detector 1002 can begin searching for a local device network with which it is compatible. For example, the second hazard detector 1002 can begin searching for 802.15.4-compatible networks. In some embodiments, the second hazard detector 1002 can distinguish between 802.15.4 networks that are compatible with the smart home devices and other 802.15.4 networks that are not compatible with the smart home devices.
- the second hazard detector 1002 may also create a Wi-Fi access point for a temporary Wi-Fi network.
- This temporary Wi-Fi network can be used as a fallback in cases where the second hazard detector 1002 was unable to establish a connection through the local device network 1602 with the first hazard detector 400.
- the mobile computing device 816 can connect to the Wi-Fi access point created by the second hazard detector 1002 and proceed with the setup process as described above in relation to method 700.
- the first hazard detector 400 was previously instructed by the mobile computing device 816 to broadcast a joinable beacon for other smart home devices on the local device network 1602.
- the first hazard detector 400 was also previously instructed to inform the mobile computing device 816 when a new smart home device connected to the local device network 1602 in response to the beacon.
- the second hazard detector 1002 attempts to join the local device network 1602
- the first hazard detector 400 can allow the second hazard detector 1002 to provisionally join the local device network 1602.
- the second hazard detector 1002 does not need to supply any credentials, and access to the local device network 1602 may be granted for a limited time interval and/or limited types of communications may be allowed from the second hazard detector 1002 during the provisional time interval.
- credentials can be stored in the second hazard detector 1002 a manufacturing process or a post-manufacturing process to identify it as a compatible product for the smart home system, and those credentials may be provided to the first hazard detector 400 in order to authorize the provisional membership in the local device network 1602.
- the first hazard detector 400 can then communicate through the home Wi-Fi network 1604 (which may involve the router 160 or some other type of access point) with the mobile computing device 816.
- the mobile computing device 816 generally will not have a radio compatible with 802.15.4 networks such as the local device network 1602. Additionally, the second hazard detector 1002 will not have the SSID 1110 and/or the LAN password 1112 that would give it access to the home Wi-Fi network 1604 until later in the setup process. Therefore, in order to provision the second hazard detector 1002 on the home Wi-Fi network 1604, to register the second hazard detector 1002 with the user account 1004 on the cloud server 164, and to pair the second hazard detector 1002 with the mobile computing device 816, the first hazard detector 400 can act as a bridge between the local device network 1602 and the home Wi-Fi network 1604.
- the first hazard detector 400 can form a tunnel that simply passes data packets from the home Wi-Fi network 1604 to the local device network 1602. Because the first hazard detector 400 is provisioned to operate on the home Wi-Fi network 1604 and is equipped with a radio device that is compatible with the local device network 1602, the first hazard detector 400 can pass data packets between the two networks. In some
- the first hazard detector 400 need not play any active role in provisioning the second hazard detector 1002, but can instead simply pass data back and forth. In other words, the first hazard detector 400 does not need to understand or take part in the conversation between the mobile computing device 816 and the second hazard detector 1002.
- the tunnel provided by the first hazard detector 400 can also provide many other benefits. It is common as time passes for smart home devices such as the hazard detectors 400, 1002 to receive periodic software upgrades.
- the first hazard detector 400 may have been installed within the enclosure 154 relatively long period of time (e.g., more than two years). During this time, the first hazard detector 400 may have received numerous software upgrades, which may have involved communication protocols, initialization and pairing procedures, and/or the like.
- the second hazard detector 1002 may have been manufactured at approximately the same time as the first hazard detector 400, but the second hazard detector 1002 may have sat on a store shelf for a number of years.
- the software in the second hazard detector 1002 may be badly out of date.
- the first hazard detector 400 would have to remain backwards compatible with every version of the operating software since inception. Maintaining backwards compatibility would take a great deal of programming effort and storage space on a device that may be battery-powered an expected to operate in a very low-power environment.
- the first hazard detector 400 only needs to remain backwards compatible with the tunneling protocol expected by the second hazard detector 1002.
- the mobile computing device 816 and/or the cloud server 164 will generally be higher powered devices that can either remain backwards compatible with the rest of the software for the second hazard detector 1002. They may also provide software upgrades during the setup process for the second hazard detector 1002. In contrast, the first hazard detector 400 - which may need to be relatively low power and which may use relatively low-complexity microprocessors - can remain unaware of these software upgrades and backwards compatibility.
- FIG. 17 illustrates data being passed through the communication tunnel established by the first hazard detector 400, according to some embodiments.
- the mobile computing device 816 will have previously received the second device code 1120 by either having scanned in the QR code or received a manual entry by the user.
- the mobile computing device 816 can prove to the second hazard detector 1002 that it is authorized to communicate with the second hazard detector 1002.
- tokens or pairing codes may be exchanged between the second hazard detector 1002 and the mobile computing device 816 to facilitate future communications via the home Wi-Fi network 1604.
- the mobile computing device 816 can transmit information needed to communicate through the home Wi-Fi network 1604.
- the mobile computing device 816 can transmit the SSID 1110 and/or the LAN password 1112 to the second hazard detector 1102 through the tunnel created by the first hazard detector 400.
- the second hazard detector 1002 can then select the home Wi-Fi network 1604 as specified by the SSID 1110 and use the LAN password 1112 to gain access to the home Wi-Fi network 1604. Moving forward, the second hazard detector 1002 can communicate through the home Wi-Fi network 1604.
- the mobile computing device 816 can transmit the device network information 1122 to the second hazard detector 1002.
- the current connection between the second hazard detector 1002 and the first hazard detector 400 on the local device network 1602 is but a provisional one.
- a provisional connection may be limited in time and/or scope.
- the second hazard detector 1002 In order to connect more permanently with the local device network 1602, the second hazard detector 1002 must provide credentials to the first hazard detector 400 and/or other smart home devices connected to the local device network 1602.
- the network device information 1122 may include a username and password for an 802.15.4-compatible network.
- the device network information 1122 may include a Weave username and/or password, as well as Fabric ID and/or keys. Using this device network information 1122, the second hazard detector 1002 can now establish more long-term communication with the local device network 1602, for example, by joining the local Weave network, and thereby receive messages from other smart home devices relating to detected hazards, and/or the like.
- the second hazard detector 1002 can now connect with the cloud server 164 and associate itself with the user account 1004. This may involve pairing the second hazard detector 1002 with the user account 1004.
- the cloud server 164 can transmit service configuration information to the mobile computing device 816 when the access token 1108 is sent prior to the setup process.
- the service configuration information can include a service node identifier, a globally unique Account identifier that identifies the user account, a DNS host name identifying an entry point for the service, and an opaque account pairing token.
- the mobile computing device 816 may also transmit the configuration information to the second hazard detector 1002 through the tunnel provided by the first hazard detector 400.
- the second hazard detector 1002 can then establish a communication session with the cloud server 164 using the DNS host name and service node identifier.
- the second hazard detector 1002 then authenticates itself to the cloud server 164 based on its digital PKI certificate and its private key, and then transmit the account identifier and account pairing token.
- the cloud server 164 Upon verifying the received account pairing token and account identifier, the cloud server 164 then establishes a pairing between the second hazard detector 1002 and the user account 1004.
- this communication session can go through the tunnel provided by the first hazard detector 400.
- this communication channel can be established independently by the second hazard detector 1002.
- FIG. 18 illustrates the pairing process between the second hazard detector 1002 and the cloud server 164, according to some embodiments.
- the second hazard detector 1002 has received the SSID 1110 and the LAN password 1112 as described above.
- the second hazard detector 1002 can connect to the cloud server 164 through the home Wi-Fi network 1604 and then connect through the router 160 to the Internet 162 and the cloud server 164.
- the second hazard detector 1002 can then be paired with the user account 1004 using the configuration information described above (e.g.
- the cloud server 164 may also provide the account certificate 1118 to the second hazard detector 1002. The account certificate 1118 can then be used by the second hazard detector 1002 to authenticate future communications from the mobile computing device 816.
- the first hazard detector 400 can provide the second hazard detector 1002 with the pairing code 1802 through the local device network 1602. Also, some embodiments may exchange cryptographic keys between the second hazard detector 1002 and the cloud server 164 (e.g. symmetric key keys, public/private key pairs, etc.) such that future communications between the second hazard detector 1002 and the cloud server 164 can be encrypted.
- cryptographic keys between the second hazard detector 1002 and the cloud server 164 (e.g. symmetric key keys, public/private key pairs, etc.) such that future communications between the second hazard detector 1002 and the cloud server 164 can be encrypted.
- the second hazard detector 1002 has been (1) provisioned on the home Wi-Fi network 1604, (2) provisioned on the local device network 1602, (3) authenticated with the mobile computing device 816, and (4) paired and added to the user account 1004 on the cloud server 164. All of these operations have been done requiring only a few user inputs to the mobile computing device 816.
- To add the second hazard detector 1002 required selecting the provisioning device (e.g., the first hazard detector 400) if multiple smart home devices are available, and pushing the user input buttons on the first hazard detector 400 and the second hazard detector 1002.
- the user is spared from having to switch Wi-Fi networks or otherwise alter the settings of the mobile computing device 816, entering Wi-Fi passwords, or any other relatively cumbersome and error-prone procedure.
- the only code that needs to be entered to add the second hazard detector 1002 is the second device code 1120, which can easily be scanned via the QR code using a camera or other optical sensor on the mobile computing device 816.
- Some embodiments may present a few additional steps in the installation process after the device has been paired and provisioned as described above. For example, some embodiments may allow the user to specify a location within the enclosure 150 where the second hazard detector 1002 is installed. This process may follow the description of FIGS. 8Q-8U above, where the user is presented with a number of predefined locations, such as a child bedroom, a living room, a master bedroom, a dining room, a basement, and/or the like, and allowed to select from the predefined list. Additionally, the user may be allowed to enter a custom location using a text input of the mobile computing device 816. The location specified by the user (e.g.
- the kitchen may be used to differentiate the second hazard detector 1002 from other hazard detectors in the enclosure 150. This location may also be “spoken” by the second hazard detector 1002 during operation when a hazard is detected (e.g. "heads up, there's smoke in the kitchen”).
- FIGS. 19A-C illustrate some optional final steps for completing installation of the second hazard detector 1002, according to some embodiments.
- FIG. 19A allows the user to enable or disable a "Pathlight" feature. Some embodiments of the second hazard detector 1002 may allow for a low-intensity light option to be used as a nightlight when motion is detected by the second hazard detector 1002 or by another nearby smart home device in the local device network.
- FIG. 19B illustrates an interface that may be displayed while the second hazard detector 1002 is being paired with the user account 1004 at the cloud server 164. Because the process involves communicating through the Internet, and because adding the second hazard detector 1002 to the user account 1004 may take upwards of one minute, this interface can be displayed such that the user knows the process is not yet complete but still progressing.
- FIG. 19C illustrates an interface that informs the user that the setup process is complete and successful.
- This interface also allows the user to optionally install additional smart home devices. If the user chooses to install another device, the setup process may be further streamlined.
- the installation process for a subsequent smart home device may be limited to scanning/entering the new device code.
- a user may purchase a new security system that is comprised of multiple sensor units. Each of the sensor units for the security system can be installed one-after-the-other using this feature with minimal required user input.
