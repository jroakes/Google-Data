Embodiment
This document generally describes protect data from unwarranted access.User is typically based on for accessing certain number
According to application program level of comfort, and whether user thinks that application program needs some data to provide good user's body
The a variety of causes tested, user authorize and refused application program and access certain form of data (for example, position data and picture)
" authority ".User may expect to refuse application program and access the authorities of certain types of data to prevent the application program from visiting
Data are asked, but then may not be this if data are embedded in the another type of information that application program is authorized to
Kind situation.
Fig. 1, which is shown, prevents mechanism of the data by unwarranted access.Assuming that user is on his smart phone
Download and be mounted with the picture editor's program 102 for allowing user to edit image (for example, by applying " filter " to image).Pacifying
During dress, can prompt user's designated pictures edit routine 102 whether by with access by the pictures management program 104 in equipment
The authority of the picture of storage.User can select to be deposited by pictures management program 104 to access to picture editor's program 102 " authority "
The picture of storage.It can also prompt whether user's designated pictures edit routine 102 should have the authority for obtaining geographical location information,
But user may not think that picture editor's program 102 needs to access the position of user, and it therefore can refuse picture editor
Program 102 accesses determines data that program 106 provides as geographical position (shown in the arrow 110 in Fig. 1).
On the other hand, user can provide to access to photo-managing program 104 determines what program 106 generated by geographical position
The authority of position data (shown in the arrow 112 in Fig. 1).Because access geographic position data is awarded in pictures management program 102
114 authority, thus pictures management program 104 can any given at the time of using geographic position data 114 to working as
The image 108a-c of the new shooting of front position is marked." make in fact, the expression of the picture 108a in Fig. 1 includes text
Person ", " time " and " position ", indicating picture storage identification picture author, shooting the time of picture and obtaining the position of picture
The metadata put.
If picture editor's program 102 receives the image 108 with its geographical position metadata, problem is likely to occur,
Because user does not authorize the authority that picture editor's program 102 accesses geographical location metadata.Picture editor's program 102 is from receiving
Picture in parse position data may not be typical, but by honest or malice design, picture editor's program 102 can
To be able to access that position data and send it to remote computing system.Now, user may lose to his or her
The control of position data is managed, geographical position determines program 106 even if user may refuse the access of picture editor's program 102
Authority.It is possible that the problem, because permission system may be intended to prevent the point-to-point transmission of information (for example, preventing from believing
Breath from geographical position determines that program 106 is sent to picture editor's program 102), rather than tracking information life cycle (for example,
By tracking once serving data to the program of correct certification, there occurs what for geographic position data 114).
Technology discussed herein may can identify picture editor's program 102 without the authority for accessing positional information
(at least when it is from location-based service PROGRAMMED REQUESTS), but picture editor's program 102 has requested that the figure for accessing and including positional information
Piece.Therefore, at least without user is notified or from the case that the user of authorized transmissions picture receives input, in computing system
Another program performed on (for example, sub-component of operating system) can take action to prevent picture editor's application program 102
Access the positional information in picture.As described in following example, computing system be present and identify that authorization data is embedded in not at it
Adaptable multiple technologies during authorized data.
In the first example (as shown in the arrow 120 in Fig. 1), computing system can peel off positional information from image 108a
With the image 116a of generation modification, and the image 116a of modification is supplied to picture editor's program 102.As shown in figure 1, calculate system
System can leave other metadata (for example, time of the author of image and acquisition picture) in the picture.In some instances, may be used
With the stripping of automatic execution position metadata.In other words, ask to scheme from pictures management program 104 in picture editor's program 102
As after 108a, computing system can be in the case where not receiving the specified user's input that remove location metadata from image
Peel off location metadata.
As the second example (as shown in the arrow 122 in Fig. 1), computing system can prevent picture editor's program 102 complete
Site preparation accesses picture.For example, picture editor's program 102 may have requested that multiple picture 108a-c batch imports, still
The subset of these files may be only received, because another component of computing system may prevent the picture comprising positional information
Transmission.As an example, the photo library in picture editor's program 102 can only show the subset of picture in the picture library of user.
Computing system may or may not provide user's notice that picture editor's program 102 can not access one or more pictures.One
In a little examples, (in addition to by authorizing picture editor's program 102 to determine the authority of the request data of program 106 from geographical position)
User may not rewrite the prevention for preventing picture editor's program 102 from accessing the picture with position data.
As the 3rd example (as shown in the arrow 124 in Fig. 1), computing system can generate image 116b copy, and
And replace positional information metadata using identifier in copy.The value of identifier may not specified geographic location, but can be with
Time point afterwards parses original geographical location information using identifier (if for example, user is with backward picture editor's journey
Sequence 102 is authorized from geographical position and determines that program 106 asks the authority of position data).
In this example, identifier may be considered that the pointer for being directed to positional information, and the component of computing system can
To reconcile whether picture editor's program 102 is able to access that the information pointed to by identifier.This can be completed with least two ways.
When the request of picture editor's program 102 accesses (identified symbol is replaced) location metadata, computing system can (1) inspection
User whether authorized picture editor's program 102 from geographical position determine program 106 obtain position data authority (for example,
Authorize geographical position determine that program 106 is successfully responding to the request of picture editor's program 102), or (2) send user specify be
No picture editor's program 102 should access (rather than authorizes picture editor's journey using the prompting in the geographical position of identifier mark
Sequence 102 utilizes the global authority of any picture access positional information at any time).In order to realize such identifier resolution, meter
Calculation system can store one or more tables that each identifier can be mapped to its position data and control to positional number
According to access associated rights (for example, controlling whether that picture editor's program 102 successfully can determine program from geographical position
The priority assignation of 106 request position datas).
As the 4th example (as shown in arrow 126), computing system can prompt user to specify how to handle in picture
The presence of positional information.In this example, computing system has determined that image 108a includes positional information, and picture editor's journey
Sequence 102, which does not have from geographical position, determines that program 106 asks the authority of such information, but substitutes and simply remove positional number
According to (the first example), prevent the access (the second example) to image or replace position data (the 3rd example), meter using identifier
Calculation system is for example allowed a user to specify to what image does by the way that the user interface with user's selectable option is presented.
It is the mobile device 202 in Fig. 2A that can select the example user interface of one of these options by its user input
The user interface 204 shown.User interface 204 in the example is to include illustrating user's selectable option 206,208 and 210
The dialog box of text, and prompt the region on touch-screen of the user for example by pressing mobile device 202 to select these choosings
One of, these regions correspond to the display for the graphical interface element for being used for corresponding option.
Option 206,208 and 210 allows users to specify computing system (a) application program should be allowed to access figure respectively
Picture, even if image includes the position data (option 206) being embedded in image, (b) is supplying images to picture editor's program
Before 102, position data (option 208), or (c) while denied access image (option 210) are removed from image.It can provide
Other options, including for being not only photo current and all successive images being carried out with the option of above-mentioned action.
In some embodiments, user can be by interface 204 or another display interface come given filter device, with application
All pictures or all remaining pictures in the image collection stored by pictures management program 104.For example, user's input can be with
Computing system is specified only for being in or be not in the picture of a certain opening position (for example, outside one mile of the family away from user or mobile
The picture of the current location of equipment) using the action (for example, one in above-mentioned action a, b and c) specified, and/or only for
Meet or be unsatisfactory for the picture (for example, the picture shot before more than 30 minutes) of engineered time standard.Therefore, user can specify
Computing system only when picture be not be taken recently and not near the family of user or mobile device current location quilt
Positional information is allowed to be delivered to picture editor's program 102 from pictures management program 104 during shooting.
Fig. 2 B show user interface 252, can be specified by its user and authorize application-specific (for example, picture is compiled
Volume program 102) authority.In some instances, computing device 202 can be shown in by user's selection by computing device 202
Setting menu in icon come presentation user interface 252, and computing device 202 can be provided in computing device 202
The user interface similar with what is shown in fig. 2b of each (or at least multiple) application program of upper execution.
In this example, the chosen authority for checking picture editor's program 102 of user, and it is each in row 254a-g
The single authority of individual mark picture editor program 102.For example, the row 254a for position authority includes user interface elements
256a, it can be dialled by its user enabling between disabled status (also referred to as authorize and refuse elsewhere in the disclosure)
The priority assignation of dynamic location-based service feature.In this example, user can pass through the area for the touch-screen for pressing display element 256a
Priority assignation is stirred in domain, but can replace element 256a with one or more different types of optional elements of user.
In some instances, be not each application program have their own allow users to specify the program authority
User interface, but each authority can have the user for allowing users to specify the authority credentials of multiple programs of their own
Interface.For example, there may be the user interface of entitled " position authority ", it includes each being used in multiple distinct programs
Row, where each row include and the similar or like optional element shown in Fig. 2 B.
Fig. 3 is shown for protecting data from the system of unwarranted access.In this illustration, computing system 302
Any one of various types of computing systems can be represented.For example, its can be smart phone, it is tablet personal computer, on knee
Computer, desktop computer, server system or its combination or variant.In this illustration, computing system 302 can with figure
The computing device 202 of 2A-B descriptions is identical.
Computing system 302 determines system 306 and data protection system 308 including authority wherein.The two systems can be with
In application program 320a-c outside, and it is a part for operating system 304 in some embodiments.In other words, by
Authority determine the operation that system 306 and data protection system 308 perform can not be application program 320a-c a part (and
Can not be by these programme-control), some of them can be third party application, and it is in response to user from application on site market
It is middle to select to be used for the program for downloading (and being likely to purchase), it is downloaded to computing system 302.Third party application can be by with
The application program of the different developer's exploitation of the developer of operating system 304.
Authority determines that system 306 can be the component of computing system 304, and it manages which which application program is able to access that
The data of type.For example, authority determines that the user interface 252 shown in Fig. 2 B can be presented in system 306, and user can be solicited
Input, it is that each application program specifies whether the application program is able to access that certain form of data.Authority determines system 306
It can adjust whether application-specific is able to access that certain types of data.As an example it is supposed that picture editor's program 102 is logical
Cross to geographical position and determine that program 106 (Fig. 1) sends request to attempt to access geographic position data 114.Therefore, authority determines system
System 306 may need to provide determines program 106 for this request to reach geographical position, or determines journey for geographical position
Sequence 106 is to respond the mandate of the request.
As an example, before the request that picture editor's program 102 sends to geographic position data 114, picture editor's journey
Sequence 102 can determine the request permissions of system 306 to authority.As another example, authority determines that system 306 can be intercepted from figure
Some or all requests to geographic position data 114 of piece edit routine 102 (and other programs).If picture editor's program
102 (being based on user's specified power) have the authority of request geographic position data 114, then authority determines that system 306 can incite somebody to action
The request is forwarded to geographical position and determines program 106.Otherwise, authority determines that system 306 can not forward positional information is asked
Ask.
In some instances, geographical position determines that program 106 receives from picture editor's program 102 positional information is asked
Ask, but geographical position determines that program 106 determines that system 306 communicates with authority, is visited with identifying whether picture editor's program 102 has
Ask the authority of geographic position data 114.In this example, if authority determines that system 306 indicates that picture editor's program 102 has
The authority of data as access, then geographical position determine that program 106 can be returned only to geographic position data 114.
In this example, authority determines that system 306 can reconcile the information transfer between various application program 320a-c.Should
It can be the third party application downloaded from application program market with each in program 320a-c, or can be advance
The application program of a part in computing system 302 or as operating system.For example, geographical position determines program 106
(Fig. 1), pictures management program 104 (Fig. 1) and picture editor's program 102 (Fig. 1) can be application program 320a-c examples.
Although some authorities may seem to control the access to one group of data (for example, photo) rather than application program,
But authority determines that the conciliation of access of the system 306 to the data can be related to the application program of Access Management Access data.As showing
, the pictures management program in Fig. 1 is described as managing the access to picture 108a-c.Therefore, the application program in Fig. 3
320a-c is shown as being connected with data 322a-c using arrow.However, authority determines that system 306 not always needs control pair
Access as one group of application program and related data.On the contrary, in some instances, authority determines that system 306 can be reconciled
Only access the data of one group of storage or data of the information without accessing one group of storage only as caused by application program.
In some embodiments, authority determines the point between two programs that system 306 is configured as on control device
The authority (potentially determining system 306 using the authority of interception and conciliation request) of point to-point communication.In other words, denied access by
First program authority of the certain types of data of the second Program Generating includes the first program of refusal from the second PROGRAMMED REQUESTS data
Ability (or at least obtaining the response of the request to the data including request).However, once certain types of data have been fitted
The 3rd program is given in locality, and authority determines that system 306 can be not adapted to track the certain types of data, and the 3rd
Whether program can transmit the data to other application.
The recognition application of data protection system 308, which is try to access, to be included application program and not to have the data of access rights
Information, and solve to conflict.The operation of data protection system 308 at least in part by analyzer 310, data remover 312,
Data replacer 314 and user's prompting device 316 perform.
Analyzer 310 recognizes whether to be specified for the authority by the information that application program accesses and the application program
Between conflict.For example, analyzer 310 can not have the authority for accessing certain types of data with recognition application, still
Information is obtained from the another application with the data for accessing the type.(this analysis is it is also conceivable to identification other applications are
The information of the no data for once accessing the type, the journal file of the current and past priority assignation of such as records application program with
And the interim rewriting of priority assignation.) in this case (for example, when determine another application program can with or can once access
During other kinds of data), analyzer 310 can parse the information received from other applications, specified and be used for identification
Whether the file of transmission includes certain types of data.(if two application programs can access data, or two applications
Program can not all access data, then analyzer 310 can be configured as not parsing information, to reduce the data that must be resolved
Amount).Can by determine any data whether be located at information in ad-hoc location (for example, " position " metadata in picture
In field) or certain type of information whether in the information (for example, data are to construct in some way, such as with certain
Length or form, some character, some contents etc. of some position) perform the analysis.
Certain group information (for example, file) do not had into access right labeled as including request applications in response to data-analyzing machine
The data (authority that can not directly obtain data from its source according at least to specified request application) of limit, one or more data are moved
Except device 312, data replacer 314 and user's prompting device 316 are called.As described on arrow 120 (Fig. 1), data remover
312 peel off any data forbidden from information.As described on arrow 124 (Fig. 1), data replacer 314 utilizes identifier
Replace the data forbidden.As described on arrow 126 (Fig. 1), user's prompting device 126 prompts user to specify computing system logarithm
According to taking which type of action.
Fig. 4 A-B are shown for protecting data from the flow chart of the process of unwarranted access.
In frame 402, computing system provides user interface, can specify whether the first application program has by its user input
There is the authority for accessing first kind data and Second Type data.For example, the authority of computing system determines that system 306 (Fig. 3) can
To show user interface 252 (Fig. 2 B).
In frame 404, computing system receives user's input, and its specified application is without the data for accessing the first kind
Authority.For example, user's input can be interacted with the element 256a of user interface 252 (Fig. 2 B) and " closed so that element 256a is toggled it to
Close " state, do not have with designated pictures edit routine 102 and access the position data that program is at least determined directly from geographical position
The authority of (for example, geographic position data 114).
In frame 406, computing system receives the user's input for the data for specifying the first application program to access Second Type.
For example, user's input can be interacted with the element 256e of user interface 252 (Fig. 2 B) so that element 256e is toggled it into " opening " shape
State, picture (for example, picture 108A-C) to be accessed with designated pictures edit routine 102.The data of Second Type can be by second
Application program (being in this example pictures management program 104) manages or modification.
In frame 408, computing system provides second user interface, and by its user input the second application program can be specified to be
The no authority with the data for accessing the first kind.For example, the user interface shown in similar to Fig. 2 B can be presented in computing system,
But (and therefore allow user to set specific to picture for pictures management program 104 rather than picture editor's program 102 and compile
Collect the authority of program 102).
In frame 410, computing system receives the user's input for the data for specifying the second application program to access the first kind.
For example, user's input can with similar to the above-mentioned user interface interaction (but being used for pictures management program 104) shown in Fig. 2 B,
To set "Yes" authority for position data.In this example, the second application program has the data for editing above-mentioned Second Type
The ability of (for example, picture).Therefore, can access the data (for example, position data) of the above-mentioned first kind second applies journey
The data of the first kind can be inserted into the data (for example, picture) for the Second Type that application program can access by sequence.
In frame 412, computing system determines to whether there is conflict between the data type that application program is able to access that.In other words
Say, computing system can determine whether the first application program has the power that a type of data are accessed from the second application program
Limit, and the data whether the second application program is able to access that the first application program and does not have access rights (or can once access
Data).Such determination can be used as determining whether data, the quilt for checking the first uncommitted access of application by computing system
Specify the basis of the information for being sent to the first application from the second application.In the case of no above-mentioned determination, computing system
(for example, data protection system 308) can allow data to be sent to the first application program from the second application program, without analysis
The information of unwarranted data.
In frame 414, as determining to exist conflict (and therefore for example should check information with the basis of file one by one)
Result, the data that computing system receives Second Type will be sent to the instruction of the first application program from the second application program.
For example, when these applications have conflict priority assignation, data protection system 308 or its component (for example, analyzer 310) can be with
As the clearing house carried out data transmission between applications.Analyzer 310 can be by receiving the data transmitted between applications
Transmit and these data transfers (or biography stopped to intended destination is analyzed before its intended destination is forwarded it to
It is defeated) perform this operation.Analyzer 310 can also by send request source application provide "Yes" or "No" response come
Check whether intended destination application program has and access the authorities of certain types of data to perform this operation.
In frame 416, computing system determines that the first application program has access rights and to be supplied to the first application program
The data of Second Type whether include the data of the first kind.For example, analyzer 310 (Fig. 3) can analyze Second Type
The example of data (for example, particular picture), to identify whether it includes the example of the data of the first kind (for example, positional number
According to).Analyzer 310 can be configured as based on its position in Second Type data (for example, the certain field positioned at file
In) or the data of the first kind are identified based on content (for example, by with some features).If analyzer 310 identifies
The data of Second Type do not include the data of the first kind, then analyzer 310 can allow the data of Second Type being supplied to
First application program, authorized without user (for example, without in information of first application requests from the second application program
The prompting occurred afterwards and before the first application program receive information and user response) (frame 418).Then, the process can
To be repeated for other examples of data.
In frame 420, whether the application program of computational system identification first has the authority for accessing first kind data.For example,
Data protection system 308 can identify whether picture editor's program 102 has the authority for accessing position data.In some embodiment party
In formula, if computing system has been carried out threshold of the operation of frame 412 as the data for being used to determine whether to analyze Second Type
Limit test, then the operation of frame 420 is probably unnecessary and is not carried out, as described in above for frame 416.In some implementations
In mode, the operation of frame 420 can be performed before the operation of frame 416 (such as so that computing system identify first using whether
A type of data can be accessed, then if response is "No", then check whether the data of the type are sending
In file).Therefore, frame 412 can be similar or identical with 420 operation, but be sent out at the diverse location of the process
It is raw.
In frame 422, computing system execution is acted to prevent from being included within Second Type in the case where no user authorizes
The data of the first kind in data are supplied to the first application program.As described on arrow 120,122,124 and 126 (Fig. 1),
Various types of actions that computing system is able to carry out be present.
In frame 424, computing system prevent the first application program receive Second Type data (its among other data
Also include the data of the first kind).For example, computing system, which can prevent picture editor's program 102 from accessing, includes positional information
Picture.In some instances, original application program (for example, pictures management application program 104) is sent to data protection system 308
Ask to identify whether to allow original application program that specific group information (for example, picture) is sent into destination application program (example
Such as, picture editor's program 102).In some instances, original program will send information to destination program, and data protection
System 308 intercepts and analyzes transmission, and with the ability for preventing transmission.
In frame 426, computing system removes the data of the first kind from the data of Second Type, and will remove first
The data of the Second Type of the data of type are supplied to application program.For example, data remover 312 (Fig. 3) can be by image
It is supplied to before picture editor's program 102 from picture 108a and peels off picture of the location metadata 114 as " removing " or modification
116b.Data remover 312 can by only removing location metadata 114, or by removed from picture all metadata come
Realize.In some embodiments, removing metadata includes inserting different metadata (for example, instruction original metadata is
The metadata removed from file, such as " FFFF ").
In frame 428, computing system provides the user interface of data of the data including the first kind of instruction Second Type, and
Although and receive the data including the first kind for specifying Second Type data whether will the data of Second Type be supplied to the
User's input of one application program.For example, computing system can be provided as shown in Figure 2 A and on the institute of arrow 126 in Fig. 1
The prompting 204 stated.User can provide user's input, and it is specified is supplied to destination to apply journey the information in original form
Sequence, wanting modification information, with stripping purpose application program does not have the data of access rights or prevented to destination application
Send information.
In frame 430, computing system replaces the data of the first kind using identifier, and the identifier is not the number of the first kind
According to, and computing system can have the access first kind in response to the first application program of instruction afterwards by the identifier
The user of the authority of data inputs and accesses the data (the specifically example) of the first kind.For example, in picture 108a
Location metadata can be replaced by pointer.If the user of computing system 302 changes picture editor's program at time point afterwards
Authority allow it to access positional information, then another component of picture editor's program 102 or computing system 302 can
Positional information 102 is retrieved using pointer.For example, when authority changes, data protection system 308 can be to the first application program
Communication is sent, or sends removed initial data or notifies the first application program pointer to be initial data and solved
Analysis.As an alternative, application program may can occasionally send to data protection system 308 and ask, to determine whether to be right
The initial data answered and any pointer is parsed.
Although it is for simplicity, that the picture for including position data shows the present disclosure describes the data that are sending
Example, but techniques described herein is not limited to the data of these types, and the technology can apply to many different fields
Scape.In other words, many application programs be present and not having permission to access, " incidentally " in the example of the data in other data.Example
Such as, picture, video or office documents (for example, text or electrical form) can include metadata, and the metadata includes mesh
Ground program may be without the time (for example, Time of Day) of access rights or author information.As another example, calendar event letter
Breath can include potential unwarranted position or pictorial information, and (or if request applications only need to know whether user does
It is commonplace, and require no knowledge about what the people doing, then even include the title or details of event).As another example, contact person
Information (for example, contact person in address book) can include potential unwarranted pictorial information, certain form of contact person believes
Breath and user's notes.
