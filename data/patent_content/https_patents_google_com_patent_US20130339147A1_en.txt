Definitions
- the World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly. Search engines assist users in locating desired portions of this information by cataloging web pages. Typically, in response to a user's request, the search engine returns references to documents relevant to the request.
- a web crawler is typically used to find and retrieve documents (e.g., web pages) on the web.
- the web crawler sends a request to, for example, a web server for a document, downloads the entire document, and then provides the document to an indexer.
- the indexer typically takes the text of the crawled document, extracts individual terms from the text, and sorts those terms (e.g., alphabetically) into a search index.
- the web crawler and indexer repeat this process as the web crawler crawls documents across the web.
- Each entry in the search index contains a term stored in association with a list of documents in which the term appears and the location within the document's text where the term appears.
- the search index thus, permits rapid access to documents that contain terms that match search terms of a user supplied search query.
- the indexer typically ignores common words, called stop words (e.g., the, is, on, or, of, how, why, etc.) when creating or updating the search index.
- stop words e.g., the, is, on, or, of, how, why, etc.
- Existing indexers create a single search index that contains terms extracted from all documents crawled on the web.
- search engines may base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search engine is to identify links to high quality, relevant results (e.g., web pages) based on the search query using the search index.
- the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to terms contained in the search index, and retrieving a list of documents associated with each matching term in the search index. Documents that contain the user's search terms are considered “hits” and are returned to the user.
- the “hits” returned by the search engine may be ranked among one another by the search engine based on some measure of the quality and/or relevancy of the hits.
- a basic technique for sorting the search hits relies on the degree with which the search query matches the hits. For example, documents that contain every term of the search query or that contain multiple occurrences of the terms in the search query may be deemed more relevant than documents that contain less than every term of the search query or a single occurrence of a term in the search query and, therefore, may be more highly ranked by the search engine.
- a device may include a memory configured to store instructions and a processor configured to execute the instructions to identify an advertisement based on a custom content search index, and provide the identified advertisement for display with custom content search results generated based on the custom content search index.
- a method may include causing an advertisement for custom content to be displayed in a document, where the document is unassociated with a provider of the custom content; and providing revenue or an advertising credit to an owner of the document in response to causing the advertisement to be displayed.
- a method may include providing advertisements when presenting a document relating to custom content of a custom content provider; and providing at least one advertisement relating to the custom content when presenting a document relating to something other than the customer content.
- the at least one advertisement is provided free of charge or at a reduced charge to the custom content provider.
- a method may include providing advertisements when presenting a document relating to custom content of a custom content provider; and sharing revenue from providing the advertisements with the custom content provider.

- Implementations described herein may permit a user to create their own corpora of customized content that may be accessed and searched by other users via a content searching service, such as, for example, Google Search.
- a content searching system may crawl the web to retrieve web content and then index the retrieved web content to create a web search index.
- a user may also upload or otherwise identify custom content to the content searching system, which may then index the custom content to create a custom search index that is different than the web search index.
- the custom search index may store information different from the information stored by the web search index.
- the custom search index may store a subset of the information stored in the web search index. In this case, it may be possible for the custom search index to store pointers to information in the web search index.
- the custom search index may store information that is not present in the web search index.
- the custom search index may be considered different from the web search index in the sense that the custom search index may be searchable separate from the web search index.
- Searching of custom content using the different custom search indexes may then be selectively permitted by users who may or may not have to be authenticated for the custom content that they wish to access and search.
- the custom content may be used in conjunction with a custom content business system.
- the custom content business system may provide different techniques for sharing revenue with custom content owners and aid custom content owners in attracting users to their content.
- a “document,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product.
- a document may include, for example, an e-mail, a website, a business listing, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, an advertisement, an image, a video, a digital map, etc.
- a common document is a web page.
- Documents often include textual information and may include embedded information (such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as Javascript, etc.).
- Content is to be broadly interpreted to include data that may or may not be in document form. Examples of content may include data associated with one or more documents, data in one or more databases, etc.
- Customer content is to be broadly interpreted to include content that has been uploaded by a user for indexing and/or content identified by a user for indexing.
- a “user,” as that term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include one or more people (e.g., a person, a group of people that may have some relationship (e.g., people associated with a business or organization), or a group of people with no formal relationship).
- people e.g., a person, a group of people that may have some relationship (e.g., people associated with a business or organization), or a group of people with no formal relationship).

- Other techniques for extracting and indexing content that are more complex than simple word-level indexing, may also be used, including techniques for indexing XML data, images, videos, etc.
- Each entry in a custom search index 130 may contain a term or other data stored in association with an item of content in which the term or other data appears and a location within the custom content where the term or other data appears.
- Custom search engine 520 may search custom search index(es) 130 , based on a received search query, to match terms of the search query with terms or other data contained in entries in custom search index(es) 130 . If custom search index(es) 130 includes multiple different custom search indexes, then custom search engine 520 may search, based on the received search query and, possibly, user authentication, selected ones of the different custom search indexes. Custom search engine 520 may retrieve a corresponding list of items of custom content from each entry in custom search index 130 that matches a term of the search query. The lists of items of content retrieved from one or more entries in custom search index 130 may be returned as custom search results 540 .

- FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary configuration of ad server 230 according to an exemplary implementation.
- Ad server 360 may include a content targeting system 600 , and a predictive marketing system 610 .
- Content targeting system 600 and predictive marketing system 610 may be implemented as software and/or hardware components within a single server entity, or as software and/or hardware components distributed across multiple server entities.
- Content targeting system 600 may target ads to users performing custom content searches.
- Content targeting system 600 may target ads based on, for example, custom search indexes 130 created for custom content 120 and/or on user behavior (e.g., user patterns, such as clicks, purchases, views, etc.), which may be obtained, for example, from user tracking system 360 .
- Stronger ad targeting metrics may appear in relation to custom content searches because users of custom content automatically segregate themselves from the rest of the population.
- ads it becomes possible for ads to be better targeted to users of certain custom content types. For example, subscribers to an automotive-content group are much more likely targets for ads relating to auto-care, auto-repair, etc.
- Advertisers could specifically target certain content groups (e.g., all public auto content), specific content (e.g., content for a particular hot-rod magazine), or even specific articles (e.g., only articles associated with engine care).
- content targeting system 600 can perform very specific ad targeting, allowing advertisers to target specific custom content or groups of custom content.
- this specific ad targeting allows for revenue sharing with content owners that did not previously have monetization strategies for their content. Content owners may, therefore, make their content available for ad targeting, which will provide the content owners with the ability to share in the revenues from the ads associated with their content (e.g., targeted impression-based ads or click-based ads).
- Predictive marketing system 610 may predict the value of showing an ad impression to a user. This predicted value may be used in providing ads (e.g., in deciding whether to show or not show a particular ad). Predictive marketing system 610 may provide (or act in cooperation with) an automated experimentation system that automatically creates random marketing campaigns to locate keywords for custom content search ads. The automated experimentation system may generate likely keywords based on searches users perform (received from, for example, usage tracking system 360 ), and may take into account other relevant metadata in the content, along with the purchase value of such content. Predictive marketing system 610 may then predict the value (e.g., predicted revenue) of showing the ad impression to the user and decide if the ad is actually worth showing.
- the value e.g., predicted revenue
- Content owners can also help guide predictive marketing system 610 by defining sets of possible keywords to target, as well as by creating promotional periods where content costs are reduced to users (this will, in effect, boost the expected utility to users).
- the promotional periods may involve a simple reduction in the cost of accessing the custom content or may provide coupons that reduce a user's cost of accessing the custom content. Because promotions would change the probability of purchases by users, these campaigns could have strong effects on the predictive model and predictive marketing system 610 's decision to show or not show ads.
- Predictive marketing system 610 may also cause ads to be displayed in a first custom owner's content for other related custom content based on the patterns of users of the other custom content.
- Content targeting system 600 and/or predictive marketing system 610 may cause ads to be shown based, for example, on an entire custom search index (e.g., a custom search index relating to dogs), a particular document (or documents) in a customer search (e.g., a document related to Labrador retrievers), and/or other information.
- Content prices can be directly shown to the user from the ad so the user can more easily decide if the content is valuable.
- Promotional periods e.g., coupons, lower prices, etc.
- a custom content owner may allow ads to be targeted to users that perform custom content searches (e.g., ads may be displayed on the same web page that provides custom content search results) and users that access the custom content owner's content (e.g., ads may be displayed on documents (e.g., articles) that are accessed by users).
- the content owner may share in the profit (e.g., with the ad provider) that is obtained from ad impressions and/to ad clicks.
- a content owner may simply want to make his/her content visible to a wider audience. For example, a content owner of a set of how-to articles may desire to market the articles to a wider audience without necessarily making significant profits.
- the content owner may allow ad server 230 to show ads during custom content searches and/or during access of documents associated with the content owner. The content owner may also allow the revenues from those ads to be fed back into the ad network as credits for advertisements.
- Ad server 230 may then auto-generate ads for the owner's custom content and mix the auto-generated ads with other potential ads. In this way, ad server 230 would provide ads that attract users to the owner's content via the ad network with the cost of these ads being fed by the proceeds of the ad impressions and/or ad clicks generated by the owner's content.
- FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate the above revenue sharing concept.

- Ad server 230 may cause ads for the NY Newspaper to be shown on a document providing web search results and/or other custom content search results (custom content searches of other content relating to or not relating to the NY Newspaper). In this way, ad server 230 may attract users to the NY Newspaper via the ads, without content owner 710 having to pay for the ads.
- referral bonuses may be provided to web site owners (e.g., web site owners whose content is highly related to customer content) that refer users to custom content.
- purchases are tracked back to a referring site (via standard browser referrer information or through other tracking systems) and the referring site may be provided with a portion of the revenue generated from those ads or ad credits, as described above.

Description
- The World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly. Search engines assist users in locating desired portions of this information by cataloging web pages. Typically, in response to a user's request, the search engine returns references to documents relevant to the request.
- A web crawler is typically used to find and retrieve documents (e.g., web pages) on the web. To retrieve a document from the web, the web crawler sends a request to, for example, a web server for a document, downloads the entire document, and then provides the document to an indexer. The indexer typically takes the text of the crawled document, extracts individual terms from the text, and sorts those terms (e.g., alphabetically) into a search index. The web crawler and indexer repeat this process as the web crawler crawls documents across the web. Each entry in the search index contains a term stored in association with a list of documents in which the term appears and the location within the document's text where the term appears. The search index, thus, permits rapid access to documents that contain terms that match search terms of a user supplied search query. To improve search performance, the indexer typically ignores common words, called stop words (e.g., the, is, on, or, of, how, why, etc.) when creating or updating the search index. Existing indexers create a single search index that contains terms extracted from all documents crawled on the web.
- Generally, search engines may base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user. The goal of the search engine is to identify links to high quality, relevant results (e.g., web pages) based on the search query using the search index. Typically, the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to terms contained in the search index, and retrieving a list of documents associated with each matching term in the search index. Documents that contain the user's search terms are considered “hits” and are returned to the user. The “hits” returned by the search engine may be ranked among one another by the search engine based on some measure of the quality and/or relevancy of the hits. A basic technique for sorting the search hits relies on the degree with which the search query matches the hits. For example, documents that contain every term of the search query or that contain multiple occurrences of the terms in the search query may be deemed more relevant than documents that contain less than every term of the search query or a single occurrence of a term in the search query and, therefore, may be more highly ranked by the search engine.
- According to one aspect, a device may include a memory configured to store instructions and a processor configured to execute the instructions to identify an advertisement based on a custom content search index, and provide the identified advertisement for display with custom content search results generated based on the custom content search index.
- According to another aspect, a method may include causing an advertisement for custom content to be displayed in a document, where the document is unassociated with a provider of the custom content; and providing revenue or an advertising credit to an owner of the document in response to causing the advertisement to be displayed.
- According to a further aspect, a method may include providing advertisements when presenting a document relating to custom content of a custom content provider; and providing at least one advertisement relating to the custom content when presenting a document relating to something other than the customer content. The at least one advertisement is provided free of charge or at a reduced charge to the custom content provider.
- According to an additional aspect, a method may include providing advertisements when presenting a document relating to custom content of a custom content provider; and sharing revenue from providing the advertisements with the custom content provider.

The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.
- Implementations described herein may permit a user to create their own corpora of customized content that may be accessed and searched by other users via a content searching service, such as, for example, Google Search. A content searching system may crawl the web to retrieve web content and then index the retrieved web content to create a web search index. A user may also upload or otherwise identify custom content to the content searching system, which may then index the custom content to create a custom search index that is different than the web search index. For example, the custom search index may store information different from the information stored by the web search index. In one implementation, the custom search index may store a subset of the information stored in the web search index. In this case, it may be possible for the custom search index to store pointers to information in the web search index. Alternatively, or additionally, the custom search index may store information that is not present in the web search index. Also, the custom search index may be considered different from the web search index in the sense that the custom search index may be searchable separate from the web search index.
- Searching of custom content using the different custom search indexes may then be selectively permitted by users who may or may not have to be authenticated for the custom content that they wish to access and search. The custom content may be used in conjunction with a custom content business system. For example, the custom content business system may provide different techniques for sharing revenue with custom content owners and aid custom content owners in attracting users to their content.
- A “document,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may include, for example, an e-mail, a website, a business listing, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, an advertisement, an image, a video, a digital map, etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page. Documents often include textual information and may include embedded information (such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as Javascript, etc.).
- “Content,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include data that may or may not be in document form. Examples of content may include data associated with one or more documents, data in one or more databases, etc.
- “Custom content,” as that phrase is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include content that has been uploaded by a user for indexing and/or content identified by a user for indexing.
- A “user,” as that term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include one or more people (e.g., a person, a group of people that may have some relationship (e.g., people associated with a business or organization), or a group of people with no formal relationship).
-
FIG. 1 is a diagram of an overview of an exemplary implementation described herein. As shown inFIG. 1 ,web content 100 may be retrieved using, for example, a web crawler (not shown). The web crawler may find and retrieve documents (e.g., web pages) stored on the web and extract content from the documents. For example, the web crawler may send a request to a web server for a document, download the entire document, and then provide the document to an indexer (not shown). The indexer may index the retrieved web content to create aweb search index 110. The indexer extracts text from the content of the crawled document, extracts individual terms or other data from the text, and sorts those terms or other data (e.g., alphabetically) intoweb search index 110. Other techniques for extracting and indexing content, that are more complex than simple word-level indexing, may also be used, including techniques for indexing extensible markup language (XML) data, images, videos, etc. Each entry inweb search index 110 may contain a term or other data stored in association with a list of documents in which the term or other data appears and the location within the document where the term or other data appears.Web search index 110 may subsequently be used to search for specific documents whose content matches asearch query 140. - As further shown in
FIG. 1 ,custom content 120 may also be obtained.Custom content 120 may include content uploaded by a user, content designated by the user as being part of its custom content (e.g., user designates one or more websites or web pages to be included in the user's custom content), web content that is available only to selected subscribers via subscription, or other types of content that may be aggregated and indexed separately from web search index 110 (e.g., the user or entity may designate websites or web pages that contain content about a selected topic as being included in the user's custom content). An indexer (not shown) may index the obtained custom content to create acustom search index 130 that may be different than web search index 110 (e.g.,custom search index 130 may include information different fromweb search index 110 and/orcustom search index 130 may be searchable separate from web search index 110). The indexer may take the text or other data fromcustom content 120, extract individual terms or other data fromcustom content 120, and sort those terms or other data (e.g., alphabetically) intocustom search index 130. Other techniques for extracting and indexing content, that are more complex than simple word-level indexing, may also be used, including techniques for indexing XML data, images, videos, etc. Each entry incustom search index 130 may contain a term or other data stored in association with a location withincustom content 120 where the term or other data appears.Custom search index 130 may subsequently be used to search for specific content ofcustom content 120 that matches asearch query 140.Custom search index 130 may include multiple custom search indexes (not shown), each being associated with a different corpus of custom content. - Search engine(s) 150 may receive
search query 140 and may selectively search eitherweb search index 110 or custom search index 130 (or multiple different custom search indexes), or may search bothweb search index 110 and custom search index 130 (or other different custom search indexes), usingsearch query 140. A search ofweb search index 110 by search engine(s) 150 may returnweb search results 160 that matchsearch query 140. A search ofcustom search index 130 by search engine(s) 150 may returncustom search results 170 that matchsearch query 140. Web search results 160 andcustom search results 170 may be represented together or separately with a search result document, as will be described below. - A custom
content business system 180 may work in conjunction withcustom search index 130 and/or custom search results 170. For example, customcontent business system 180 may act in cooperation with an ad server (not shown) to target ads to users that are searching and/or accessingcustom content 120. Moreover, customercontent business system 180 may also act in cooperation with the ad server to provide ads as part of a predictive marketing scheme. Customcontent business system 180 may, in some implementations, allow for revenue from ads to be shared with content owners. -
FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of anetwork 200 in which systems and methods described herein may be implemented.Network 200 may includemultiple clients 205 connected to acontent searching system 210, data server(s) 220, and anad server 230 via anetwork 240. Twoclients 205, onecontent searching system 210, one or more data server(s) 220, and onead server 230 have been illustrated as connected to network 240 for simplicity. In practice, there may be more or fewer clients, content searching systems, data servers, and/or ad servers. Also, in some instances, aclient 205 may perform one or more functions ofcontent searching system 210, data server(s) 220, and/orad server 230, andcontent searching system 210, data server(s) 220, and/orad server 230 may perform one or more functions ofclient 205. -
Clients 205 may include client entities. An entity may be defined as a device, such as a personal computer, a wireless telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a laptop, or another type of computation or communication device, a thread or process running on one of these devices, and/or an object executable by one of these devices.Clients 205 may implement a browser for browsing documents stored at data server(s) 220.Clients 205 may also use the browser for accessingcontent searching system 210 to search documents (e.g., web content) associated with data server(s) 220 and/or custom content, as described further below. -
Content searching system 210 may include one or more hardware and/or software components that access, fetch, index, search, and/or maintain general web documents and/or custom content documents.Content searching system 210 may implement a data aggregation service by crawling a corpus of documents (e.g., web pages) hosted on data server(s) 220, indexing the documents, and storing information associated with these documents in a repository of crawled documents. The aggregation service may be implemented in other ways, such as by agreement with the operator(s) of data server(s) 220 to distribute their documents via the data aggregation service. - Data server(s) 220 may store or maintain documents that may be browsed by
clients 205, or may be crawled bycontent searching system 210. Such documents may include data related to published news stories, products, images, user groups, geographic areas, or any other type of data. For example, data server(s) 220 may store or maintain news stories from any type of news source, such as, for example, the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time magazine, or Newsweek. As another example, server(s) 230 may store or maintain data related to specific products, such as product data provided by one or more product manufacturers. As yet another example, server(s) 230 may store or maintain data related to other types of web documents, such as pages of web sites (e.g., web content). -
Ad server 230 may serve advertisements for display to users ofclients 205. Information regarding the advertisements may be transmitted with search results or, in some implementations, may be displayed in web pages hosted by third parties. In one implementation, the advertisements may include advertisements for custom-search content. - While
content searching system 210, data server(s) 220, andad server 230 are shown as separate entities, it may be possible for one ofcontent searching system 210, data server(s) 220, orad server 230 to perform one or more of the functions of the other one ofcontent searching system 210, data server(s) 220, orad server 230. For example, it may be possible thatcontent searching system 210, data server(s) 220, and/orad server 230 are implemented as a single entity. It may also be possible for a single one ofcontent searching system 210, data server(s) 220, and/orad server 230 to be implemented as two or more separate (and possibly distributed) devices. -
Network 240 may include one or more networks of any type, including a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), an intranet, the Internet or a combination of networks. The PLMN(s) may further include a packet-switched sub-network, such as, for example, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD), or Mobile IP sub-network.Clients 205,content searching system 210, data server(s) 220, andad server 230 may connect to network 240 via wired and/or wireless connections. -
FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram ofcontent searching system 210. As shown inFIG. 3 ,content searching system 210 may include aweb search unit 300, a customcontent search unit 310, anindex database 320, asecurity unit 330, anaccounting unit 340, aresult formatter 350, and a usage tracking system 360 interconnected withnetwork 240 via a bus and/or network 370.Web search unit 300, customcontent search unit 310,security unit 330,accounting unit 340,result formatter 350, and usage tracking system 360 may be implemented as software and/or hardware components within a single server entity, or as software and/or hardware applications distributed across multiple server entities. -
Web search unit 300 may crawl documents (e.g., containing web content) stored at data server(s) 220, index the crawled documents to create aweb search index 110, and search the crawled documents using the web search index. Customcontent search unit 310 may obtain custom content, such as, for example, content uploaded from users, content designated by the user as being part of its custom content (e.g., the user designates one or more web sites or web pages to be included in the user's custom content), content obtained from sources that require subscriptions for access to the content, and/or content on a given topic that may be obtained and aggregated from multiple sources, index the content in separate custom search indexes to create multiple differentcustom search indexes 130 and search the custom content using one or more of the different custom search indexes. -
Index database 320 may store aweb search index 110 and one or morecustom search indexes 130.Index database 320 may storeweb search index 110 and the one or morecustom search indexes 130 as different data structures that may be searched independently of one another. Alternatively,index database 320 may store one or morecustom search indexes 130 within the same data structure asweb search index 110 in a manner that they may be searched independently of one another. Each ofcustom search indexes 130 may include multiple index entries, with each entry containing a term stored in association with an item of custom content in which the term appears, and a location within the custom content's text where the term appears. A custom search engine may searchcustom search indexes 130, based on a received search query, to match terms of the search query with terms contained in entries incustom search indexes 130. -
Security unit 330 may authenticate users desiring to upload custom content to customcontent search unit 310 and/or may authenticate users desiring to search one or morecustom content indexes 130 associated with custom content.Security unit 330 may authenticate users by passing authentication tokens to the users which define the custom search indexes that are accessible by a particular user, and may contain security keys to permit encryption for sensitive information.Security unit 330 may authenticate users and authorize customcontent search unit 310 to permit access to selected custom search indexes to the authenticated users. -
Accounting unit 340 may establish and modify user access rights, may record and report user access to selected custom search indexes, may obtain feedback from users accessing given custom search indexes, and/or may track and control access to given custom search indexes based on whether users have subscribed to the custom search indexes. -
Result formatter 350 may return search results obtained fromweb search unit 300 and/or customcontent search unit 310 in a formatted and organized manner.Result formatter 350 may combine custom content search results together with web content search results in a way that is meaningful to the user (e.g., in a hypertext markup language (HTML) page). - Usage tracking system 360 may track usage patterns of
custom content 120 to permit content providers to determine what custom content is being viewed, clicked, purchased, etc. for pricing and/or marketing purposes. Usage patterns may also aid in rankingcustom content 120, and/or in determining what content is potentially more useful or valuable to users (e.g., for the purposes of promoting certain content to certain users). Usage tracking system 360 may promote content providers and/orcustom content 120, determined to be valuable, in advertisements (e.g., via an advertising system), and/or in custom search results 170. - Bus and/or network 370 may include a communication path, such as, for example, a system bus or a network that permits
web search unit 300, customcontent search unit 310,security unit 330,accounting unit 340,result formatter 350, and usage tracking system 360 to communicate with one another. - Although
FIG. 3 shows exemplary components ofcontent searching system 210. In other implementations,content searching system 210 may include fewer or additional components than depicted inFIG. 3 . In still other implementations, one or more components ofcontent searching system 210 may perform the tasks performed by other components ofcontent searching system 210. -
FIG. 4 is an exemplary diagram ofweb search unit 300. As shown inFIG. 4 ,web search unit 300 may include aweb crawler 400, aweb content indexer 410, aweb search index 110, and aweb search engine 420. -
Web crawler 400 may find and retrieve web content 430 (e.g., web documents) and provide the retrievedweb content 430 toweb content indexer 410. For example,web crawler 400 may send a request to a web server for a web document, download the entire web document, and then provide the web document toweb content indexer 410.Web content indexer 410 may indexweb content 430 to createweb search index 110. For example,web content indexer 410 may take the text or other data of a given crawled document, extract individual terms or other data from the text of the document, and sort those terms or other data (e.g., alphabetically) inweb search index 110. Other techniques for extracting and indexing content, that are more complex than simple word-level indexing, may also be used, including techniques for indexing XML data, images, videos, etc. Each entry inweb search index 110 may contain a term or other data stored in association with a list of documents in which the term or other data appears and the location within the document where the term or other data appears. -
Web search engine 420 may searchweb search index 110, based on a received search query, to match terms of the search query with terms or other data (e.g., video, images, etc.) contained in entries inweb search index 110.Web search engine 420 may retrieve a corresponding list of documents from each entry inweb search index 110 that matches a term of the search query. The lists of documents retrieved from one or more entries inweb search index 110 may be returned as web search results 440. In one implementation, each result ofweb search results 440 may include a uniform resource locator (URL) associated with a corresponding search result document and, possibly, a snippet of content extracted from the corresponding search result document. - Although
FIG. 4 shows exemplary components ofweb search unit 300, in other implementations,web search unit 300 may include fewer or additional components than depicted inFIG. 4 . In still other implementations, one or more components ofweb search unit 300 may perform the tasks performed by other components ofweb search unit 300. -
FIG. 5 is an exemplary diagram of customcontent search unit 310. As shown inFIG. 5 , customcontent search unit 310 may include a custom content upload Application Programmer Interface (API) 500 a, acustom content crawler 500 b, acustom content indexer 510, one or morecustom search indexes 130, acustom search engine 520, and a data delivery engine/content formatter 530. - Custom content upload
API 500 a may receivecustom content 120 uploaded from one or more users (e.g., one or more authenticated users). The uploaded content may include data of any type or format. In one implementation, the uploaded content may include meta-data (e.g., XML data). The meta-data may include content metadata with pointers to actual content. In another implementation, custom content uploadAPI 500 a may include a translation engine for translating any type or format of uploaded data into a particular type or format of data that can be more easily processed bycustom content indexer 510. Custom content uploadAPI 500 a may pass the receivedcustom content 120 tocustom content indexer 510. -
Custom content crawler 500 b may crawl specific content on the web to retrieve documents that may be indexed in a correspondingcustom search index 130. For example,custom content crawler 500 b may crawl available documents on the web containing content directed to a specific topic (e.g., dogs, football, etc.) or documents identified by a custom content provider.Custom content crawler 500 b may, in some implementations, need to be authenticated by content providers associated with specific custom content crawled on the web and/or one or more databases.Custom content crawler 500 b may pass the crawledcustom content 120 tocustom content indexer 510. -
Custom content indexer 510 may indexcustom content 120 to create custom search index(es) 130. For example,custom content indexer 510 may take the text or other data ofcustom content 120, extract individual terms from the text or other data ofcustom content 120, and sort those terms or other data (e.g., alphabetically) into a singlecustom search index 130. Other techniques for extracting and indexing content, that are more complex than simple word-level indexing, may also be used, including techniques for indexing XML data, images, videos, etc. Each entry in acustom search index 130 may contain a term or other data stored in association with an item of content in which the term or other data appears and a location within the custom content where the term or other data appears. -
Custom search engine 520 may search custom search index(es) 130, based on a received search query, to match terms of the search query with terms or other data contained in entries in custom search index(es) 130. If custom search index(es) 130 includes multiple different custom search indexes, thencustom search engine 520 may search, based on the received search query and, possibly, user authentication, selected ones of the different custom search indexes.Custom search engine 520 may retrieve a corresponding list of items of custom content from each entry incustom search index 130 that matches a term of the search query. The lists of items of content retrieved from one or more entries incustom search index 130 may be returned as custom search results 540. In one implementation, each result ofcustom search results 540 may include a URL associated with a corresponding search result document and, possibly, a snippet of content extracted from the corresponding search result document. - Data delivery engine/
content formatter 530 may receive the search results fromcustom search engine 520, format the search results into a meaningful data format (e.g., into an HTML document) that can be received and displayed by the user (e.g., via a web browser). Data deliver engine/content formatter 530 may customize the formatting of the search results (e.g., the content and visual format of the data) received fromcustom search engine 520 based on individual user preferences or based on the preferences of the user that uploaded/selected the custom content being searched. - Although
FIG. 5 shows exemplary components of customcontent search unit 310, in other implementations, customcontent search unit 310 may include fewer or additional components than depicted inFIG. 5 . In still other implementations, one or more components of customcontent search unit 310 may perform the tasks performed by other components of customcontent search unit 310. -
FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary configuration ofad server 230 according to an exemplary implementation. Ad server 360 may include acontent targeting system 600, and apredictive marketing system 610.Content targeting system 600 andpredictive marketing system 610 may be implemented as software and/or hardware components within a single server entity, or as software and/or hardware components distributed across multiple server entities. -
Content targeting system 600 may target ads to users performing custom content searches.Content targeting system 600 may target ads based on, for example,custom search indexes 130 created forcustom content 120 and/or on user behavior (e.g., user patterns, such as clicks, purchases, views, etc.), which may be obtained, for example, from user tracking system 360. Stronger ad targeting metrics may appear in relation to custom content searches because users of custom content automatically segregate themselves from the rest of the population. Thus, it becomes possible for ads to be better targeted to users of certain custom content types. For example, subscribers to an automotive-content group are much more likely targets for ads relating to auto-care, auto-repair, etc. Advertisers, as such, could specifically target certain content groups (e.g., all public auto content), specific content (e.g., content for a particular hot-rod magazine), or even specific articles (e.g., only articles associated with engine care). In this way,content targeting system 600 can perform very specific ad targeting, allowing advertisers to target specific custom content or groups of custom content. Moreover, this specific ad targeting allows for revenue sharing with content owners that did not previously have monetization strategies for their content. Content owners may, therefore, make their content available for ad targeting, which will provide the content owners with the ability to share in the revenues from the ads associated with their content (e.g., targeted impression-based ads or click-based ads). -
Predictive marketing system 610 may predict the value of showing an ad impression to a user. This predicted value may be used in providing ads (e.g., in deciding whether to show or not show a particular ad).Predictive marketing system 610 may provide (or act in cooperation with) an automated experimentation system that automatically creates random marketing campaigns to locate keywords for custom content search ads. The automated experimentation system may generate likely keywords based on searches users perform (received from, for example, usage tracking system 360), and may take into account other relevant metadata in the content, along with the purchase value of such content.Predictive marketing system 610 may then predict the value (e.g., predicted revenue) of showing the ad impression to the user and decide if the ad is actually worth showing. Content owners can also help guidepredictive marketing system 610 by defining sets of possible keywords to target, as well as by creating promotional periods where content costs are reduced to users (this will, in effect, boost the expected utility to users). The promotional periods may involve a simple reduction in the cost of accessing the custom content or may provide coupons that reduce a user's cost of accessing the custom content. Because promotions would change the probability of purchases by users, these campaigns could have strong effects on the predictive model andpredictive marketing system 610's decision to show or not show ads.Predictive marketing system 610 may also cause ads to be displayed in a first custom owner's content for other related custom content based on the patterns of users of the other custom content. -
Content targeting system 600 and/orpredictive marketing system 610 may cause ads to be shown based, for example, on an entire custom search index (e.g., a custom search index relating to dogs), a particular document (or documents) in a customer search (e.g., a document related to Labrador retrievers), and/or other information. Content prices can be directly shown to the user from the ad so the user can more easily decide if the content is valuable. Promotional periods (e.g., coupons, lower prices, etc.) can be reflected in prices shown to users and can also boost ad rankings because lower prices increase the likelihood that users would purchase the content. - The ability to perform custom content searches provides opportunities for content owners to profit in a number of different ways. For example, as described above, a custom content owner may allow ads to be targeted to users that perform custom content searches (e.g., ads may be displayed on the same web page that provides custom content search results) and users that access the custom content owner's content (e.g., ads may be displayed on documents (e.g., articles) that are accessed by users). The content owner may share in the profit (e.g., with the ad provider) that is obtained from ad impressions and/to ad clicks.
- Another type of revenue sharing scheme that may be employed is a zero-revenue, revenue sharing scheme. It is recognized that, in some situations, a content owner may simply want to make his/her content visible to a wider audience. For example, a content owner of a set of how-to articles may desire to market the articles to a wider audience without necessarily making significant profits. The content owner may allow
ad server 230 to show ads during custom content searches and/or during access of documents associated with the content owner. The content owner may also allow the revenues from those ads to be fed back into the ad network as credits for advertisements.Ad server 230 may then auto-generate ads for the owner's custom content and mix the auto-generated ads with other potential ads. In this way,ad server 230 would provide ads that attract users to the owner's content via the ad network with the cost of these ads being fed by the proceeds of the ad impressions and/or ad clicks generated by the owner's content. -
FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate the above revenue sharing concept. As illustrated inFIG. 7A , assume that acontent owner 710 provides a subscription-based newspaper (called “NY Newspaper”).Content owner 710 may allowad server 230 to show ads when users search theNY Newspaper 720 and when users view articles from theNY Newspaper 730. Instead of sharing in the revenue generated by the ads, assume thatcontent owner 710 receives ad credits fromad server 230 that may be used bycontent owner 720 to causead server 230 to serve ads for the NY Newspaper. As illustrated inFIG. 7B ,content owner 710 may use the ad credits, which causesad server 230 to provide ads for NY Newspaper and/or articles within NY Newspaper. InFIG. 7B ,ad server 230 causes an ad for the NY Newspaper to be shown on a document providing search results 740.Ad server 230 may cause ads for the NY Newspaper to be shown on a document providing web search results and/or other custom content search results (custom content searches of other content relating to or not relating to the NY Newspaper). In this way,ad server 230 may attract users to the NY Newspaper via the ads, withoutcontent owner 710 having to pay for the ads. - Yet another type of revenue sharing scheme that may be employed is a content referral scheme. In this scheme, referral bonuses may be provided to web site owners (e.g., web site owners whose content is highly related to customer content) that refer users to custom content. Thus, in this revenue sharing scheme, purchases are tracked back to a referring site (via standard browser referrer information or through other tracking systems) and the referring site may be provided with a portion of the revenue generated from those ads or ad credits, as described above.
-
FIG. 8 illustrates the above revenue sharing concept. As illustrated inFIG. 8 , assume that acontent owner 810 provides a subscription-based magazine (called “Hot Rod Magazine”).Content owner 810 may payad server 230 to present ads for its magazine. Assume that an owner of aweb site 820 that provides information regarding new car prices has entered into a revenue sharing agreement withad server 230. Thus,ad server 230 may show ads onweb site 820 and may share the revenue from the ads with (or provide ad credits to) the owner ofweb site 820. If a user accessesweb site 820,ad server 230 may show anad 830 for the Hot Rod Magazine and may share the revenue obtained fromcontent owner 810 with the owner ofweb site 820. -
FIG. 9 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for targeting ads for a custom content search. The process exemplified byFIG. 9 may be performed bycontent searching system 210,ad server 230, and/or other devices. As shown, processing may begin by receiving a search query for custom content (block 910). For example, a search query may be received from a client (e.g.,client 205 inFIG. 2 ) for a subscription-based on-line magazine. - A list of documents may be identified based on the search query (block 920). For example,
custom search engine 520 may search custom search index(es) 130 associated with the subscription-based on-line magazine, using the term(s) in the received search query, to match the terms of the search query with terms or other data contained in entries in custom search index(es) 130.Custom search engine 520 may retrieve a corresponding list of documents of custom content from each entry incustom search index 130 that matches a term of the search query. In some implementations, custom search engine 520 (or another device) may identify, prior to performing the search of custom search index(es) 130, users who have permission to access certain custom indexes via an authentication procedure or users who have subscribed to freely available custom indexes and only perform the search of custom search index(es) 130 if the user is permitted to search custom search index(es) 130. - One or more ads may be identified based on the search query (block 930). Ads may be identified based on custom search index(es) 130 (e.g., based on a topic of the custom search index(es) 130 or terms or other data located in custom search index(es) 130) associated with the subscription-based on-line magazine. Alternatively or additionally, ads may be identified based on one or more of the documents in the list of documents. Key word matching, prediction information obtained from user tracking (e.g., predictions based on users' patterns, such as clicks, purchases, views, etc.), and/or other techniques may be used to identify those ads that are relevant to custom search index(es) 130 and/or the one or more documents. In one implementation, advertisers may be allowed to bid on ads to be shown next to custom search results. For example, if ad auctioning is used, advertiser bidding may be used to set ad ranking In this situation, therefore, certain candidate ads may be selected over other candidate ads.
- The list of documents and the identified one or more ads may be provided to client 205 (block 940). The list of documents and the identified one or more ads may be displayed on a graphical user interface of
client 205. The ads may be set apart from the list of documents in the graphical user interface (e.g., as illustrated in the exemplary graphical user interface depicted inFIGS. 7A and 7B ). - Implementations described herein provide illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the implementations to the precise form disclosed.
