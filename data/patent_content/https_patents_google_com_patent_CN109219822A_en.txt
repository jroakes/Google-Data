Increase.
In addition, co-planar waveguide flux quanta bit allows couple to greater number of quantum bit.It is coupled to increase
The quantum bit quantity of typical follow current flux quanta bit, it is desirable that increase the face of superconducting loop associated with quantum bit
Product.However, with the increase of loop area, inductance associated with quantum bit increases sharply, thus the potentially amount of limiting
Sub- bit serviceability.In addition, it is contemplated that the Chimera graphics architectures typically used when using follow current quantum bit
Constraint, quantum processor may also be subjected to the limitation of the complexity of so-called imbedding problem (embedding problem).
On the contrary, the coupling of surface wave conduction amount quantum bit is the co-planar waveguide part by being inductively couple to quantum bit together
Come what is realized.Since waveguide is distributed its inductance and capacitor on macro length (for example, several millimeters), so inductance will not be with wave
The increase of long size and the quantity of quantum bit that quicklys increase, and therefore can couple can dramatically increase.In addition, one

Shown in coupler 218 have in the place that co-planar waveguide 210a and 210b intersect or co-planar waveguide 210b and 210c intersect it is straight
Angular distortion.Each coupler 218 passes through thin gap (for example, several microns order of magnitude) and adjacent waveguide lateral separation.Each coupling
Clutch 218 is also from coplanar ground plane physical separation.During operation, the energy from a waveguide (for example, 210a) can be felt
Superconducting thin film coupler 218 should be coupled to, then which is inductively couple to and is arranged in coupler component
Another waveguide (for example, waveguide 210b) near 218.
Although the co-planar waveguide of adjacent quantum bit is illustrated as in coupler to nearby overlapping each other in Fig. 2, wave
It leads and is not in electrical contact in these infalls actually.On the contrary, they (such as allow a wave in two waveguides using jumper wire device
Lead and cross bridging air bridges (cross-over air-bridge) of another waveguide without generating contact in infall) and that
This separation.Other designs for keeping waveguide intersected with each other in the case where no electrical contact can alternatively be used.
In order to simplify the drafting of complicated quantum bit coupling framework, Fig. 3 is also can be used in co-planar waveguide flux quanta bit

Neighbouring square 302 replaces.Waveguide 304 is shown as slender threads at either end with slight bending.For the sake of clarity,
Grounding connection and Josephson junction is omitted.Improved quantum bit couples framework
Use superconduction co-planar waveguide flux quanta bit and different coupled arrangements shown in Fig. 2, it is possible to be configured to grow
Scalable quantum processor architecture apart from quantum bit coupling.This framework can provide various advantages.For example, in some realities
It applies in mode, framework disclosed herein provides the increase of quantum bit density.As quantum bit density is higher, can indicate
With the wider and complexity solved the problems, such as.In some embodiments, identical or less with realization quantum bit density
Hardware required by other coupling frameworks is compared, and can use less amount of hardware (for example, coupler) between quantum bit
To realize the increase of quantum bit density.Hardware between quantum bit is fewer, and quantized system is regarded as having higher electricity
It leads or more not " rigidity ", that is to say, that it is easier to change between different quantum states, and falls into undesirable state
A possibility that it is lower.In some embodiments, the increase of density can be by being evenly spaced opening amount in coupling framework
Sub- bit is realized.By equally spaced quantum bit, the crosstalk between different quantum bits is more symmetrical, to simplify and be
Crosstalk computes and compensates in system.With the reduction that the calculating for computing and compensating crosstalk requires, can accommodate bigger therebetween
Amount of crosstalk, so that quantum bit be allowed to be positioned closer together.Quantum can be determined by the level of acceptable crosstalk
Bit can be spaced how close limitation.For example, in some cases, quantum bit interval is too close, so that crosstalk becomes very high, mend
Crosstalk is repaid as stubborn problem.The example limitation of acceptable amount of crosstalk includes the signal for example from quantum bit to be measured
1%.In some embodiments, coupling framework disclosed herein provides interconnectivity bigger between quantum bit, thus
Enable the stronger quantum computer of potential computing capability.Realize that the coupling framework of aforementioned advantages can be understood as with Gao Shukuan
With low diameter.
Further, since the exact magnitude for the other quantum bits maying be coupled to may be with computational problem to be solved
And change, if quantum processor architecture design provides flexibility in terms of the quantum bit for accommodating different number, this be can be
It is advantageous.That is, if quantum processor architecture be it is scalable, theoretically the design can be used to solve to require
The problem of any number of quantum bit.
Be set forth below can be coupled to the relatively great amount of quantum bit with high conductance, Gao Shukuan and low diameter can
Scale the example of quantum processor architecture and the process for generating it.In general, which may include providing basis
Cell design, the two or more overlapping arrays of the cell design including quantum bit on the basis, the wherein amount of unit
Sub- bit is coupled to each other.Then, in each array the position of quantum bit moved it is a certain amount of, to produce modification
Quantum bit unit.According to the movement for being applied to each quantum bit, in some embodiments, the quantum bit unit of modification
It can splice to form the bigger pattern of interconnection quantum bit.
The first step of construction quantum processor architecture includes since the cell on basis, and the cell on the basis is considered
The quantum bit for the variable number that each quantum bit is may be coupled to.Fig. 4 A is the cell design 400 for showing this basis
Exemplary schematic diagram, wherein indicating to describe quantum bit using co-planar waveguide flux quanta bit is simplified shown in Fig. 3
402.For the sake of clarity, ground plane is omitted.In the view shown in Fig. 4, it is assumed that quantum bit forms and is arranged in lining
Bottom is (for example, sapphire, SiO2Or Si) on.In order to provide electric control and operation on quantum bit 402, flux bias line and its
Its control line can be formed in one or more layers of the separation on or below the plane to form quantum bit 402.
Semiconductors manufacture can be used in one or more layers comprising flux bias line and other control lines and chip joining technique is formed
And it is attached to quantum bit 402.
Cell 400 includes the first array of the quantum bit 402 arranged along first axle or direction 401, and along
The second array for the quantum bit 402 that the second axis or direction 403 different from first axle 401 are arranged, so that the amount of two arrays
Sub- bit 402 forms lattice structure, wherein the co-planar waveguide of the co-planar waveguide of the first quantum bit quantum bit different from second
Between lattice or crosspoint each intersection point correspond to Coupling point.In the specific example, first axle and second axis be just
It hands over, although other arrangements are also possible.Give the quadrature arrangement of two arrays, 402 base of each quantum bit in unit 400
A number of other quantum bits in " orthogonal " couples to unit 400 described herein.
Although the waveguide of quantum bit 402 is shown as overlapping each other in lattice point of intersection in Figure 4 A, waveguide is at this
A little infalls are not in electrical contact actually.On the contrary, they (such as allow a waveguide in two waveguides handing over using jumper wire device
Crossed at fork another waveguide without generate contact bridging air bridges) be separated from each other.As described in connection with fig. 2, each quantum
The waveguide of bit is operatively coupled in infall using one or more superconducting-coupled device elements, for the sake of clarity, in Fig. 4
The superconducting-coupled device element of the one or more is omitted.
Exemplary unit lattice 400 are configured to the coupling of the road c, wherein c=10.That is, the quantum bit 402 in unit
10 other quantum bits (for example, other quantum bits in unit) can be operationally directly coupled to by being arranged to it.
However, passing through concatenation unit lattice 400, it is possible to for cell 400 each quantum bit provide at the end of co-planar waveguide it is logical
The direct-coupling of 404 to two additional quantum bits of " end-to-end " coupling is crossed, as shown in Figure 4 B.For the ease of observation unit lattice
Splicing, show gap between the end of the co-planar waveguide at " end-to-end " coupling position 404 it should be appreciated that
End from each cell can be operably coupled together, shown between the quantum bit 202 and 204 in such as Fig. 2.
Although the cell 400 of Fig. 4 A is depicted as the road the c coupling of c=10, it also can choose other values of c, wherein minimum single
First lattice may have c=2.
By concatenation unit lattice 400, obtained quantum processor architecture is corresponding simply to Chimera figure (Chimera
Identical structure with c=4) slightly bigger version.That is, the splicing arrangement of cell 400 will be provided solely for
The binary unit that is fully connected of the Weak link to its adjacent unit.Therefore, given quantum bit will not in all directions with
Neighbouring quantum bit tangles strongly.In addition, this concatenation unit lattice arrangement will include region, can be cut by it in the presence of few
The region of coupler is measured, this indicates the interconnectivity of relative mistake, and therefore coupling framework may be less powerful.
The configuration shown in Fig. 4 A of relative quantum bit position is vertical and horizontal-shift, to improve the interconnection of cell
Property.The example spacing adjustment for 2N quantum bit being arranged in N × N number of cell 500 is shown in Fig. 5, wherein N is equal to
10, and it is as described below.
Each quantum since the first array (being arranged along axis 401) of the quantum bit 402 of Fig. 4 A, in the first array
Bit 402 deviates first distance along the second axis 403 relative to the quantum bit 402 of the direct neighbor in the first array, this
One distance is approximately equal to that the √ oriented with the same direction is N number of equally spaced and continuous quantum bit.For example, as shown in Figure 5,
Quantum bit 402a in first array is along axis 403 from the quantum bit 402b offset distance of the direct neighbor in the first array
501, wherein distance 501 is sufficiently large to accommodate 3 quantum bits (i.e. about √ N, for N=10).Therefore, fixed with the same direction
To, three continuous quantum bits (quantum bit a, b and c) from second array be adapted in quantum bit 402a and
In offset distance 501 between 402b.In this example, for determine offset distance single quantum bit size by coplanar
The width of waveguide is defined plus the width (see, for example, width 305 shown in Fig. 3) of the side of DC-SQUID.However, can
Differently to define quantum bit size, as long as defined quantum bit is in the same sizely for determining each offset distance.
In order to keep and the coupling of the quantum bit from second array and provide uniform cell (therefore cell can
To be spliced into bigger structure), the quantum bit deviated in the first array can be iterated through and the pattern established.However,
Offset 501 can be divided between the last one quantum bit of previous pattern and the first quantum bit of next pattern.For example,
Referring again to FIGS. 5, quantum bit 402c is the last one quantum bit in the pattern for deviate quantum bit, and direct neighbor
Quantum bit 402d is the first quantum bit in the new pattern for deviate quantum bit.However, quantum bit 402d not with amount
The sub- identical original position alignment of bit 402a.On the contrary, quantum bit 402d is in unit compared with quantum bit 402a
More the right is slightly transferred in lattice 500.This is because the offset 501 of about √ N (for example, being 3 when for N=10) has existed
It is divided between quantum bit 402c and quantum bit 402d.Specifically, offset 501 substantially accommodates the quantum bit of vertical orientation
The width on width (positioned at the right of the DC-SQUID of quantum bit 402c) and vertical orientation quantum bit " e " and " a " of " d "
(positioned at the left side of the DC-SQUID of quantum bit 402d).
Once all quantum bits in the first array are deviated according to above-mentioned design parameter, then the amount in second array
Sub- bit deviates in a similar way.For example, quantum bit 402e (being also identified as quantum bit " e " in Fig. 5) is along axis
401 from the quantum bit 402f offset distance 503 of the direct neighbor in second array, and wherein distance 503 is sufficiently large to accommodate 3
Quantum bit (i.e. about √ N, for N=10).Again, in order to keep the coupling with the quantum bit from the first array and mention
For uniform cell, the quantum bit deviated in second array can be iterated through and the pattern established.In addition, second array
Offset between the quantum bit of interior direct neighbor can previous pattern the last one quantum bit and next pattern the
Divide between one quantum bit.
After the cell 500 for obtaining the modification that wherein quantum bit has shifted relative to each other, the unit of modification
Lattice 500 can splice to create bigger connected graph, the purpose of the amplification for the system with a large amount of quantum bits.Part by
In the uniformity of cell structure 500, may be implemented to scale.It is shown in Fig. 6 by splicing in 4 × 4 superlattice structures 600

The identical mode of cell 500 is constructed using co-planar waveguide flux quanta bit.Splicing piece is arranged such that each unit
The quantum bit of lattice is operatively coupled to the quantum bit of other adjacent cells (for example, by from different units lattice
The placement of the induction coupling of point of intersection between waveguide).The quantum bit being positioned adjacently with the outer periphery of framework 600 can be with
It is coupled to quantum bit more less than the quantum bit of the centralized positioning of closer framework 600.In addition, the part of co-planar waveguide can
To expand from the bulk of lattice 600 (bulk).In order to reduce the expose portion of co-planar waveguide in splicing lattice and be not used
Partial quantity, waveguide can be bent (for example, with 90 ° of angular distortions) and extend, to the greatest extent may be used in they and lattice structure 600
Other quantum bits more than energy intersect and may be coupled to other quantum bits as much as possible in lattice structure 600.
Utilize lattice 600, it is possible to by following straight horizontal and vertical segmentation quickly to reach lattice since any point
In other quantum bits.Cell is constructed such that the space not wasted.With U × U cell lattice layout splicing list
First lattice structure, wherein each cell is associated with the coupling of the road c, wherein c is greater than or equal to 2 and U and is greater than or equal to 2, splicing
The diameter of cell structure is approximately equal to 2U, and the quantum bit sum for including in concatenation unit lattice is approximately equal to 2U2c。
Fig. 4 to fig. 6 shows a kind of certain types of cell for providing the coupling of long range quantum bit and corresponding spelling
Connect lattice structure.Specifically, the quantum bit of the design of cell shown in Fig. 4 A 400 is disposed in two arrays, wherein
The elongated portion (for example, co-planar waveguide part) of N number of quantum bit in first array is oriented perpendicularly in second array
N number of quantum bit elongated portion.However, other cell designs are also possible, and therefore can be formed for not
With the basis of lattice structure.For example, in some embodiments, cell may include the battle array of more than two quantum bit
Column.In some embodiments, array can be each other with the angle orientation other than 90 °.Therefore, pass through the list of splicing modification
First trellis at lattice can also show the array and/or each other of the more than two quantum bit oriented along different directions
With the array of the quantum bit of the angle orientation other than 90 °.Alternatively, or in addition, in each array of cell
The quantity of quantum bit can be different.In some embodiments, each quantum bit is in array relative in array
The distance of adjacent quantum bit transfer can be different.For example, the first quantum bit in the array of N number of quantum bit can be along
First direction is parallel from array and the second quantum bit of direct neighbor deviates about √ N, and the second quantum bit can be from
Parallel and direct neighbor third quantum bit deviates different amounts in array (for example, about (√ N)/2).Direct phase in array
Other variations of offset between adjacent quantum bit are also possible.

710b (bright grey level), quantum bit 710b are coupled to quantum bit 710c (dark gray line).Quantum bit 710b and 710c
Each of be also coupled to quantum bit 710d (dark gray line) and quantum bit 710e (dark gray line).
As shown in Figure 7, quantum bit couples framework 700 by the three of the quantum bit oriented along different directions from each other
A isolated array (704,706,708) composition.For example, framework 700 includes the first array 704, wherein the quantum ratio of array 704
Spy is opened along direction 701 by parallel interval.Second array 706 includes the quantum bit opened along direction 704 by parallel interval, with

Triangle connected graph can also be referred to as by closing structure, because when the quantum from each of three different quantum bit arrays
When bit overlaps each other, triangle is formed.
In some embodiments, coupled structure can also include that additional long range is of coupled connections.For example, in some realities

The second end at Coupling point between a difference quantum bit.Although resonator 802 and 804 is shown as intersecting, they
It is not necessarily required to couple at the point of overlapping.Resonator 802,804 can be formed by the elongate articles of such as conductive material, such as super
Lead aluminium.Each resonator 802,804 includes capacitor at its end.For example, including example at every one end of elongated conducting material
As air or dielectric gap can separate the second conductive material, such as superconducting ground face.In some embodiments, resonance
Device does not include capacitor.During the operation using the quantum processor of framework 800, each resonator is by one at first end
Or the quantum bit that multiple quantum bits are different from the one or more at the second end of resonator is (for example, pass through induction coupling
Close) it is coupled.

It closes.Quantum bus is to realize the auxiliary system of effective ZZ coupling between quantum bit, it means that quantum bit adds humorous
The ground state of the system of vibration device should be described as having the ground state of long range ZZ Hamiltonians.We write first has
Total Hamiltonian of the quantum-bit systems of Ising interaction, wherein two in quantum bit quantum bit passes through single
Resonator couples, as shown in Figure 9:

Programmability: energy value E0It is g1、g2And ωrFunction, then we can be by with tunable resonator frequency
And/or the coupling of quantum bit resonator is to obtain Z1Z2Programmable coefficients.It is believed that the coupling between resonator and quantum bit
Intensity depends on the difference on the frequency between quantum bit resonator.That is, this difference on the frequency is smaller, coupling can be stronger.
For example, in some embodiments, the frequency for being coupled to the resonator of the first quantum bit and the second quantum bit can be about
It is identical as the frequency of the first quantum bit and/or the second quantum bit that resonator is coupled to.Resonator length partially depends on again
In the frequency of resonator.For example, there is similar frequency range for covering several GHz to the quantum bit frequency of tens GHz ranges
Resonator can have the length between about 1000 μm to about 15000 μm
