Definitions
- the present invention relates to a method for answering accurately and automatically queries submitted for the purposes of exploring and extracting information from an online knowledge source, such as an enterprise website, an online catalogue, a database, or a computer-based help system.
- an online knowledge source such as an enterprise website, an online catalogue, a database, or a computer-based help system.
- the invention is a computerized system that can respond, not just to a single query issued by a user, but instead to a query in the context of a dialog with the user.
- a system which we term an interactive automated response system, consists of three principal components or subsystems:
- a query we mean both the contents of a communication sent by a user to an interactive automated response system and, within the interactive automated response system, data sent by the dialog manager to the search system to be used in finding a matching answer.
- the context will always make clear which meaning is intended.
- a response we mean the contents of a communication sent by an interactive automated response system to a user in order to satisfy a query from the user.
- the response may include the best answer found by the search system (according to the scores of the matching answers) as well as a list of relevant categories (ranked by confidence level) found by the text categorizer from which a subsequent selection may be made by the user if the displayed response does not fully meet the user's needs.
- an answer we mean data found by a search system that matches a query sent to it by a dialog manager.
- a set of answers, if any matches are found, can be used by the dialog manager, in determining the best response to a query from the user.
- a category we mean a class of answers. Each answer normally belongs to one or more categories.
- a text categorizer assigns categories to text extracted from a dialog in order to determine the current subjects of the dialog. So, while a category normally is used to describe a class of possible answers, a category can also be viewed as a description of a current subject of the user's query.
- an interactive automated response system requires the following data as part of its set-up to be fully functional:
- This data may be stored in various eXtended Markup Language (XML) files, as just one possibility.
- XML eXtended Markup Language
- Part of this invention is the use of a category scheme that is endowed with a partial order.
- a category scheme that is endowed with a partial order.
- the idea of a partial order is quite general and includes as a special case a hierarchy of categories given by a tree. Since the partial order can be used to determine which of two categories may be more specific than the other, using a partially ordered set of categories enables the system to simplify the set of categories assigned to a stage of a dialog by discarding all but the most specific categories. This is important if the system is to come up with a response that is both specific and appropriate to the query. Creating data structures, accessible by the dialog manager, that define both the category scheme and the partial order on the category scheme is an integral part of setting up the system.
- the intended mode of operation of an interactive automated response system is as follows.
- the dialog manager extracts one or more texts from its record of dialog, sends those texts to the text categorizer and then uses the results of categorizing the texts to assign one or more categories to the latest stage of the dialog. There are two uses made of the categories found at this point:
- Another use of the categories found is to determine what text is to be sent by the dialog manager to the search system. By comparing the currently assigned categories with those previously assigned, one can detect whether the user is drilling down (asking about a more specific subject) or switching topics. If the user is drilling down, then one way to search for an answer in context would be to base the search on a combination of the current query with an earlier query or queries. If the user is switching topics, then the current query, in isolation from the earlier queries, should be used as the basis for the search for answers.
- the dialog manager sends queries in the form of texts that are deemed to be the best evidence for the category assignments so far made to the search system.
- the search system For each query sent to the search system, the search system returns any matches (answers or answer IDs) together with the categories to which each matching answer belongs, as well as, for each match, a score indicating the relative degree of fit of the match to the query.
- the final categories assigned to a stage of a dialog may depend, not only on the categories found by text categorization, but also on the categories of answers found by the search system.
- the assignment of categories to a stage of a dialog in the context of the entire dialog up to that point, is what we term dialog categorization.
- dialog categorization differs from the related problems of text categorization and topic detection in text.
- the details of dialog categorization will also be discussed in detail.
- a response is sent by the dialog manager to the user, which can involve several components, such as
- a display of the answer deemed best which may be a web page (displayed in a browser or otherwise), a video clip, audio, images, a text file, etc.
- dialog manager Because the dialog at any stage may be assigned multiple categories, there is a certain amount of complication that must be sorted through in order to implement the mode of operation described above. To handle the various complications, one capability that we deem essential for the dialog manager is the maintenance of a user's session history, by which we mean a history of the user's current dialog with the system.
- the session history should contain
- each previous user input which may be either a natural language query or a user-made choice elicited by an earlier response sent by the system to the user,
- the text categorizer used by an interactive automated response system may be any system that assigns categories to data containing text, such as one that applies symbolic rules, one that uses decision trees, one that uses a linear separator, a Bayesian classifier, etc.
- the text categorizer may be developed using machine learning techniques, applied to training data, or it may be constructed by hand. The principle requirement is that the text categorizer be able reliably and efficiently to assign predetermined categories to data objects consisting of text.
- the text categorizer should also return a confidence level with each category assigned to text data submitted to the text categorizer, where the confidence level is a quantitative estimate of the degree of confidence in or the degree of utility of the assignment.
- the confidence level can be used by the dialog manager to plan the layout of the eventual response to the user, with more prominence given to parts of the response related to categories, with higher confidence levels.
- the search system used by an interactive automated response system may be any system that matches text to answers, returning either actual answers or answer IDs.
- the answers themselves might be text, web pages, video clips, audio files, etc.
- One component of the search system needs to be a file or database containing information about answers that could be used in composing responses to users.
- the information stored corresponding to a particular answer includes a representation of that answer as a list of keywords or features, the presence of which in a query would be regarded as partial evidence that the answer matched the query.
- the information stored corresponding to a particular answer also includes a description of the set of categories to which that answer belonged.
- the search system would be a document matching system in which the text supplied to the search system would be treated as a queries that would be compared with keywords extracted from answers and/or from data related to the answers, such as example questions having a particular answer. For each text submitted to the search system, those answers that matched would be returned, and with each matching answer the categories to which that answer belonged would be returned, as well as a score indicating the closeness of the match.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing the major components of an interactive automated response system, as well as the kinds of information that flows between the various components;
- FIG. 3 depicts a simple category scheme that can be represented as a tree, in which the most specific categories are those farthest from the root of the tree;
- the interactive automated response system 12 further includes a text categorizer (TC) 122 and a search system (SS) 123 .
- TC text categorizer
- SS search system
- the dialog manager 121 parses the input text to determine the text to be input to the text categorizer 122 .
- the text categorizer 122 analyzes the input text and provides outputs of categories and confidence levels to the dialog manager 121 .
- the dialog manager 121 determines what text items should be input to the search system 123 .
- the search system 123 responds with matches, categories and scores.
- the dialog manager 121 includes storage which stores the user's session history. Based on the inputs from the text categorizer 122 and search system 123 and the user's session history, the dialog manager 121 generates appropriate responses to the user queries.
- the process begins when the dialog manager 121 receives an input from the user in function block 201 .
- the dialog manager 121 accesses the user's session history in function block 202 and, based on the user's current input and the session history, the dialog manager determines the text items to be sent to the text categorizer 122 in function block 203 .
- the text categorizer 122 assigns categories paired with confidence levels to each text item sent by the dialog manager in function block 204 and returns this information to the dialog manager.
- the dialog manager 121 uses the results returned to it by the text categorizer 122 and the search system 123 to create a response to be sent to the user in function block 208 . Finally, the dialog manager updates the session history and sends a response to the user in function block 209 .
- the system responds by asking the user what kind of loan he or she is interested in, possibly by displaying a list of the sub-categories of the category “loans” 302 which, in this illustrative example, includes “auto loans” 303 and “mortgage loans” 304 .
- the user in our example responds by saying he or she is interested in mortgage loans, which he or she might do by clicking on a selection in the list, but for our example, let us assume that he or she enters the text:
- the dialog manager 121 may be further decomposed into three modules:
- the text analyzer 405 processes text sent to it by the session manager 402 , which involves tokenization, stemming, and identifying all features of the text—including occurrences of keywords—that are of use to the text categorizer 122 and the search system 123 .
- the text analyzer. 405 also carries out dialog categorization based on the results returned by the text categorizer 122 and the search system 123 .
- the text analyzer 405 passes the results of its analysis to the session manager 402 .
- the results passed by the text analyzer 405 to the session manager 402 include categories, answer IDs, confidence levels, scores, and, indication of which parts of the dialog are deemed the evidence for the category and answer recommendations of the text analyzer.
- a preferred implementation of the text categorizer 122 of the interactive automated response system is to use symbolic rules for categorization.
- the rule file could be generated either by hand or by symbolic rule induction, if suitable training data were available. Even if the rules were machine generated, an advantage of symbolic rules is that they can be understood, and consequently can be edited, by a human being in order to improve the overall performance of the system.
- each rule in the rule file will be a conjunction of conditions involving the presence or absence of features in the text, yielding, when all conditions axe satisfied, a category to be assigned to the text. Furthermore, each rule will have attached to it a confidence level reflecting the reliability or utility of the category assignment made when the rule fires. Categories found, and confidence levels, are passed to the dialog manager 121 by the rule applier 406 .
- a preferred implementation of the search system 123 of the interactive automated response system is via a lightweight document matcher 408 that can efficiently match text sent to it with keywords corresponding to answers.
- Each set of keywords, along with an answer ID and, the set of categories to which the corresponding answer belongs, is stored in a search database 409 .
- the keyword sets may be constructed by hand or automatically from sets of sample questions for each answer. Whenever a match is found and deemed significant, the lightweight document matcher 408 returns the answer ID, the corresponding categories, and a score measuring the closeness of fit of the query to the matching keywords.
- dialog categorization involves repeatedly revisiting categorization decisions during a user session. Categorizing the dialog at all stages is important, even after queries that lead to specific answers, because subsequent queries, if any, need a context in which to do subsequent categorization.
- dialog categorization is more complex than the static problem of simply categorizing text.
- complexity arises because, in dialog categorization, it is not clear exactly what text drawn from the dialog should enter into a categorization decision.
- Dialog categorization is pronounced of the problem of topic detection in text, in that differing parts of a dialog can be assigned different topics. But, topic detection is different from dialog categorization because
- the primary text categorization tool i.e., the text categorizer 122 is rule-based, but the exact nature of the text categorizer is really quite immaterial to giving a general solution to the dialog categorization.
- a constrained query is a query sent to the search system that comes with an assigned category whose purpose is to focus the search system's search space.
- a constrained answer is an answer found for a constrained query.
- an unconstrained query is a'search request based on a query alone without a constraining category, so that the entire database is searched.
- An unconstrained answer is an answer found to an unconstrained query.
- dialog categorization solution should have the following features and components:
- the dialog may possibly be categorized with multiple categories.
- the dialog manager of an interactive response system should maintain in memory those answers (or answer IDs) recently found in the course of carrying on a dialog.
- the list of recently found answers can then have a role to play in determining when the system should fall back onto unconstrained search.
- the hierarchy can be employed in the design of a system that aims whenever possible to provide the most specific answers that appear to be desired by a user.
- the collection of all categories forms a set partially ordered by a relation called subsumption.
- the category hierarchy is given by a tree (where paths run away from the root), then X ⁇ Y means that there is a path from the Y to X (and, in particular, Y is closer to the root than X).
- the poset of categories has a unique maximal element T , pronounced “top”.
- the category T is the least specific category possible, and, as such, specifies no information about the user's subject or goal in conducting a dialog.
- the category T need not be represented explicitly in an actual implementation, although it might be. If the category hierarchy is a tree, then T is the root of the tree.
- any set of categories that we assign to a dialog will consists of only “most specific categories” (i.e., only the most specific candidates found for assignment to the dialog). So, in the parlance of order theory, each set of categories assigned to a dialog at a point in time be will an antichain, which is a subset of a poset in which no two different elements are comparable.
- the result of dialog categorization at a point in time can be enumerated as a set of pairs
- Result′ ⁇ (p, S) ⁇
- p ⁇ Result TextSet , S ⁇ C
- Result′ is the result of the preceding dialog categorization decision.
- first set is empty
- second in preference is a primary category set that leads to at least one non-repetitive constrained answer.
- prev and curr are combined by concatenation to form the concatenated input concat.
- PartialResult(prev, PrevCat, curr, PickedCat) ⁇ (C 1 , p 1 ), (C 2 , p 2 ), . . . , (C m , p m ) ⁇
- L(concat) and L(curr) are necessarily antichains because answers can only belong to minimal, i.e., terminal, categories. In general, we would use only answers in “most specific categories”.
- categorization will involve use of the functions R and L.
- R the primary text categorization tool
- L category by document matching
- ⁇ PrevCat ⁇ X
- ⁇ PrevCat ⁇ X
- UnSupTS(S) Found(S) ⁇ [NotNew(S) ⁇ Drill(S) ⁇ SupTS(S)].
- Shortness Criterion Whenever we assign a category to a dialog, we will be able to determine a shortest text that supports that judgment, i.e., curr if the category is in S(curr), and concat otherwise.
- repetitive answer is one that appeared in the list of answers found recently.
- we use a minimal definition of recently wherein it means after the user's immediately preceding input. While other reasonable definitions may be substituted, the technical definition of “recently” should always include “after the user's immediately preceding input”.
- the definition of repetitive answer given above is general, so it applies to unconstrained answers as well as constrained answers. Thus, a non-repetitive answer may either be entirely new, or it may have been presented to the user earlier in the dialog, but it cannot have been found when the query immediately preceding the current query was processed.
- Smyth preorder which is widely used in theoretical studies of non-determinism.
- S 1 is largest
- S 2 is intermediate
- S 3 is smallest.
- the Smyth preorder is one way to extend a partial order on a set to a kind of order on the power set of that set.
- CurrCat ⁇ C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C m ⁇
- a primary category that is a drill-down category or a currently supported topic switch
- Result′ is the result of the preceding dialog categorization decision
- the set Result′ may have more than one element, and the specification above requires iterating over all the elements of that set.
- the Shortness Criterion for best textual evidence can require more than one call to the search system as part of sorting out what is the best evidence for a single category.
- dialog categorization both of the troubling aspects of dialog categorization go away when we switch from using the Shortness Criterion to using the Heuristic Criterion for determining the best evidence.
- the whole specification of dialog categorization for our current implementation is reduced because there is never more than one piece of textual evidence identified for a set of categories.
