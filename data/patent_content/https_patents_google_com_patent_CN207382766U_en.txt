A or multiple roll wheel assemblies (for example, wheel, castor, idler wheel) are mounted on guide assembly.
Method 300 can continue in step 304, including the second module of data center cooling system is attached to first
Module.For example, in certain aspects, the lower module that can include cable tray and other electric power and information support equipment can be with
It is installed to the bottom of upper module.Lower module can be included from the side that the top plate of lower module extends.It side can be vertical
It extends downwardly and is suspended on certain altitude above the floor of data center, to accommodate multiple rows of server (or other electricity therebetween
Son) rack.In certain aspects, step 304 can be performed before step 302, for example, being led upper module is mounted on
Lower module is connected into (for example, fastening, welding) to upper module before on rail assembly.
Method 300 can continue in step 306, be included on guide track system mobile with supporting fever electronic equipment (example
Such as, server, the network equipment or other electronic equipments) the neighbouring data center cooling system of multiple rows of racks of data centers
One and second module.For example, guide track system can include guide rail and roll wheel assembly, synergistically contribute to include upper and lower part
(or other are without rubbing for the rolling that the data center cooling system of module can be occupied in working space in the personnel that data center builds
Wipe or close to without friction) it is mobile.Multiple rows of data center's machine rack can dispose (for example, being installed before step 302) and exist in advance
In data center's building, in the position for allowing to move with the neighbouring data center cooling system of these rows (for example, such as Figure 1A institutes
Show -1C).
Method 300 can continue in step 308, including by the refrigerating module of the first module of data center cooling system
It is fluidly coupled to cooling fluid source.In certain aspects, each upper module can include one or more cooling coils,

The supply of block supports and return duct can be fluidly connected to cooling coil and be fluidly connected to cooling fluid source (example
Such as, cooler, cooling tower, heat exchanger, water body or other cooling fluid sources).In certain aspects, step 302-306 it
It is preceding mounted on particular attachment mould it is in the block supply and return conduit section can formerly before dispose data center cooling system in
Other accessory modules on fluidly coupled (for example, welding, grooved pipe connects or other connection techniques) to previously deployment data
On other sections in Center Building.
Method 300 can continue in step 310, including being set fever electronics by the electric supporting assembly in the second module
It is standby to be electrically coupled to electric power source.For example, in certain aspects, which can be electrically coupled to by lower module
The power pipe (for example, total wire conduit or electrical bus or other power-supply devices) of support.This power pipe or total wire conduit
It can electrically couple or can previously be electrically coupled to the power supply of data center's building (for example, utility network, hair
Motor, battery, solar energy or wind generator system or other power supplys).In step 310, other components can also electrically couple
To power supply.For example, the fan of the part as upper mould refrigerating module in the block can be electrically coupled to power supply.In step
310, controller, control device, electric machine controller, variable frequency drives and other cooling system automation equipments are (for example, sensing
Device, actuator) power supply can also be electrically coupled to.
Method 300 can continue in step 312, including operation refrigerating module to be cooled down during the operation of data center
Generate heat electronic equipment.For example, once rack and data center cooling system are in place in data center cooling system, then electronics is set
It is standby to be operated to provide information technology (IT) service.During the operation of electronic equipment, heat is generated, can be cold
But the cooling air-flow removal of Module cycle.
Fig. 3 B show can utilize according to the data center cooling system 100 of the disclosure, data center systems 200 or its
His data center cooling system is performed method 320.In certain aspects, method 320 can include the step in method 300
312 sub-step.Method 320 can start in step 322, including cooling fluid is recycled to cooling mould by supply line

(for example, by fan) is recycled in the region neighbouring with the preceding open sides of multiple rows of rack.Warm air gas chamber extends through personnel can
Region is occupied, and extends up to the ceiling of data center's building structure.
Method 320 can continue in step 330, including the air-flow of heating is recycled to cooling mould from warm air gas chamber
Block.For example, with the air-flow of heating by fan circulation by warm air gas chamber, fan pulls to the air-flow of heating (in the example
In) and through refrigerating module cooling coil.Therefore, by the way that heat is transferred to the cooling cycled by cooling coil from air-flow
Liquid, the air-flow of heating are cooled in cooling coil.The cooling liquid for the air-flow heating heated is recycled to cooling
Liquid source (such as passing through reflux line) to cool down again.Certainly, when data center operates, step 322- can be performed repeatedly
330。
