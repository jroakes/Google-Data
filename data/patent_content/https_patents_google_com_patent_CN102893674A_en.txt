Description
The cross reference of related application
According to 35U.S.C.119, the application requires the U.S. Provisional Application No.61/345 of submission on May 17th, 2010,578 rights and interests, and its full content is incorporated herein by reference.
Technical field
The disclosure is usually directed to radio communication, and relates more specifically to carrier aggregation.
Background technology
Carrier aggregation will be for following LTE network, so that improved data rate to be provided to the user.Carrier aggregation is included in multiple radio frequency (" component carrier ") and goes up data transmission to UE or from the UE receive data.Wider bandwidth is supported high data rate.Therefore, UE can dispose a plurality of component carriers to communicate.Here, communication comprises emission and/or the reception of data and signaling.In these component carriers some can be " activated ".If component carrier is activated, then it can be used in the transfer of data to UE.The component carrier of configuration is for the candidate who activates; That is to say, based on the arrival of a large amount of data, one or more can being activated in the component carrier of configuration.
Require UE to carry out various provided for radio resources management and measure, to support component carrier (CC) management and to support the carrier aggregation mobility of operating period.CC management can comprise adds CC in the CC set of configuration to, removes CC and replace CC in the CC set of configuration from the CC set of configuration.Mobility can comprise the switching of the UE between the repeater between the long haul radio head end between the sector between the eNB, eNB, that be connected to identical eNB and identical eNB.Such measurement can be the remarkable consumption-particularly of UE battery because use carrier aggregation, UE will carry out the more multifrequency measurement when not using carrier aggregation.The disclosure relates to the measurement that component carrier is carried out and attempts it is minimized.
In LTE version 8, can define by network the parameter that is called " s-measurement ".S-measures index signal intensity or signal quality level.If the signal of UE lookup service residential quarter is below s-measures, then it carries out the measurement of other frequency (that is, the frequency except service frequency) and other radio access technologies (such as UMTS and GSM).If the signal of UE lookup service residential quarter is more than s-measures, (basic principle is if Serving cell is measured high then can to avoid carrying out measurement, then there are not the needs immediately that UE switched to another residential quarter, and therefore do not have the needs for measurement and measurement report).Therefore, s-measures the significant battery saving of supporting for UE.
Adopt carrier aggregation, UE can dispose a plurality of carrier waves from identical eNB.Therefore, UE can have a plurality of Serving cells, and each Serving cell is at the enterprising line operate of different carrier waves.One in these Serving cells is designated as P-residential quarter (corresponding down link CC is called as primary component carrier or PCC), and other Serving cell is designated as S-residential quarter (corresponding down link CC is called as less important component carrier or SCC).
Can control all measurements with the s-measurement parameter that is provided by the P-residential quarter; That is to say, UE uses the P-residential quarter as being used for benchmark that s-measures and measuring when above at s-when the P-cell signal, can avoid all measurements (being included in the measurement of the residential quarter on the SCC).Yet this has caused effectively carrying out the CC management decision---namely, in the situation that does not have the measurement on the SCC, network can not determine when add/remove/replace CC.
After having thought over following the specific embodiment of the present invention and following accompanying drawing, for the person of ordinary skill of the art, it is more obvious that various aspects of the present invention, feature and advantage will become.Accompanying drawing may be simplified in order to know, and needn't draw in proportion.

The LTE UE that does not have configuration to be used for carrier aggregation usually carries out with the provided for radio resources management of Types Below and measures: the residential quarter of measuring in the frequency of the residential quarter of measurement on the carrier frequency identical from Serving cell, measuring is to measure between the RAT of residential quarter of different radio access technologies (RAT) in the residential quarter of the inter-frequency measurements on the carrier frequency different with Serving cell and measurement.Performed actual measurement experience is by the configuration of network.The result of some or all of measurements is sent to network in measurement report message.Definition measurement event when the UE emission measurement is reported.When specific measurement dependent event occurs (for example, when the neighbor cell signal is better than Serving cell signal), trigger measurement event.When having triggered measurement event, UE is transmitted into network with measurement report.Therefore, UE can trigger measurement report when neighbor cell is better than Serving cell, and this has caused UE that the network emission measurement is reported.If the neighbor cell signal adds that than Serving cell signal side-play amount is high, then UE can think that neighbor cell is better than Serving cell.Measurement report comprises the measurement that triggers measurement event, and can comprise the measurement of other residential quarter.The configuration that is used for the measurement of provided for radio resources management is independent of the configuration for the component carrier frequency of the purpose of carrier aggregation.For example, carrier frequency F1 and F2 can be the component carriers of configuration, and UE can be configured to carry out the RRM measurement of the residential quarter on carrier frequency F1, F2 and F3.
Measurement event can be by following classification (specifying in 3GPP TS 36.331 of measurement event):
Classification 1: only by the measurement of Serving cell or the measurement event that triggered by the comparison of neighbor cell and Serving cell: these comprise event A1 (it is better than threshold value that Serving cell becomes); A2 (Serving cell becomes than threshold difference); And A3 (side-play amount of neighbor cell becomes better than Serving cell).
Classification 2: only by the measurement of neighbor cell or the measurement event that triggered by the combination of the measurement of the measurement of neighbor cell and Serving cell: these comprise event A4 (neighbor cell becomes than threshold difference); A5 (Serving cell become be worse than the poor and neighbor cell of threshold value 1 become better than threshold value 2); B1 (neighbours become better than threshold value between RAT) and B2 (Serving cell becomes and becomes poorer than threshold value 2 than neighbor cell between threshold value 1 difference and RAT).
In the situation that lack carrier aggregation, can provide to UE single s-is measured.If it is good that the Serving cell signal is measured than s-, do not require that then UE carries out any measurement; Therefore, measurement event is not triggered, and not emission measurement report of UE.The s-measured value is selected by network so that in the situation that the Serving cell signal in the s-measured place or measure abovely at s-, UE unlikely needs switching.Because a large amount of UE is in (that is, it is good that the Serving cell signal is measured than s-) in the good coverage usually, so this mechanism has caused saving for a large amount of battery of UE.Should be noted that (for example, the value of the side-play amount in A3) can be negative value in the measurement event that is made of side-play amount.
When UE is arranged to carrier aggregation, have a plurality of Serving cells, configuration is used for residential quarter on each carrier wave of CA.Serving cell on primary component carrier is designated as main services residential quarter (P-residential quarter).Other Serving cell is designated as secondary service residential quarter (S-residential quarter).Not that the residential quarter of Serving cell is considered to neighbor cell (comprise in the frequency, residential quarter between frequency and between RAT).To the interpolation of the carrier wave of the CC set of configuration/remove and (b) carry out timely switching between the residential quarter on the less important component carrier for (a), need the measurement event except measurement event mentioned above.
The LTE UE that configuration is used for carrier aggregation carries out the measurement with Types Below usually: the residential quarter of measurement from one of Serving cell identical carrier frequency on frequency in the residential quarter measuring, measure be to measure between the RAT of residential quarter of different radio access technologies (RAT) in the residential quarter of the inter-frequency measurements on the carrier frequency different with Serving cell and measurement.Needed measurement event can be by following classification in having carrier aggregation:
Classification 1a: only by the measurement of main services residential quarter or the measurement event that triggered by the comparison of neighbor cell and main services residential quarter: these comprise event A1-PCC (it is better than threshold value that the P-residential quarter becomes); A2-PCC (the P-residential quarter becomes than threshold difference); And A3-PCC (it is better than P-residential quarter that the side-play amount of neighbor cell becomes).
Classification 1b: only by the measurement of secondary service residential quarter or the measurement event that triggered by the comparison of neighbor cell and secondary service residential quarter: these comprise event A1-SCC (it is better than threshold value that the S-residential quarter becomes); A2-SCC (the S-residential quarter becomes than threshold difference); And in the A3-frequency (side-play amount of the neighbor cell on the frequency identical with the S-residential quarter becomes better than S-residential quarter).Note, comprise that non-service cell and the event of the comparison of the S-residential quarter on another frequency on the frequency is dispensable the two for carrier management and mobility.
Classification 2 ': only by the measurement of neighbor cell or the measurement event that triggered by the combination of the measurement of the measurement of neighbor cell and main services residential quarter: these comprise event A4 (neighbor cell becomes than threshold difference); A5 (the P-residential quarter becomes and becomes better than threshold value 2 than threshold value 1 difference and neighbor cell); B1 (neighbours become better than threshold value between RAT) and B2 (the P-residential quarter becomes and becomes poorer than threshold value 2 than neighbor cell between threshold value 1 difference and RAT).Note, comprise that the event of combination of measurement of the measurement of neighbor cell and S-residential quarter is for carrier management or dispensable for mobility.
We solve in the situation that exist carrier aggregation s-to measure the problem that how can be used for minimizing measurement now.We at first consider to use the impact that employed s-measures when carrier aggregation also is not arranged to situation when having configured carrier aggregation.Suppose that UE can have a plurality of Serving cells when having configured carrier aggregation, be necessary to define which residential quarter with acting on the benchmark residential quarter that s-measures (that is the residential quarter of, its signal and s-measurement being made comparisons).Very natural with the P-residential quarter as the benchmark residential quarter.For clear, we are called s-with this s-measurement and measure
The P-residential quarterWe consider following sight: wherein UE disposes two carrier waves, and one of them has than another little coverage, as illustrated among Fig. 1.
At point 1 place, UE only disposes PCC.When UE enters into the coverage of candidate S-residential quarter, SCC should be added to the set of configuration.In order to know when UE enters the coverage of S-cell coverage area, even the P-cell signal is fine, also is necessary to carry out the A3-PCC that is made comparisons in P-residential quarter and the residential quarter on SCC and measures.Suppose the S-residential quarter that does not exist on the second carrier wave, do not trigger in measurement event A1-SCC, A2-SCC and the A3 frequency.Therefore the coverage by candidate S-residential quarter limits the s-measurement
The P-residential quarterIn other words, remove and the interpolation behavior in order to ensure suitable CC, s-measures
The P-residential quarterValue need so that when UE triggering measurement report during near the edge of any one coverage in the candidate S-residential quarter.S-is measured
P-is little The districtThe coverage that is restricted to the S-residential quarter will hint that UE will need to carry out the obvious larger zone (not comparing by the situation that network is realized with carrier aggregation) of measurement.
Can consider the replacement mechanism that the 2nd s-that wherein is associated with the S-residential quarter measures.For clear, we are called s-with this s-measurement and measure
The S-residential quarter i, S-residential quarter wherein
iIn the secondary service residential quarter.S-measures
The S-residential quarter iCan control category 1b measurement event.That is to say, if the S-residential quarter
iSignal is measured than s-
The S-residential quarter iGood, do not require that then (these comprise the S-residential quarter to the needed measurement of UE execution classification 1b measurement event
iMeasurement and with the S-residential quarter
iThe measurement of the neighbor cell on the identical frequency).Utilization comprises that s-measures
The P-residential quarterMeasure with s-
The S-residential quarter iThe such mechanism of the two, network can be selected to measure for s-
The P-residential quarterRelatively low value and be used for s-and measure
The S-residential quarter iRelatively low value.Even this so that network can guarantee to measure than s-at the P-cell signal
The P-residential quarterUE continues to carry out for classification 1b event (for example, measuring in the frequency on the less important component carrier) measurement when good, and does not require the measurement for classification 1a event.
Therefore, such mechanism may be useful when UE has the S-residential quarter.Yet this does not help to find candidate S-residential quarter
iFor example, in the sight shown in Fig. 1, this substitutes the interpolation of not considering SCC.As illustrated among Fig. 2, at point 1 and point 2 places, UE will only dispose PCC.Before the UE point of arrival 2, measure based on s-
The P-residential quarterAnd closed the A3-PCC measurement.Simultaneously, suppose and do not have the S-residential quarter
i, do not trigger event in A1/A2 and the A3 frequency.Therefore, network does not know when UE enters the overlay area of candidate S-residential quarter.
According to inventive embodiment, UE disposes two alternative s-and measures:
S-measurement-Alt
The P-residential quarterBe defined as control: (a) classification 2 ' measurement event and the classification 1a measurement event that (b) do not comprise the measurement of the residential quarter on the component carrier of configuration.These events comprise A4, A5, B1, B2, A1-PCC and A2-PCC.Also comprise the A3-PCC event, wherein neighbor cell is not on the component carrier of configuration.The P-residential quarter is with acting on s-measurement-Alt
The P-residential quarterThe benchmark residential quarter.Therefore, if the P-cell signal than s-measurement-Alt
The P-residential quarterGood, then UE can avoid carrying out following measurement: the measurement of the residential quarter of measurement on the carrier frequency different from Serving cell and the measurement of the residential quarter that is different radio access technologies (RAT), the residential quarter measured.

The S-residential quarter iThe classification 1a measurement event of the measurement of the residential quarter on the component carrier that (ref P-residential quarter) is defined as controlling (a) classification 1b measurement event and (b) being included in configuration.These events comprise in A1-SCC, A2-SCC and the A3 frequency.Also comprise the A3-PCC event, wherein neighbor cell is on the less important component carrier of configuration.The P-residential quarter is measured with acting on s-
The S-residential quarter iThe benchmark residential quarter of (ref P-residential quarter).Therefore, if the P-cell signal measure than s-
The S-residential quarter i(ref P-residential quarter) is good, and then UE can avoid carrying out following measurement: the measurement of S-residential quarter; And the measurement of the neighbor cell on SCC.

The S-residential quarter iThe embodiment of the use of (ref P-residential quarter).Situation depicted in figure 3 is comprised of 3 carrier wave F1, F2 and F3.F1 is configured to primary component carrier.1 place in the position requires UE to carry out the measurement of all configurations, and therefore can trigger the measurement event of any configuration.When UE from putting 1 when moving to a little 9, UE can select to avoid specifically measuring.Hereinafter this is described in more detail.
2 places in the position, carrier wave F2 are added to the CC set of configuration; Therefore, if be configured to like this, may require UE to carry out the measurement of the residential quarter on F2.3 places in the position, the P-cell signal is than s-measurement-Alt
The P-residential quarterGood, and therefore, UE can avoid carrying out the measurement (that is, do not require the great majority that UE carries out the measurement that is included in the residential quarter on the carrier wave F3 measure) of residential quarter between RAT and the residential quarter on the carrier frequency that is not less important component carrier.In the position 3 and 4 places, position, the measurement of the residential quarter on carrier wave F2 continues.
5 places in the position, carrier wave F3 are added to the CC set of configuration; Therefore, if be configured to like this, may require UE to carry out the measurement of the residential quarter on F3.6 places in the position, the P-cell signal is measured than s-
The S-residential quarter 1(ref P-residential quarter) is good, and therefore UE can avoid carrying out the measurement of the residential quarter on carrier wave F2.In the position 6 and 7 places, position, the measurement of the residential quarter on carrier wave F3 continues.
8 places in the position, the P-cell signal is measured than s-
The S-residential quarter 2(ref P-residential quarter) is good, and therefore UE can avoid carrying out the measurement of the residential quarter on carrier wave F3.Therefore, 9 places in the position only require UE to carry out the measurement of the residential quarter on main CC.
In the situation in front, during candidate S-residential quarter on having can be the with it synchronous carrier wave of UE, carrier wave is added to the CC set of configuration.Alternatively, during candidate S-residential quarter on not having can be the with it synchronous carrier wave of UE, carrier wave can be added to the CC set of configuration.Similarly, during candidate S-residential quarter on not having can be the with it synchronous carrier wave of UE, can remain on the carrier wave (that is, it not being removed) in the CC set of configuration from CC set of configuration.Adopt in such a way, 1 place, position in the situation of Fig. 3, the CC set of UE configuration can comprise F1, F2 and F3.Then, stop between RAT measuring and CC in the non-configuration at 3 places, position on the measurement of residential quarter after, UE continues to carry out the measurement of the residential quarter on F2 and F3.
In the above-described embodiments, require UE not stop at the measurement of the residential quarter on the PCC.In some are disposed, if the Serving cell signal is enough good, then needn't continue to measure the residential quarter on the PCC.According to another embodiment, if the Serving cell signal is enough good, then revise s-measurement-Alt

Remote radio devices (such as repeater and long haul radio head end) can be used in expansion in the coverage on the characteristic frequency or is provided at local formula " focus " coverage on the characteristic frequency.Remote radio devices can be positioned at and the basically different position of comparing, the position of eNB.ENB can launch the identical information in the residential quarter of remote radio devices, as doing on conventional residential quarter (being the residential quarter of eNB).Therefore, can look like transmission (for example, the source of transmission can be designated eNB from the system information in the transmission of remote radio devices) from eNB from the transmission of remote radio devices.If work as S-cell
iUE uses as described above s-and measures when being the residential quarter of remote radio devices
The S-residential quarter i(ref P-residential quarter), then UE can stop to carry out the measurement of the residential quarter on the F2 prematurely.Therefore, in the situation that there is remote radio devices, be conducive to use s-to measure
The S-residential quarter i(that is the s-that, is associated with the S-residential quarter measures).Therefore, UE is necessary to determine the whether residential quarter of remote radio devices, residential quarter.In one embodiment, UE can determine on the F2 the S-residential quarter whether the remote radio devices residential quarter or make in the following method in the residential quarter of one or more eNB:
