Definitions
- the specification relates to authorizing access right between users in social network systems or messaging systems.
- a first user and second user share a computer or phone device.
- the first user may want the second user to comment on a post with an online social network service on behalf of the first user.
- Some existing systems may not provide functionality regarding this requirement and the second user has to write in the content of the comment that this comment is actually from the first user. However, this may be confusing to readers and this may cause inaccuracy when counting users' activities.
- Other existing systems may allow the first user and second user to link their accounts to accomplish the authorization, which, however, requires a higher level of trust and control between each other not limited to commenting on posts and requires a period of time for the systems to prepare the linking between the two accounts.
- a system for suggesting authorization of access right between users includes: a processor and a memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to: determine a first user based at least in part on one or more user interactions associated with the first user, the first user having a potential for authorizing other users to act on behalf of the first user; determine one or more second users as authorization candidates for the first user based on the one or more user interactions associated with the first user; generate suggestion data recommending the first user to authorize the one or more second users an access right to act on the behalf of the first user; provide the suggestion data to the first user; and responsive to the first user authorizing the one or more second users the access right to act on the behalf of the first user, update an account setting for the first user describing the authorization of the access right to the one or more second users.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include: determining a first user based at least in part on one or more user interactions associated with the first user, the first user having a potential for authorizing other users to act on behalf of the first user; determining one or more second users as authorization candidates for the first user based on the one or more user interactions associated with the first user; generating suggestion data recommending the first user to authorize the one or more second users an access right to act on the behalf of the first user; providing the suggestion data to the first user; and responsive to the first user authorizing the one or more second users the access right to act on the behalf of the first user, updating an account setting for the first user describing the authorization of the access right to the one or more second users.
- the operations further include: receiving a request for a third user commenting on a post on behalf of the first user, determining whether the post has been shared with the first user, responsive to the determination that the post has been shared with the first user, determining whether the first user has an access right to comment on the post, responsive to the determination that the first user has the access right to comment on the post, determining whether the third user has an access right to comment on behalf of the first user based at least in part on the account setting for the first user, and responsive to the determination that the third user has the access right to comment on behalf of the first user, sending an authorization signal; receiving a submission signal indicating that the third user has submitted a comment responding to the post, generating a first notification for the first user including the comment, and sending the first notification to the first user; receiving an edit on the comment from the third user, updating a version index for the edited comment, generating a second notification for the first user including the edited comment, and sending the second
- the features include: the first user and the one or more second users sharing one or more electronic devices including a computer and a phone; and the suggestion data recommending the first user to authorize the one or more second users the access right to comment on a post on the behalf of the first user.
- the system may allow users who share computer devices to authorize each other certain access rights regarding their social accounts and their social activities with a social network service.
- the system may allow users to only authorize social abilities (e.g., ability to comment on posts, ability to publish new posts, etc.) to other users without letting them know private account information.
- the system may also provide useful information about links between users or accounts. For example, the advertisement agents can take advantage of the useful information when promoting products to the users or accounts.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example system for authorizing access rights between users.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example of an authorization application.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example of a suggestion application.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example method for suggesting a first user to authorize access rights to one or more second users.
- FIGS. 5A-5B are flowcharts of an example method for suggesting a first user to authorize access rights to one or more second users.
- FIGS. 6A-6C are flowcharts of an example method for authorizing a first user to comment on behalf of a second user.

- these entities of the system 100 are communicatively coupled via a network 105 .
- the user devices 115 a , 115 n in FIG. 1 can be used by way of example. While FIG. 1 illustrates two user devices 115 a and 115 n , the present disclosure applies to a system architecture having one or more user devices 115 . Furthermore, although FIG. 1 illustrates one network 105 coupled to the user devices 115 , the social network server 101 , the third party server 107 , the account server 109 and the advertisement server 151 , in practice one or more networks 105 can be connected to these entities.

- the common features may be provided by one or more social networking systems including explicitly defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users, where the relationships form a social graph.
- the social graph can reflect a mapping of these users and how they can be related.
- the social network server 101 and the social network application 103 can be representative of one social network and that there may be multiple social networks coupled to the network 105 , each having its own server, application and social graph. For example, a first social network may be more directed to business networking, a second may be more directed to or centered on academics, a third may be more directed to local business, a fourth may be directed to dating and others may be of general interest or a specific focus.
