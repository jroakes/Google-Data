- the system may use contextual information including time from a device's clock, darkness from the mobile device's optical sensor, and/or the sound of snoring detected by a device's microphone, as well as the historical data of the user's past heart rate and movement data that indicates the user tends to be asleep during the pertinent time period to determine that the contextual environment of the example situation may be that the user is asleep and does not wish to be disturbed by phone calls.
- the system may generate a notice regarding a feature that allows the user to silence the mobile device when the user is asleep.
- each particular environmental context may be determined by a different set of contextual information and historical information.

In this way, the user can be notified about a context-based feature or application that may be beneficial to use at the time and place of notification (i.e., when the user is present in the environmental context to which the context-based feature or application applies).
- a context-based feature may relate to a particular time, place, or set of circumstances.
- an application that allows a user to share content from the user's device with other devices using a Bluetooth connection may only be useful in the circumstance where other Bluetooth-enabled devices belonging to people a user desires to share content with are within an adequate proximity to the user's device.

- the system would require historical information indicative of the user's friends and family who the user desires to share content with, and contextual information indicating whether any such person is currently within Bluetooth proximity to the user's mobile computing device 300. Accordingly, upon receiving the pertinent contextual information and historical information and upon determining the corresponding environmental context, the computing device can cause a notification to be presented to the user to inform the user of the Bluetooth sharing feature, such that the user may be in a position to utilize the feature at the time of notification.
- a context-based application may be an application that allows a user to passively disable an electronic locking mechanism of mobile computing device 300 when the user is at home (“smart lock").
- the environmental context would be that the user is at home and the user desires to access the contents of a mobile computing device 300 (as indicated by the user's attempt to unlock mobile computing device 300).
- a system of the present disclosure ideally would know historical information and contextual information such as: 1) that the user desires to access contents of their mobile device when it home, 2) where the user's home is, and 3) when the user is at home.

- the computing device before generating a notification related to a context-based feature, the computing device can determine (206 from FIG. 2 ) whether a context-based feature fails to meet a usage criteria.
- determining, for example, that the user has already activated the feature in the past e.g., an example usage criteria
- the computing device may avoid generating notifications regarding features and applications for which the user is already aware.
- no notification relating to a context-based feature of mobile computing device 300 will be generated if the user's past use of the context-based feature meets the usage criteria.
- the method may first determine whether a usage criteria has been met.
- Examples of a usage criteria can include, but are not limited to, the number of times the a context-based feature has been accessed by the user, the frequency with which the context-based feature has been accessed, or the time elapsed since the context-based feature was last accessed. For example, in some implementations, if the user has accessed the context-based feature multiple times, the method may nonetheless generate a notification to the user if the last time the context-based feature was accessed was over a year ago.
- a smart lock feature can passively disable a locking function of mobile computing device 300 when mobile computing device 300 is at the user's home, such that a user may access the contents of mobile computing device 300 without having to first unlock it.
- a computing device receives an indication of historical information, wherein the historical information could include the location of the user's home (e.g., as previously specified by the user or obtained from the user's address book), as well as the user's history indicating whether the user has ever accessed or used the smart lock before.
- the computing device could further receive an indication of contextual information which would include the current location of mobile computing device 300, as determined by, for example, the GPS coordinates of the device or that the device is within WiFi range of a home access point.
- the indication of contextual information can also include an indication that the user is attempting to access content on mobile computing device 300.
- the computing device can then determine the environmental context of mobile computing device 300 from the historical information and the contextual information, which in this case can be along the lines that "the user is at home and desires to access content on the mobile device.”
- the environmental context of the user being at home and desiring to access content on the device is associated with the context-based feature of the smart lock feature because that feature becomes useful in that environmental context.
- the computing device can determine whether the user has previously activated the smart lock feature or not. According to some implementations, if the computing device determines that the user has not accessed the smart lock feature before, then it can cause a notification relating to the smart lock feature to be generated on mobile computing device 300. In some implementations, the notification may be designed to inform the user about the existence of the smart lock feature. For example, as shown in FIG. 3B , the mobile computing device 300 may output a notification 308 in response to a user attempting to unlock the mobile device's lock 306 while at home.
- a notification may be a message that is presented on the screen 302 of mobile computing device 300.
- the message can be designed to inform the user of the existence of the context-based feature or application of mobile computing device 300.
- the message may provide a link to the context-based feature of mobile computing device 300 that can allow the user to easily access the context-based feature on mobile computing device 300.
- the message may include an overview of the functionalities and usefulness of the context-based feature.
- the message may include a tutorial designed to show the user how to use or set up the context-based feature.

- aspects of the present disclosure may further include a step of, after determining that a usage criteria associated with the feature has not been met, but before causing a notification to be generated, determining whether mobile computing device 300 has been in the particular environmental context more than a threshold number of times.
- usage criteria may have both minimum and maximum parameter values or more than one range of parameter values.
- the computing device may compare the number of times the mobile device has been in the environmental context to a particular notification threshold and may only output an indication of the determination that the context-based feature has not met the usage criteria upon exceeding the notification threshold. For example, in the case of the smart lock described above, there may be a notification threshold of ten attempts to unlock the mobile computing device while at the user's home. In other words, in this implementation, the method may not notify the user of the smart lock feature upon the first time the user attempts to unlock mobile computing device 300 at home, but would wait until the eleventh time the user attempts to unlock mobile computing device 300 at home before causing a notification to be sent. In some implementations, each context-based feature may have a different notification threshold.
- the notification threshold may reset after the notification is generated. For example, in the previously described case of the smart lock feature having a notification threshold of ten, after the eleventh attempt at unlocking the phone at home the system can generate a notification, but if the user does not respond to the notification or access and activate the smart lock feature, the system may generate another notification relating to the smart lock feature after the next eleven unlock attempts.
- aspects of the present disclosure may have additional steps to prevent notifications from overwhelming a user with notifications about available features and applications.
- the number of notifications that may be provided to the user over a specified time frame may be limited by a notification limit.
- a notification limit of two may limit the number of notifications to two notifications per month. If the number of notifications is so limited, in some implementations, potential notifications in excess of that number can simply be temporarily discarded. For example, in some implementations a notification in excess of the limit may be discarded and will only be generated upon the next time the mobile computing device 300 enters the required environmental context relating to the context-based feature that was the subject of the notification.
- a notification in excess of the limit may be delayed and presented to the user at the expiration of the specified time frame.
- the notification in excess of the limit may be saved to mobile computing device 300 and may be accessible by a user at their own discretion.
- a notification limit may limit the number of times the system notifies a user about a particular context-based feature. For example, in some implementations the system may only display a notification about a particular context-based feature twice and then never again.
- the disclosed technology can incorporate data from other users to improve the notification process.
- the system can collect information across all users regarding notifications made to users, as well as the users' subsequent responses to those notifications to determine which notifications are more likely to result in a user utilizing the context-based feature that is the subject of the notification. The system can then prioritize which context-based features to notify a user about first.
- the system can adjust a threshold used to determine when to send a notification to a user based on the rate of user adoption of the context-based feature.
- the system may reduce the threshold required to be met before notifying a user who has not yet been notified of the context-based feature. In this way, the system can more actively promote context-based features that a user is more likely to want to use, thereby making the notification process less intrusive to the user.

Description
- Computing devices, such as mobile phones, may contain a number of features, functionalities, and applications designed to provide increased utility to a user of the computing device. In some such computing devices, features may be continually added as operating systems or applications receive updates. In some situations, features, functionalities, and applications of a computing device may be so plentiful and new that a user may be ignorant of them even when they would be useful to the user. As such, a user may have difficulty in achieving awareness of features that the user would otherwise desire to use. Additionally, certain functionalities, features, and applications of a computing device may only be useful in a particular context, such as in a particular situation or for a user with a particular set of needs. Thus, it may require substantial effort on the part of a user to learn and remember various new and legacy features of the computing device. Further, it may require substantial additional time and effort on the part of the user to then determine which of those features or applications, and under what circumstances, the features or applications may be useful.
- Patent application
US 2014/188956 A1 relates to a recommendation computing device that is enabled to receive information defining a current user context from a client computing device, to correlate the received current context to application/content that the user of a client computing device is likely to subsequently access and to select the applications/contents to recommend based on a determined probability, wherein the recommended applications/content are then proactively presented to the user within a user interface of the client computing device. - Patent application
EP 2 755 118 A1 describes a context awareness engine located in a controller of a mobile device, that, upon an event occurrence, generates recommended items based on user log information. The context awareness-based recommended items are then displayed to the user. - The invention is specified by the independent claims. Accordingly, an aspect of the invention is to provide a method, a system and a non-transitory computer-readable medium for notifying a user of a mobile computing device about a feature of the mobile computing device that has not been previously accessed by the user. Further preferred embodiments are defined by the dependent claims.
- Reference will now be made to the accompanying FIGS., which are not necessarily drawn to scale, and wherein:
-
FIG. 1 depictscomputing system architecture 100, according to an example implementation of the disclosed technology. -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of amethod 200, according to an example implementation. -
FIG. 3A illustrates acomputing device 300, according to an example implementation. -
FIG. 3B illustrates acomputing device 300 with a notification relating to a context-based feature that is output for display, according to an example implementation. - Some implementations of the disclosed technology will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.
- Example implementations of the disclosed technology can provide systems and methods for notifying a user of a mobile computing device about a feature of the device or application for use with the device that the user may find useful but is otherwise unaware. In particular, the disclosed systems and methods may notify a user of a mobile device about a feature or application of the device that may be useful to the user in a given context. For example, the system may notify a user about an application designed to allow Bluetooth sharing of files if the system observes that the user is attempting to email files to friends who are located nearby. Upon learning of the Bluetooth sharing application, the user may be able to more efficiently share files with friends. According to some implementations, the system may notify the user of the feature or application only if the user has not previously accessed the feature or application. Thus, the disclosed technology can be useful for informing users of mobile devices about relevant features and applications of which the user is unaware. Implementations of the disclosed technology may also provide the user with tutorials of the context-based feature or application and allow the user to activate the feature or application upon notification.
- Certain implementations of the disclosed technology may provide convenient methods for determining a mobile device's environmental context and notifying a user of a feature or application that may be useful in relation to that particular environmental context. For example, computing devices may have a variety of sensors and transceivers that may be monitored to collect data that can be used in deriving the mobile device's environmental context. Further, a computing device can also monitor signals from applications running on the computing device, such as, for example, web browsers, text messaging, email applications, and others for information that may be used in addition to sensor data in deriving the environmental context of the device. According to some implementations, if the environmental context of the mobile device is known, the system of the disclosed technology can notify the user about features and applications that are pertinent to the user's current situation or circumstances.
- Thus, the disclosed technology may provide notifications to a user that allow a user to learn about various new and legacy features of a mobile device in situations in which a particular feature or application may be useful to the user. As will be appreciated, by notifying the user of a capability or context-based feature of the device appropriate to the current context, a user is more likely to appreciate the usefulness of the feature and may gain greater knowledge and utilization of the features of the mobile device.

More specifically, the CPU 102 loads computer-executable process steps from thestorage medium 122 or other media into a field of the RAM 118 in order to execute software programs. Data may be stored in the RAM 118, where the data may be accessed by the computer CPU 102 during execution.

FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of amethod 200 according to an example implementation of the disclosed technology. Themethod 200 begins atblock 202, where a computing device receives an indication of contextual information and an indication of historical information relating to the computing device and/or of the user of the computing device. Atblock 204, the computing device determines an environmental context of a mobile device (i.e., a computing device of a particular user), wherein the environmental context is associated with one or more context-based features of the computing device. In example implementations, the computing device determines the environmental context of the mobile device in response to receiving the indication of contextual information and the indication of historical information of the user of the computing device. Atdecision block 206, the computing device determines from the indication of historical information whether a usage criteria associated with the context-based feature associated with the environmental context has been met. - A usage criteria can be a set of conditions relating to the historical usage of the context-based feature or a related feature. According to some implementations, a usage criteria can include whether the context-based feature has ever been previously activated, the number of times a context-based feature has been activated or used in the past, the number of times the context-based feature has been activated over a specified time frame (e.g., the feature has been activated 3 times in the last 6 months), or whether a similar feature has been activated by the user. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that these examples of usage criteria are merely illustrative and that usage criteria could encompass a wide array of conditions. The usage criteria can be useful in establishing whether or not a user is likely already aware of the context-based feature or whether the user should be notified about the existence of the feature. For example, in some implementations a usage criteria can be whether the context-based feature associated with the environmental context has been activated three or more times in the past. In example implementations, a computing device can make this determination based on the historical information previously received. According to some implementations, if a computing device determines that the context-based feature has met the usage criteria, then the method can end at
block 290, otherwise the method can advance to block 208. Atblock 208, in response to determining that the context-based feature associated with the environmental context has not met the usage criteria, the computing device outputs an indication of the determination that the context-based feature has not met the usage criteria, such that the mobile device annunciates a notification related to the context-based feature. In this way, the mobile device can notify the user about a feature or application of the device that may be useful to the user in the present circumstances (i.e., the present environmental context). According to example implementations, the notification can inform the user of the mobile device about how to use the feature or application of the mobile device. The details of themethod 200 will now be described in further detail below. - As previously discussed, in various implementations, the disclosed technology can output for presentation a notification to a user of a mobile device regarding features or applications of the device about which the user may be unfamiliar. According to some implementations, the notification can relate to a feature or application that is context-based (i.e., a feature or application that may be useful based on the particular environmental context of the mobile computing device 300). According to implementations of the disclosed technology, an environmental context can be broadly understood as representing the situation or circumstances of the
mobile computing device 300 and/or the user. According to some implementations, a computing device of the disclosed technology, such as amobile computing device 300 or a remote server, can determine the environmental context ofmobile computing device 300 in response to receiving 202 indications of contextual information and indications of historical information. - It will be understood by one of skill in the art that "indications of contextual/historical information" may be used interchangeably with "contextual/historical information," as those of skill in the art will appreciate that computing devices are capable of receiving and processing both information and indications of information as necessary and appropriate. In some implementations, contextual information can be data derived from sensors of
mobile computing device 300 that indicate the physical environment of themobile computing device 300. For example, this may include sensor readings regarding sound from sound interface 116 ofFIG. 1 , light from ambientlight sensor interface 140, imagery from camera interface 114, temperature fromthermometer interface 142, movement fromaccelerometer interface 144, orientation fromgyroscope interface 146, location fromGPS location interface 148, atmospheric pressure from an atmospheric pressure interface 152 (which can include a barometer), moisture or humidity from ahumidity sensor interface 154, and other sensor readings relevant to the current environment of themobile computing device 300. Further, contextual information can include data derived from monitoring signals ofmobile computing device 300 at antenna interface 110, network connection interface 112, ortelephony subsystem 132 to obtain information about the user's activities onmobile computing device 300. For example, contextual information may be derived from monitoring text messages, emails, phone calls, or web browsing onmobile computing device 300. - Historical data can be broadly understood to include information relating to a user's past use of features and applications of
mobile computing device 300 stored locally in RAM 118 ordata files 128 or stored remotely and accessed through network connection interface 112. Historical data can also include other information about the user such as the user's home address, their phone book, social networking connections, past places they have been, their web browsing history, and a wide assortment of other such information. To illustrate these concepts, in one example a user may have conducted an internet search on directions to the library (i.e., historical information), and readings from the accelerometer and GPS on the user's mobile computing device can indicate the location and movement of a user (i.e., contextual information). Based on the historical information of the internet search for directions to the library, a computing device of the present disclosure may be able to predict a user's intent to go to the library. Further, a computing device can determine the user's mode of transportation and heading based on current and historical data acquired from the accelerometer and GPS. Thus, in the foregoing example, the system of the present technology may determine that the user may be traveling (e.g., walking, on a bike, or in a car) on a particular route on their way to the library (i.e., the environmental context). - According to some implementations, a computing device can determine the environmental context of the mobile computing device using the contextual information or a combination of the contextual information and historical information. In the example described above, after the environmental context is determined from historical information and contextual information, the system can provide notifications to the user regarding features and applications of the
mobile computing device 300 that are pertinent to the environmental context. For example, the system can provide a notification to the user relating to an interactive library application that may provide hours of operation, floor plans, and a searchable inventory of books. - As described above, in some implementations, a computing device of the disclosed technology can receive contextual information. As discussed, contextual information can be information relating to the physical environment or user activity of the
mobile computing device 300 at a given point in time. The physical environment can include, without limitation, whether it is noisy or quiet, whether is it light or dark, whether it is hot or cold, whether it is dry or humid, the ambient pressure, atmospheric conditions such as rain, snow, wind, or cloudiness, as well as the location ofmobile computing device 300. According to some implementations, a computing device can obtain information about the physical environment through sensors, such as, for example, an atmospheric pressure sensor which can provide data to themobile computing device 300 through anatmospheric pressure interface 152. According to some implementations, a computing device of the present disclosure can also obtain information about the physical environment from remote devices, such as servers hosting websites that contain weather information that pertains to the location of the mobile computing device. The location ofmobile computing device 300 can be for example, a geographic location (such as GPS coordinates), a semantic location (such as "Georgia Tech campus"), or a particular room in a building. User activity can include an observation of the user's actions derived by sensing and monitoring themobile computing device 300. For example, user activity may be walking, running, driving, riding a bike, talking on the phone, sitting still, sending text messages, using a web browser to search for a particular item, or any number of other activities of which it may be possible to discern using data and information gathered by one or more computing devices. - According to some implementations, contextual information can be obtained from sensors and listeners on a mobile computing device that can monitor the activity of a mobile device.
FIG. 3A illustrates amobile computing device 300 according to an example implementation of the disclosed technology, which may include some or all of the components of thecomputing device 100 shown inFIG. 1 . Typically,mobile computing device 300 has a variety of sensors. For example, adisplay screen 302 ofmobile computing device 300 can be an implementation of a presence-sensitive input device 108 ofFIG. 1 , such as a capacitive touchscreen, which can sense touches on thedisplay screen 302 made by a user. Another sensor ofmobile computing device 300 can be anaudio input device 310, such as a microphone, for receiving audio or voice commands and providing them to themobile computing device 300 through sound interface 116 ofFIG. 1 .Audio input device 310 can also be activated to detect and receive audio data, such as for example, background noise of the environment surroundingmobile computing device 300.Mobile computing device 300 can also include an accelerometer and/or a gyroscope, either of which can be capable of detecting the movement, acceleration, and orientation ofmobile computing device 300 and providing sensor readings tomobile computing device 300 through anaccelerometer interface 144 and agyroscope interface 146, respectively..Mobile computing device 300 can also include an optical sensor, such as a light sensor for detection of light, or a camera which can take digital photos or videos and provide data representative of the light, photos, or videos tomobile computing device 300 through an ambientlight sensor interface 140 and a camera interface 114, respectively.Mobile computing device 300 can also include a GPS receiver for detecting the geographical position ofmobile computing device 300 and can provide GPS data tomobile computing device 300 through aGPS location interface 148. -
Mobile computing device 300 can include any number of other sensors that are known in the art, such as, for example, but not limited to, a pressure sensor, a heart rate monitor, a temperature sensor, a vibration sensor, a chemical sensor, or a moisture or humidity sensor. Through the use of a cellular antenna, Bluetooth antenna, or the like,mobile computing device 300 can also be capable of detecting certain other electronic devices within a specified proximity. As will be understood by those of skill in the art,mobile computing device 300 can have various sensor interfaces similar to those inFIG. 1 that are configured to allow the transfer of data from the sensors to themobile computing device 300. In some implementations, a remote computing device can be capable of activating one or more of the sensors ofmobile computing device 300. - It will be understood by those of skill in the art that the presently disclosed technology may utilize a wide array of sensors to actively or passively collect context information about
mobile computing device 300 and its surroundings in accordance with the disclosed technology. In addition to obtaining contextual information from the sensors described above, and as described previously,mobile computing device 300 can also obtain contextual information by monitoring information and signals relating to the use of device features, such as the content of mobile applications, text messages, emails, phone conversations and other content that is accessed by a user of mobile computing device 300 (collectively, "application data"). According to some implementations, some or all of the sensor data and application data (collectively, contextual information) may be stored onmobile computing device 300 or on a remote computing device, such as a remote server. Further, according to some implementations, if a user is associated with more than one device, all data associated with a user can be associated with a user profile which can enable centralized monitoring of the user's activity across all devices, and thus, any sensor or application data gathered from one device can be accessed by the other related devices. For example, if a user visits a website on a home computer associated with the user's profile, the user'smobile computing device 300 can receive data relating to the user's visit to the website. According to some implementations, data from all of a user's devices may be associated with a user profile. According to some implementations, data from some or all of a user's devices may be stored onmobile computing device 300 or on a remote server. - As described above, before determining an environmental context and generating a notification, a computing device of the disclosed technology can receive historical information relating to the user of the computing device. In some implementations, historical information, which may be stored in RAM 118, on a remote computing device and/or on a cloud server, can broadly include records of a user's past usage of features and applications of
mobile computing device 300, as well as other information about the user such as their home address, their phone book, social networking connections, past places they have been to, their web browsing history and a wide assortment of other such information. For example, historical information might include an indication that a user has performed an internet search attempting to locate a particular book for purchase. Historical information can also include whether a user has previously accessed or used a particular feature or application ofmobile computing device 300. For example, historical information might include an indication that the user has never accessed an image capture application ofmobile computing device 300. In some implementations, historical information can include how many times and/or how often a user has activated a particular feature or application ofmobile computing device 300. According to some implementations, a computing device of the disclosed technology can monitor usage of amobile computing device 300 and store historical information based on the monitored activity. In some implementations, the historical information of the user of the computing device can be stored on a remote computing device. In some implementations, the historical information obtained from monitoring the use ofmobile computing device 300 can be combined with historical information of other devices associated with a user's user profile. - In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed technology, before generating a notification, a computing device can determine an environmental context of
mobile computing device 300 in response to receiving an indication of contextual information and an indication of historical information of the user of the computing device. As noted previously, the environmental context ofmobile computing device 300 can broadly represent the situation or circumstances of the mobile device and the user. According to some implementations, a variety of different environmental contexts can be derived from different combinations of contextual information and historical information. As noted previously in an example situation, the system can use contextual information such as GPS and accelerometer readings paired with historical information such as an internet search of a route to the library to determine that the environmental context of the example is that a user is riding a bike to the library. In another example situation, the system may use contextual information including time from a device's clock, darkness from the mobile device's optical sensor, and/or the sound of snoring detected by a device's microphone, as well as the historical data of the user's past heart rate and movement data that indicates the user tends to be asleep during the pertinent time period to determine that the contextual environment of the example situation may be that the user is asleep and does not wish to be disturbed by phone calls. In this case, in the event of an unwanted call while the user is asleep, the system may generate a notice regarding a feature that allows the user to silence the mobile device when the user is asleep. Thus, as will be understood, each particular environmental context may be determined by a different set of contextual information and historical information. According to some implementations, the environmental context ofmobile computing device 300 can be determined by a context manager. In some implementations, a context manager can be an application that can collect contextual information and historical information from one or more devices used by the user, to determine the environmental context ofmobile computing device 300. - After an environmental context is determined, a
computing device 100 according to the present disclosure may identify a context-based feature suitable for use in the environmental context prior to generating a notification. Context-based features and applications can be features and applications that have usefulness under a particular set of circumstances. As previously described above, the environmental context ofmobile computing device 300 can be associated with one or more context-based features or applications ofmobile computing device 300 that are suitable for use in the environmental context. Accordingly, in some implementations, a notification generated and output onmobile computing device 300 can relate to a context-based feature or application that is associated with the current environmental context. In this way, the user can be notified about a context-based feature or application that may be beneficial to use at the time and place of notification (i.e., when the user is present in the environmental context to which the context-based feature or application applies). - A context-based feature may relate to a particular time, place, or set of circumstances. For example, an application that allows a user to share content from the user's device with other devices using a Bluetooth connection may only be useful in the circumstance where other Bluetooth-enabled devices belonging to people a user desires to share content with are within an adequate proximity to the user's device. Thus, in the foregoing example, a system of the present disclosure ideally would know historical information and contextual information such as: 1) that the user desires to share content with others via the application, 2) the identities of associated people and devices that the user wishes to share content with, and 3) whether any such associated people and devices are within range of the Bluetooth signal of
mobile computing device 300. According to this example, the system would require historical information indicative of the user's friends and family who the user desires to share content with, and contextual information indicating whether any such person is currently within Bluetooth proximity to the user'smobile computing device 300. Accordingly, upon receiving the pertinent contextual information and historical information and upon determining the corresponding environmental context, the computing device can cause a notification to be presented to the user to inform the user of the Bluetooth sharing feature, such that the user may be in a position to utilize the feature at the time of notification. - Another example of a context-based application may be an application that allows a user to passively disable an electronic locking mechanism of
mobile computing device 300 when the user is at home ("smart lock"). In this case, the environmental context would be that the user is at home and the user desires to access the contents of a mobile computing device 300 (as indicated by the user's attempt to unlock mobile computing device 300). Thus, in the foregoing example, a system of the present disclosure ideally would know historical information and contextual information such as: 1) that the user desires to access contents of their mobile device when it home, 2) where the user's home is, and 3) when the user is at home. This could be implemented with the knowledge of the historical information of the user's home location and the contextual information of the user's current location. In accordance with some implementations, the system may generate a notification to inform the user about the smart lock feature upon observing the user attempting to unlock the mobile device at home. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, there can be a vast array of context-based features of a mobile device that can require a variety of different historical information and contextual information to function. - In accordance with implementations of the disclosed technology, before generating a notification related to a context-based feature, the computing device can determine (206 from
FIG. 2 ) whether a context-based feature fails to meet a usage criteria. As will be appreciated, determining, for example, that the user has already activated the feature in the past (e.g., an example usage criteria) may allow the computing device to avoid generating notifications regarding features and applications for which the user is already aware. Thus, according to some implementations, no notification relating to a context-based feature ofmobile computing device 300 will be generated if the user's past use of the context-based feature meets the usage criteria. Thus, in some implementations, when determining whether or not a notification will be generated, the method may first determine whether a usage criteria has been met. Examples of a usage criteria can include, but are not limited to, the number of times the a context-based feature has been accessed by the user, the frequency with which the context-based feature has been accessed, or the time elapsed since the context-based feature was last accessed. For example, in some implementations, if the user has accessed the context-based feature multiple times, the method may nonetheless generate a notification to the user if the last time the context-based feature was accessed was over a year ago. - An example implementation of the disclosed technology will now be described with respect to the previously described smart lock context-based feature. As will be understood, a smart lock feature can passively disable a locking function of
mobile computing device 300 whenmobile computing device 300 is at the user's home, such that a user may access the contents ofmobile computing device 300 without having to first unlock it. Thus, in an example implementation, a computing device receives an indication of historical information, wherein the historical information could include the location of the user's home (e.g., as previously specified by the user or obtained from the user's address book), as well as the user's history indicating whether the user has ever accessed or used the smart lock before. The computing device could further receive an indication of contextual information which would include the current location ofmobile computing device 300, as determined by, for example, the GPS coordinates of the device or that the device is within WiFi range of a home access point. The indication of contextual information can also include an indication that the user is attempting to access content onmobile computing device 300. The computing device can then determine the environmental context ofmobile computing device 300 from the historical information and the contextual information, which in this case can be along the lines that "the user is at home and desires to access content on the mobile device." The environmental context of the user being at home and desiring to access content on the device is associated with the context-based feature of the smart lock feature because that feature becomes useful in that environmental context. Next, based on the indication of historical information previously received, the computing device can determine whether the user has previously activated the smart lock feature or not. According to some implementations, if the computing device determines that the user has not accessed the smart lock feature before, then it can cause a notification relating to the smart lock feature to be generated onmobile computing device 300. In some implementations, the notification may be designed to inform the user about the existence of the smart lock feature. For example, as shown inFIG. 3B , themobile computing device 300 may output anotification 308 in response to a user attempting to unlock the mobile device'slock 306 while at home. - According to some implementations, a notification may be a message that is presented on the
screen 302 ofmobile computing device 300. The message can be designed to inform the user of the existence of the context-based feature or application ofmobile computing device 300. According to some implementations, the message may provide a link to the context-based feature ofmobile computing device 300 that can allow the user to easily access the context-based feature onmobile computing device 300. In some implementations, the message may include an overview of the functionalities and usefulness of the context-based feature. In some implementations, the message may include a tutorial designed to show the user how to use or set up the context-based feature. Further, in some implementations the message may provide a link to an external website that can provide more information regarding the context-based feature. In some implementations, a notification can be audible. For example,mobile computing device 300 may emit a sound such as a ring or a beep. In some implementations, a notification can be tactile. For example,mobile computing device 300 can vibrate. - According to some implementations, it may be desirable to avoid notifying a user of a feature or application before the user has had adequate time to explore the features and applications of the
mobile computing device 300. Thus, according to some implementations, aspects of the present disclosure may further include a step of, after determining that a usage criteria associated with the feature has not been met, but before causing a notification to be generated, determining whethermobile computing device 300 has been in the particular environmental context more than a threshold number of times. In other words, usage criteria may have both minimum and maximum parameter values or more than one range of parameter values. In some implementations, the computing device may compare the number of times the mobile device has been in the environmental context to a particular notification threshold and may only output an indication of the determination that the context-based feature has not met the usage criteria upon exceeding the notification threshold. For example, in the case of the smart lock described above, there may be a notification threshold of ten attempts to unlock the mobile computing device while at the user's home. In other words, in this implementation, the method may not notify the user of the smart lock feature upon the first time the user attempts to unlockmobile computing device 300 at home, but would wait until the eleventh time the user attempts to unlockmobile computing device 300 at home before causing a notification to be sent. In some implementations, each context-based feature may have a different notification threshold. As will be appreciated, incorporating a threshold or providing additional restraints on how soon a notification can be sent to a user about a particular context-based feature may allow users time to explore features of their mobile computing devices on their own and prevent overwhelming users with notifications when their mobile computing devices are new. In some implementations, the notification threshold may reset after the notification is generated. For example, in the previously described case of the smart lock feature having a notification threshold of ten, after the eleventh attempt at unlocking the phone at home the system can generate a notification, but if the user does not respond to the notification or access and activate the smart lock feature, the system may generate another notification relating to the smart lock feature after the next eleven unlock attempts. - According to some implementations, aspects of the present disclosure may have additional steps to prevent notifications from overwhelming a user with notifications about available features and applications. In some implementations of the disclosed technology, the number of notifications that may be provided to the user over a specified time frame may be limited by a notification limit. For example, in some implementations, a notification limit of two may limit the number of notifications to two notifications per month. If the number of notifications is so limited, in some implementations, potential notifications in excess of that number can simply be temporarily discarded. For example, in some implementations a notification in excess of the limit may be discarded and will only be generated upon the next time the
mobile computing device 300 enters the required environmental context relating to the context-based feature that was the subject of the notification. In some implementations, a notification in excess of the limit may be delayed and presented to the user at the expiration of the specified time frame. In some implementations, the notification in excess of the limit may be saved tomobile computing device 300 and may be accessible by a user at their own discretion. In some implementations, a notification limit may limit the number of times the system notifies a user about a particular context-based feature. For example, in some implementations the system may only display a notification about a particular context-based feature twice and then never again. - According to some implementations, the disclosed technology can incorporate data from other users to improve the notification process. In some implementations, the system can collect information across all users regarding notifications made to users, as well as the users' subsequent responses to those notifications to determine which notifications are more likely to result in a user utilizing the context-based feature that is the subject of the notification. The system can then prioritize which context-based features to notify a user about first. Furthermore, in some implementations, the system can adjust a threshold used to determine when to send a notification to a user based on the rate of user adoption of the context-based feature. For example, if a particular context-based feature is used by a high rate of users after receiving a notification, the system may reduce the threshold required to be met before notifying a user who has not yet been notified of the context-based feature. In this way, the system can more actively promote context-based features that a user is more likely to want to use, thereby making the notification process less intrusive to the user.
