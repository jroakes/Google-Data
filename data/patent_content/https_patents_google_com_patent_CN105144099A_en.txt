Embodiment
With reference to Figure 1A, 1B and 2, in some embodiments, group system 100 is included in the cluster 200 of the machine 210 (such as, storer main frame, computation processor, computing machine etc.) of grouping in unit 202.Cluster 200 can implement distributed system 201, described distributed system comprises loosely-coupled machine 210,210a to n (such as, be embodied as computing machine or the server of storer main frame or processor), its have separately with storage resources 214 (such as, non-transitory storer, flash memory, dynamic RAM (DRAM), phase transition storage (PCM) and/or disk) computational resource 212 (such as, one or more processor) that communicates.Distributed system 201 can comprise the storage covered on storage resources 214 abstract (such as, key/value storehouse (store) or file system), and it allows one or more client 120,120a to n to use the easily extensible of storage resources 214.Client 120 communicates with machine 210 by network 102.
Client/server model allows client 120 from machine 210 (herein also referred to as server 210) request service.Server 210 is exclusively used in one or more request 130 running and receive from one or more client 120 usually.Usually and as shown in figure, client/server communication occurs via computer network 102, wherein client 120 and server 210 have independent hardware unit at diverse location place.One in the central issue of the client/server model in group system 100 is a large amount of clients 120 in group system 100 and machine 210.In such systems, any given server 210 makes server 210 many clients 120 that over-burden share by available client end request 130.
Client-requested 130 comprises two parts, that is, control section 132 and service load part 134.Control section 132 is relatively little and containing such as, about information 133 (such as, metadata), the priority, size etc. of service load part 134.Service load part 134 comprises the data 135 be associated with control section 132.Therefore, because service load part 134 is containing more data 135, so the size of service load part is usually large than control section 132.
The request 130 of both each self-contained control section 132 and service load part 134 is sent in the situation of server 210 by one or more client 120 wherein, when the performance of described system is subject to some limited assemblies (such as, storage resources) restriction time, can bottleneck problem be there is.The situation of frequent appearance is: server 210 receives a large amount of client-requested 130, and if each request 130 comprises control section 132 and service load part 134, so server 210 can receive data more more than the accessible data of its storage resources 214.Then, server 210 can due to ask 130 and overload and may storer be finished.Additionally or alternati, hol blocking (head-of-lineblocking) can be there is.When blocking the residue input in impact damper when the first input (that is, the head of input buffer), hol blocking (HOL obstruction) can be there is.Except non-process or remove the first input, otherwise other input in impact damper cannot be processed.Because single connection can carry the request 130 under various priority, suspend the request 130 (such as, causing HOL to block) under all priority so suspend to connect.In addition, when client 120 necessary re-try request 130, refusal request 130 consumption network and cpu resource, and scheduling can be made more difficult, this is because server 210 no longer knows request 130.On the other hand, if the control section 132 of request 130 is first only sent to server 210 by client 120, so server 210 has the request 130 that relatively more available storage resources 214 [Fig. 3] processes more big figure relatively.Server 210 can retrieve service load part 134 more late time (time such as, in the request 130 of process).
Fig. 3 provides the general view of the communication between client 120 and server 210.In some embodiments, control section 132 is sent to server 210 by client 120.Described request is stored in its storer 214 until processor 212 gets out process request 130 by server 210.When processor 212 can with and when getting out process request 130, the service load part 134 of server 210 retrieval request 130 also processes request 130.In some instances, described server uses Remote Direct Memory access (RDMA) to carry out the service load part 134 of the corresponding control section 132 of retrieval request 130.RDMA is by directly retrieving desired data to reduce the data demand to network 102.RDMA does not relate to any one in the operating system of server 210 or client 120, thus eliminates the needs to extra CPU (central processing unit) (CPU), cache memory or contextual processing (contextswitch).In addition, when server 210 is just processing different client-requested 130, RDMA can parallel work-flow retrieval client-requested 130 service load part 134.Although use RDMA to describe client service load retrieving, other suitable retrieving and method also can be used.
With reference to figure 4A and 4B, in some embodiments, client 120 comprises requested part generator 150, storage resources 160 (such as, non-transitory storer, flash memory, dynamic RAM (DRAM), phase transition storage (PCM) and/or disk) and message transmitter 170.Before control section 132 is sent to server 210, client-requested 130 is divided into service load part 134 and control section 132 by the requested part generator 150 of client 120.Service load part 134 is stored in storer 160 by client 120.In some instances, storer 160 can access by server 210 retrieval after a while carrying out service load part 134.Additionally or alternati, storer 160 can be visited by Remote Direct Memory access (RDMA) by server 210.Control section 132 is sent to server 210 by message transmitter 170.Control section 132 can comprise following (such as, as metadata) in one or many person: Request Priority (such as, high priority, medium priority or low priority), size, user identifier, client identifier, time delay, device identifier or control section verify.Out of Memory about client 120 or client-requested 130 can be included in control section 132.In some instances, message transmitter 170 sends control section 132 with the first order; But receiver 180 can not with the order receipt corresponding treated service load 136 through send control section 132 identical with the order sending control section 132.In some instances, client 120 is a part for treated service load 136 reserve storage 160 from server 210 transmission.
In some instances, client 120 comprises receiver 180, and receiver 180 is for receiving the treated service load 136 of the corresponding control section 132 being previously sent to server 210 from server 210.In addition or alternatively, only when client storage resources 160 has enough storage spaces to receive treated service load 136, receiver 180 receives treated service load 136.
In some instances, client 120 requires within the appointment duration, process some request 130.Client 120 can comprise the duration for completing request 130 in the control section 132 being sent to server 210.Server 210 can determine whether it can process request 130 within the fixed time of being asked by client 120.If server 210 cannot process request within the described fixed time, so server 210 sends to receiver 180 message 131 (Fig. 3) that instruction cannot process request 130.In this type of situation, described request can be retransmitted to same server 210 or another server 210 by client 120.
Server 210 can comprise impact damper 230, service load searcher 240, processor 212 and receiver 260.Receiver 260 receives the control section 132 sent from client message forwarder 170.In some instances, receiver 260 is based on the priority ranking of in following information or many persons given client end control section 132: Request Priority (such as, high priority, medium priority or low priority), size, user identifier, client identifier, time delay, device identifier or control section are verified.Receiver 260 can carry out the priority ranking of specified control part 132 based on the message of any type about client 120 or client-requested 130 be included in received client control portion 132.After the priority ranking of the message specified request 130 contained in based on control section 132, receiver 260 is by through specifying the control section 132 of priority ranking to be sent to impact damper 230.Impact damper 230 maintains control section 132 with the order of being specified by receiver 260.Impact damper 230 be divide for memory control unit before processing controls part 132 132 physical storage memory storage (such as, non-transitory storer, flash memory, dynamic RAM (DRAM), phase transition storage (PCM) and/or disk).
In some instances, service load searcher 240 receives the control section 132 of client-requested 130 from impact damper 230 and retrieves corresponding service load part 134 from client 120.When service load searcher 240 receives the corresponding service load part 134 of control section 132, processor 212 can process client-requested 130.This procedure avoids for etc. the server memory 230 through retrieval service load part 134 to be treated distribute.But in some instances, service load searcher 240 is only when the service load part 134 retrieving corresponding control section 132 when previous client request 130 is sent to processor 212 by.Service load searcher 240 can retrieve the service load part 134 specified number corresponding to the control section 132 being ready to be processed.For example, service load searcher 240 can be considered last three control sections 132 in impact damper 230 and retrieve its corresponding service load part 134 to think that processor 212 processes client-requested 130 and prepares.This allows processor 212 continuously process client-requested 130 and without the need to waiting for that service load searcher 240 is from client memory retrieval service load part 134.Once processor 212 processes client-requested 130, treated service load part 136 is just sent to client 120 by server 210.
The control section 132 allowing client 120 to send client-requested 130 and the process allowing server 210 to retrieve service load part 134 when it gets out process request 130 give the chance of the request 130 that server 210 receives greater number, this is because the request 130 received only is included in the control section 132 that size aspect is less than the request 130 of service load part 134 relatively.As an example, service load part 134 is generally hundreds of kilobyte, and corresponding control section 132 is only hundreds of bytes.Therefore, server 210 can receive the request of many 1000 times before it is finished storer.This provides better isolation, priority ranking improve long-tail time delay (long ?taillatency).
Refer again to Fig. 2, in some embodiments, agency 104 is situated between and is connected between one or more client 120 and server 210.Agency 104 can receive request 130 from client 120 and only control section 132 is forwarded to suitable server 210 (such as, based on control section 132).When server 210 is asked, service load part 134 can be sent to suitable server 210 by agency 104.Alternatively, agency 104 can only receive control section 132 from client 120 and then control section 132 is forwarded to suitable server 210, and only ask service load part 134 from client 120 when server 210 asks service load part 134, therefore reduce the needs carrying out in agency 104 inside cushioning.
The example operation that Fig. 5 is provided for the method 500 processing client-requested 130 on data processing equipment 210 is arranged.Described method comprises the control section 132 receiving 502 client-requested 130 from relative client 120.Each client-requested 130 has control section 132 and service load part 134.Control section 132 comprises the information 133 of the data 135 about service load part 134.Therefore, because service load part 134 comprises more data 135, so the size of service load part 134 is larger than control section 132.Method 500 also comprises: in the non-transitory storer 214 of data processing equipment 210, cushion 504 client control portion 132 received; And before process client-requested 130, retrieve the service load part 134 of described client-requested 130.
In some instances, described method comprises the sequential processes of priority ranking for client-requested 130 of given client end control section 132.Described method can carry out the priority ranking of given client end control section 132 based at least one in the checking of priority (high priority, medium priority or low priority), size, user identifier, client identifier, time delay, device identifier or control section.In some instances, the corresponding priority ranking that method 500 comprises further based on client-requested 130 carrys out processed in sequence client-requested 130.In addition, method 500 can comprise the service load part 134 that retrieval has the client-requested 130 of the first high-precedence, the second high-precedence or third high priority ranking further.In some instances, service load searcher 240 receives the service load part 134 (such as, service load searcher 240 retrieves the service load part 134 of last three control sections 132 in impact damper 230) of the predetermined number of described control section 132 from client 120 based on position in impact damper 230 of the corresponding control section 132 of client-requested 130.
In some embodiments, retrieve service load part 134 and comprise the non-transitory storer 160 using Remote Direct Memory access (RDMA) access client 120.After process client-requested 130, method 500 can comprise the client 120 treated service load 136 being sent to treated client-requested 130.In addition, described method can comprise: determine whether the client of treated client-requested 130 has enough storeies 160 and can be used to receive treated service load 136; And client 120 have enough storeies 160 available time treated service load 136 is sent to relative client 120.
In some instances, client 120 expects the service from server 210, and requires that described service performs within the time of specified quantitative.Therefore, control section 132 can comprise the duration for completing client-requested 130.Method 500 can be included in and cannot send message when specifying and processing the client-requested 130 of relative client 120 in the duration to described client 120.In some instances, when processing client-requested 130 within the appointment duration or when cannot process client-requested 130 due to other reason server 210 any, described method refuses described client-requested 130.This allows client 120 that request 130 is sent to another server 210, and avoids the delay that request 130 queued up in a buffer before the process request 130 (comprising control section 132 and service load part 134).
With reference to figure 6, in some embodiments, the method 600 client-requested 130 being sent to data processing equipment 210 is provided.Method 600 comprises control section 132 and the service load part 134 of generation 602 client 130.Service load part 134 comprises data and control section 132 comprises the information of the data about service load part 134.Method 600 comprises: the control section 132 of client-requested 130 is sent 604 to data processing equipment 210; Receive the request of the service load part 134 of 606 retrieval client-requested 130; And the service load part 134 of the 608 access client requests 130 of permission.
In some embodiments, method 600 comprise allow by Remote Direct Memory access (RDMA) service load part 134 is retrieved.Other search method of service load part 134 can be used.Client control portion 132 can comprise at least one in the checking of priority (such as, high priority, medium priority or low priority), size, user identifier, client identifier, time delay, device identifier or control section.After the control section 132 of client-requested 130 is sent to server 210, method 600 can comprise the treated service load 136 receiving the service load part 134 corresponding to client-requested 130 from server 210.In addition, described method can comprise further and receives treated service load 136 when described client 120 has enough storer 160 capacity.In some instances, method 600 comprises: with the first sequential order, multiple control sections 134 of corresponding client-requested 130 are sent to data processing equipment 210; And receive the retrieval request to the service load part of client-requested with the second sequential order being different from the first sequential order.
In some embodiments, client 120 required to complete request 130 in the time of specified amount.Client 120 comprises the duration for completing client-requested 130 in control section 132.Then, server 210 can determine whether it can perform client-requested 130 within the described fixed time.In some instances, method 600 comprises when processing client-requested 130 within the appointment duration from data processing equipment 210 receipt message.In addition, described method can comprise the client control portion 134 when cannot retransmit client-requested 130 when specifying in the duration and processing client-requested.Request 130 can be sent to same server 210 or another server 210 by client 120.
