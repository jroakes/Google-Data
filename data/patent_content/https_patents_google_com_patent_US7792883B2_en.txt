Definitions
- Search engines provide a powerful tool for locating content in documents in a large database of documents, such as the documents on the Internet or World Wide Web (WWW), and/or the documents stored on the computers of an Intranet.
- the documents are located using an index of documents in response to a search query, consisting of one or more words, terms, keywords and/or phrases, henceforth called terms, that are submitted by a user.
- Documents in the index of documents may be matched to one or more terms in the search query to determine scores.
- a ranked listing of relevant documents or document locations, based on the scores, is provided to the user.
- Search queries may have a variety of purposes and formats.
- One class of formats corresponds to location searches.
- Conventional location searches often use a fixed format, such as a template.
- Existing templates are often fixed or may only allow a limited number of variations.
- words or terms in an existing location search query may have a pre-determined order (street name, state, zip code) and/or a pre-determined spelling.
- a search engine system having one or more central processing units, a memory in one or more computers, and one or more programs stored in the memory and executed by the one or more central processing units.

- Each geographical feature document corresponds to a geographical feature, which may be a location (e.g., a street, city, country, state, country) or a geographical entity (e.g., lake, river, mountain, continent, ocean, etc.). While a single geographical feature may correspond to a set of locations, such as a set of street addresses, all the locations associated with a geographical feature may be considered to be “a location” in the context of identifying the locations or geographical features that best match a location search query.

Generally, though, documents with high quality matches to the search query are assigned higher scores than documents with lower quality matches to the search query. Other factors, such as the locations of the geographical features corresponding to the matching documents, relative to a current viewport in which a map or image is displayed, and the relative importance of these geographical features, may also be factors in computing the scores.

- the indexes 320 may be stored on one or more computers in the search engine.
- the subsets may be distributed such each index 320 handles an equivalent or approximately equivalent portion of processing associated with the respective location search query.
- the documents 312 - 1 may be distributed randomly or pseudo-randomly over the indexes 320 .

For example, if 10 sets of top-10 documents are received at a given level, the top-10 documents may be determined and passed on.

Abstract
Description
where IRi is a query match score (with respect to a particular candidate document) corresponding to a respective term or element “i” in the canonical and/or Boolean expression, FR is “feature rank” that indicates an importance of the feature or location, E is a normalization value, and Q is an optional factor. Q may correspond to the quality of the match between the query and the candidate document, or it may correspond to any other metric that may be used to improve the quality of the search results. An example of the Q factor is described below with reference to
where the exponent, M, is a value greater than one (e.g., 2, 2.5 or 3), and is typically between two and five (2≦M≦5), so as give the normalized total match score more importance in the scoring function than the feature rank, FR, and Q factors. In some embodiments, the scoring function discussed above is modified to favor documents whose name has terms in the same order as the terms are positioned in the search query over documents matching the same terms, but which have the terms in a different order in their name. For example, the total match score may be supplemented with a pair-wise matching score (e.g., total match score+pair-wise match score), which is based on the number of ordered term pairs (ordered, neighboring terms) in the search query that match ordered terms pairs in the document name.
SkirtRegionRadius=ViewportRadius×(1+SkirtFactor×EV)
EV=A+B×e −M×X1
where A and B are selected so that EV equals its maximum value, 1, when X1 is equal to zero (i.e., when the viewport region is very small), and EV equals its minimum value, 0, when X1 is equal to its maximum value, 1 (corresponding to a viewport region that covers the entire earth). SkirtFactor is a configurable scaling factor. An exemplary value of SkirtFactor is 10; in other embodiments, SkirtFactor is equal to a value between 4 and 20. M is a configurable exponential rate factor. An exemplary value of M is 50; in other embodiments, M is equal to a value between 10 and 200. In addition, the value of M depends on the scaling of the angular distance X1. Solving for A and B in accordance with the constraints stated above, the equation for EV becomes:
When M=50, e−M is very close to zero (e−50≈1.9*10−22), and EV is approximately equal to e−M*X1.
where IRi is a query match score (with respect to a particular candidate document) corresponding to a respective term or element “i” in the canonical and/or Boolean expression, FR is the “feature rank,” which indicates the importance of the feature or location, E is a normalization value, and SAF is the scoring attenuation factor mentioned above. The IR, FR and E parameters are discussed in more detail above, and that discussion is equally applicable to the scoring function discussed here. It is noted that the sum of the IRi values for a particular candidate document (or geographical feature) can be considered to be an information retrieval score or query match score for the candidate, and that all the other parameters of the scoring function are for scaling, boosting or attenuating the score in accordance with additional factors so as to improve how the search results are ranked (i.e., so that the topmost ranked search results are the search results that are most likely to correspond to the geographical feature that is being sought by the user).
SAF=C+D×e −K×X
where K is an exponential scaling factor, and X is the ratio of (A) the distance between the geographical feature and the viewport region (i.e., the closest edge of the viewport region), and (B) the width of the viewport skirt region, as explained above with reference to
When K=3, e−K is approximately equal to 0.5, and 1−e−K is approximately equal to 0.95. When MinScore=0.2 and K=3, SAF is approximately equal to 0.158+0.842*e−3X for geographic features that intersect the viewport skirt region (but do not intersect the viewport region). Note that SAF, according to this equation is equal to 1.0 when X=0, and is approximately equal to 0.2 when X=1. As noted above, SAF is equal to 1 for geographic features that intersect the viewport region, and is equal to MinScore (e.g., 0.2) for geographic features that intersect neither the viewport region nor the viewport skirt region. In other embodiments, MinScore is a value between 0.1 and 0.5, and K is a value between 2 and 10.
