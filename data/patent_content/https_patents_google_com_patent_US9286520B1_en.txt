Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in transporting passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- a manual mode where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle
- autonomous mode where the vehicle essentially drives itself

- An autonomous vehicle operating on a road may rely on maps for navigation.
- hazard conditions on the road such as accident sites or obstacles, may not be included in the maps, but are often identified by road flares. Therefore, the autonomous vehicle may be configured to detect hazard conditions on the road by detecting road flares so as to determine safe navigation trajectories.
- a road flare may be a type of pyrotechnic (material capable of undergoing self-contained and self-sustained exothermic chemical reaction) that produces a brilliant light or intense heat without an explosion.
- Road flares can be used for signaling, illumination, indicating obstacles or advising caution in hazard conditions on roads.
- Road flares may produce light through combustion of a pyrotechnic composition.
- Flares may be colored by inclusion of pyrotechnic colorants. In an example, a road flare may burn for 10-60 minutes with a bright red/yellow light.
- a computing device of a vehicle may be configured to receive an image of a road of travel of the vehicle, where the image includes a plurality of pixels.
- Road flares may exhibit a brilliant red or yellow color as mentioned above.
- the computing device may be configured to make a comparison between respective color values of the plurality of pixels in the image and a predetermined color value of a road flare. For instance, the computing device may be configured to identify a set of pixels having given color values within a color value threshold from the predetermined color value of the road flare.
- road flares may appear roundish, or have any other predetermined shape, and occupy a relatively small region in space.
- the computing device may be configured to compare characteristics of a shape of an object represented by the identified set of pixels in the image to corresponding characteristics of a predetermined shape of the road flare to confirm whether the object represents a road flare. Further, the computing device may be configured to assign a likelihood that the object represents a road flare. Based on the likelihood, the computing device may be configured to modify a control strategy associated with a driving behavior of the vehicle; and control the vehicle based on the modified control strategy. For instance, the computing device may be configured to determine a hazard condition or circumstance associated with the road flare; and modify the control strategy based on the condition or circumstance.
- An example vehicle control system may be implemented in or may take the form of an automobile.
- a vehicle control system may be implemented in or take the form of other vehicles, such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, boats, airplanes, helicopters, lawn mowers, recreational vehicles, amusement park vehicles, farm equipment, construction equipment, trams, golf carts, trains, and trolleys.
