- the index 120 may associate or reference content that incorporates such images. Examples of such content include advertisement media (images, text with slogan) or multimedia content.
- the image analysis sub-system 110 analyzes individual images as they are located from the aggregation processes 112 or otherwise provided to the system 100 . According to an embodiment, the image analysis sub-system 110 performs various kinds of analysis on individual images to identify information about the contents of the images. In one implementation, the image analysis sub-system 110 outputs the information it determines from individual images to the index 120 . For each image, the index 120 may store (i) an identifier 125 to the image and/or to the location of the image, (ii) information identified from data associated with the image, and (iii) information identified from performing recognition analysis on the image. Various other kinds of information may be stored. In one embodiment, information stored with each image includes object identification information 127 and a signature value 129 for identified objects.
- the object identification information 127 identifies objects in a picture, with a level of specificity or characteristic information that may vary amongst implementations.
- the object identification information 127 may be derived from image analysis or text extraction (also described below).
- the signature value 129 may be a quantitative expression of an object in the image.
- the signature value 129 may be the result of image analysis processes.
- one of the analysis performed by the image analysis sub-system 110 includes extracting text or other information (e.g. metadata) provided with the image to determine information about objects or content in the image.
- Image recognition processes may also be performed to recognize or detect objects from the image.
- the image analysis sub-system 110 may also identify one or more characteristics of the object, such as coloring or salient features. Recognized objects and features of an image include persons, items that appear in the image (e.g. shoes) or even text that appears in the image (such as on a sign).
- object identification information 127 may include more than mere identification of the object.
- the object identification information may also include descriptive information about the object.
- the object identification information 127 is provided as text data to the index 120 .
- the image recognition process may be performed to determine the signature value 129 of objects detected from individual images.
- the signature value 129 may, under one implementation, be a numeric or quantitative description of an object.
- the signature value 129 can identify one object from another object of the same kind.
- the signature value 129 may be used to determine when two objects are the same (e.g. same person's face, same model and type of shoes), or when two objects are similar (e.g. two people look alike, or two shoes have similar appearance). The latter case is referred to as a “similarity comparison”,
- the recognition may also include, as part of the object identification information 127 , one or more of the following: the coloring of the person's hair or skin, the gender of the person, the person's eye color, the race of the individual, and the age group of the individual.
- the recognition may also include, as part of the object identification information 129 , one or more of the following: the color of shoe; whether the shoe is for a man, woman or child; the shoe style; the color of the shoe; the shape of the shoe at various places, such as the heal or tip; and other salient information such as whether the shoe contains a buckle or zipper, or the pattern of the shoe.
- the object identification information 127 may be in the form of text data.
- the signature value 129 provides a quantitative characterization of the characteristics of that object, to distinguish that object from other objects, or like the object to other object. With the face of a person, this may account for specific features in the person's face. With objects, such as shoes, the signature value may quantitatively reflect the shape, color, pattern and salient features of the shoe.
- the image analysis sub-system 110 is a programmatic component that performs its functions through execution of code or logic (i.e. programmatically).
- One or more alternative embodiments contemplate the image analysis sub-system 110 as including manual operators in addition to programmatic processes.
- object detection is performed by manual operators who view images individually and categorize or provide information about the contents of the images.
- the image analysis sub-system 110 may provide a human interface to display images from a collection, and accept and record input from operators viewing the image.
- one or more alternative embodiments provide for a combination of manual intervention and programmatic processes to analyze the contents of the images.
- the result of programmatic object detection is displayed to a human operator along with the image, and the human operator may verify or correct the recognition.
- the human operator may also supplement or append the recognition, by, for example, detecting a salient feature that is missed by the programmatic element.
- one implementation provides for a human operator interface that displays numerous (i.e. tens or hundreds) of images at once, along with the object identification information 127 , and requires the human operator to verify or correct pictures individually, but as a cluster.
- the index 120 may store entries that identify or locate individual images, as well as text or quantitative information derived from the image recognition processes.
- the index 120 may be made available to a search component 130 , which identifies criteria and uses the information stored in index 120 to select images.
- the search component is responsive to an input 152 that is provided from server 150 .
- Input 152 may correspond to one or more of the following: (i) a selection of content that a user on the terminal 160 makes through some affirmative action, such as selecting and clicking with the mouse or other pointer device; (ii) a detection of content that a user is viewing or is interested in, such as by way of identifying content on a portion of the downloaded web page that the user is viewing; (iii) identification of any content up hearing on the web page; (iv) identification of a subject of a content that the user is viewing.
- server 150 may be configured to include a programmatic component that can identify and communicate the input 152 to the image selection system 100 .
- the user may select an image, link or other data element that is associated with a subject or topic.
- the component 158 may communicate the selected topic or link to the system 100 .
- the component 158 may communicate the name of the movie star to the system 100 .
- the component 158 may identify an associated topic of the selected item.
- the component 158 may include intelligence to identify either the make of the sports car, or just “expensive car”, or another topic that the component 158 is programmed to associate with the selected topic (e.g. a demographic may be identified by the selection).
- the programmatic component 158 may perform similar process to identify, for example, metadata associated with an image, embedded links in the page, or information pertaining to advertisements that appear on the page.
- programmatic component 158 performs a key word search to identify the contents of the document by keyword. From any of these processes, the programmatic component 158 may identify a subject, that is then communicated as part of input 152 to the system 100 . As will be described, what is returned is content, including images, that relate to the input 152 .
- text input manually entered by the user forms the basis for determining the subject for input 152 .
- a search term that the user enters for a search engine may be used for input 152 , or results from the search.
- text the user enters through use of the web page 155 can be inspected for keywords, and then communicated as input 152 to system 100 .
- the user may enter an email content that is then inspected for key words, or for its subject line. In either case, identification of the text results in the display of images from system 100 that are deemed pertinent in some way to the content that is or was existing on the web page 155 .
- search component 130 performs a search using the index 120 .
- the search component may form a criteria 132 from the input 152 .
- search component 130 can receive as input either images or text based data.
- search component 130 may include an image analysis component 136 to analyze image data as input 152 , and text component 138 to analyze text based input 152 .
- the image analysis component 136 forms either a signature criteria or a text criteria.
- the type of criteria 132 and how its implemented to select images depends on implementation, as illustrated by the following usage scenarios.
- one embodiment provides that the image analysis component 136 recognizes or determines an object in the image, and then uses that determination in forming the search criteria 132 on the index 120 .
- the image analysis component 136 determines the signature value of the object in the image, and uses that value as the criteria (or portion thereof). The signature value may be used when either an exact match to the object in the image input is needed, or when a similarity or likeness match is desired to that object.
- the image input may be identified by user input (i.e. the user selects an image), or provided on a page or portion thereof that the user views.
- the image analysis component 136 of the search component 130 determines one or more objects in the image.
- the image analysis component 136 then forms criteria based on the determined objects. In one implementation, this criteria may be text based.
- the image analysis component 136 determines a signature from the image input.
- the criteria is then based on the signature and compared against other image signatures in the index 120 .
- a similarity or likeness match may be performed to identify objects that are similar, or which have similar features.
- the user may view a merchandise (e.g. rug) for sale, select the image, and direct the image to be compared against other similar images.
- the signature of the rug may then be used to form a criteria to perform a similarity match for other rugs, or for other merchandise carrying a pattern similar to the desired rug.
- the user may submit image to identify an identical product or design, so that he can compare pricing.
- the criteria may be based more directly on the input 152 .
- the text component 138 of the search component 130 may translate, parse or otherwise process the input to form the criteria. Still further, the criteria may be based on both image and text, and carry a combination of any of the image analysis or text component described above.
- one or more embodiments provide that the criteria 132 returns either (i) a set of one or more images, or (ii) identification of the images or their locations.
- the search component may process a result 133 corresponding to the results from the index 120 .
- the system 100 may return a set of identification 145 to the selected images, or alternatively, the selected images themselves (with or without other content).
- the images are then provided in the web page 152 .
- Various examples of how images may be provided to supplement content, provide advertisement media, or provide merchandise objects.
- the system 100 may be provided separate or independent from the server 150 .
- a user may simply copy content from the web page and visit a domain or site where the system 100 is provided.
- the input 152 may be provided directly from the user, and the output of the identified images may form a new page.
- index 120 may specify image content that has not had image data analysis.
- index 120 may include advertisement media. Information associated with each advertisement media may be determined from text associated with the media, or may be manually determined.
- Embodiments described with FIG. 1 may be performed through use of one or more processors and storage components that are in communication with each other.
- components that form the image selection system 100 may be distributed at different locations on a network, and even handled by different operators or domains.
- the index 120 is operated in connection with the image analysis sub-system 110
- one or more embodiments contemplate use of servers, computers, or processing combinations that perform functions such as described with the search component 130 or the image recognition sub-system 110 .
- the index 120 and other components may incorporate storage mediums structured in the form of databases or other memory resources.
- a system such as described by FIG. 1 may be distributed over multiple locations on a network such as the Internet, or provided on one domain or even on one server.
- the index 120 and the search component 130 may be provided at different locations, and operated independently of one another by different operators.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a method to use an index that stores information about images, under an embodiment of the invention.
- a method such as described by FIG. 2 may be performed using a system such as illustrated by FIG. 1 .
- reference to elements of FIG. 1 is intended to illustrate suitable components for performing one or more steps or sub-steps being described.
- a step 210 content that is to be used for image selection is detected.
- the content is identified from a third-party server or domain that serves a web page to a terminal.
- Other embodiments provide that the content is specified by the user, interacting directly with the image selection system 100 .
- Step 220 provides that a criteria is determined from the content. Different sub-processes are possible in this step.
- the content from step 210 is an image.
- two different processes may be operated by the search component 130 .
- One sub-process that can be performed is a determination of an object in the image.
- the image analysis component 136 of the search component 130 performs analysis to identify objects in the image.
- a criteria 132 is determined from the determination of the objects in the image. For example, the image may be analyzed to determine that there is “rug” or a “patterned rug”. Different levels of specificity are contemplated. For example, object determination may identify the rug as “Oriental” or “Asian” or predominantly of one color.
- the signature value is determined by detecting or determining the object(s) in the image in step 236 . From image data corresponding to the object, the object's signature value is determined in step 238 . Then in step 240 , a criteria may be formed based on the signature value in step 240 .
- the sub-processes may for image data input may be combined to yield a criteria that identifies the object and its signature. For example, an image of a carpet may yield object determination (“predominantly red rug”) and a signature value (identifying the pattern of the rug).
- a text based search criteria 132 may be received from the content.
- text data may be correspond to key words in a document the person is viewing, or which corresponds to metadata that accompanies an image.
- the text data may form the basis of a criteria 132 .
- One criteria 132 may include a combination of all the processes described. For example, a user may view a web page for a carpet for sale. The text for the sale item may be analyzed and parsed to identify the word “carpet”. From the image, image recognition may yield a “red rug” and the signature value corresponds to a pattern of the rug. The criteria 132 may be formed from all three processes, so that it includes specification of carpet, red rug, and a signature value for the pattern.
- step 260 provides that one or more images are selected for display to the user.
- the criteria 132 may correspond to an output of the image analysis component 136 and/or the text component 138 ,
- the index may be scanned to return matching entries in step 270 .
- the entries may identify the images by location, or alternatively supply the images directly.
- the images may be formed in a new web page, or form a portion of an existing web page.
- Various implementations are contemplated by which resulting images of the search are returned to the user.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a method for supplying a person with pertinent advertisement, under an embodiment of the invention.
- a person is detected as viewing an online content comprising an image.
- Step 320 identifies the image portion of the content.
- Step 330 provides that the image content is analyzed using the image analysis component 136 .
- a step 340 identifies an object of the image.
- step 350 determines a signature of the identified object.
- step 360 identifies text associated with the image.
- Each of the determinations about the image are used to formulate a query to the index 120 , which in the embodiment described, contains advertisement media.
- an advertisement media is selected for the user based at least in part on the image of the content he was viewing.
- embodiments described herein may apply to performing object determination, recognition, and similarity comparison on objects such as merchandise.
- Merchandise objects provide another example of an implementation for a system such as described with FIG. 1 .
- one embodiment provides that text and metadata information associated with the image is used as clues to identify the object of the image.
- pre-defined categories are identified, and based on information such as keywords describing the image, URL locating the image, or other information, a categorization of the object in the image is made. For instance, a website might have named the shoes as “men's footwear”. A corresponding pre-defined category may be labeled “men's shoes”.
- a rule-based system can be used to map descriptive terms of an image to a predefined category. For instance, if the term “shoe”, and “for him” is identified in the descriptive text of the image, that item can be assumed to be in men's shoes categories.
- the rule based system may include a set of rules to perform such assignments.
- mappings can be done by a learning algorithm.
- a learning algorithm may be trained that can learn automatically the dependency of the words to categories.
- the results of an automating category mapping algorithm can be verified and updated by human operators for accuracy.
- segmentation is performed on the image. While categorization may assist segmentation, segmentation on the image data itself may be performed independently.
- the objective of the segmentation process is to separate the object(s) of interest from the background.
- any foreground/background segmentation algorithm can be used.
- the background can be assumed to be at the sides of the images, whereas the foreground can be assumed to be at the center.
- the intensity distribution of both foreground and background can be obtained from the center and side pixels respectively.
- a mixture of Gaussian models can be learnt for the foreground and background pixels.
- these models can be applied to the whole image and each pixel can be classified as foreground and background.
- the segmentation outputs of the algorithm can be verified by human operators for accuracy.
- FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B illustrate a result of segmentation on a merchandise object, as performed by one or more embodiments described herein.
- a process of extraction may be performed.
- features that obtain the color, shape, boundary, and pattern of the foreground object are calculated.
- Such features may be referred to as “visual features”.
- Each of these features may be stored numerically as vectors and each item may be indexed.
- the index 120 may include in part or whole a similarity database where the item's metadata is saved along with the visual features.
- the various feature vectors for an object may comprise the signature value.
- the item's metadata is also saved as a metadata feature vector.
- the metadata feature can be a mapping of the words to unique identifiers that are derived from a dictionary look-up.
- IDF Inverse document frequency
- the visual and metadata features can be indexed using various indexing algorithms.
- a linear index can be used where each item is stored linearly in a file.
- a tree based indexing algorithm can be used, where the nodes of the tree would keep clusters of similar looking items. This way, only that node needs to be loaded in the search time, and the search may be performed faster.
- the index database is saved, it is ready to be searched.
- the search can be initiated from another image. For instance, the user would tell find more examples (shoes) like another one that they liked. This would make a query to the search index, and a weighted distance matching is applied between the visual and metadata features of the query image and all the images in the index database.
- this weighting can be a linear combination. In another embodiment, this weighting can be done based on non-linear transformations.
- Different embodiments can be based on slider, color picker or based on choosing different key regions in the image.
- the user is allowed to change the weights of shape, color or pattern or style of the returned items.
- color picker the user can choose a particular that he or she is interested in, and then the algorithm would match the query image's shape in that particular color.
- key regions the user draws a rectangle on where he is interested in, and the system would run a query on local features of that kind. For instance, the user can draw a rectangle on the high heel, and the algorithm looks for high heels on all the images. The results are refined on run-time, as the users play with any of these feedback mechanisms.
- the information when index 120 is used to store information about images of merchandise objects, the information may include URLs or other links to online merchants that provide the merchandise objects for sale.
- the URL or link may be returned with images when searches are performed by, for example, search component 130 .
- results of the similarity search include images that are active, and enable selection by the user to access a site of an online merchant where the merchandise object is provided.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a method for supplying a person with the ability to view merchandise and locate the same or similar merchandise through an on-the-fly image comparison, under an embodiment of the invention.
- a user selects an image of a merchandise object, such as a shoe or a rug.
- Step 520 provides that image analysis is performed on the image of the selected merchandise. From the image analysis, a signature value is determined.
- a similarity operation may be performed by the search component 130 on the index 120 .
- the similarity operation may specify the merchandise object and the signature value, or alternatively the various feature vectors and other identifying information stored in the index 120 .
- the similarity operation may identify objects that are in images recorded in the index, with signature values that are deemed to be similar to the selected object. In one embodiment, two objects are deemed similar if the signature values are within a designated threshold.
- the similarity comparison may return as a result all images containing an object with a feature vectors and/or signature values that are within a designated threshold that defines the similarity.
- the threshold may be one of design preference or dictated by the particular application.
- a result comprising one or more images with objects deemed to be similar in appearance is returned to the user.
- the result includes, at least initially, only a single image that contains an image deemed most similar to the selected object.
- a series, sequence or other plurality of images may be displayed. The images may be sorted or ranked by various factors, including proximity of similarity or other factors.
- a user may view an auction or e-commerce page that shows an object for sale.
- the user may select a feature, or alternatively access a site, that accepts the image as input and processes the image to determine a signature value.
- One or more implementations also provide that text associated with the merchandise (e.g. auction heading) may also be used to specify a category that the signature value is to apply to.
- a search of the index 120 is performed to identify either exact matches (e.g. the same item on sale at another auction or site) or an item that is deemed similar to the selected merchandise.
- the user may like the item being viewed, but may want to see what else that is similar in appearance is offered at a particular auction site or on other e-commerce sites.
- an algorithm is used to automatically generate images related to text content, such as articles.
- tags can be extracted from images, using information obtained from recognition, corresponding to objects in them, and text in them. Those tags and images are collected in a central server. All images are indexed using the tags inside them.
- an inverse index is created such that, given a tag, the inverse index provides all the images that contain that tag.
- a picture ranking algorithm as described in provisional patent application No. 60/679,591 determines the most relevant images with that tag.
- the tagging system can be used for an application called “photosense”.
- photosense There are many articles provided with online source that can be supplemented with images. The article might be more valuable and more readable by the addition of relevant photos.
- the system traverses the article, and find the key words. The key words can be found by looking at the frequency of words, and looking at the title. These words might be filtered by a proper noun dictionary if necessary.
- the central server is connected and a search is applied on the relevant words. The most relevant search image results are returned, and they are automatically posted next to the images.
- an overlay on the images can be shown when the mouse is on the images.
- the page When the user presses on the overlay, the page might be directed to the web page of the actual product item, or full search page of the item from the central server. This way, photos are included to add value to the article, as well as, ads are displayed in images, and in a non-disturbing manner to the user. This system generates revenues based on advertisements.
- Munjal searches on the photo (assuming he is not aware that Burak is using the system and/or is not linked to Burak as a friend in the system) with the keywords Munjal and Las Vegas, the system returns a communication identifying one or more pictures that match the criteria. However, the returned image would not be shown to the user in its entirety, but in some degraded, or retracted fashion. For example, the results may be shown in a very blurred fashion. Munjalcan then select a feature to procure access to the image. For example, an icon or other feature may be presented to “Get” access on the blurred photo. This enables him to write the submitter (Burak) a message requesting access to the full image. The submitter may then elect to reply, grant access or deny access.
- Burak submitter
- Munjal can now see the full unblurred photo.
- the submitter may also have the option of marking the photo “public” so that anyone can see it from that point forward.
- Munjal has multiple search result hits that match his search but are blurred (private) he can request them all at once using a so-called “Get all” button and can write one note to all of the owners.
- one or more embodiments contemplate use of image content items in connection with a matchmaking or dating site.
- a person can specify a celebrity, either by image or by name.
- the system 100 may determine the signature values of images in a collection corresponding to persons making themselves available on the date site.
- embodiments identify a signature value of the celebrity or a dress (or shoe) she is wearing.
- the signature value can be used as part of or the basis of the search term.
- the search component 130 can then perform a search of the index 120 for similar images and return people or merchandise of a particular type in appearance.
- a user can provide images of a person (ex-girlfriend, ex-boyfriend, etc), and the system can return pictures of other similar looking people.
- a person may view any random picture from, for example, a news item, and then select the image for a similarity search of other similar looking people.
