Definitions
- the present disclosure is related generally to wireless network communication and, more particularly, to determination of uplink transmission power for non-contiguous resource-block allocations.
- Carrier aggregation is a feature for increasing average user throughput of mobile stations by enabling the mobile station to exploit unused resources on a secondary component carrier.
- the resource blocks on the two component carriers are segregated so that mobile stations assigned to a first component carrier cannot be allocated unused resources on the second component carrier.
- Carrier aggregation is especially beneficial if the loading of the two component carriers is unbalanced so that many of the resource blocks on the second component carrier would be unused if they cannot be assigned to mobile stations on the first component carrier.
- Carrier aggregation also increases the peak data rate achievable by the mobile station; however, reduced transmission power levels may be required on the mobile station to meet emissions requirements and to reduce interference in adjacent channels due to non-linear characteristics of mobile station power amplifiers.
- A-MPR additional maximum power reduction
- the A-MPR allowed for uplink carrier aggregation is specified in two different ways for non-contiguous allocations and contiguous allocations.
- the A-MPR is specified as a function of an allocation ratio A of the non-contiguous allocation.
- the allocation ratio is the ratio of a number of allocated resource blocks to a total number N RB — agg of aggregated resource blocks available for the uplink transmission.
- the A-MPR is specified using a table lookup.
- a contiguous allocation is defined as an allocation which has no unallocated resource blocks between a first allocated resource block and a last allocated resource block.
- An allocation which spans a boundary between first and second aggregated carriers is said to be contiguous if there are no gaps except for internal guard bands between the first and second aggregated carriers. In this case, the last resource block of the first aggregated carrier and the first resource block of the second aggregated carrier are both allocated.
- the A-MPR allowed for contiguous allocations is typically significantly less than is allowed for non-contiguous allocations.
- the tables defined for contiguous allocations cannot be used for allocation ratios greater than 0.5 for any subframe in which a physical uplink control channel (“PUCCH”) is transmitted (e.g., by other mobile stations) on either of the two contiguous carriers because any such allocation will be “punctured” by resource blocks for the PUCCH. Since the PUCCH is used for acknowledgement, negative acknowledgement, and channel-state information, most subframes will include a PUCCH transmission and for these subframes, and the tables for contiguous allocations cannot be used.

- TS 36.101 Third Generation Partnership Project Technical Specification 36.101
- A-MPR is used, and MPR is defined to be equal to 0.
- MPR maximum power reduction
- A-MPR is defined to be equal to 0.
- the method described below in which a second A-MPR is developed for non-contiguous resource allocations from the A-MPR defined for contiguous allocations can be applied with respect to MPR in the case that no NS_CA is signaled.
- A-MPR for Minimum A-MPR Minimum A-MPR A 0.5 for contiguous for contiguous A-MPR reduction
- A-MPR reduction with non- allocation with allocation with for contiguous for contiguous CA_NS contiguous A 0.5
- A 0.5 allocation allocation signaled formula (150 RBs) (200 RBs) (150 RBs) (200 RBs)
- the A-MPR for a corresponding contiguous allocation can be used with an appropriate offset, or correction factor.
- An example of such an almost contiguous allocation would be an allocation that is contiguous except for the PUCCH region (e.g., a contiguous allocation from which the PUCCH resource blocks have been punctured as illustrated in FIG. 4 ).
- the punctured resource blocks could be allocated to semi-persistently scheduled Physical Uplink Shared Channel (“PUSCH”) resource blocks or for other purposes.
- PUSCH Physical Uplink Shared Channel
- a second non-contiguous A-MPR for any non-contiguous allocation can be derived from the A-MPR for a corresponding contiguous allocation with a correction factor, where the size of the correction factor depends on both the number of resource blocks in the corresponding contiguous allocation and the number of resource blocks punctured from the corresponding contiguous allocation.
- the second A-MPR derived from the corresponding contiguous allocation will be less than the non-contiguous A-MPR formula defined in TS 36.101, while in other cases, the second A-MPR will be greater than the non-contiguous A-MPR defined in TS 36.101.
- the mobile station determines an overall bandwidth of the allocation by filling in any gaps of unallocated resource blocks (e.g., L_CRB of FIG. 4 ). Equivalently, the overall bandwidth of the non-contiguous allocation can be defined as the bandwidth L_CRB (in resource blocks) of the smallest contiguous allocation that contains the non-contiguous allocation.
- the mobile station determines the allowed A-MPR from the appropriate contiguous allocation A-MPR table using the determined overall bandwidth. The mobile station then uses an allocation correction factor added to the A-MPR value obtained from the tables.
- the allocation correction factor ensures that the power spectral density of the non-contiguous allocation is the same or less than that of the corresponding contiguous allocation from which its A-MPR was derived. More specifically, the A-MPR for the non-contiguous allocation is increased by the ratio of the number of resource blocks in the contiguous allocation (e.g., the non-contiguous allocation with gaps filled in) to the number of resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation.
- A-MPR-C denotes the A-MPR allowed for a contiguous allocation of L resource blocks
- A-MPR-NC 2 denote the second A-MPR allowed for a corresponding non-contiguous allocation in which K resource blocks have been punctured out of the contiguous allocation of L resource blocks.
- the A-MPR-NC 2 is determined as the A-MPR-C with an allocation correction factor A-MPR-CF:
- A-MPR-NC2 A-MPR-C+A-MPR-CF
- A-MPR-CF 10*log 10 ( L/ ( L ⁇ K )).
- correction factor A-MPR-CF can also be written as:
- A-MPR-CF 10*log 10 ( L/M ).
- the resource-block allocation for the PUSCH transmissions in CC 1 is such that the last allocated resource block is at the beginning of the higher frequency PUCCH region.
- CC 2 there is simultaneously a PUSCH transmission with RB_Start at the end of the lower frequency PUCCH region.
- the A-MPR value for the aggregated component carriers is the allowed maximum output power reduction applied to transmissions on the Primary Component Carrier and the Secondary Component Carrier for contiguously aggregated component carriers.
- L_CRB_CC 1 and L_CRB_CC 2 RBs start at RB_start 1 and RB_start 2 , respectively.
- the A-MPR value is selected based on L —CRB as follows:
- L CRB L CRB — CC1 +PUCCH HReg — CC1 +PUCCH LReg — CC2 +L CRB — CC2
- the PUCCH region of each component carrier may be different but must have at least one resource block so that:
- the mobile station first computes A-MPR as if it were assigned the PUCCH region resource blocks so that the allocation is contiguous. For allocations where L —CRB includes the PUCCH transmission region, the mobile station must add an additional correction factor of:
- a ⁇ - ⁇ MPR ⁇ - ⁇ CF 10 * log ⁇ ⁇ 10 ⁇ ( L CRB / ( L CRB - PUCCH RegT ) )
- a ⁇ - ⁇ MPR PUCCH 10 * log 10 ( L CRB L CRB - PUCCH RegT )
- PUCCH RegT PUCCH Reg — CC1 +PUCCH Reg — CC2
- A-MPR-NC 2 is given by:
- A-MPR-NC2 A-MPR-C+A-MPR-CF.
- Each 15 MHz carrier has 75 resource blocks, so we number the resulting aggregated resource blocks 0, 1, . . . , 149.
- the mobile station is assigned a non-contiguous allocation of resource blocks 32 through 72 and 77 through 117.
- the number of resource blocks L in the smallest contiguous allocation containing this non-contiguous allocation is 82 resource blocks.
- the number of resource blocks K punctured from this smallest contiguous allocation is 4.
- the punctured resource blocks 73 and 74 may correspond to the higher frequency PUCCH region of the lower frequency component carrier, while the resource blocks 75 and 76 may correspond to the lower frequency PUCCH region of the higher frequency component carrier.
- the A-MPR for the contiguous allocation is 5 dB.
- the second non-contiguous A-MPR is thus given by:
- L — CRB is the length of a contiguous resource-block allocation.
- Note 3 For intra-subframe frequency hopping which intersects regions, notes 1 and 2 apply on a per slot basis.
- the A-MPR determined using the second non-contiguous method is 3.8 dB less than the A-MPR determined using the non-contiguous method specified in TS 36.101.
- Other examples of improved A-MPR values for various CA_NS values will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
- the allocation correction factor provides for a larger A-MPR than the allocation ratio-based method already defined in TS 36.101.
- the allocation correction factor tends to work well when the number of punctured resource blocks K is small in comparison to the number of resource blocks L in the smallest containing non-contiguous allocation so that the allocation correction factor is small.
- the second non-contiguous method for determining A-MPR can perform poorly in that it allows much more A-MPR than is necessary in order to meet the emissions requirements.
- a second example is now described for carrier aggregation for the 15 MHz+15 MHz case in combination with CA_NS_ 01 signaling.
- the number of resource blocks L of the smallest contiguous allocation containing the two allocated resource blocks is 150
- the number of punctured resource blocks K is 148
- the A-MPR formula for non-contiguous resource allocations See TS 36.101 section 6.2.4A.1) yields:
- the A-MPR formula in TS 36.101 gives an A-MPR value equal to 16.7 dB.
- the A-MPR is determined for the smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation.
- the number of resource blocks L of the smallest containing contiguous allocation is 150.
- the A-MPR for this contiguous allocation is 6 dB.
- the second A-MPR is then determined by adding a correction factor to this contiguous A-MPR.
- the number of resource blocks L for the smallest containing contiguous allocation is 150
- the number of punctured resource blocks K is 148, so that the second non-contiguous A-MPR is given by:
- the A-MPR determined using the second non-contiguous method is 8 dB greater than the A-MPR determined using the non-contiguous method.
- the existing method for computing A-MPR in TS 36.101 for computing A-MPR for non-contiguous allocations is preferred to the non-contiguous method because the resulting A-MPR is less.
- the A-MPR for the second non-contiguous method is less than the A-MPR for the non-contiguous method, and for some examples the A-MPR for the second non-contiguous method is greater than for the non-contiguous method.
- A-MPR-CF is equivalent to a limitation on the ratio L/(L ⁇ K) for the non-contiguous allocation, where L is the number of resource blocks in the smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation, and where K is the number of resource blocks punctured from the allocation.
- the log function can be implemented as a set of thresholds applied to the ratio L/(L ⁇ K), or equivalently L/M, where a ratio that falls between two such thresholds is assigned a correction factor A-MPR-CF which is the appropriate multiple of 0.5 dB.
- FIG. 5 a flowchart 500 of a method for calculating an uplink transmission power is shown.
- the method may be carried out by a mobile station of FIG. 1 .
- the mobile station selects a minimum of two A-MPR values for determination of uplink transmission power.
- the mobile station receives (Step 505 ) an allocation indication from the base station.
- the allocation indication in one example is a control message that indicates radio resources (e.g., resource blocks) allocated to the mobile station by the base station.
- the mobile station determines (Step 510 ) whether the allocation is a contiguous allocation.
- the mobile station determines (Step 515 ) a contiguous A-MPR using the contiguous allocation tables as defined in TS 36.101.
- the mobile station is allowed to set its configured maximum output power P CMAX,c for a serving cell c (e.g., for a cell provided by the base station) and also its total configured maximum output power P CMAX , as described in TS 36.101 (see section 6.2.5A).
- the total configured maximum output power P CMAX is to be set between P CMAX — L ⁇ P CMAX ⁇ P CMAX — H .
- the mobile station determines (Step 520 ) lower bound P CMAX — L based on the contiguous A-MPR according to TS 36.101. The mobile station then determines (Step 525 ) the P CMAX based on the P CMAX — L and determines (Step 530 ) the uplink transmission power. The mobile station performs (Step 535 ) the uplink transmission based on the uplink transmission power.
- the mobile station determines (Step 540 ) a first A-MPR as a modified contiguous A-MPR with an allocation correction factor.
- the first A-MPR is based on a smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation and the allocation correction factor.
- the mobile station determines the smallest contiguous allocation by filling in any gaps of unallocated resource blocks in the allocation; however, the “smallest contiguous allocation” is not actually allocated and is thus a hypothetical smallest contiguous allocation, as will be understood by those skilled in the art.
- the mobile station uses the smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation to determine a contiguous A-MPR using the contiguous allocation tables as defined in TS 36.101.
- the contiguous allocation table lookup is based on at least one of a starting index of the non-contiguous allocation, an ending index of the non-contiguous allocation, the number M of allocated resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation, or a modulation and coding scheme for the uplink transmission.
- the mobile station determines the allocation correction factor based on a ratio of a number L of resource blocks in the smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation to a number M of resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation. For example, the mobile station determines the allocation correction factor as 10 log 10 (L/M). The mobile station determines the first A-MPR as a sum of the contiguous A-MPR and the allocation correction factor.
- the mobile station determines (Step 545 ) a second A-MPR as a non-contiguous resource allocation A-MPR for the allocation. For example, the mobile station calculates the A-MPR by performing a predetermined function based on the allocation ratio, as described in TS 36.101.
- the mobile station determines the allocation ratio as a ratio of a number M of resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation to a maximum number N RB — agg of aggregated resource blocks available for the uplink transmission.
- the maximum number may be for a single carrier (e.g., 25 resource blocks for a 5 MHz carrier) or for multiple aggregated carriers (e.g., 150 resource blocks for two aggregated 15 MHz carriers).
- the mobile station calculates the uplink transmission power based on the selected A-MPR. For example, the mobile station performs Steps 520 , 525 , and 530 using the selected A-MPR instead of the contiguous A-MPR. The mobile station then performs (Step 535 ) the uplink transmission based on the uplink transmission power.

- the base station determines the allocation correction factor based on a ratio of a number L of resource blocks in the smallest contiguous allocation to a number M of resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation. For example, the base station determines the allocation correction factor as 10 log 10 (L/M).
- the base station determines the first A-MPR as a sum of the contiguous A-MPR and the allocation correction factor.
- the base station selects (Step 620 ) a lesser of the first and second A-MPRs.
- the base station decodes (Step 625 ) a received uplink transmission based on the non-contiguous allocation of resource blocks and the selected A-MPR. For example, the base station receives the uplink transmission using the allocated resource blocks.
- the base station selects a modulation and coding scheme based on the selected A-MPR.
- the base station sends the selected MCS to the mobile station in the control message and decodes the uplink transmission using the selected MCS.

Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure is related generally to wireless network communication and, more particularly, to determination of uplink transmission power for non-contiguous resource-block allocations.
- Carrier aggregation is a feature for increasing average user throughput of mobile stations by enabling the mobile station to exploit unused resources on a secondary component carrier. In the absence of carrier aggregation, the resource blocks on the two component carriers are segregated so that mobile stations assigned to a first component carrier cannot be allocated unused resources on the second component carrier. Carrier aggregation is especially beneficial if the loading of the two component carriers is unbalanced so that many of the resource blocks on the second component carrier would be unused if they cannot be assigned to mobile stations on the first component carrier. Carrier aggregation also increases the peak data rate achievable by the mobile station; however, reduced transmission power levels may be required on the mobile station to meet emissions requirements and to reduce interference in adjacent channels due to non-linear characteristics of mobile station power amplifiers. In some cases of uplink carrier aggregation, a required additional maximum power reduction (“A-MPR”) for determining uplink transmission power is large. The A-MPR allowed for uplink carrier aggregation is specified in two different ways for non-contiguous allocations and contiguous allocations.
- For non-contiguous allocations (e.g., allocations with multiple clusters), the A-MPR is specified as a function of an allocation ratio A of the non-contiguous allocation. The allocation ratio is the ratio of a number of allocated resource blocks to a total number NRB
— agg of aggregated resource blocks available for the uplink transmission. For contiguous allocations, the A-MPR is specified using a table lookup. A contiguous allocation is defined as an allocation which has no unallocated resource blocks between a first allocated resource block and a last allocated resource block. An allocation which spans a boundary between first and second aggregated carriers is said to be contiguous if there are no gaps except for internal guard bands between the first and second aggregated carriers. In this case, the last resource block of the first aggregated carrier and the first resource block of the second aggregated carrier are both allocated. - The A-MPR allowed for contiguous allocations is typically significantly less than is allowed for non-contiguous allocations. However, the tables defined for contiguous allocations cannot be used for allocation ratios greater than 0.5 for any subframe in which a physical uplink control channel (“PUCCH”) is transmitted (e.g., by other mobile stations) on either of the two contiguous carriers because any such allocation will be “punctured” by resource blocks for the PUCCH. Since the PUCCH is used for acknowledgement, negative acknowledgement, and channel-state information, most subframes will include a PUCCH transmission and for these subframes, and the tables for contiguous allocations cannot be used.

Possible implementations of the base station include an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access base station, an Evolved NodeB (“eNB”), a transmission point, a Remote Radio Head, a home eNB, and a femtocell. In one example, the base station is an eNB that controls a macrocell of thewireless network 115. The base station may include multiple network entities. For example, the base station may in fact be two or more base stations operating in conjunction with one another to operate as a single base station or network entity.

During operation, thetransceiver 202 receives data from theprocessor 206 and transmits Radio Frequency (“RF”) signals representing the data viaantenna 208.

In some embodiments, the base station performs carrier aggregation of two or more carriers (e.g., uplink carriers). In this case, the allocation of resource blocks can include resource blocks on two or more adjacent uplink carriers.

Similarly, information received through theuser interface 307 is provided to theprocessor 304, which may then cause the mobile station to carry out a function whose effects may or may not necessarily be apparent to a user. - Turning to
FIG. 4 , diagram 400 illustrates a non-contiguous allocation of resource blocks for an uplink transmission by a mobile station, such as themobile station 105. As shown, two adjacent component carriers (“CC1” and “CC2”) include an allocation of resource blocks allocated by the base station for the uplink transmission. The allocation includes a first contiguous set of resource blocks on CC1, with a first resource block at RB_start_CC1 and bandwidth of L_CRB_CC1. The allocation also includes a second contiguous set of resource blocks on CC2, with a first resource block at RB_start_CC2 and bandwidth of L_CRB_CC2. The first and second sets of resource blocks are separated or “punctured” by resource blocks for the PUCCH on both CC1 and CC2. An overall bandwidth of the allocation is denoted as L_CRB, and includes the bandwidth of the first set of resource blocks, the bandwidth of the second set of resource blocks, and the resource blocks for the PUCCH on both CC1 and CC2. - For contiguous allocations, there are seven tables defined which specify allowed A-MPR values. The allowed A-MPR values for non-contiguous allocations are defined in seven formulas based on a carrier aggregation signaling value (“CA_NS”). The first of these formulas applies in the event that no CA_NS value is signaled. The six remaining ones are defined for use with the signaling of CA_NS_01, CA_NS_02, CA_NS_03, CA_NS_04, CA_NS_05, and CA_NS_06. To see the benefit of using the tables for contiguous allocations to specify A-MPR rather than the formulas for non-contiguous allocations, an example is described herein using an allocation ratio of 0.5. With the non-contiguous formulas, the allowed A-MPR is independent of specific allocations and is defined for each possible CA_NS value and also when the CA_NS has not been specified. For comparison, the A-MPR allowed for contiguous allocations (taken from the contiguous tables) is shown for the corresponding aggregation scenarios in Table 1. The A-MPR values shown are the smallest A-MPR values compatible with a contiguous allocation having an allocation ratio of 0.5. Note that it is possible to find contiguous allocations which require more A-MPR.
- It can be noted in Third Generation Partnership Project Technical Specification 36.101 (“TS 36.101”) that when CA_NS is signaled, A-MPR is used, and MPR is defined to be equal to 0. Conversely, when no CA_NS is signaled, maximum power reduction (“MPR”) is used, and A-MPR is defined to be equal to 0. However, the method described below in which a second A-MPR is developed for non-contiguous resource allocations from the A-MPR defined for contiguous allocations can be applied with respect to MPR in the case that no NS_CA is signaled.
-
TABLE 1 A-MPR reduction from using contiguous A-MPR tables rather than non-contiguous A-MPR formula. (Note that MPR is used in the case that no CA_NS is signaled.) A-MPR for Minimum A-MPR Minimum A-MPR A = 0.5 for contiguous for contiguous A-MPR reduction A-MPR reduction with non- allocation with allocation with for contiguous for contiguous CA_NS contiguous A = 0.5 A = 0.5 allocation allocation signaled formula (150 RBs) (200 RBs) (150 RBs) (200 RBs) No CA_NS 3.5 3 3 0.5 0.5 CA_NS_01 9.5 5 6 4.5 3.5 CA_NS_02 9.5 2 6 7.5 3.5 CA_NS_03 11.5 5 7 6.5 4.5 CA_NS_04 4.5 4 4 0.5 0.5 CA_NS_05 9.5 5 6 4.5 3.5 CA_NS_06 11.5 2 3 9.5 8.5 - From Table 1, it is apparent that contiguous allocations can be found with an allocation ratio of 0.5 for which the allowed A-MPR is much less than that allowed by the non-contiguous formulas. In some cases, the A-MPR reduction resulting from the use of the A-MPR table for contiguous allocations can be as much as 9 dB. However, as noted above, it is not possible to have a contiguous allocation with allocation ratio greater than or equal to 0.5 in subframes in which a PUCCH is transmitted on either component carrier.
- In some cases where the allocation of resource blocks is “almost contiguous,” the A-MPR for a corresponding contiguous allocation can be used with an appropriate offset, or correction factor. An example of such an almost contiguous allocation would be an allocation that is contiguous except for the PUCCH region (e.g., a contiguous allocation from which the PUCCH resource blocks have been punctured as illustrated in
FIG. 4 ). In other examples, the punctured resource blocks could be allocated to semi-persistently scheduled Physical Uplink Shared Channel (“PUSCH”) resource blocks or for other purposes. More generally, a second non-contiguous A-MPR for any non-contiguous allocation can be derived from the A-MPR for a corresponding contiguous allocation with a correction factor, where the size of the correction factor depends on both the number of resource blocks in the corresponding contiguous allocation and the number of resource blocks punctured from the corresponding contiguous allocation. In some cases the second A-MPR derived from the corresponding contiguous allocation will be less than the non-contiguous A-MPR formula defined in TS 36.101, while in other cases, the second A-MPR will be greater than the non-contiguous A-MPR defined in TS 36.101. - For the non-contiguous allocation, the mobile station (or base station) determines an overall bandwidth of the allocation by filling in any gaps of unallocated resource blocks (e.g., L_CRB of
FIG. 4 ). Equivalently, the overall bandwidth of the non-contiguous allocation can be defined as the bandwidth L_CRB (in resource blocks) of the smallest contiguous allocation that contains the non-contiguous allocation. For the contiguous allocation, the mobile station determines the allowed A-MPR from the appropriate contiguous allocation A-MPR table using the determined overall bandwidth. The mobile station then uses an allocation correction factor added to the A-MPR value obtained from the tables. The allocation correction factor ensures that the power spectral density of the non-contiguous allocation is the same or less than that of the corresponding contiguous allocation from which its A-MPR was derived. More specifically, the A-MPR for the non-contiguous allocation is increased by the ratio of the number of resource blocks in the contiguous allocation (e.g., the non-contiguous allocation with gaps filled in) to the number of resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation. - As one example of calculating A-MPR for a non-contiguous allocation, let A-MPR-C denote the A-MPR allowed for a contiguous allocation of L resource blocks and A-MPR-NC2 denote the second A-MPR allowed for a corresponding non-contiguous allocation in which K resource blocks have been punctured out of the contiguous allocation of L resource blocks. In this case, the A-MPR-NC2 is determined as the A-MPR-C with an allocation correction factor A-MPR-CF:
-
A-MPR-NC2=A-MPR-C+A-MPR-CF -
where -
A-MPR-CF=10*log10(L/(L−K)). - Since K of the resource blocks of the contiguous allocation of L resource blocks are punctured, it follows that number of resource blocks M allocated to the mobile station is equal to L−K. Thus, the correction factor A-MPR-CF can also be written as:
-
A-MPR-CF=10*log10(L/M). - We now consider the special case in which the non-contiguous allocation is punctured only by the PUCCH region. The resource-block allocation for the PUSCH transmissions in CC1 is such that the last allocated resource block is at the beginning of the higher frequency PUCCH region. In CC2, there is simultaneously a PUSCH transmission with RB_Start at the end of the lower frequency PUCCH region. According to TS 36.101, the A-MPR value for the aggregated component carriers is the allowed maximum output power reduction applied to transmissions on the Primary Component Carrier and the Secondary Component Carrier for contiguously aggregated component carriers. As illustrated in
FIG. 4 , L_CRB_CC1 and L_CRB_CC2 RBs start at RB_start1 and RB_start2, respectively. The A-MPR value is selected based on L—CRB as follows: -
L CRB =L CRB— CC1+PUCCHHReg— CC1+PUCCHLReg— CC2 +L CRB— CC2 - The PUCCH region of each component carrier may be different but must have at least one resource block so that:
-
L CRB >L CRB— CC1 +L CRB— CC2 - The mobile station first computes A-MPR as if it were assigned the PUCCH region resource blocks so that the allocation is contiguous. For allocations where L—CRB includes the PUCCH transmission region, the mobile station must add an additional correction factor of:
-
- where:
-
PUCCHRegT=PUCCHReg— CC1+PUCCHReg— CC2 - so that A-MPR-NC2 is given by:
-
A-MPR-NC2=A-MPR-C+A-MPR-CF. - Equivalently, in this example in which the non-contiguous allocation is punctured only by the PUCCH, we have:
-
- A specific example is now described for carrier aggregation for the 15 MHz+15 MHz case in combination with CA_NS_01 signaling. Each 15 MHz carrier has 75 resource blocks, so we number the resulting aggregated resource blocks 0, 1, . . . , 149. In this example, we assume that the mobile station is assigned a non-contiguous allocation of resource blocks 32 through 72 and 77 through 117. The number of resource blocks L in the smallest contiguous allocation containing this non-contiguous allocation is 82 resource blocks. The number of resource blocks K punctured from this smallest contiguous allocation is 4. The punctured resource blocks 73 and 74 may correspond to the higher frequency PUCCH region of the lower frequency component carrier, while the resource blocks 75 and 76 may correspond to the lower frequency PUCCH region of the higher frequency component carrier. From Table 6.2.4A.1-1 in TS 36.101 (shown below), the A-MPR for the contiguous allocation is 5 dB. For this example, the second non-contiguous A-MPR is thus given by:
-
-
TABLE 6.2.4A.1-1 (from TS 36.101): Contiguous Allocation A-MPR for CA_NS_01 A-MPR for RB — start +QPSK and CA_1C: L — CRBL — CRB16-QAM CA_NS_01 RB — Start[RBs] [RBs] [dB] 100 RB/ 0-23 and >0 n/a ≦12.0 100 RB 176-199 24-105 >64 n/a ≦6.0 106-175 n/a >175 ≦5.0 75 RB/ 0-6 and 0 < L— CRB ≦ n/a ≦11.0 75 RB 143-149 10 >10 n/a ≦6.0 7-90 >44 n/a ≦5.0 91-142 n/a >142 ≦2.0 Note 1: RB — start indicates the lowest RB index of transmitted resource blocks.Note 2: L — CRB is the length of a contiguous resource-block allocation.Note 3: For intra-subframe frequency hopping which intersects regions, notes 1 and 2 apply on a per slot basis. Note 4: For intra-subframe frequency hopping which intersects regions, the larger A-MPR value may be applied for both slots in the subframe. - For CA_NS_01, the A-MPR formula for non-contiguous resource allocations is given (See TS 36.101 section 6.2.4A.1) by the following:
-
M A=−22.5A+17; 0≦A<0.20 -
−11.0A+14.7; 0.20≦A<0.70 -
−1.7A+8.2; 0.70≦A≦1 - For this example, the allocation ratio A is equal to 0.52 (=78/150), so that the non-contiguous A-MPR is given by:
-
- Accordingly, for this example, the A-MPR determined using the second non-contiguous method is 3.8 dB less than the A-MPR determined using the non-contiguous method specified in TS 36.101. Other examples of improved A-MPR values for various CA_NS values will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
- One issue with the allocation correction factor described above is that for some cases, the allocation correction factor provides for a larger A-MPR than the allocation ratio-based method already defined in TS 36.101. The allocation correction factor tends to work well when the number of punctured resource blocks K is small in comparison to the number of resource blocks L in the smallest containing non-contiguous allocation so that the allocation correction factor is small. However, in cases in which the number of punctured resource blocks K is large in comparison to the number of contiguous resource blocks in which it is embedded, the second non-contiguous method for determining A-MPR can perform poorly in that it allows much more A-MPR than is necessary in order to meet the emissions requirements. The reason for this poor performance is due to the fact that if the transmit power is reduced by the allocation correction factor (which is large when L−K<<L) in order to maintain the same spectral density as for the corresponding contiguous allocation (for those resource blocks that are not punctured), then the transceiver of the mobile station (or a power amplifier therein) is operating in a much more linear region in which spectral regrowth due to power amplifier non-linearity is greatly reduced. As a result, when L−K is small relative to L, the extra power reduction is much more than is necessary in order to meet emissions requirements.
- A second example is now described for carrier aggregation for the 15 MHz+15 MHz case in combination with CA_NS_01 signaling. For this example, only the outer-most two resource blocks are allocated for the PUSCH. In this example, the number of resource blocks L of the smallest contiguous allocation containing the two allocated resource blocks is 150, the number of punctured resource blocks K is 148, and the allocation ratio is A=2/150=0.133. For CA_NS_01, the A-MPR formula for non-contiguous resource allocations (See TS 36.101 section 6.2.4A.1) yields:
-
- Thus, for this example, the A-MPR formula in TS 36.101 gives an A-MPR value equal to 16.7 dB.
- Using the second non-contiguous method described above, the A-MPR is determined for the smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation. For this example, the number of resource blocks L of the smallest containing contiguous allocation is 150. From Table 6.2.4A.1-1 in TS 36.101, the A-MPR for this contiguous allocation is 6 dB. The second A-MPR is then determined by adding a correction factor to this contiguous A-MPR. In this case, the number of resource blocks L for the smallest containing contiguous allocation is 150, and the number of punctured resource blocks K is 148, so that the second non-contiguous A-MPR is given by:
-
- Accordingly, the A-MPR determined using the second non-contiguous method is 8 dB greater than the A-MPR determined using the non-contiguous method. Thus, for this example, the existing method for computing A-MPR in TS 36.101 for computing A-MPR for non-contiguous allocations is preferred to the non-contiguous method because the resulting A-MPR is less.
- As a result of the above two examples, it can be observed that for some examples the A-MPR for the second non-contiguous method is less than the A-MPR for the non-contiguous method, and for some examples the A-MPR for the second non-contiguous method is greater than for the non-contiguous method. In some cases, it may be desirable to only allow the second non-contiguous method for non-contiguous allocations in which the only the PUCCH resource blocks are punctured from the corresponding contiguous allocations. Alternatively, it may be desirable to allow the second contiguous method only for non-contiguous allocations for which the correction factor A-MPR-CF is less than some maximum value. It can be noted that a limitation on A-MPR-CF is equivalent to a limitation on the ratio L/(L−K) for the non-contiguous allocation, where L is the number of resource blocks in the smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation, and where K is the number of resource blocks punctured from the allocation. Similarly, a limitation on A-MPR-CF is equivalent to a limitation on the ratio L/M for the non-contiguous allocation, where M=L−K. Finally, in cases in which the allowed A-MPR is rounded up to the next 0.5 dB, the log function can be implemented as a set of thresholds applied to the ratio L/(L−K), or equivalently L/M, where a ratio that falls between two such thresholds is assigned a correction factor A-MPR-CF which is the appropriate multiple of 0.5 dB.
- Turning to
FIG. 5 , aflowchart 500 of a method for calculating an uplink transmission power is shown. The method may be carried out by a mobile station ofFIG. 1 . The mobile station selects a minimum of two A-MPR values for determination of uplink transmission power. The mobile station receives (Step 505) an allocation indication from the base station. The allocation indication in one example is a control message that indicates radio resources (e.g., resource blocks) allocated to the mobile station by the base station. The mobile station determines (Step 510) whether the allocation is a contiguous allocation. - If the allocation is contiguous (YES at Step 510), then the mobile station determines (Step 515) a contiguous A-MPR using the contiguous allocation tables as defined in TS 36.101. For uplink carrier aggregation, the mobile station is allowed to set its configured maximum output power PCMAX,c for a serving cell c (e.g., for a cell provided by the base station) and also its total configured maximum output power PCMAX, as described in TS 36.101 (see section 6.2.5A). The total configured maximum output power PCMAX is to be set between PCMAX
— L≦PCMAX≦PCMAX— H. The mobile station determines (Step 520) lower bound PCMAX— L based on the contiguous A-MPR according to TS 36.101. The mobile station then determines (Step 525) the PCMAX based on the PCMAX— L and determines (Step 530) the uplink transmission power. The mobile station performs (Step 535) the uplink transmission based on the uplink transmission power. - If the allocation is not contiguous (NO at Step 510), then the mobile station determines (Step 540) a first A-MPR as a modified contiguous A-MPR with an allocation correction factor. In this case, the first A-MPR is based on a smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation and the allocation correction factor. The mobile station determines the smallest contiguous allocation by filling in any gaps of unallocated resource blocks in the allocation; however, the “smallest contiguous allocation” is not actually allocated and is thus a hypothetical smallest contiguous allocation, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. The mobile station uses the smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation to determine a contiguous A-MPR using the contiguous allocation tables as defined in TS 36.101. The contiguous allocation table lookup is based on at least one of a starting index of the non-contiguous allocation, an ending index of the non-contiguous allocation, the number M of allocated resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation, or a modulation and coding scheme for the uplink transmission.
- The mobile station determines the allocation correction factor based on a ratio of a number L of resource blocks in the smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation to a number M of resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation. For example, the mobile station determines the allocation correction factor as 10 log10 (L/M). The mobile station determines the first A-MPR as a sum of the contiguous A-MPR and the allocation correction factor.
- The mobile station determines (Step 545) a second A-MPR as a non-contiguous resource allocation A-MPR for the allocation. For example, the mobile station calculates the A-MPR by performing a predetermined function based on the allocation ratio, as described in TS 36.101. The mobile station determines the allocation ratio as a ratio of a number M of resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation to a maximum number NRB
— agg of aggregated resource blocks available for the uplink transmission. The maximum number may be for a single carrier (e.g., 25 resource blocks for a 5 MHz carrier) or for multiple aggregated carriers (e.g., 150 resource blocks for two aggregated 15 MHz carriers). The mobile station selects the predetermined function based on the CA_NS value. For example, the mobile station determines a maximum output power MA based on the allocation ratio and the functions defined in TS 36.101 Sections 6.2.3A and 6.2.4A. After determination of the first and second A-MPRs (Steps 540 and 545), the mobile station selects (Step 550) a lesser of the first and second A-MPRs. The mobile station then determines the A-MPR according to A-MPR=CEIL {Z, 0.5}, where Z is the lesser of the first and second A-MPRs. In another example, the mobile station applies the CEIL function to the first A-MPR and the second A-MPR prior to selecting the lesser of the first and second A-MPRs. - The mobile station calculates the uplink transmission power based on the selected A-MPR. For example, the mobile station performs
Steps - Turning to
FIG. 6 , aflowchart 600 of a method for decoding an uplink transmission is shown. The method may be carried out by a base station ofFIG. 1 . The base station allocates (Step 605) a non-contiguous allocation of resource blocks for the uplink transmission from the mobile station. The base station sends an indication of the allocated resource blocks to the mobile station (e.g., via a control message). - The base station determines (Step 610) a first A-MPR based on a smallest contiguous allocation containing the non-contiguous allocation and an allocation correction factor. The base station determines the allocation correction factor based on a ratio of a number L of resource blocks in the smallest contiguous allocation to a number M of resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation. For example, the base station determines the allocation correction factor as 10 log10 (L/M). The base station determines the first A-MPR as a sum of the contiguous A-MPR and the allocation correction factor.
- The base station determines (Step 615) a second A-MPR as a non-contiguous A-MPR for the non-contiguous allocation. For example, the base station calculates the A-MPR by performing a predetermined function based on the allocation ratio, as described in TS 36.101. The base station determines the allocation ratio as a ratio of a number M of resource blocks in the non-contiguous allocation to a maximum number NRB
— agg of aggregated resource blocks available for the uplink transmission. The base station selects the predetermined function based on the CA_NS value. For example, the base station determines a maximum output power MA based on the allocation ratio and the functions defined in TS 36.101 Sections 6.2.3A and 6.2.4A. The base station then determines the second A-MPR according to MPR=CEIL {MA, 0.5}. - The base station selects (Step 620) a lesser of the first and second A-MPRs. The base station decodes (Step 625) a received uplink transmission based on the non-contiguous allocation of resource blocks and the selected A-MPR. For example, the base station receives the uplink transmission using the allocated resource blocks. In some embodiments, the base station selects a modulation and coding scheme based on the selected A-MPR. The base station sends the selected MCS to the mobile station in the control message and decodes the uplink transmission using the selected MCS. The base station also performs channel estimation, including path loss estimation, for the uplink transmission based on the selected A-MPR.
