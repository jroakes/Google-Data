If “no,” it is estimated in output node 630 that the user 450 is located on level L 1 .
- intermediate node 620 asks whether the signal received from access point 414 is greater than or equal to ⁇ 65 dBm. If this returns true, it is estimated at output node 640 that the user 450 is located on level L 2 . If false, intermediate node 650 asks whether the signal received from access point 416 is less than or equal to ⁇ 40 dBm.

- the access point islands may be divided as broadly or narrowly as desired.
- the islands may be a group of floors in a building (e.g., as in FIG. 3A ), a building (e.g., as in FIG. 3B ), a group of buildings (e.g., as in FIG. 3C ) or the like.
- Each island may include one or more access points.

- each island may include a plurality of building levels.
- one or more decision trees such as the tree 600 of FIG. 6 may be built for each island to isolate a level on which the user is located. For example, at different levels of a building, signal strengths from different access points (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, radio, or other access points) may vary. Referring to the example of FIG. 4 , a signal from access point 416 may be much stronger on level L 1 than on level L 3 . Such variations may be identified, for example, using a mobile device which traverses throughout the building levels and may be used to generate a mapping of the access point signal strengths.
- the decision trees may correlate the received signal strength of the access points with a particular building level in the island. Alternatively or additionally to received signal strength, the decision trees may correlate any of a variety of other attributes with a building level, such as barometric pressure, altitude, etc.
- One or more decision trees may also be built to predict a position of a mobile device on a given building level (block 840 ). For example, for each building level, variations in signals received from access point may be identified at different positions on the level. The decision trees may correlate these variations with positions on the level.
- multiple decision trees may be built to determine a single building level or position.
- the multiple decision trees may each analyze a different set of data, or may analyze data in a different sequence.
- the different sets of data may include varying the access points that are analyzed, varying an order in which access points are analyzed, varying the received signal strength values, or a combination of these.
- some of the decision trees may relate to additional attributes, such as lighting or noise level. While any number of decision trees may be used, a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy make take place as the number of trees increases. Thus, for example, a building level or position may be determined using 10-15 decision trees.

- the mobile device may receive signals from one or more access points.
- the access points may be identified by the mobile device using, for example, MAC address or EUI. These access points may then be compared to a list of access points, such as the list created in block 820 of FIG. 8 , to determine on which island the mobile device is located (block 920 ).
- the user of the mobile device may be located within building 1010 , which is divided into Island A, Island B, and Island C. Each of these islands may include access points which are not visible outside of the island.
- the access points in Island A may transmit signals which may only be received by devices in Island A, and not devices in Island B or Island C.
- the user may receive a signal from one or more access points in Island C.
- a comparison of the one or more access points to a predetermined list may indicate that the one or more access points and the mobile device are located in Island C.
- decision trees e.g., the decision tree 600 of FIG. 6
- the decision trees may be stored in a remote server and downloaded as needed. Because only decision trees for a particular island are needed, and because the decision trees do not consume a great deal of resources, the trees may be downloaded fairly quickly. Alternatively, the decision trees may be stored on the mobile device semi-permanently, for example, if a user desires to continually determine his location in a given building.
- FIG. 11 provides an example of user 1150 and mobile device 1180 on a given island (e.g., Island C of FIG. 10 ).
- the island includes multiple levels 1122 (L 8 ), 1124 (L 7 ), 1126 (L 6 ).
- L 8 includes access point 1112
- L 7 includes access point 1114
- L 6 includes access points 1116 and 1118 .
- the mobile device 1180 may receive signals from each of these access points 1112 - 1118 , though the signals may vary in strength as a function of at least a distance between the device 1180 and the access points 1112 - 1118 .
- Starting and intermediate nodes of the decision trees may process information related to these signals as input.
- An output of the decision trees may indicate the mobile device's building level.
- the mobile device 1180 may execute the decision trees and determine that it is located on level L 7 .
- decision trees e.g., the decision tree 700 of FIG. 7
- these trees may be executed to determine the mobile device's position on the building level (block 960 ).
- the trees may use data related to received signal strength from surrounding access points as input, and may output an indication of position.
- FIG. 12 illustrates an example of an indoor area 1200 on a given building level (e.g., L 7 of FIG. 11 ).
- the indoor area includes access points 1210 , 1212 , 1214 , 1216 , 1218 .
- Mobile device 1280 may receive signals from the access points 1210 , 1212 , 1214 , but may be out of range of the access points 1216 , 1218 .
- This information may be input to one or more decision trees built for the indoor area 1200 , and the output may indicate a position of the mobile device 1280 .
- the output is indicated as latitude and longitude.
- the position may be indicated in coordinates relative to the indoor area 1200 , or in any other way.
- the mobile device 1280 may display a diagram of the indoor area 1200 on its screen, and its current position may be denoted as a red dot or the like.
- the above-described methods of predicting a user's indoor location may be executed periodically or continually to trace a movement of a mobile device.
- a mobile device 1380 may move throughout an indoor area 1300 , and receive signals of varying strengths from different access points 1310 , 1312 , 1314 , 1316 , 1318 along the way.
- the mobile device 1380 may thus be traced from a starting point 1362 along a path 1364 by executing decision trees at one or more points along the path 1364 .
- the mobile device 138 may also store a record of its movements, for example, by recording each decision tree output along with a timestamp.
- Using decision trees to predict a location of a user within an indoor area may be advantageous in that the decision trees do not consume a great deal of resources, they may be executed quickly, and they make choices about which inputs are relevant locally, rather than globally. Additionally, an accuracy of the location predictions made using the decision trees may be increased by executing a plurality of trees and averaging the result.
