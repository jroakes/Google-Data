Lexical item standardization engine 122 determines the various potential chat language lexical items in the natural language input received
Standardization.For example, lexical item standardization engine 122 can determine the standardization of the standardization " see " of lexical item " c ", lexical item " thx "
The standardization " review " of " thanks ", lexical item " rvw " and " rearview " etc..Lexical item standardization engine 122 can use rule
One or more mappings, rule and/or the other criterion of generalized database 152 are standardized to generate.For example, standardization database
152 may include the mapping of certain chat language lexical items to one or more of its corresponding standardization.For example, lexical item " c "
It can be mapped to the single standardization of " see ", lexical item " rvw " can be mapped to " review ", " rearview " etc.
Multiple standardization.In addition, for example, standardization database 152 can include identical characters with definition rule, the rule regulation
Multiple continuous examples and not the lexical item of effective standardization lexical item in, the example of the character can be removed until effectively advising
Until generalized lexical item is implemented.For example, " helloooooooo " specification can be made to turn to " hello " using rule, make
" yessss " specification turns to " yes ", so that " yippeeeeeeeee " specification is turned to " yippee ", " cooooolllll " is made to standardize
For " cool " and " col " etc..In some embodiments, lexical item standardization engine 122 composition can be reflected when determining standardization
It penetrates and/or regular.For example, engine 122 can be by being first " wazza " by " wazzaaaaa " deduplication and identifying " wazza "
Mapping between " what ' s up " turns to " what ' s up " standardize " wazzaaaaa ".By " wazzaaaaa " duplicate removal
It is multiple for " what ' s up " when, engine 122 can by following rule, i.e., in multiple continuous examples comprising identical characters and
It is not that the example of the character can be removed in the lexical item of effective standardization lexical item until the lexical item of identification is (for example, in chat language
The lexical item that recognizes in mapping between lexical item and standardization lexical item) be implemented until.
Alternative input engine 124 is that the natural language input received generates candidate alternative input and by being standardized with it
One (if yes) in change replaces one or more lexical items of received natural language input to generate candidate alternative
Each of input.For example, the natural language for received " tx 4the rvw " inputs, lexical item standardization engine
122 can make " tx " specification turn to thanks, and " 4 " specification can be made to turn to " for ", and " rvw " specification can be made to turn to
" review " and " rearview ".Based on those standardization, alternative input engine can be generated " thanks 4the review ",
“tx for the review”、“thanks 4the rearview”、“thanks for the rearview”、“thanks
The candidate alternative of for the review ", " tx 4the review " and " tx 4the rearview " input.
Rating engine 126 is each of the alternative input generated by alternative input engine 124 generation score, and can
Selection of land is for generating the natural language input of alternative input and generating score.Rating engine 126 selects that using these scores
It is at least one of a little to make as generating engine 128 by message when generating the response inputted to received natural language
Selected input.
In various embodiments, rating engine 126 determines score using language model 154.In those embodiments
In it is some in, language model 154 is in message and/or other contents including " standardization " (that is, non-chat language) lexical item
Corpus on training n tuple language model.For example, can use language model 154 determine instruction " see ", " you " and
" later " is more likely to " see of co-occurrence (in the corpus for train language model 154) than " see ", " u " and " l8r "
The score of you later ".By this natural language input and " thanks audio with " thx audio company "
The alternative input of company " compares.In this case, can use language model 154 determine " thx ",
" company " and " audio " is more likely to co-occurrence (and therefore for " thx than " thanks ", " audio " and " company "
Audio company " determines better score).In some embodiments, rating engine 126 (is received for given input
To natural language input and/or alternative input) come based on using the input lexical item language model 154 and do not have to ginseng
Examine by user be supplied to automation assistant 120 the lexical item formerly inputted and/or by automation assistant 120 provide for rendering to
The score for given input is determined in the case where the lexical item of user formerly exported.In some other embodiments, scoring
Engine 126 can also be using formerly input (for example, immediately formerly input) and/or first output (for example, immediately formerly defeated
One or more of lexical item out).
As mentioned above, in some embodiments can based on including " standardization " lexical item message and/or its
The corpus of its content carrys out train language model 154.For example, the corpus of message may include using in two or more mankind
The message exchanged between family, wherein the chat language lexical item of those message is by one or more mankind's reviewers and/or automation
System is transformed to standardization version.For example, lexical item " 4 " can be made to standardize in the message including " thanks 4your help "
Turn to " for " and including " for " rather than the message of " 4 " is utilized to train language model 154.On the other hand, including
In the message of " 4 × 4trunk ", the appearance twice of lexical item " 4 " will not be replaced with " for ", and can also using include " 4 ×
The message of 4truck " carrys out train language model 154.In other words, it can be chatted based on wherein potential in those embodiments
Its language lexical item those lexical items by with chat language form utilize when with its standardize version replace --- but wherein those
Potential chat language lexical item they by with non-chat language form using when the message that is maintained come train language model
154.Can use additional and/or substitution corpus come various embodiments such as web page, news report, academic article,
Patent application publication provides and carrys out train language model in user internet comment of internet content comment to video etc.
154。
In some embodiments for determining score, rating engine 126 additionally and/or alternatively utilizes one or more
A additional score, such as from message generate one or more of engine 128 one or more reply content scores and/or
One or more rewriting scores from rewrite engine (not describing).In some in those embodiments, when being based on language
Speech model 154 and there is no when enough variations rating engine 126 between two or more in the score that determines using coming from
The reply content score (and/or other additional scores) of message generation engine 128.In some other embodiments, scoring is drawn
Holding up 126 can be always using generating the reply content score (and/or other additional scores) of engine 128 from message as being directed to
It is analyzing a part of the score of one or more inputs and determination, and optionally true with language model 154 is based on
Fixed score is utilized in conjunction with reply content score.
Generally, one in engine 128 is generated by message and is directed to input (primitive nature language in-put or alternative input)
It is how " good " that provided reply content score instruction is had by the response that the engine 128 is generated based on the input.For example, engine
One in 128 can provide " chat response " and can mention in the case where there is the scripted response with input strong correlation
For indicating the reply content score of good response.For example, replying resource database 156 may include that one or more scriptings are chatted
Its response, one or more of scriptings chat response be respectively mapped to instruction scripted response it is when appropriate one or
Multiple input parameters --- and the reply content of given input can be determined compared with inputting parameter based on given input
Score.In addition, for example, one in engine 128 can provide the content from " search result " and can give being directed to
Input at least one search result be high quality search result and/or have specific " type " (for example, " one case result ", " know
Know card ", " plan exhibition response ") in the case where provide instruction good response given input reply content score.
As an example, it is assumed that receive the natural language input of " thx audio " and alternative input engine 124 is raw
It is inputted at the alternative of " thanks audio ".It is further assumed that rating engine 126 is to be inputted based on those of language model 154
Generate score, but those scores be too close to each other and not can guarantee better than another and select one (for example, better score
It is not able to satisfy threshold value relative to another score).In such examples, one in message generation engine 128 can provide
More refer to from the content of " search result " and can providing than the individual reply content score for " thanks audio "
Show the reply content score for " thx audio " of good response.Rating engine 126 can be based at least partially on those times
Multiple content score selects " thx audio " to be better than " thanks audio ".
As another example, it is assumed that the natural language input and alternative input for receiving " thx 4assistance " are drawn
Hold up the 124 alternative inputs for generating " thanks for assistance ".Further assume that rating engine 126 is based on language
Say that the input of those of model 154 generates score, but those scores are too close to each other and not can guarantee better than another and select
One.In such examples, message generate in engine 128 one can provide the content from scripted response and can be with
It is included in reply resource database 156 and " thanks for the [help/assistance/input/info/
Information/ etc.] " the associated scripted response of input parameter " you ' re welcome ", wherein square brackets " [] "
Indicate multiple lexical items with the lexical item in square brackets, it is therein any one can be matched with " thanks for the ".It is based on
Meeting by force between the input parameter of the scripted response of " thanks for assistance " and " you ' re welcome "
Degree, which, which generates engine 128, can provide the reply content score for being directed to " thanks for assistance ", than coming from
The individual reply content score for " thx 4assistance " of the engine 128 more indicates good response.Rating engine
126, which can be based at least partially on those reply content scores, selects " thanks for be better than " thx 4assistance "
assistance”。
Generally, score is rewritten for provided by input (primitive nature language in-put or alternative input) by rewrite engine
It is how " good " that instruction has the rewriting of the input, wherein rewriteeing by being based on the input based on rewrite engine and being optionally based on one
Or multiple first input (or those selected alternatives formerly inputted input) Lai Shengcheng.Rewrite it is how well can be based on rewriteeing it this
The characteristic (for example, whether it is grammatically correct) of body and/or the property of the search result in response to rewriting.Show as one
Example, it is assumed that the first input of " what ' s the weather on Saturday ", the current of " what abt sun " input with
And the candidate alternative input including " what about Sunday ".Rewriting based on " the what abt sun " that formerly inputs can
It can be " what ' s the weather on the Sun ", however the rewriting of " what about Sunday " can be " what '
s the weather on Sunday".It can be based on for example responding that for the rewriting score of " what about Sunday "
One or more property ratios of the search result rewritten a bit are more preferable for the rewriting score of " what about sun ".
Regardless of the technology utilized, selected input can be supplied to message and generate engine by rating engine 126
128, the message, which generates engine 128, can use reply resource database 156 to generate in the reply in response to selected input
Hold.In some embodiments, message, which generates engine 128, to have generated reply content before receiving selected input.Example
Such as, reply content may have been generated during generating reply content score as described above.Reply content generated is provided
To provide natural language input message exchange client 1071-N, and be provided for inputting as to the natural language
Response be presented to the user.For example, it also includes natural language input that reply content can be incorporated by message exchange client
In message exchange thread.
Chat language measurement engine 130 is based on contributing to message exchange thread to by one or more of these users
Chat language in multiple message in the past using determining that the chat language for being directed to one or more users is measured.Chat language
Determining chat language measurement is stored in chat language metric database 158 for by one or more by measurement engine 130
Message generates engine 128 and utilizes.Message generate engine 128 can determine whether it is defeated in response to the natural language of user at them
Enter in the reply content generated (optionally regardless of whether natural language input itself includes any chat language lexical item)
It replaces utilizing the chat language for being suitable for user to measure when its standardization lexical item including chat language lexical item.
In some embodiments, chat language measurement engine 130 is based on the example that chat language is utilized by message
It counts to determine chat language measurement.For example, chat language measurement engine 130 can measure " general " chat language (for use
Family or user group) be determined as with do not include it is any chat language message count compared with include it is any chat language
The counting of (user's of user group) message is related.In addition, for example, chat language measurement engine 130 can additionally and/or can
" general " chat language measurement (for user or user group) is determined as the tale phase such as with the lexical item in message as an alternative
The counting of the lexical item in (user's of user group) message as chat language lexical item compared is related.
As an example, the past example of the chat language translation of user and the amount based on those examples be can store
(for example, related based on original count, frequency and/or other and amount) determines chat language measurement.For example, being provided in user
In the case where consistently using chat language in the message of automation assistant, the chat language measurement for the user can refer to
Show that the user it is expected to receive and also include the response of chat language from automation assistant, and automates assistant to provide packet
Include at least some responses that chat language lexical item replaces the standardization version of those lexical items.Chat language measurement can be " general "
One group of one or more specific chat language lexical item is measured or be suitable for language of chatting.For example, user for " thx "/
The chat language measurement of " thanks " can make automation assistant use " thx " replacement " thanks " in the response to the user,
However user may not make to automate assistant in the sound to the user for the individual chat language measurement of " gr8/great "
Ying Zhongyong " great " replacement " great ".
In some embodiments, the measurement of chat language can be specific to given user.For example, can at least partly ground
The example of chat language in the message formulated by the user is such as according to the example of technology described herein identification come really
It is fixed.In some in those embodiments, the measurement of chat language can specific to user one or more equipment (for example,
User may be more likely in mobile computing device rather than " desktop " calculates and utilize chat language in equipment).In some embodiments
In, chat language measurement can the chat language example based on multiple users and can be specific to such as with one or more
It one group of user of the user of predicable (for example, geographic area, the range of age) and/or can be set specific to the calculating utilized
The type of standby type and/or the message exchange client utilized is (for example, message exchange customer end A can compared with customer end B
To have bigger chat language frequency in multiple users).In some embodiments, it can be presented to given user aobvious
Requesting automation assistant 120 includes that chat language (such as includes and is directed to one group or more in the output for being supplied to user likes
Group user at least threshold value chat language measure it is associated chat language lexical item chat language) option.For example, user can
It is wherein stream in people of those chat language lexical items in geographic area to select to receive the chat language lexical item in output
It is capable (for example, it is associated at least threshold value chat language measurement for one group of user in geographic area those chat
Language lexical item).
In some embodiments, one in message generation engine 128 can determine whether to utilize one or more
Language lexical item of chatting replaces measuring when the standardization version of those lexical items using multiple chat language.For example, message generates engine
128 can determine whether to utilize " c " replacement " see " in the output of user to be supplied to based on both following: user's is general
Language of chatting is measured；And (user's or one group user) chat language measurement specific to " c/see ".For example it is assumed that with
The general chat language measurement instruction at family passes through " medium " the chat language availability of user.If specific to chatting for " c/see "
Its language measurement instruction high chat language availability associated with those lexical items, then can utilize " c " in the output of generation
Instead of " see ".On the other hand, if specific to " c/see " chat language measurement instruction it is associated with those lexical items it is low merely
Its language availability then can utilize " see " in the output of generation.
