- the embodiments described herein are described generally in relation to HTML files or documents, but embodiments may operate on any type of article, including any type of image.
- the server device 104 or other device can determine if any of the documents crawled are shopping documents.
- a shopping document is a document that presents items for sale and in which the items can be purchased through interaction with the document or related documents.
- the document locator 130 identifies shopping documents that contain items relevant to the search query signal 122 .
- a shopping document can contain a single item or multiple items relevant to the search query.
- Shopping documents can contain attributes of the items, such as, for example, the price of the item, an image of the item, a SKU number for the item, and a version of the item.
- the attribute processor 132 identifies and extracts certain attributes associated with the item or items relevant to the search query. In one embodiment, the attribute processor 132 identifies and extracts the price of the item and an image associated with the item from the documents located by the document locator 130 that are relevant to the search query. Other functions and characteristics of the document locator 130 and attribute processor 132 are further described below.
- the present invention may comprise systems having a different architecture than that which is shown in FIG. 1 .
- the attribute processor 132 may be located external to the search engine 120 and may perform its functions offline before a search query from a user.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to explain the exemplary methods shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 .
- a plurality of articles are received, at least one price representation in a first article is identified, at least one shopping character string in a link element or a form element of the first article is identified, and an indication that the first article is a shopping article is provided.
- the price representation can be a currency symbol followed by a number followed by a period or comma followed by two single digit numbers.
- the character string can occur in a uniform resource locator (URL), parameter or value of an HTML form element, such as ⁇ FORM>, ⁇ INPUT>, or ⁇ IMAGE> or a URL in an HTML ⁇ A> tag.
- the character string can be “add to cart”, “add to basket”, “add to shopping bag”, “update order”, “cart”, “basket”, and “checkout”.
- a search query for an item is received, a first article associated with the search query is selected, a first attribute associated with the item from the first article based at least in part on the search query is identified, a second attribute associated with the item based at least in part on the search query and the first attribute is identified, and the first attribute and the second attribute from the first article are extracted.
- the search query can be entered by a user or can be generated by the search engine or search engine administrator. Attributes can be extracted from a plurality of articles and each item can be ranked. The list of ranked items can be presented to a user as a search result set. Alternatively, the search engine can index and store the extracted attributes.
- the first attribute and second attribute can be identified in a variety of ways.
- the first attribute and the second attribute can be identified based at least in part on a structure of the first article.
- the identification of the first attribute and the second attribute can comprise determining a relationship between each attribute and a query term.
- the first article can have a tree structure and the identification of the first attribute and the second article can comprise determining a number of words between each attribute and a query term, determining a distance from each attribute and a query term to a closest common ancestor, determining a number of nodes in a smallest tree that contains both the first attribute and a query term and the second attribute and a query term, determining a depth to a smallest tree containing both the first attribute and a query term and the second attribute and a query term, determining a distance between the first attribute and the second attribute.
- the identification of the first attribute and the second attribute can also comprise determining global information associated with articles related to the first article.
- the identification of the first attribute and the second attribute can be performed simultaneously or it can be performed serially, such as determining the first attribute and then determining the second attribute.
- the first attribute is a price associated with the item and the second attribute is an image associated with the item.
- Identifying the price can comprise determining a price representation score, determining a font size of the price, determining a font face of the price, determining words immediately preceding the price, and determining words immediately following the price.
- Identifying the image can comprise determining an aspect ratio associated with the image, and determining a frequency of occurrence value associated with the image.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary method 200 that provides a method for identifying and extracting item attributes from documents.
- This exemplary method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention.
- the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 can be executed or otherwise performed by any of various systems.
- the method 200 is described below as carried out by the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 by way of example, and various elements of the system 100 are referenced in explaining the example method of FIG. 2 .
- the search engine 120 identifies shopping documents.
- a shopping document is a document that presents items for sale and in which the items can be purchased through interaction with the document or related documents.
- the search engine 120 can determine shopping documents during the crawl of the network 106 or after the crawl of the network 106 .
- the search engine 120 can provide an indication, such as a flag, in an index of crawled documents for each document that is identified as a shopping document.
- the search engine 120 can detect specific formatting characteristics of the document that indicate that the document presents items for sale. User-visible features of documents are sometimes unreliable, because documents frequently discuss items for sale without actually offering them for sale, for example, a review of an item. The search engine 120 thus can focus on the not user-visible, mechanical aspects of a document in determining whether it is a shopping document. For example, in the case of an HTML document, the search engine 120 can determine if there are any form elements or link elements of the document that indicate that the document is a shopping document.
- the search engine 120 can search for character strings occurring in a URL, parameter or value of an HTML form element, such as ⁇ FORM>, ⁇ INPUT>, or ⁇ IMAGE> or a URL in an HTML ⁇ A> tag.
- an HTML form element such as ⁇ FORM>, ⁇ INPUT>, or ⁇ IMAGE> or a URL in an HTML ⁇ A> tag.
- the following character strings in a form or link element indicate a shopping document: “add to cart”, “add to basket”, “add to shopping bag”, “update order”; “cart”, “basket”, and “checkout”.
- a variety of other similar character strings can indicate a shopping document.
- the search engine 120 can also determine if a price occurs on the document. Specifically, the search engine 120 can identify if the document contains a price representation.
- a price representation can be currency symbol followed by a number, followed by a period, followed by two single digit numbers, such as “$15.89”.
- the search engine can identify other monetary currency symbols other than “$” and can look for a comma instead of a period indicating the fraction of a currency, for example 15.89.
- the search engine 120 receives a search query signal 122 from a client device 102 a via the network 106 .
- a user 112 a can input text representing an item the user wishes to purchase or gain information on the purchase of into a client device 102 a .
- the client device can create an associated search query signal 122 representative of the search query 114 input by the user and transmit the search query signal 122 to the server device 104 via the network 106 .
- the user 112 a is interested in purchasing a camera, the user can input “camera” in the client device 102 a and the client device can send an associated search query signal 122 to the server device 104 .
- the search engine 120 or a search engine administrator can generate a search query regarding an item or items to enable the extraction of item attributes from documents.
- the document locator 130 identifies shopping documents relevant to the item requested in the search query. For the example search query “camera”, the document locator 130 can attempt to locate all shopping documents presenting cameras for purchase. The document locator 130 can identify relevant shopping documents using conventional techniques, such as, for example, matching the terms of the search query with the indexed terms from the shopping documents.
- Attributes for an item can include, for example, an item name, a price of the item, an image of the item, a SKU number for the item, a version of the item, a description of the item, and other information relating to the item.
- An attribute for an item in a document can be identified based on a variety of factors, such as the terms of the query, the structure of the document, global information from related documents, and other identified or potential attributes.
- the attribute processor 132 can identify potential attributes of the item by determining the relationship of a potential attribute and terms used in the search query. This relationship can be determined based on a variety of distance metrics and structure metrics based on the structure of the document. For example, the attribute processor 132 can determine a relationship by determining the distance of a potential attribute from the terms of the query, the location of a potential attribute in the structure of the document, and the font size and face of a potential attribute. The attribute processor 132 can also use the relationship in the document between potential attributes in the determination of attributes for an item. It is possible to identify and extract multiple attributes for each item.
- the attribute processor can identify and extract an item title based on the query terms, and then use this attribute and the query terms in identifying and extracting a price for the item, and use the extracted two attributes and the query terms in identifying and extracting an image for the item.
- Global information used by the attribute processor 132 in identifying and selecting attributes associated with items can include, for example, the number of documents from a particular vendor or host, the number of times an image is referenced on the network, and the size of an image.
- the attribute processor 132 can determine different attributes for an item simultaneously or one at a time.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example of subroutine 208 and specifically illustrates an example of determining two attributes, price and image, for an item from a document.
- the attribute processor 132 determines a list of potential prices for the item.
- the attribute processor 132 can determine potential prices by examining the document and determining the price signals associated with each potential price. These price signals can include price representation, the font of the potential price, the proximity of the potential price to special words, and distance and structure metrics related to the potential price.
- each potential price can be given a price representation score that represents how well the price looks as a price.
- a price will typically have a currency indicator, such as “$”, a number that is followed by a period, followed by two single digit numbers, such that a price may look like “$15.89”.
- the font size of the potential price can be indicative that it is a price if it is a large font size. Font face can also indicate whether or not the potential price is an actual price. For example, a strikethrough font type can indicate that the potential price is not a price for the item. Terms immediately preceding the potential price, such as, for example, “our price”, “your price”, “sale price”, and “sale” can indicate a price.
- immediately preceding a potential price can indicate that the potential price is not an actual price, such as, for example, “starting at”, “over”, “about”, “was”, “save”, “rebate”, and “shipping”.
- a country abbreviation, such as “US”, immediately preceding or following the potential price can be indicative that it is an actual price.
- the attribute processor 132 can utilize various distance and structural metrics to determine the proximity of a potential price to a query term.
- One such distance metric is the number of words between a potential price and a query term.
- Other distance metrics can be used on documents having a tree structure.
- HTML documents have a hierarchical tree structure that can be formed by a plurality of small tree structures.
- the attribute processor 132 can determine the distance from a potential price to the closest common ancestor shared with a query term and the depth of the smallest tree containing both a potential price and a query term.
- the attribute processor can also use the structural metric of the number of nodes in the smallest tree that contains both a potential price and a query term to determine potential prices for an item.
- the attribute processor 132 Based on some or all of these price signals, the attribute processor 132 identifies potential prices for an item in a document and compiles a list of potential prices for an item from a document. In one embodiment, the attribute processor 132 can then sort and rank the list based on these same signals used in a decision tree. Other methods of sorting and ranking the list are possible.
- the attribute processor 132 can determine potential images for an item from a document. As with determining potential prices for the item, the attribute processor 132 determines various image signals to identify the potential images associated with the item. Such signals can be, for example, various distance and structural metrics for potential images and query terms, various distance and structural metrics for potential images and potential prices, and global information regarding the potential image. Similar distance metrics and structural metrics as were used for identifying potential prices can be used for potential images and query terms and potential images and potential prices. Global information regarding the potential images, such as, the file type of the potential image, the size of the potential image, the aspect ratio of the potential image, and an occurrence value for the image can also be used by the attribute processor 132 to determine potential images.
- the occurrence value can be based on the frequency of occurrence of the image in the document and in the network. It is desirable to choose an image of the item that is a photograph or other representation of the item rather than a logo associated with the item or other undesirable image. Images can be indicated by files that have “.gif”, “.jpeg”, or “.jpg” extensions. Images that have odd aspect ratios or occur frequently on the document or in the network may be logos or other undesirable images. Additionally, a very large image or small image can signify that the image is not useful or appropriate.
- the attribute processor 132 compiles a list of potential images for an item from a document. In one embodiment, the attribute processor 132 can then sort and rank the list based on these same signals used in a decision tree. Other methods of sorting and ranking the list are possible.
- the attribute processor 132 selects the best potential price and the best potential image for an item from a document.
- the attribute processor can select the highest ranked potential price as the best potential price and can select the highest ranked potential image as the best potential image. Biasing the image and price selection to things near each other on the document can increase the quality of the selected image and price.
- the best potential price is identified by the attribute processor 132 before the attribute processor 132 identifies the potential images.
- the best potential price and best potential image from the document relating to the item are extracted by the attribute processor 132 and can be used in the compilation of a summary relating to the item for the document.
- the attribute processor can identify and extract attributes for the requested item from relevant documents identified by the document locator 130 .
- item attributes for each relevant document are compiled in a search result set.
- the compiled search result set can be transmitted by the server device 104 to the client device 102 a via the network 106 .
- the search engine 120 can index and store the item attributes to be used in response to a search query from a user.
- first and second are used herein merely to differentiate one item, article, or attribute from another item, article, or attribute.
- the terms first and second are not used to indicate first or second in time, or first or second in a list, or other order, unless explicitly noted.
- the “second” may come in time or in a list before the “first,” unless it is otherwise explicitly indicated.
