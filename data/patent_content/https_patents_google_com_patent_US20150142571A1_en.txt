- content server 140 executes a web server program responsive to HTTP requests for content issued by user device 145
- user device 145 executes a web browser program which issues the HTTP requests and converts content received from content server 140 responsive to those requests for display on display unit 150 .
- user device 145 may also obtain content from map service 135 for display on display unit 150 , such as an interactive map application which allows for searching for points of interest and selection of particular geographical areas for display on display unit 150 .
- the content obtained by user device 145 may include a supplemental display area indicating one or more areas for displaying advertisements, with those areas collectively comprising regions for displaying two or more supplemental content display regions (see, for example, supplemental display area 220 and supplemental content display regions 221 and 222 illustrated in FIG. 2 ).
- Info′illation included in the content for these regions cause a program executing on user device, such as a web browser application, to contact advertisement service 125 with information relating to the supplemental content display regions specified by the content, and obtain supplemental content information, such as advertisement information, from advertisement service 125 for display in each of the supplemental content display regions on display unit 150 .
- advertisement service 125 includes an advertisement database 130 which stores advertisements and data relating to the advertisements. Advertisers 120 provide advertisements for storage in advertisement database 130 , and additional information describing each advertisement such as keywords or categories relevant to displaying an advertisement. By providing advertisement data to user device 145 , which renders the advertisement on display unit 150 , it may be considered that advertising service 125 has displayed the advertisement on display unit 150 .

- quotation service 110 includes a quotation database 115 containing textual quotations.
- quotations stored in quotation database 115 are obtained from book text corpus 105 .
- an supplemental content display region displaying a non-advertisement textual quotation is hyperlinked to a webpage related to the source of the quotation, such as a book included in book text corpus 105 .
- text segments that satisfy “reasonable quote” conditions are extracted from book text corpus 105 , and filtering is performed to remove text segments containing abusive content.
- quotes may simply be randomly selected from book text corpus 105 .
- clickstream information (e.g., when a hyperlink for a quote is followed) is obtained from user device 145 and used to rank and select quotes.
- quotations are selected from quotation database 115 based on their relevance to the piece of content retrieved from content server 140 . This relevance may be determined, for example, based on words included in the quotations as they relate to the content, or based on information regarding the source of the quote, such as a subject or category of a book.
- the comparative performance e.g., “click-through” events reported by user device 145 ) of advertisements when displayed concurrently with particular quotes may be used to rank and select quotes that appear to be of greater interest to users.
- book text corpus 105 is illustrated as an example source for textual quotations, other sources may be used in conjunction with or instead of books, such as, but not limited to, movie quotes, newsworthy quotes, celebrity quotes, political quotes, and other media.
- user-specific options may be recorded with advertisement service 125 to affect the use of non-advertisement information. For example, a user may choose to opt out of displaying non-advertisement information in lieu of advertisements. As another example, the user may register particular areas or topics of interest from which non-advertisement information, such as quotes, should be selected. Also, a user may choose other specified sources of non-advertisement information to be displayed in a supplemental content display region, such as, although not limited to, an RSS feed (which may provide news of interest to the user), a stream of social networking posts (such as a Twitter feed), or a stream of images from an online photo album.
- RSS feed which may provide news of interest to the user
- Twitter feed a stream of social networking posts
- advertisement information and non-advertisement information may be obtained by content server 140 , which incorporates this data into content provided to user device 145 .
- user device 145 may execute a program that has supplemental content display region for display on display unit 150 (e.g., a program which displays advertisements for generating revenue for the publisher of the program).
- the program may directly request display data for the supplemental content display regions from advertisement service 125 , without issuing a related request for content from content server 140 .
- an advertisement may be selected in favor of advertisements that are most similar to the content in which an advertisement display region is included
- non-advertisement information such as a textual quotation
- Machine learning techniques used for categorizing advertisements, and vector-based correlation techniques for finding advertisements or clusters of advertisements that correlate to content may be adapted for use with non-advertisement information (e.g., by identifying a quotation or cluster of quotations with the lowest, rather than the highest, correlation).
- a supplemental content display region such as a supplemental content display region displaying a non-advertisement textual quotation, may be periodically updated with new advertisement or non-advertisement information in order to provide a more dynamic and attractive presentation in the supplemental display area, whereby content of an supplemental content display region is periodically replaced with new content.

Description
- Techniques are known within the art for displaying a plurality of advertisements, such as short text-based advertisements, image-based advertisements, and video-based advertisements, at predetermined locations on a webpage. Over time users begin to pay increasingly less attention to such webpage-based advertisements, to the point where they are often ignored by users. If users end up ignoring such advertisements, they may miss opportunities relevant to their interests. A common technique employed by advertisers to attract the attention of users (and also to compete with other advertisements) is to make advertisements more visually stimulating, such as by using images, animation, video, and/or audio. However, these forms of advertisements generally require more data to be delivered to users, which may increase expense and delay for delivering and displaying such advertisements.
- The disclosed subject matter relates to a machine-implemented method for displaying an advertisement in a supplemental display region of a display comprising providing a primary content display region, providing a first supplemental content display region and a second supplemental content display region, both of which are co-located within the primary content display region, obtaining advertisement information, providing the advertisement information for display in the first supplemental content display region, obtaining non-advertisement information, and providing the non-advertisement information for display in the second supplemental content display region, wherein the advertisement information and non-advertisement information are displayed concurrently.
- The disclosed subject matter further relates to a system for displaying advertisements. The system comprises an advertisement database storing a plurality of pieces of advertisement information, one or more processors, and a machine-readable medium comprising instructions stored therein. When the processors execute the operations, the processors perform operations comprising: receiving a first request from a user device for a first piece of supplemental content and a second request for a second piece of supplemental content for concurrent display within a supplemental display area and with a primary content display area on the user device, providing an advertisement information obtained from the advertisement database to the user device in response to the first request, and providing a non-advertisement information to the user device in response to the second request.
- The disclosed subject matter also relates to a machine-readable medium comprising instructions stored therein, which when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform operations including receiving a first request associated with a first supplemental content display region and a second request associated with a second supplemental content display region for concurrent display within a supplemental display area and with a primary content display area on a user device, obtaining an advertisement information, providing the advertisement information to the user device in response to the first request, obtaining a non-advertisement information, and providing the non-advertisement information to the user device in response to the second request.
- It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized, the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects, all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.
- The novel features of the subject technology are set forth in the appended claims. However, for purpose of explanation, several aspects of the disclosed subject matter are set forth in the following figures.

FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary architecture diagram for the disclosed techniques for displaying advertisements.User device 145 is a network-connected device configured to retrieve content fromcontent server 140 for display ondisplay unit 150 included inuser device 145. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter,content server 140 executes a web server program responsive to HTTP requests for content issued byuser device 145, anduser device 145 executes a web browser program which issues the HTTP requests and converts content received fromcontent server 140 responsive to those requests for display ondisplay unit 150. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, rather than retrieve content fromcontent server 140,user device 145 may also obtain content frommap service 135 for display ondisplay unit 150, such as an interactive map application which allows for searching for points of interest and selection of particular geographical areas for display ondisplay unit 150. - In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, the content obtained by
user device 145 may include a supplemental display area indicating one or more areas for displaying advertisements, with those areas collectively comprising regions for displaying two or more supplemental content display regions (see, for example,supplemental display area 220 and supplementalcontent display regions FIG. 2 ). Info′illation included in the content for these regions cause a program executing on user device, such as a web browser application, to contactadvertisement service 125 with information relating to the supplemental content display regions specified by the content, and obtain supplemental content information, such as advertisement information, fromadvertisement service 125 for display in each of the supplemental content display regions ondisplay unit 150. - In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter,
advertisement service 125 includes anadvertisement database 130 which stores advertisements and data relating to the advertisements.Advertisers 120 provide advertisements for storage inadvertisement database 130, and additional information describing each advertisement such as keywords or categories relevant to displaying an advertisement. By providing advertisement data touser device 145, which renders the advertisement ondisplay unit 150, it may be considered thatadvertising service 125 has displayed the advertisement ondisplay unit 150. Such advertisements may be text-based (typically including hypertext links, such that when a displayed advertisement is selected by a user, a web browser application is directed to a website relating to the advertisement), but also may comprise, for example, images, animations, and/or videos. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter,advertisement service 125 obtains information regarding the content, such as a document identifier, including the portions indicating the supplemental content display regions. In such an aspect,advertisement service 125 is able to provide content-aware advertising, in conjunction with the advertisement data stored inadvertisement database 130, to identify and present advertisements related to the content, in order to provide advertisements which are presumably more closely related to the interests of a user requesting the content. - In addition to displaying advertisements, supplemental content display regions may also be used to display non-advertisement data. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter,
advertisement service 125 is also configured to obtain non-advertisement information, such as textual quotations fromquotation service 110, instead of advertisement information, for display in one or more of the supplemental content display regions corresponding to a piece of content. By displaying non-advertisement information, hopefully of interest to a user ofuser device 145, users may be encouraged to more frequently review supplemental content display regions for information of interest, thereby increasing the likelihood that a user will not ignore advertisements displayed in the supplemental content display regions, whether an advertisement concurrently displayed with the non-advertisement information or advertisements displayed in supplemental display areas for other content in the future. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter,advertisement service 125 performs content-aware selection of non-advertisement information to identify and present non-advertisement information related to the content, in order to display non-advertisement information which is presumably more closely related to the interests of a user requesting the content. - To provide textual quotations to
advertisement service 125,quotation service 110 includes aquotation database 115 containing textual quotations. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, quotations stored inquotation database 115 are obtained frombook text corpus 105. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, an supplemental content display region displaying a non-advertisement textual quotation is hyperlinked to a webpage related to the source of the quotation, such as a book included inbook text corpus 105. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, text segments that satisfy “reasonable quote” conditions are extracted frombook text corpus 105, and filtering is performed to remove text segments containing abusive content. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, quotes may simply be randomly selected frombook text corpus 105. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, clickstream information (e.g., when a hyperlink for a quote is followed) is obtained fromuser device 145 and used to rank and select quotes. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, quotations are selected fromquotation database 115 based on their relevance to the piece of content retrieved fromcontent server 140. This relevance may be determined, for example, based on words included in the quotations as they relate to the content, or based on information regarding the source of the quote, such as a subject or category of a book. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, the comparative performance (e.g., “click-through” events reported by user device 145) of advertisements when displayed concurrently with particular quotes may be used to rank and select quotes that appear to be of greater interest to users. - Additionally, although
book text corpus 105 is illustrated as an example source for textual quotations, other sources may be used in conjunction with or instead of books, such as, but not limited to, movie quotes, newsworthy quotes, celebrity quotes, political quotes, and other media. - In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, user-specific options may be recorded with
advertisement service 125 to affect the use of non-advertisement information. For example, a user may choose to opt out of displaying non-advertisement information in lieu of advertisements. As another example, the user may register particular areas or topics of interest from which non-advertisement information, such as quotes, should be selected. Also, a user may choose other specified sources of non-advertisement information to be displayed in a supplemental content display region, such as, although not limited to, an RSS feed (which may provide news of interest to the user), a stream of social networking posts (such as a Twitter feed), or a stream of images from an online photo album. - In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter not illustrated in
FIG. 1 , advertisement information and non-advertisement information may be obtained bycontent server 140, which incorporates this data into content provided touser device 145. - In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter,
user device 145 may execute a program that has supplemental content display region for display on display unit 150 (e.g., a program which displays advertisements for generating revenue for the publisher of the program). In such an aspect, the program may directly request display data for the supplemental content display regions fromadvertisement service 125, without issuing a related request for content fromcontent server 140. - In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, whereas an advertisement may be selected in favor of advertisements that are most similar to the content in which an advertisement display region is included, in contrast non-advertisement information, such as a textual quotation, may be selected in favor of pieces of non-advertisement information that are most dissimilar to the content and/or the advertisement information. This presumably provides a non-advertisement information which is more unexpected or interesting to a user of
user device 145, so as to better encourage ongoing viewing of supplemental display areas. Machine learning techniques used for categorizing advertisements, and vector-based correlation techniques for finding advertisements or clusters of advertisements that correlate to content may be adapted for use with non-advertisement information (e.g., by identifying a quotation or cluster of quotations with the lowest, rather than the highest, correlation). - In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, a supplemental content display region, such as a supplemental content display region displaying a non-advertisement textual quotation, may be periodically updated with new advertisement or non-advertisement information in order to provide a more dynamic and attractive presentation in the supplemental display area, whereby content of an supplemental content display region is periodically replaced with new content. Either a “pull” (e.g., initiated by user device 145) or a “push” (e.g., initiated by advertisement service 125) operation may be performed in order to update the supplemental content display region.
-
FIG. 2 illustrates an example ofdisplay contents 200 displayed ondisplay unit 150 ofuser device 145. A number of elements are concurrently displayed as part ofdisplay contents 200. Primarycontent display area 210 displays content retrieved frommap service 135 orcontent server 140.FIG. 2 illustrates an example in which a graphical map obtained frommap service 135 is displayed within primarycontent display area 210. Those skilled in the art understand that many different types of media or content, such as, but not limited to, text, images, and video, may be displayed in primarycontent display area 210. Additionally, primarycontent display area 210 may display content which is interactive with a user making use of user device 146. Examples of such interactive content include, but are not limited to, hyperlinks, text input fields, and movable and zoomable map displays. Another primarycontent display area 230 is included in thedisplay contents 200, and may contain similar content as described for primarycontent display area 210. Primarycontent display areas 310 and 330 may also be considered to be included within a single primary content display area. -
Display contents 200 also includessupplemental display area 220. In contrast to the information obtained for and displayed in primarycontent display areas 310 and 330, the information forsupplemental display area 220 is not obtained frommap service 135 orcontent server 140. Instead,user device 145 obtains information for display insupplemental display area 220 from advertisement service 125 (although in some aspects of the disclosed subject matter,user device 145 may obtain information indirectly viamap service 135 orcontent server 140, which serve to relay such information from advertisement service 125).Supplemental display area 220 includes first supplementalcontent display region 221 and secondsupplemental display region 222.Supplemental display regions user device 145 is configured to respond to user interaction with a supplemental display region displaying advertisement information by directing the user to a further information for a product and/or service associated with the advertisement information. - Additionally,
supplemental display regions user device 145 may concurrently display ondisplay unit 150 advertisement information in firstsupplemental display region 221 and non-advertisement information in secondsupplemental display region 222, or vice versa. -
Display contents 200, as illustrated inFIG. 2 , further includes a secondsupplemental display area 240, comprising thirdsupplemental display region 241 and fourthsupplemental display region 242. - Due to limited area for
display unit 150, and depending on the size ofdisplay contents 200, not all ofdisplay contents 200 may be visible at the same time. InFIG. 2 ,display boundary 250 defines an extent of the viewable area ofdisplay contents 200, in which the portion ofdisplay contents 200 abovedisplay boundary 250 is visible. By any of a number of mechanisms well known in the art, such as a scrollbar or touch-sensitive scrolling, the portion ofdisplay contents 200 below the illustrated display boundary can also be made visible ondisplay unit 150. In some cases, only a portion of display contents might be scrollable. In some aspects of the disclosed subject matter, information for non-visible elements ofdisplay contents 200, such asdisplay area 240 located belowdisplay boundary 250, may not be retrieved and/or displayed until they are made visible indisplay unit 150. - In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, primary
content display area 210 may be used to display a map of a geographic region, provided bymap service 135, and non-advertisement information is selected from pieces of non-advertisement information identified as relevant to the region displayed in primary content display area. In this manner, interesting information is presented to users that is relevant to what they are reviewing viamap service 135. -
FIG. 3 illustrates aprocess 300 by which advertisements are displayed. Atstep 305,advertisement service 125 identifies first and second supplemental content display region for concurrent display with a primary content display area ondisplay unit 150 ofuser device 145, such as two supplemental content display regions included in a supplemental display area on a single webpage. - At
step 310,advertisement service 125 obtains an advertisement information, such as, but not limited to, a text-based advertisement. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, the obtained advertisement may instead be image, video, and/or audio-based as well. As discussed above, the obtained advertisement information may be selected based on the content obtained fromcontent server 140, such as the content of the primary content display area. - At
step 315,advertisement service 125 obtains a non-advertisement information, such as, but not limited to, a textual quotation fromquotation service 110, which selects the textual quotation fromquotation database 115. As discussed above, in some aspects of the disclosed subject matter, textual quotations may be drawn from other sources, such as an RSS or social networking feed. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, the obtained non-advertisement information may instead be image, video, and/or audio-based as well. In an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, the obtained non-advertisement is selected based on what is displayed in the primary content display area and/or in the displayed advertisement information. - At
step 320, the advertisement information obtained instep 310 is displayed byadvertisement service 125 in the first supplemental content display region ondisplay unit 150 by providing the advertising information to user device 145 (either directly or via content server 140). Atstep 325, the non-advertisement information obtained instep 315 is displayed byadvertisement service 125 in the second supplemental content display region ondisplay unit 150 by providing the non-advertisement information to user device 145 (either directly or via content server 140). As a result, the advertisement information and non-advertisement information are displayed together in a supplemental display area concurrent with the display of primary content information ondisplay unit 150 ofuser device 145. - Many of the above-described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable storage medium (also referred to as computer readable medium). When these instructions are executed by one or more processing unit(s) (e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units), they cause the processing unit(s) to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of computer readable media include, but are not limited to, CD-ROMs, flash drives, RAM chips, hard drives, EPROMs, etc. The computer readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.
- In this specification, the term “software” is meant to include firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage, which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also, in some implementations, multiple software inventions can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software inventions. In some implementations, multiple software inventions can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally, any combination of separate programs that together implement a software invention described here is within the scope of the invention. In some implementations, the software programs, when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.
- A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

FIG. 4 conceptually illustrates anelectronic system 400 with which some implementations of the subject technology are implemented. Theelectronic system 400 can be a computer, phone, PDA, or any other sort of electronic device. Such an electronic system includes various types of computer readable media and interfaces for various other types of computer readable media.Electronic system 400 includes abus 405, processing unit(s) 410, asystem memory 415, a read-only memory 420, apermanent storage device 425, aninput device interface 430, anoutput device interface 435, and anetwork interface 440. - The
bus 405 collectively represents all system, peripheral, and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices of theelectronic system 400. For instance, thebus 405 communicatively connects the processing unit(s) 410 with the read-only 420, thesystem memory 415, and thepermanent storage device 425. - From these various memory units, the processing unit(s) 410 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the invention. The processing unit(s) can be a single processor or a multi-core processor in different implementations.
- The read-only-memory (ROM) 420 stores static data and instructions that are needed by the processing unit(s) 410 and other modules of the electronic system. The
permanent storage device 425, on the other hand, is a read-and-write memory device. This device is a non-volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when theelectronic system 400 is off. Some implementations of the invention use a mass-storage device (such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive) as thepermanent storage device 425. - Other implementations use a removable storage device (such as a floppy disk, flash drive, and its corresponding disk drive) as the
permanent storage device 425. Like thepermanent storage device 425, thesystem memory 415 is a read-and-write memory device. However, unlikestorage device 425, thesystem memory 415 is a volatile read-and-write memory, such a random access memory. Thesystem memory 415 stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some implementations, the invention's processes are stored in thesystem memory 415, thepermanent storage device 425, and/or the read-only memory 420. For example, the various memory units include instructions for processing multimedia items in accordance with some implementations. From these various memory units, the processing unit(s) 410 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some implementations. - The
bus 405 also connects to the input and output device interfaces 430 and 435. Theinput device interface 430 enables the user to communicate information and select commands to the electronic system. Input devices used withinput device interface 430 include, for example, alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices (also called “cursor control devices”). Output device interfaces 435 enables, for example, the display of images generated by theelectronic system 400. Output devices used withoutput device interface 435 include, for example, printers and display devices, such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) or liquid crystal displays (LCD). Some implementations include devices such as a touchscreen that functions as both input and output devices. - Finally, as shown in
FIG. 4 ,bus 405 also coupleselectronic system 400 to a network (not shown) through anetwork interface 440. In this manner, the computer can be a part of a network of computers (such as a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), or an Intranet, or a network of networks, such as the Internet. Any or all components ofelectronic system 400 can be used in conjunction with the invention. - These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in computer software, firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be included in or packaged as mobile devices. The processes and logic flows can be performed by one or more programmable processors and by one or more programmable logic circuitry. General and special purpose computing devices and storage devices can be interconnected through communication networks.
- Some implementations include electronic components, such as microprocessors, storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium (alternatively referred to as computer-readable storage media, machine-readable media, or machine-readable storage media). Some examples of such computer-readable media include RAM, ROM, read-only compact discs (CD-ROM), recordable compact discs (CD-R), rewritable compact discs (CD-RW), read-only digital versatile discs (e.g., DVD-ROM, dual-layer DVD-ROM), a variety of recordable/rewritable DVDs (e.g., DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.), flash memory (e.g., SD cards, mini-SD cards, micro-SD cards, etc.), magnetic and/or solid state hard drives, read-only and recordable Blu-Ray® discs, ultra density optical discs, any other optical or magnetic media, and floppy disks. The computer-readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code, such as is produced by a compiler, and files including higher-level code that are executed by a computer, an electronic component, or a microprocessor using an interpreter.
- While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessor or multi-core processors that execute software, some implementations are performed by one or more integrated circuits, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In some implementations, such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.
- As used in this specification and any claims of this application, the terms “computer”, “server”, “processor”, and “memory” all refer to electronic or other technological devices. These terms exclude people or groups of people. For the purposes of the specification, the terms display or displaying means displaying on an electronic device. As used in this specification and any claims of this application, the terms “computer readable medium” and “computer readable media” are entirely restricted to tangible, physical objects that store information in a form that is readable by a computer. These terms exclude any wireless signals, wired download signals, and any other ephemeral signals.
- To provide for interaction with a user, implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some aspects of the disclosed subject matter, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.
