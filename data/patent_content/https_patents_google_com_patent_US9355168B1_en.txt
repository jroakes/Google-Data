- Other suitable types of digital content items include audio files (e.g. music, podcasts, audio books, and the like), documents, images, multimedia presentations, and so forth.
- the video hosting service 100 provides videos that have been uploaded by other users of the video hosting service 100 , or may have been provided by the video hosting service operator, or by third parties.
- Clients 170 can search for videos based on keywords or other metadata. These requests are received as queries by the front end server 140 and provided to the video serving module 110 , which is responsible for searching the video database 155 for videos that satisfy the user queries and providing the videos to the users.
- the video serving module 110 supports searching on any fielded data for a video, including its title, description, metadata, author, category and so forth.
- users can browse a list of videos based on categories such as most viewed videos, sports, animals, or automobiles. For example, the user may browse a list of videos related to cars and select which videos from the list to view.
- Video database 155 stores videos provided to clients 170 .
- Each video in one embodiment has a video identifier (id).
- Each video file has associated metadata associated that includes video ID, author, title, description, and keywords, additional metadata can be included as available.
- the metadata also includes one or more topics that are associated with the video.
- the associated topics may include topics created by a community in a collaborative knowledge base like Freebase. Alternatively, the topics may be selected from the frequently occurring topics occurring in the titles, descriptions, and user comments of the videos, for example the 100,000 most frequently occurring term unigrams or bigrams.
- each topic is associated with a topic strength TS representing the topics' degree of association with the video.
- the topic strength for a particular topic and video is based on content analysis of the video, users' comments for the video, or other metadata associated with the video.
- the topics and topic strength information can be stored in a separate database.
- the topic strength for a video is also adjusted based on the usefulness of a topic.
- the usefulness of a topic is a weight reflecting how useful is a topic to a system in representing the topic's association with the video. For example, the system operator may not prefer topics that represent racy or objectionable content and therefore the usefulness weight for such topics may be a low or a negative value.
- the usefulness of a topic is based on the frequency of topic in the corpus.
- the user access log 160 stores access data describing the user's access and interactions with videos.
- the access data indicates whether a user watched an entire video, watched a video for a particular duration, skipped a video, scrolled up or down through a web page including a video, shared a video with other users, added a video to a playlist, flagged a video, blocked a video from a playlist or a collection of videos, favorited a video, gave a video a favorable rating (e.g. liked a video using a FACEBOOKTM account or +1'd a video using a GOOGLE+TM account), gave a video an unfavorable rating (e.g. “thumbs down”).
- the user access log 160 or another entity associated with the user access log 160 provides the users with the opportunity to opt-out of having the users' access data collected and/or shared with other modules in the video hosting service 100 or other services.
- the profile repository 164 stores the user profiles.
- a user profile includes a set of topics for a user. This set of topics represents the user's interest and the list may be partly populated by receiving a number of topics from the user.
- the user profile may include the topics as a list of topics (e.g., as terms or topic identifiers), or as vector (e.g., bit map, or vector of real valued weights). Additionally, the list is populated by the user analysis module 120 .
- the topics stored in a user's profile can be used for various purposes. For example, the topics can be displayed as user's area of interest on the user's home page in a social network or a content hosting network. Additionally, the topics may be used to suggest to the user content, content channels, products, services, additional topics etc. that may be of interest to the user. The suggestions may be provided to the user on the user's home page or another web page like a “browse” page where a user may browse through various topics that may be of interest to the user.
- the topics displayed on the user's home page or browse page are selectable (for e.g. through a hyperlink).
- a user may select a topic and the selection leads the user to a web page partly or wholly dedicated to the selected topic.
- the selected topic's web page includes content related to the selected topic, like related multimedia content or textual content. Additionally, the topic's web page may include links to other related topics' web pages. These related topics may be displayed as topics related to the selected topic or recommended topics for a user visiting the selected topic's web page.
- the user analysis module 120 determines and stores a user profile based on the videos accessed by the user, and is one means for performing this function.
- FIG. 2 illustrates method executed by the user analysis module 120 for determining and storing the topics for a user profile.
- the user analysis module 120 queries the user access log 160 and determines 202 videos accessed by the user. This set of videos can be all videos accessed by the user, or just those accessed by the user within a certain time period, such as the previous thirty days.
- the user analysis module 120 analyzes the user's access data stored in the user access log 160 and determines 204 the user's interactions with the accessed videos. The user analysis module 120 also determines 204 the user's interaction strength for each accessed video based on factors like the type of user's interaction with the accessed video. The user analysis module 120 also queries the video database 155 and determines 206 , for each video accessed by the user, the topics associated with the accessed videos and the video's topic strengths indicating the video's degree of association with the topics. Based on the determined interaction strengths and topic strengths, the user analysis module 120 selects 208 and stores 210 topics in the user's profile.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the user analysis module 120 according to one embodiment.
- the user analysis module 120 comprises a user interaction module 302 , an interaction strength module 304 , a user profile module 306 and a related topics module 308 .
- the user interaction module 302 receives feedback regarding the users' interactions with videos and stores the received feedback as access data in the user access log 160 .
- a module (not shown) in the client 170 (or the service 175 ) tracks data about the user's interactions (e.g. pause, rewind, fast forward). Additional user's interactions (e.g. the user requesting a video, rating a video, sharing a video) are tracked by a module (not shown) in the video hosting service 100 or at another service like a social networking service. Regardless of where the data is tracked, the data is transmitted to the user interaction module 302 .
- the user interaction module 302 receives the transmitted data and stores the received data in the user access log 160 as access data. Examples of access data stored in access log 160 are described above.
- the user interaction module 302 repeatedly receives feedback regarding the user's interactions with various videos and updates the access data for the user based on the received feedback.
- the interaction strength module 304 analyzes the access data for a user and determines an interaction strength IS i indicating a user's degree of association with a particular video v i . To determine the IS value, the interaction strength module 304 assigns different weights to different types of user's interactions with the video. For example, a user starting a video may be assigned a weight of 0.5, a user watching at least 80% of the video may be assigned a weight of 0.75, a user giving a favorable rating for the video may be assigned a weight of 1.5, a user favoriting a video may be assigned a weight of 2.0, and a user subscribing to a channel of videos associated with the watched video or with the user who uploaded the watched video may be assigned a weight of 5.0.
- the interaction strength module 304 assigns greater weight to the user's interactions indicating a greater involvement with a video. For example, the interaction strength module 304 assigns a greater weight to a user adding a video to a playlist, or sharing a video with others, than to the user watching the video. Additionally, the interaction strength module 304 adjusts the weight for a particular interaction based on the frequency or duration of the interaction. For example, the interaction strength module 304 assign a greater weight to a user's view of a particular video if the user has viewed the video a number of times instead of just once or for a ten minute duration instead of thirty seconds. In one embodiment, the interaction strength module 304 normalizes the adjusted weights based on the total number of videos the user has interacted with, the total number of times the user has interacted with the videos, or the total amount of time the user has spent interacting with the videos.
- the interaction strength module 304 assigns negative or relatively low weights to certain interactions indicating the user's lack of interest in a particular video. For example, skipping a presented video, flagging a video, or blocking a video from a playlist may be assigned a negative weight.
- the interaction strength module 304 discounts the weight based on their age. For example, the interaction strength module 304 exponentially decays the weight associated with a user interaction based on the amount of time elapsed since the user interaction occurred. Accordingly, a user interaction that occurred recently is assigned a higher weight than a user interaction that occurred at an earlier time.
- the interaction strength module 304 determines and stores an interaction strength IS indicating the strength of the user's interactions or association with the video.
- the interaction strength is based on the assigned and adjusted weights. For example, the interaction strength is a sum or product of the assigned and adjusted weights.
- the user analysis module 120 determines for a user, the videos v i the user has interacted with (from the user access log 160 ) and the user's interaction strength IS i for each of these videos (determined by the interaction strength module 304 ). Also, as described above, the user analysis module 120 determines for each of these videos v i , topics t associated with the video (from the video database 155 ) and, for each of the associated topic t k , a topic strength TS k indicating the topic's degree of association with the video (from the video database 155 ).
- the user profile module 306 determines the set T of topics for a user profile based on a topic association strength TAS determined for each set s, where TAS j indicates the degree of association between set s j 's topics t and the user.
- TAS j indicates the degree of association between set s j 's topics t and the user.
- the user profile module 306 combines the topic strengths TS k of the set's topics t k for each of the videos v i in the set s j . Combining the topic strengths TSs may occur by adding, averaging, or applying another arithmetic or statistical function to the topic strengths TSs.
- the user profile module 306 selects a number of these sets based on the sets topic association strengths TAS j . For example, the user association module 306 may select fifty sets s with fifty highest topic association strengths TAS. The topics t k of the selected sets s form the set T topics for the user's profile.
- the user profile module 306 also stores in the user's profile the topic association strengths TAS associated with the stored topics.
- the user profile module 306 can be configured to periodically updates the stored topics in a user's profile using the process described above, based on the videos that the user interacted with since a prior update.
- the user profile module 306 receives topics that are related with the topics stored in a user profile and stores the related topics in the user profile.
- the user profile module 306 receives the related topics from the related topics module 308 .
- Related topics module 308 accesses the topics in a user's profile and determines additional topics related to the profile's topics.
- related topics module 308 can determine related topics. These include a demographic approach, a topic co-occurrence approach, and a combined demographic and topic co-occurrence approach. Additional approaches to determine related topics would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the disclosure herein. For example, related topics may also be determined based on topics' relationships specified in a knowledgebase like Freebase.
- related topics module 308 determines related topics based on the popularity of various topics in each of a number of demographic groups.
- the related topics module 308 organizes the user profiles in the profile corpus based on one or more demographic category, such as gender and age group.
- the related topics module 308 can organize the user profiles into twelve demographic groups D z of profiles based on the user's gender (male, female) and age group (e.g., 13-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54; 55+).
- the related topics module 308 determines, for each demographic group D z of user profiles, a number of most frequently occurring topics t (e.g., the top 50 most frequently occurring topics); this forms the related topic set R z for the demographic group D z . Then for a given demographic group D z , the related topics module 308 adds the related topics R z to each user profile in D z . If a topic t in R z is already present in the user profile, then it can be handled either by skipping it, or by increasing its topic association strength TAS.
- the related topics module 308 uses the co-occurrence of topics in the user profiles to determine which topics are related to each other. To determine the related topics, the related topics module 308 initially determines, across a collection of user profiles (e.g., all user profiles in the system), pairs of topics (t i , t j ) that co-occur in at least some of the user profiles in the collection, and from there determines a measure of co-occurrence for each topic pair. The determination of these co-occurring topics is described in regards to FIG. 5 below. The related topics module 308 then determines for each topic t k in the corpus, the most closely related topics t l based on the co-occurrence measure. Next, given a user profile with topics t j , the related topics module 308 adds to the user profile for each topic t j the most closely related topics t l .
- the related topics module 308 adds to the user profile for each topic t j the most closely related topics t l .
- FIG. 5 illustrates a co-occurrence matrix 500 that stores co-occurrence strengths CS i,j indicating the measure of co-occurrence of a topic t i with another topic t j .
- the illustrated co-occurrence matrix 500 is simply a graphical representation of co-occurrence strengths CSs used to aid the description of the related topics module 308 , and that the matrix 500 may be stored in various data structures like arrays, lists etc.
- the co-occurrence matrix 500 is an n ⁇ n matrix.
- Each row 502 a - n represents a topic t i and each column 504 a - n represents a topic t j .
- Each cell, like cell 508 represents the co-occurrence strength CS i,j of for the pair of topics t i and t j .
- the co-occurrence strength CS i,j for the pair of topics t i and t j may be determined as follows. As noted above, each topic t i in user profile has a topic association strength TAS i . Thus, for a pair of topics t i and t j co-occurring in a given user profile, the related topics module 308 computes a profile co-occurrence strength PCS i,j based on the topic association strengths TAS i and TAS j .
- the profile co-occurrence strength PCS i,j may be a product, sum, average, or another arithmetic or statistical function of the pair's topic association strengths TAS i and TAS j .
- the co-occurrence strength CS i,j is then the combined PCS i,j summed across all user profiles in which topics t i and t j co-occur. Each PCS i,j is then normalized by the frequency of topic t i in the profile corpus. In other embodiments, combining may include averaging, adding, or performing another arithmetic or statistical function on the profile co-occurrence strengths PCS.
- cell 508 includes the co-occurrence strength (CS) for topic T i (topic for intersecting row 502 i ) co-occurring with topic T j (topic for intersecting column 504 j ) in the profile corpus used to select topics for the co-occurrence matrix 500 .
- This co-occurrence strength (CS) is a normalized sum of topic association strengths (TASs) of T i and T j for corpus' profiles that include both these topics.
- the sum of the topic association strengths (TASs) has been normalized by the frequency of T i 's appearance in corpus' profiles.
- cell 506 includes the co-occurrence strength (CS) for topic T j co-occurring with topic T i .
- This co-occurrence strength (CS) is also a normalized sum of topic association strengths (TASs) of T i and T j , but this sum has been normalized by the frequency of T j 's, not T i 's, appearance in the corpus' profiles.
- TASs topic association strengths
- the related topics module 308 identifies for each topic t i (by row) a number of cells with the highest co-occurrence strengths CSs (e.g., 50 highest values), or the cells with co-occurrence strengths CS beyond a threshold value (e.g., CS i,j >75% of maximum CS i,j ). These cells represent the set of topics R i that are determined to be related to topic t i .
- FIG. 5 further illustrates the method employed by the related topics module 308 to select related topics for topic T j .
- cells 508 , 510 include the highest co-occurrence strengths CS i,j for topic t j (represented by row 502 j ).
- the related topics module 308 identifies these cells 506 , 508 as the cells with the highest co-occurrence strengths CS i,j and thus identifies topics t i and t n (the topics of the intersecting columns 504 i , 504 n for cells 506 , 508 ) as topics related to topic t j .
- the related profile module 308 adds the related topics R j to the user profile. If a topic t in R i is already present in the user profile, then it can be handled either by skipping it, or by increasing its topic association strength TAS.
- the related topics module 308 determines related topics for a selected user from a profile corpus of users that are in same demographic group as the selected user. To determine these related topics, the related topics module 308 constructs for each demographic group D z a co-occurrence matrix 500 from a set of user profiles belonging to that group. Then for each demographic group D z , the related topics module 308 determines the related topics R z,i for each topic, in that that group's co-occurrence matrix.
- the related topics module 308 automatically adds related topics to each user's profile.
- the related topics module 308 can be configured to enable users to selectively add related topics to their individual user profiles.
- the users may add topics, including related topics, to their own profiles through an interface such as the one illustrated in FIG. 4 .
- the interface in FIG. 4 includes a profile topics column 406 and a related topics column 410 .
- the profile topics column 406 includes the topics 412 associated with a user's profile based on the analysis of the user's interactions with videos.
- the related topics column 410 is updated to include topics 422 a - n related to the selected topics 412 .
- the related topics 422 a - n are determined by the related topics module 308 and presented to the user in the related topics column 410 .
- the user may select one or more related topics 422 a - n , and in response to such selection, these topics are added to the user's profiles.
- the user profile module 306 also determines and stores with the additional topics their topic association strengths TASs.
- Certain aspects of the present invention include process steps and instructions described herein in the form of an algorithm. It should be noted that the process steps and instructions of the present invention could be embodied in software, firmware or hardware, and when embodied in software, could be downloaded to reside on and be operated from different platforms used by real time network operating systems.
- the present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein.
- This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.
- a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, DVDs, CD-ROMs, magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.
- the computers referred to in the specification may include a single processor or may be architectures employing multiple processor designs for increased computing capability.
