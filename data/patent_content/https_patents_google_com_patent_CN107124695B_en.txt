In other examples, the user may effectively designate contact and location tags as being associated with the visited location. In other examples, if not listed in the user's contact list but the system has knowledge of the location visited by the user, the visited location may be labeled as appropriate and the corresponding contact in the user's contact list may be updated to include the visited location.
Description
Description of the cases
The application belongs to divisional application of Chinese patent application 201380033076.8 with application date of 2013, 06, 21.
Background
Mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, have opened a variety of new services that can be provided to users. One very popular and growing category of these new services involves location tracking and awareness. The geographic location of the mobile device may be determined using any of several techniques for determining location, including by reference to cellular network towers, Wi-Fi access point locations, or by using data from a Global Positioning System (GPS) component. An example application that utilizes location tracking and awareness includes all content from locations reported to social interactions based on location.
A common problem faced by many of these new services is the relationship of geographic location (e.g., latitude and longitude on earth) to the associated location tag (e.g., home, work, etc.). Existing techniques and systems for addressing this problem are limited to searching for listed business or other public locations. Using incomplete data to establish relevant and meaningful labels for geographic locations can degrade the quality of information presented to users, thereby degrading their experience with location tracking or location-aware services.

Detailed Description
Systems and techniques disclosed herein provide the ability to determine a location visited by a user and associate a relevant location tag with the visited location based on contact information. The use of contact information associated with a user (e.g., addresses stored in the user's contact list for each contact) allows relevant tags for visited locations to be provided in accordance with the systems and techniques of this disclosure when the visited locations are not available through a local search query or other common information source. In some examples, the location tag may be applied based on a match between the location being accessed and information stored in the user's contact list. In other examples, the user may effectively specify the contacts and location tags to be associated with the visited location. In other examples, if the location visited by the user is not listed in the user's contact list, but is otherwise known, the visited location may be labeled as appropriate, and the corresponding contact in the user's contact list may be updated to include the visited location.
Certain examples are now described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the systems and techniques disclosed herein. Examples are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those skilled in the art will understand that the systems and techniques specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting examples and that the scope of the present disclosure is defined solely by the claims. Features illustrated or described in connection with one example may be combined with features of other examples. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present disclosure.
The location of the user may be inferred based on the location of the user's mobile device. Location information may be stored at various time intervals to provide a location history for the device and the user. The location history may be stored in a cache or other memory on the mobile device, or it may be sent to a server over the mobile network and stored in a data store. The user may be provided with the following opportunities: control whether programs or features, e.g., executed by a computing device associated with or used by a user, collect user information (e.g., information about the user's location or other information, such as information about the user's contacts, social network connections, social behaviors or activities, preferences, etc.); and/or controlling whether and/or how to receive content from the content server based on the collected information. Additionally, some data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is not determinable for the user, or the geographic location of the user where location information (such as a city, ZIP code, or state rating) is obtained may be generalized so that the specific location of the user cannot be determined. In these ways, the user may have control over how information is collected and used by the content server.
Fig. 1 illustrates an example of a mobile network 100 for providing location-based services. In the illustrated example, the mobile network 100 includes a communication network 110 and a mobile device 120. The mobile device 120 may connect to the communication network 110 via various access points 130. Although one mobile device 120 and one access point 130 are illustrated for purposes of example, a mobile network may include any number of mobile devices and access points.
The mobile device 120 may be any device configured to exchange data over a mobile network. For example, the mobile network 100 may be a GSM, TDMA, or CDMA technology-enabled network, or any other form of wireless network, such as an IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, or other Wi-Fi network, or a combination of wired and wireless networks. The access point 130 may be a form of radio receiver or transmitter that provides a gateway between the mobile device 120 and the communication network 110. For example, the access point may be a wireless router or a cellular network tower. In some examples, the mobile device 120 may also receive GPS signals transmitted from GPS satellites 140.
In the example shown, the mobile network 100 also includes a location server 150, and the location server 150 may exchange data with the mobile device 120 via the communication network 110. Location server 150 may include, for example, a digital data processor 160, digital data processor 160 being communicatively coupled with a digital database storage 170, digital database storage 170 being, for example, a database or other memory or storage unit capable of storing digital data.
An example technique 200 for collecting location information and determining a location visited by a user is illustrated in fig. 2. The technique 200 may include obtaining location history data, or it may include operating on pre-existing location history data. As shown in fig. 2, the technique 200 begins at step 210, where location history data is collected. For example, the location history data may be generated by a mobile device, such as mobile device 120 of fig. 1, and transmitted to location server 150 over mobile network 100 via access point 130 and communication network 110. Location server 150 may also collect location history data, for example, when a user "logs in" at a location using any number of social applications that provide the posting.
The following opportunities may be provided to the user, for example, by the mobile device 120: control whether programs or features executed, for example, by the mobile device 120 collect user information (e.g., location history data or other information, such as information about the user's contacts, social network connections, social behaviors or activities, preferences, etc.); and/or control whether and/or how to receive content from a content server (e.g., location server 150) based on the collected information. Additionally, some data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is not determinable for the user, or the geographic location of the user where location history information (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level) is obtained may be generalized so that the specific location of the user cannot be determined. In these ways, the user may have control over how information is collected and used by the content server.
The mobile device may acquire location history data using any of several techniques for determining location. For example, a mobile device may use a GPS receiver to acquire location data. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides position and time information for any location on or near the earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. The system is freely accessible by anyone with a GPS receiver, and many smart phones and other mobile devices include a GPS receiver. Other techniques, such as proximity to a cellular tower (or other mobile network access point) of known location or triangulation between a mobile device and a plurality of such towers, may also be used to determine location data.
In some examples, the location history data may be obtained by the mobile device and stored locally in memory on the device. In some examples, the location history data may be processed on the mobile device using a processor on the device. In other examples, location history data may be transmitted to a location server for processing. For example, location history data may be retrieved and sent directly to a location server. In some examples, the location history data may be stored on the mobile device and transmitted to the location server at predetermined intervals. For example, location history data acquired during a time period, such as a day, week, month, etc., may be stored on the mobile device and transmitted to the location server at the end of that time period. In some examples, location history data may be acquired and stored on the mobile device until certain conditions are met, such as access to a wireless network, and then transmitted to a location server. In some examples, the location history data may be stored on a location server, such as in digital database store 170 of fig. 1, until data covering multiple days has been received. The location history data may include historical location data as well as current location data.
The mobile device may acquire location history data at various intervals. In some examples, the mobile device may acquire location history data at regular intervals during the day. For example, the location history data may be acquired several times per minute, once per hour, once every two hours, or at any other time interval. To establish a location history that is more conducive to the techniques described herein, more frequent location sampling may be better than using a long interval between location data acquisitions.
The location history data may be expressed in a variety of ways. As shown in fig. 3, the location history data may be in the form of information representing a geographic location and a point in time, such as latitude 310, longitude 312, date 314, and time 316. The location history data may also include a precision radius 318 that represents an estimate of the precision of that location data point. The radius of accuracy may range from a few meters to several kilometers based on the type of location data. For example, GPS location data may have a radius of accuracy of several meters, while cellular network tower location data may have a radius of accuracy of several kilometers.
The location history data may be processed to reduce the plurality of data points to a list of locations visited by the user, as shown at step 212 in fig. 2. In some examples, location server 150 may process location history data. Location server 150 may process and analyze the location history data in a variety of ways. For example, raw geographic location history data (such as that shown in FIG. 3) may be processed to produce "visited location" geographic data. For example, the location history data can be processed to correlate raw location history data with visited locations by computing a centroid of nearby location history data points of a cluster. A cluster of location history data points can be defined as a set of location history data points that are physically close to each other, and a centroid can be defined as the geographic center of a cluster of such data points. This may be referred to as distance-based clustering. In addition, the date and time can be used to further filter the location history data and generate clusters of data points that are close in both space and time. For example, for a plurality of data points collected during a period of time during, for example, night when the user is expected to be at home, there may be data points corresponding to different locations within the user's house such as the kitchen, bedroom, living room, etc. The location history data for this time period may show small changes in latitude and longitude, but is relevant to a single place, home. Thus, such points that are geographically close over time may be viewed as clusters representing a single place. Clustering by determining a centroid between slightly different locations may provide a single geographic location that represents the location visited and may be associated with the time span spent therein (e.g., the time spanned from the first to last location historical data points in the cluster). In addition, clustering may help reduce variations in location history data caused by inaccuracies in the location data set (e.g., errors in location acquisition from a GPS or other source).
In addition to determining the centroid as a single geo-location representing the visited location, other processing may include reverse geocode lookup to obtain information about the location, such as an address or business name. For example, a process known as geocoding or reverse geocoding may be used to convert location data from geographic coordinates to a human-readable address. Address encoding refers to the following processing: therein, a human-readable address such as 1600 Amphithheade park, Mountain View, CA may be converted to location data in geographic coordinates, e.g., latitude 37.423021 and longitude-122.083739. Reverse geocoding refers to reverse processing, i.e., converting geographic coordinates to an address. Such information may be stored with the location history data. Alternatively, these processes may be used to reverse geocode the original location history data points and thereby form clusters — for example, by clustering location history data points associated with a single address. This may be referred to as address-based clustering.
The data represented by the clustering process described above may take the form of longitude, latitude, start time, and end time, where the longitude and latitude are with respect to the centroid and the start and end times represent the time span over which the user exists in a particular place. The location history data for a cluster may also include a radius, which may reflect inaccuracies in location measurements, movement of people within the cluster, or both. In addition, the data may reflect multiple visits to the same place within the user's location history data. In such an example, the data may include a vector of access times, each access time including a start time and an end time pair.
The technique step 212 of determining the location visited by the user may also include conducting a local search using a geographic location from the user's location history data, such as a centroid calculated from the original location history data points. In some examples, the geographic location may include at least a location and a time. In some examples, the geographic location may also include a radius or a distance to the location. The radius may be derived from accuracy information related to the technique of obtaining the geographic location, or it may be based on changes in location within the cluster. Alternatively, a preselected value for the radius may be used. The purpose of conducting a local search is to return destinations that are close to the geographic location. Typically, the destination is a business, address, or other mappable feature that may represent a location that may have been visited by the user.
The local search may be conducted on a local search engine. A local search engine is a search engine that attempts to return a list of businesses and/or related web pages within a particular geographic area. For local searches, a user may enter a search query and specify a geographic area in proximity to which the search query is to be executed. The local search engine may return relevant results to the user, such as a list of businesses in the geographic area and/or relevant web pages relevant to the geographic area.
In some examples, the local search may be conducted by: a local search engine is invoked with the geographic location from the user's location history data and the radius within which the search is to be performed. For example, a local search may be made for latitude and longitude along with a radius such as 200 meters. The latitude and longitude are typically points or centroids of clusters from the user's location history data. The radius may be calculated as described above, or it may be preselected, for example 200 meters. A radius of 200 meters may be beneficial if the expected accuracy in the location history data is about 100 meters. In this way, it can be assured that the user's actual destination is within the area searched as part of the local search. In addition, the local search may include a limit N on the number of destinations from the region that are returned. For example, specifying N-10 may limit the number of results within 200 meters to 10.
However, the results returned by a local search may be of low quality for some types of destinations. Search results returned by local searches are typically limited to businesses, tourist attractions and other information available from public lists. If the user visits a friend, for example, at his or her home, the friend's home may not be generated as a result of the local search. In such a case, reverse geocoding may be used to supply a street address as opposed to a latitude/longitude location. While street addresses may be more relevant than latitude/longitude locations, any one location format may be particularly relevant and/or desired by its user. Different types of location tags, such as "Bob's home," may be more desirable and/or contextually relevant to a user when viewing, accessing, analyzing, or connecting his or her visited location.
Systems and techniques are described herein for associating relevant location tags with visited locations based on contact information associated with a user. In some examples shown in fig. 4, techniques 400 are provided for associating location tags with visited locations. Initially, the collected location data is analyzed to determine one or more visited locations, as described above and shown in FIG. 2. Upon determination of the visited location, technique step 410 may include a search of the user's contact list to determine if the visited location matches location information stored in the contact list.
FIG. 5 illustrates an example of data that may be contained within a user's contact list. The contact list may include one or more entries, where each entry corresponds to an individual, group, company, organization, and the like. The contact list may include any number of data fields associated with each contact list entry. Fig. 5 illustrates several example fields in a tabular format, including a first name 510, a last name 512, an email address 514, a telephone number 516, and a home address including a street address 518, a city 520, a state 522, and a zip code 524. Each contact list entry may have additional fields associated with it, including any number of addresses. Each address may include contact location information such as numbers, street names, cities, states, and zip codes, as well as contact location labels such as "home", "work", and the like. In this way, a user may store any number of addresses in their contact list associated with tags that provide additional context for the addresses.
Searching the user's contact list to determine whether the location visited by the user corresponds to a location stored in the user's contact list may be performed in a variety of ways. The techniques for determining whether two locations match may be similar to those described above in relation to the local search query. In some examples, the location accessed may be expressed in terms of an address and a radius of precision. In such an example, the user's contact list may be searched by determining whether the same address (e.g., the same address number, street, city, state, and zip code) exists within the contact list. If a partial match is found (e.g., a different number on the same street in the same city, etc.), a distance calculation may be made between the address of the visited location and the partial match address to determine if the partial match is within the precision radius. If so, the partial match may be used as the matching address. If more than one partial match is located within the precision radius, the user may be presented with two possible matches. The match may be presented in the form of a street address, or may be presented in the form of a contact name (e.g., "bob") and a location tag (e.g., "home") associated with each street address that matches in the user's contact list. The user may then be prompted to select the correct address or contact associated with the visited location.
In another example, the matching may be done based on geographic location rather than postal address. In such an example, the geographic location (e.g., latitude, longitude, and radius of precision) may be compared to a geocoded location of an address stored in the user's contact list (e.g., latitude and longitude for each address entry shown in fig. 5). Distance calculations may be performed to determine whether the location of an address in the user's contact list is within a precision radius of the location of the visited location. If so, the associated address or contact name and location tag of the matching location may be used as the matching address. If more than one entry from the contact list is within the precision radius of the accessed location, the user may be prompted to select the correct contact for the accessed location, as described above.
If a matching address or location is found, the technique 400 may include associating the accessed location with matching contact information from the user's contact list, as shown at step 412 in FIG. 4. Associating the location to be visited with the matching contact information may include, for example, associating a contact name (e.g., "bob") and a location tag (e.g., "home") for the address to be matched with the location to be visited. In such an example, when a user views or interacts with their location history data through any number of applications and/or interfaces, the visited location may be presented as, for example, "Bob's home," rather than a latitude/longitude location or reverse geocoded address data. Such a presentation may be beneficial because the contact-based tag for the visited location (e.g., "Bob's home") may be more contextually relevant to the user than the geographic location or street address.
Alternatively or in addition to the contact list search described above, the technique 400 may include searching one or more other information sources associated with the user. For example, the technique 400 may include the processor searching for one or more emails associated with the user (e.g., emails stored in the user's inbox or mail system). The one or more emails may contain location information associated with contact information that is not present in the user's contact list. One example is an email footer, where a sender often includes contact information at the end of an email, including an address or other location information. The information included in a typical email footer may equate to a comprehensive contact list entry for the sender, particularly when combined with the sender's known name and email address. Thus, techniques and systems consistent with the present disclosure may include searching one or more emails to determine whether the visited location corresponds to location information contained in the one or more emails. If matching information is found, the visited location may be labeled with the name of the email sender and, if present, a location label assigned by the sender (e.g., "office," "home," etc.). Also, in some examples, the technique 400 may include establishing or updating a contact list of the user to include an entry for the sender along with an address or location of the location being accessed.
In another example, techniques are provided for quickly associating an address or location of a visited location with a contact list entry. An example technique 600 for doing so is illustrated in fig. 6. Initially, the collected location data may be analyzed to determine one or more visited locations as shown in FIG. 2. After determining the visited location, the technique 600 may include a step 610 of presenting the visited location to the user. The visited location may be presented as, for example, a latitude/longitude location, a reverse geocoded address, or both. Additionally, in some examples, the accessed location, which is a latitude/longitude location or reverse geocoded address, may be presented to the user only after the technique shown in fig. 4 has not been successfully utilized to determine whether a more contextually relevant location tag is available (i.e., to determine that the accessed location has not been stored in the user's contact list associated with any contacts). The visited locations may be presented using a number of different devices and user interfaces including, for example, a location history viewing interface presented on the user's computer or mobile device.
The technique may further include receiving a designation of a contact and a location tag from the user, as shown in step 612. In one example, a user may be provided with a list of contacts from their contact list and may select an appropriate contact associated with the visited location. The user may also be prompted to select or enter an associated location tag (e.g., "home," "work," etc.). Upon receiving such a designation from the user, the technique can include a step 614 of associating the visited location with a contact and location tag designated by the user. Associating the visited location with the contact may include, for example, updating a contact list entry for the contact to include the location of the visited location and/or the reverse geocoded address along with the specified location tag (i.e., the user's contact list may be updated to include the visited location under the specified tag). In so doing, the contact name and location tag may be utilized in future interactions with the user regarding the visited location.
In another example shown in fig. 7, techniques 700 are provided for associating contact tags with locations visited by a first user that may utilize information known from systems interacting with other users. As described above, location data may be initially collected from a first user (e.g., using a mobile device associated with the user) and analyzed to determine one or more visited locations, as shown in fig. 2. After determining the location to be accessed, technique 700 may include step 710: it is determined whether the location visited by the first user is associated with a second user. The visited location may be associated with the second user if, for example, the second user has provided a tag for the location and/or address of the visited location (e.g., the second user has labeled the location and/or address of the visited location as "home"). If the visited location is associated with a second user, the technique may further include updating a contact list entry for the second user in a contact list associated with the first user to include the location of the visited location and the location tag of the second user, as shown in step 712.
For example, location server 150 may determine that the first user visited the location, and that the location and/or address of the visited location does not match any locations or addresses stored in the first user's contact list (e.g., using the techniques shown in fig. 4). In such a case, location server 150 may determine whether the visited location is associated with a second user. This can be done, for example, by: the matching location and/or address processed by location server 150 is searched for one or more other users, although any access and search on the data of multiple users must be made according to accepted terms of use and privacy policies. If a matching location is found (e.g., the second user "Shali" has marked the visited location as "home"), the contact list entry for the second user in the first user's contact list may be updated to include the location and/or address of the visited location along with an associated location label (e.g., "Shali home"). Alternatively, if no contact list entry exists for the second user, updating the contact list of the first user may include establishing a new entry for the second user.
The first user's contact list may be automatically updated in some examples to include information known through interaction with other users. However, in other examples, the technique may include prompting the user for permission to update, create, or edit the contact list entry for the second user. In other examples, contact names and location tags from the second user may be utilized when presenting location history information to the first user, and contact list entries for the second user may be established or updated only upon selection by the first user. In such an example, for example, the first user may be presented with an interface showing their location history, and the interface may present the visited locations using names and location tags obtained from the second user. The interface may alert the first user to the fact that information is being obtained from the second user, and may prompt the first user to add a location and/or address, a location tag, and a contact name to their contact list (again, by updating an existing entry or building a new entry if not present).
Examples described herein provide systems and techniques for determining a location visited by a user based on contact information and associating a related tag with the location. In general, the systems and techniques described here can determine one or more locations visited by a user based on location history data collected for the user (e.g., by collecting location information from a mobile device associated with the user). The systems and techniques may further determine whether the location visited by the user corresponds to an entry in the user's contact list (e.g., an address associated with a contact in the contact list) or whether the contact is known by some other means (e.g., provided by the user or known by the system from interaction with another user). In the case of a known contact, a relevant tag (e.g., "John's home") may be applied to the visited location. Additionally, if the accessed location associated with the contact has not been previously stored in the contact list, the user's contact list may be updated to include the accessed location.
More specifically, in a first aspect, there is provided a technique for annotating a location visited by a user using a computer processor, comprising: location history data for the user is collected and stored in a data store. The technique further includes: the accessed location is determined from the location history data by a processor in communication with the data store. The technique also includes: searching, by the processor, for contact location information corresponding to the visited location for a contact list associated with the user; and associating, by the processor, the accessed location with a contact location tag corresponding to the matching contact location information.
The systems and techniques described here can have a number of variations and additional features. For example, in some examples, searching a contact list associated with a user may include: a recent match between the accessed location and one or more addresses stored in the contact list is detected.
In other examples, collecting the location history data for the user may include: location history data is received from a mobile device associated with the user. In some examples, the location history data may include information representing one or more dates, times, and geographic locations.
In other examples, determining one or more locations visited by the user may include: clustering a plurality of geographic locations from the location history data. In some examples, the cluster may return a central geographic location and a precision radius representing a centroid of multiple geographic locations from the location history data.
The one or more geographical locations included in or derived from the location history data may be in the form of latitude and longitude locations. In some examples, determining the location visited by the user may include: one or more geographic locations derived from the location history data are reverse geocoded.
In some examples, the techniques may include: other information sources associated with the user are searched in addition to the contact list associated with the user. For example, in some examples, the techniques may include: one or more emails associated with the user are searched by the processor to detect contact location information corresponding to the visited location. This may be beneficial if, for example, the user does not have an address for a contact stored in his contact list, but has an email from the contact that contains the address (e.g., in the page corner of the email from the contact). In such an example, a location tag associated with the contact may be applied to the visited location, and the user's contact list may be updated to include the location information in the entry for the contact.
In another aspect, a technique for associating location information with a contact using a computer processor is provided that includes: location history data for the user is collected and stored in a data store. The technique further includes: the accessed location is determined from the location history data by a processor in communication with the data store. The technique also includes: receiving a designation of a contact and a location tag from the user; and associating, by the processor, the accessed location with the contact and the location tag. In some examples, associating the visited location with the contact and location tag may include: the contact list entry for the contact is updated to include the visited location and the location tag.
In another aspect, techniques are provided for associating location information with a contact using a computer processor, including: collecting location history data for the first user and storing the location history data in a data store; and determining, by a processor in communication with the data store, a location visited by the first user from the location history data. The technique also includes: determining, by the processor, whether the location visited by the first user is associated with a second user. The technique further includes: updating, by the processor, a contact list entry for the second user in a contact list associated with the first user to include the accessed location if the accessed location is associated with the second user.
In some examples, updating the contact list entry may include: the visited location is associated with a location tag derived from the second user. In doing so, the location may be labeled and associated with the contact name as long as it is known by the system, although the following are the cases: the contact list for the first user may not include the visited location or, in some cases, even an entry for the second user. In some examples, updating the contact list entry may include: before doing so, the first user is prompted to allow editing of the contact list entry for the second user (or, if not already present, to create a contact list entry for the second user).
