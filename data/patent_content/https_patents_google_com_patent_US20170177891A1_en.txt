-
FIG. 1 shows amethod 100 of processing requests for content selected by a child account that is linked to a parent account according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. Atoperation 102, a server (e.g.,server 13 and/orremote platform 17 shown inFIG. 6 , and/orprocessing unit 14 and/oranalysis system 5 shown inFIG. 7 , and discussed in detail below), may link a child account to a parent account in a memory device of the server, where the parent account includes payment information. Payment information may include, for example, bank account information, credit card information, debit account information, and/or any other suitable payment account information. A device may be a smart phone, smart watch, tablet, wearable computing device, or the like, such asdevice FIG. 5 and discussed below, as well as shown inFIGS. 2-4, 6, and 7 and discussed below. In some embodiments, the child account may be associated with a first device, and the parent account may be associated with a second device. In some embodiments, a single device may be linked to both the parent account and the child account. - A parent account may be created so as to include payment information, and may be registered with the server, and a child account may be subsequently created and linked to the parent account. The parent account may be an account of a parent and/or guardian (e.g., legal guardian, teacher, school administrator, or the like). One of more child accounts can be associated with a parent account. For example, a parent may have children with different ages, and each of the child accounts may be associated with the parent account. In some embodiments, risk tolerances may be independently set for each of the child accounts associated with the parent account, as discussed in detail below. Alternatively, settings for risk tolerance can be set and applied to all of and/or a select number of the child accounts.
- A risk tolerance may be set, for example, in a memory device of the server (e.g.,
server 13 shown inFIG. 6 , and/orremote service 11 and/orprocessing unit 14 shown inFIG. 7 ), for media content and/or an application selected via the child account atoperation 104. In some embodiments, such as those discussed below in connection withFIG. 2 , a risk tolerance may be set according to a content type.FIG. 2 shows adevice FIGS. 5-7 , which may be associated with a parent account and may include auser interface 200 to receive selections from a parent user. Selections received via theuser interface 200 may be provided to the server, and associated with the parent account and/or one or more child accounts. - The
user interface 200 shown inFIG. 2 may includeoptions user interface 200 shown inFIG. 2 may receive a selection ofoption 210 from a parent to change a child account (e.g., if there are a plurality of child accounts associated with the parent account). Upon selection of the child account viaoption 210, the parent may set approvals for the selected child account via theuser interface 200, as discussed below. - The
user interface 200 may receive a selection ofoption 220 to set approval for a content type. For example, a selected media content and/or an application may be a book that is rated as educational may have a lower risk score than non-educational books (e.g., comic books). In another example, the selected media content and/or an application that may be age appropriate for the child associated with the child account may have a lower risk score than media content and/or an application having an age range that is higher than that of the child of the child account. In yet another example, when the genre is a video game, the parent may select and/or set this type of content as being higher risk content. - In some embodiments, the risk tolerance may be set according to a content rating by selecting an
option 230 to set approvals for content rating from theuser interface 200. For example, by selectingoption 230, the parent and/or guardian may allow purchases of media content and/or an application for kids aged 5-8, but no media content and/or an application for children who are 9 or older, if the child is 8 years old. The parent and/or guardian may also set a risk tolerance according to an educational value of the media content and/or application by selectingoption 240 to set approvals for educational content value from theuser interface 200. For example, by selectingoption 240, the risk tolerance may be set according to whether the selected media content and/or application is a textbook, as opposed to a comic book. - In some embodiments, the risk tolerance may be set according to a set frequency of purchases by selecting
option 250 to set approvals for frequency of purchase. For example, the risk tolerance may be adjusted to accept or decline back-to-back-to-back purchases of similar media content and/or an application. The risk tolerance may also be adjusted according to a cost of purchases by selectingoption 260 to set approvals for cost of purchases withuser interface 200. In some embodiments, the cost may be associated with the type of media content and/or application. For example, the risk tolerance may be adjusted to that $0.99 books may be auto-approved, but an in-application purchase for $100 of credit for a particular game would require parental approval. - In some embodiments, a risk tolerance may be set according to a genre or intent by selecting
option 270 to set approvals for educational content value. For example, a risk tolerance may be set such that all applications (i.e., selected media content and/or application) that allow child to contact non-family members may be escalated to the parent (e.g., to be approved by the parent) for a child account of a child that is at or below a predetermined age (e.g., children under 13 years old). - In some embodiments, a risk tolerance may be set by selecting
option 280 ofuser interface 200 to set a percentage of an allocated allowance for the child account with the set allowance value. For example, the risk tolerance may be set by the parent so that if a cost of a selected media content and/or an application is greater than a pre-determined percentage of the allowance, the selected media content and/or application is to be approved by the parent. - As shown in
FIG. 1 , a selection may be received, at the server, for media content and/or an application via the child account atoperation 106.FIG. 3 shows adevice user interface 300, which may be associated with the child account. Alternatively, in some embodiments, thedevice user interface 300 may be associated with at least one of the child account and the parent account. - The
user interface 300 may receive a selection (e.g., from a child) for media content and/or an application. For example, theuser interface 300 may include media content and/or application selections for anaudio item 302, avideo item 304, anapplication 306, and/or a book orarticle 308. Theaudio item selection 302 may receive a request for media content for one or more songs, an album, an audio book, a podcast, or the like. Theuser interface 300 may receive a selection for thevideo item 304, which may be a request for a movie, television show, documentary, educational video, and/or any other suitable video content. Theuser interface 300 may receive a selection for theapplication 306, which may be a request for a software application for thedevice user interface 300 may receive a selection for a book orarticle 308, which may be a request to download, view, and/or purchase a book, an article, and/or any other suitable text document. - When a request for media content and/or application has been made at
operation 106 ofFIG. 1 , a risk basis value of the selected media content and/or application for the child account may be identified at the server atoperation 108. According to the selection of the media content and/or application and the risk tolerance for media content and/or application that is set by the parent account as described above in connection withFIG. 2 , the server may determine a risk basis value. In some embodiments, the risk basis value may be a numerical value that is determined by, for example, the server based on at least one of a rating, age range, media content type and/or application content type, and/or cost of the selected media content and/or application, and/or the child account initiating the request. For example, the server may determine the numerical value based on the rating, the age range, the media content type, and/or cost of the selected media content. The server may assign the determined numerical value to be the risk basis value, and the server may compare the risk basis value with a risk tolerance to determine whether to pre-approve the requested media item. - The risk basis value may determine whether the media content and/or application request from the child account may be auto-approved by the parent account (e.g., according to one or more settings received by the parent account), whether the request may need parental approval, and/or whether the media content and/or application request is auto-denied by the parent account. For example, when the risk basis value is equal to or less than the set risk tolerance, the selected media content and/or application may be auto-approved by the patent account. When the risk basis value is, for example, within a predetermined range that is greater than the set risk tolerance, the request for the media content and/or the application may need parental approval via the parent account. When the risk basis value is, for example, greater than the predetermined range that is greater than the set risk tolerance, the request for the media content and/or the application may be auto-denied by the parent account.
- At
operation 110, the selected media content and/or application for the child account may be approved, at the server, when the identified risk basis value of the media content and/or application is equal to or less than the set risk tolerance. - The parent account may be notified of the received selection of media content and/or an application from the child account at
operation 112.FIG. 4A shows an example of adevice user interface 400 of thedevice notification 405 of a media content and/or an application request from a child account. In some embodiments, the notification may include identifying information for the child and/or child account associated with the request. For example, when there are a plurality of child accounts associated with a parent account, thenotification 405 may provide identifying information of the child account making the media content and/or the application request. Theuser interface 400 may include adescription 410 of the requested media content and/or application. For example, thedescription 410 may describe the audio item, video item, application, book, and/or article requested by the child account to download, purchase, and/or view. The information may include title, author, artist, rating (e.g., rating by other users and/or critics, level of adult content rating, etc.), length (e.g., number of pages, time length, etc.), educational content level (e.g., grade level), age range, cost, or the like. When the selected media content and/or application is not auto-approved by the parent account according to the approval settings received byuser interface 200 ofFIG. 2 , the parent user of the parent account may select approve 420 or decline 430, to respectively approve or decline the requested media content and/or application request according to thedescription 410. - At
operation 114 shown inFIG. 1 , the approved selected media content and/or application may be transmitted from the server to a device associated with the child account. As shown inFIG. 4B , thedevice user interface 450, which may provide anotification 455 that the requested media content and/or application has been approved by the parent account. Theuser interface 450 may include adescription 460 of the requested media content and/or applications that has been approved. The child user may select user interface item 470 to download, purchase, and/or view the approved media content and/or application. - In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users (e.g., in connection with the parent account and/or child account, discussed above), or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity (e.g., a child's identity) may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
