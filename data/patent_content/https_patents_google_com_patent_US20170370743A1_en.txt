- the first and second records can be instantiated as first and second rows in a first data table.
- the first and second status update information is found in two different rows of a second data table.
- the rows of the second data table can each reference a respective one of the first and second rows in the first data table.
- the one or more data processors can be programmed to display the more recent status update on a display screen in a social interaction record that includes a visual indicium characterizing a social interaction event with the individual that has already occurred.
- the social interaction record can include one or more visual indicia representing multiple modes by which a future, outgoing social interaction events with the individual can occur.
- the display screen can be a touch screen.
- the visual indicia representing multiple modes can be interactive elements displayed on the touch screen.
- the one or more data processors can be programmed to detect user interaction with a selected one of the visual indicia representing multiple modes and trigger the outgoing social interaction represented by the selected one of the visual indicia in response to the user interaction.
- An application may provide access to communication with a user's acquaintances through a variety of communication modes, including by social networking sites.
- a user's contact list may be displayed on a mobile device in alphabetical order.
- a control bar can be generated that shows each of the mechanisms by which the acquaintance can be communicated with.
- the user of the device may then select an icon for one of the modes to begin communicating immediately via that mode. For example, pressing the telephone icon can cause the acquaintance's telephone number to be dialed, while pressing a social networking icon can cause a text box to be presented so that one can write on the other user's wall.
- Other manipulation of the input control can cause recent communications by the particular mode of communication to be displayed. For example, long pressing on a social networking icon can cause the last five posts to the acquaintances wall to be display for the user.
- the interface may also be genericized, so that any image of acquaintances can be an object that exhibits the behavior shown here. Thus, for example, whenever a user sees a photo of an acquaintance, the user will know that he or she can quickly access modes of communicating with that acquaintance.
- Data for such an application may be provided via a standard and public API.
- the user's device may make requests to data sources internal to the device (e.g., contact information) and to services outside the device (e.g., social networks), which may then return information according to the pre-determined requests.
- data sources internal to the device e.g., contact information
- services outside the device e.g., social networks
- Such services may also authenticate a user before providing the user with certain forms of information.

- the user with whom device 105 is associated can establish a peer-to-peer wireless link with the user with whom device 135 is associated. These users can, e.g., text one another or send photos to one another.
- Server-mediated social interaction allows users to exchange messages, photos, or other media with a server data processing device mediating the exchange.
- the illustrated implementation of system 100 includes four different examples of servers that can mediate such social interaction, namely, an electronic mail server 155 , a social network server 160 , a text message server 165 , and a photo server 170 .
- Each of social interaction servers 155 , 160 , 165 , 170 includes one or more data processors that are programmed to perform data processing activities that mediate social interaction.

- Text message server 165 is programmed to allow a user to exchange text messages with other users.
- Photo server 170 is programmed to allow a user to access a collection of one or more photographs posted to photo server 170 by other individuals. In some implementations, photo server 170 may restrict a user to accessing photographs posted by other individuals who have somehow approved the user's access.
- social interaction events provided by system 100 can be classified as either “outgoing” or “incoming.”
- outgoing social interaction events include, e.g., outgoing phone calls and text messages, e-mail messages sent to other users, photographs posted to photo server 170 , comments posted on a social network hosted by social network server 160 , posts to message boards, comments on blog or other pages, and the like.

- FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of one implementation of a social interaction hub 200 displayed on mobile device 105 .
- Social interaction hub 200 is displayed on all or a portion of display screen 195 and includes a collection of social interaction records 205 , 210 , 215 , 220 .
- Each social interaction record 205 , 210 , 215 , 220 is a graphical element that includes indicia characterizing a social interaction event that has already occurred as well as indicia characterizing multiple modes by which a future, outgoing social interaction event can occur.
- the future outgoing social interaction event will be related to the past social interaction event in that information will be exchanged between the same users.
- social interaction records 205 , 210 , 215 , 220 are arranged chronologically, e.g., in the vertically downward direction in the order in which they occurred regardless of the nature of the social interaction that they characterize.
- the outgoing telephone call event characterized in social interaction record 205 occurred before the electronic mail event characterized in social interaction record 210 .
- the events characterized in both records 205 , 210 occurred before the social network event characterized in social interaction record 215 , which in turn occurred before the social network event characterized in social interaction record 220 .
- social interaction records 205 , 210 , 215 , 220 are arranged in accordance with one or more other parameters.
- social interaction records 205 , 210 , 215 , 220 can be arranged alphabetically or by the mode of the past social interaction event.
- Each social interaction record 205 , 210 , 215 , 220 includes an indicium 225 identifying the counterparty involved in a past social interaction event, an indicium 230 identifying the category of that past social interaction event, and a collection 235 of indicia identifying modes by which future, outgoing social interaction events can occur.
- Counterparty indicium 225 can be one or more of text (e.g., a person's name), a photo, a glyph, a telephone number, or other symbol identifying the involved counterparty.
- counterparty indicium 225 in record 205 identifies that “Peter Rabbit” was the counterparty in the social interaction event characterized by record 205 whereas counterparty indicium 225 in record 210 identifies that “Peter Piper” was the counterparty in the social interaction event characterized by record 210 .
- Each category indicium 230 can be one or more of text, a photo, a glyph, or other symbol that identifies the mode of the past social interaction event.
- category indicium 230 in record 205 identifies that the social interaction event characterized by record 205 was a telephone call.
- Category indicium 230 in record 210 identifies that the social interaction event characterized by record 210 was an electronic mail event.
- Category indicia 230 in records 215 , 220 identify that the social interaction events characterized by records 215 , 220 were postings on a social network.
- category indicia 230 identifying that social interaction events as postings on a social network can include, e.g., a logo or other identifier of the social network, as described further below.
- social commerce interaction events can be identified by category indicia 230 .
- Social commerce interaction events are commercial offers, or information about commercial offers, that are distributed directly from peer-to-peer rather than through, e.g., mass media.
- One example of a social commerce interaction event is a printable coupon or discount link that is forwarded from one individual to another.
- Another example of social commerce interaction event are events that are tailored for commerce that relies on near field communication for, e.g., mobile ticketing, mobile payment, and the like.
- Commercial offers, or information about commercial offers, that are recognized by near field communication devices can be exchanged between individuals. Such exchanges can be can be identified by category indicia 230 in social interaction hub 200 .
- social interaction hub 200 can be limited to records that characterize either incoming or outgoing past social interaction events. In other implementations, social interaction hub 200 can include records that characterize both incoming and outgoing social interaction events. In some implementations, the records can be limited to characterizing either incoming or outgoing social interaction events for some modes of social interaction but characterize both incoming and outgoing social interaction events for other modes of social interaction. For example, in some implementations, social interaction hub 200 can include records characterizing both incoming and outgoing telephone calls but only outgoing postings on a social network or outgoing electronic mail. This approach can help limit the characterization of social interaction events that occur very frequently, such as postings by others on a social network.
- category indicia 230 can identify whether the past social interaction event was an incoming event or an outgoing event.
- category indicium 230 in record 205 includes an arrow symbol 265 indicating that the past social interaction event characterized by record 205 was an outgoing telephone call rather than an incoming telephone call.
- Category indicia 230 can identify whether the past social interaction event was an incoming event or an outgoing event in a variety of way, including color, highlights, and other graphical devices.
- social interaction hub 200 can exclude certain categories of social interaction events altogether. For example, social interaction hub 200 can exclude all text messages from characterization by a social interaction records. In other implementations, social interaction hub 200 can use a single record to characterize a group or a collection of events of the same category. For example, a chain of related electronic mail correspondence or a series of text messages exchanged with the same counterparty or counterparties can be characterized in a single record in social interaction hub 200 .
- social interaction hub 200 can be limited to social interaction events involving specified counterparties.
- social interaction hub 200 can be limited to social interaction events involving a defined group of contacts, such as a user's social contacts.
- Indicia collection 235 can include text, photos, glyphs, or other symbols that identify modes by which a future outgoing social interaction event can occur.
- the modes identified in each indicia collection 235 can be limited to the modes which are available for social interaction with the same counterparty identified by the person indicium 225 of that record.
- indicia collection 235 in record 210 only identifies two modes which are available for social interaction with the counterparty “Peter Piper” identified by counterparty indicium 225 in that same record.
- indicia collection 235 in record 220 identifies five modes which are available for social interaction with the counterparty “Peter Rabbit” identified by counterparty indicium 225 in that same record. If a mode of interaction is not available for the counterparty identified by the person indicium 225 , a mode indicium for that mode of interaction can be omitted.
- the indicia in indicia collection 235 are also interactive elements that allow a user to trigger social interaction with the counterparty identified by the person indicium 225 of that record via the identified mode.
- a mobile device 105 can present graphical elements tailored for social interaction via the mode identified by an indicium or attempt to establish social interaction via the mode identified by an indicium in response to user interaction with that indicium.
- Each mode indicium 240 , 245 , 250 , 255 , 260 can identify a different mechanism by which users can interact socially. For example, in the illustrated implementation, the presence of mode indicium 240 in a collection 235 identifies that text messages are available for social interaction with the counterparty identified in that record. Mobile device 105 can, e.g., present a text entry screen or other modality for entering text messages in response to user interaction with mode indicium 240 .
- mode indicium 245 in a collection 235 identifies that a photosharing network is available for social interaction with the counterparty identified in that record.
- Mobile device 105 can, e.g., navigate to a website of the photosharing network in response to user interaction with mode indicium 245 .
- mode indicium 250 in a collection 235 identifies that the counterparty identified in that record can be telephoned.
- Mobile device 105 can, e.g., place a telephone call to a counterparty in response to user interaction with mode 250 .
- Mobile device 105 can, e.g., present a text entry screen or other modality for entering electronic mail messages in response to user interaction with mode indicium 255 .
- mode indicium 260 in a collection 235 identifies that a social network is available for social interaction with the counterparty identified in that record.
- Mobile device 105 can, e.g., navigate to a website of the photosharing network in response to user interaction with mode indicium 260 .
- mode indicia 240 , 245 , 250 , 255 , 260 can closely resemble the symbols used as category indicium 230 .
- mode indicia 240 , 245 , 250 , 255 , 260 can be identical to or resized and/or differently colored variants of various category indicia 230 .
- mode indicia 240 , 245 , 250 , 255 , 260 identifying that a social network is available for social interaction can include, e.g., a logo or other identifier of the social network.
- indicia collection 235 includes only one mode indicium for each category of social interaction. This is not necessarily the case.
- mode indicia that identify different social networks which are available for social interaction with the same counterparty can be included in a single indicia collection 235 .
- mode indicia that identify different telephone numbers which are available for social interaction with the same counterparty can be included in a single indicia collection 235 .
- the records in social interaction hub 200 are not constrained to characterizing only one or a limited number of different modes of social interaction. Instead, the records in social interaction hub 200 can characterize multiple modes of social interaction, including social network interaction. Further, the records in social interaction hub 200 are not constrained to characterizing social interaction that is implemented by a single data communication component. For example, in the context of mobile device 105 of system 100 , social interaction hub 200 can characterize events that are implemented using a mobile phone transceiver and events that are implemented using a WiFi transceiver. The events characterized in a single social interaction hub 200 can be both direct social interaction events and server-mediated social interaction events.
- FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of an implementation of a social interaction hub 300 displayed on mobile device 105 .
- selected mode indicia 240 , 245 , 250 , 255 , 260 in indicia collections 235 are labeled with an availability indicator 305 .

- an availability indicator 305 associated with a mode indicium 260 can indicate that a counterparty is presently logged in to and available on a social network.
- availability indicator 305 associated with a mode indicium 240 can indicate that a counterparty is presently online and available to exchange text messages.
- Availability indicators 305 can label a mode indicium in a variety of ways.
- availability indicators 305 can include a highlight, a color change, or other modification of a mode indicium itself.
- Availability indicators 305 can also be a separate graphical element that labels a mode indicium by virtue of positioning relative to the mode indicium, as is the case for the over-line availability indicators 305 in the illustrated implementation.
- availability indicators 305 can indicate that a counterparty is not presently available for social interaction via a labeled mode.
- a mode indicium can be modified, e.g., by darkening to indicate that the a counterparty is not presently available for social interaction via that mode.

- Subject descriptions 405 can include text or other graphical element that describes the past social interaction event.
- Descriptions 405 can be, e.g., the subject line of an electronic mail, an excerpt or other “peek” from a text message, text accompanying a photograph posted on a photo sharing website, or an excerpt or other “peek” from a posting on a social network.
- FIG. 5 is a schematic representation of an implementation of a social interaction hub 500 displayed on mobile device 105 .
- each social interaction record 205 , 210 , 215 , 220 includes an description 505 of a location of a counterparty of the past social interaction event characterized in that record.
- Location descriptions 505 can include text or other graphical element that describes either the present location of the counterparty or a “home” or other default location of the counterparty.
- the location which is characterized depends upon whether present location information is available. For example, a counterparty may post the counterparty's present location to a social network.
- location descriptions 505 in one or more interaction records 205 , 210 , 215 , 220 that describe social interaction events with that counterparty can describe that present location. However, in the absence of such a posting or other source of information, then such location descriptions 505 can describe a default location of the counterparty.

- the display of one indicia collection 235 in response to user interaction with the widget 710 associated with social interaction record 205 illustrated in FIG. 8 .
- Indicia collections 235 thus need not be displayed continuously for every interaction record 205 , 210 , 215 , 220 , 705 . Rather, selected indicia collections 235 are only displayed in response to the receipt of a user's indication that display of the selected indicia collection 235 is desired. Accordingly, interaction hub 700 can be made relatively smaller and the limited display area of mobile device 105 used for other ends.
- Social interaction hub 700 also includes a navigation area 715 .
- Navigation area 715 includes one or more navigation widgets 720 and descriptive information 725 , 730 that facilitate navigation to additional social interaction records.

- a row in a data table can be dedicated to storing information characterizing each instance of a raw contact.
- the information characterizing a raw contact that may be stored in raw contact class 1410 are a numeric or other unique identifier of the individual (i.e., “contact_ID”), a numeric or other unique identifier of the category of the account in which the individual is represented (i.e., “account_type”), a numeric or other unique identifier of the raw contact class instance (i.e., “raw_contact_ID”), the name of the account (i.e., electronic mail address, telephone number, social network account name, or the like), an indication of the number of times the individual has been contacted using the account, an indication of the last time the individual had been contacted using the account, an indication of whether a custom ringtone is associated with the representation of the individual in the account, and the like.
- the category of the account is constrained to follow a naming convention, e.g.,
- raw contact class 1410 is indexed on a numeric or other unique identifier of the individual (i.e., the “contact_ID”) so that multiple raw contacts that represent the same real-world individual in different accounts can be identified quickly. Further, in some implementations, raw contact class 1410 is also indexed on account type and account name so that multiple raw contacts from a single account source can be identified quickly.
- Contact data class 1415 is a class that stores data points from raw contacts characterized in instances of raw contact class 1410 .
- each row in a data table can form an instance of contact data class 1415 that is dedicated to storing a single piece of information drawn from a raw contact (such as a phone number or electronic mail address) and its associated metadata (such as what type of data is stored, whether it is a work or home number, and the like).
- contact data class 1415 Among the information that may be stored in contact data class 1415 are a numeric or other unique identifier of the raw contact class instance that is characterized (i.e., “raw_contact_ID”), a numeric or other unique identifier of the contact data class instance (i.e., “data_ID”), generic fields that can hold a variety of different kinds of contact data (e.g., “data_1” and “data_2”) and type data that identifies the type of contact data stored in each generic field (e.g., “type”).
- the type data can indicate that a generic field stores a phone number, an electronic mail addresses, an account in a social or photo network, or the like.
- the data types are generally constrained to a predefined set of types.
- the data types can be constrained to being Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) data types.
- MIME Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
- mobile device 105 can determine how to display data points drawn from different raw contacts. For example, different phone numbers drawn from different accounts can be recognized as such and displayed accordingly.
- contact data class 1415 includes a predefined set of data kinds and additional data kinds that are added, e.g., by different applications.
- the set of data kinds that can be stored in contacts class 1405 can thus be open-ended.
- Such additional data kinds can also be the subject of requests and responses between a corresponding server interface module 1045 and its server.
- first generic fields form an indexed column in a contact data class table and store data that is expected to be frequently used in database queries.
- the first generic field can generally include the electronic mail address itself.
- Other generic fields can store auxiliary information that characterizes the data in the first generic field, such as whether the electronic mail address stored in the first generic field is a home or business electronic mail address.
- Status update class 1420 is a class that stores a contact's latest status updates from a corresponding raw contact characterized in raw contact class 1410 .
- information that may be stored in status update class 1420 are a numeric or other unique identifier of the contact data class instance that is characterized in the status update class instance (i.e., “data_ID”), a uniform resource identifier (URI) or other identifier of a storage location of an icon that represents the entity with which the contact has the corresponding account (i.e., “source_icon”), a uniform resource identifier (URI) or other identifier of a storage location of a name or other label identifying the entity with which the contact has the corresponding account (i.e., “source_label”), a numeric or other identify of the contact's latest status (i.e., “status”), any text of the status update (e.g., “text”), and a timestamp when status was last updated by the contact at the corresponding account (e.g
- the status updates that can be stored in status update class 1420 can take a variety of forms.
- the contact's latest status i.e., “status”
- the contact's latest status is constrained to have one of a predetermined set of allowed values, such as “offline,” “invisible,” “away,” “idle,” “do_not_disturb,”, and “available”
- the text of a status update i.e., “status” can have a range of values such as, e.g., “having lunch” or “enjoying watching Federer rally against Nadal in Palm Springs,” as shown in FIG. 7 .
- a database schema such as database schema 1405 provides a number of different advantages. For example, different numbers of different kinds of accounts can be associated with each contact.
- the account information is stored in data structures that can accommodate not only a variety of different types of accounts but also new types of accounts as they are developed by different entities that mediate social interaction.
- information characterizing the accounts can be stored in a single data table, with records characterizing different kinds of accounts interspersed among each other.
- a single most recent status update can be stored for each different kind of account, along with information identifying the time when status was last updated by the contact at the corresponding account.
- the timestamps when status was last updated at the different accounts is used to select one of the status updates for display as the most current status update, e.g., in a social status record 900 ( FIG. 9 ).
- Information drawn from a variety of different entities that mediate social interaction can be stored in a single location and integrated for use in presenting one or more of social interaction hubs 200 , 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 ( FIGS. 2-8 ) or a social interaction hub that is limited to social status records on a mobile device 105 .
- database schema 1405 access to the information in database schema 1405 is facilitated by database schema 1405 .
- information identifying the raw contacts of a single real-world individual can be accessed relatively quickly by a search of instances of raw contact class 1410 .
- a query can identify the rows or other records in instances of raw contact class 1410 that share the contact_ID of a particular social interaction counterparty when determining which mode indicia are to be included in a particular contact's indicia collection 235 . Only after a particular mode indicium has been selected for an outgoing social interact do data points tied to the raw contact corresponding to the selected indicium need to be accessed from contact data class 1415 .

Abstract
Description
- This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/914,773, filed Oct. 28, 2010, entitled “Social Messaging User Interface,” which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/255,847, filed on Oct. 28, 2009, entitled “Search, Navigation, and Docking with a Mobile Computing Device,” the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
- This specification relates to a hub for social interaction via electronic devices.
- It has been said that “no man is an island.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, humans have developed electronic devices and mechanisms that promote social interaction by facilitating the exchange of messages, photos, media, and other information between individuals. For example, mobile phones allow users to speak with one another without being tied to a fixed landline. Electronic mail and text messages are delivered nearly instantaneously. Photo sharing websites host photos posted by individuals for their friends and associates to view. Social networks such as FACEBOOK and MYSPACE allow large groups to remain in contact. Message boards allow communities with common interests to share information and discuss relevant issues. Blogs and other pages allow people to comment on content and converse with even unknown individuals.
- This specification describes a hub and corresponding user interface for the social interaction that occurs via electronic devices and mechanisms. The hub can be a center where information regarding different social interaction mechanisms is gathered and organized. The hub can allow a user to integrate those social interaction mechanisms by providing an overview of the different mechanisms and allowing users to facilely transition between different mechanisms.
- In one aspect, a data processing device includes a display screen displaying a social interaction hub, the social interaction hub including a collection of records. Each record includes a counterparty identifier identifying a counterparty of a past social interaction event, a mode indicium identifying a mode by which the past social interaction event with the counterparty occurred, and a collection of mode indicia each identifying a mode by which a future, outgoing social interaction event with the counterparty can occur. The counterparty identifier, the mode indicium, and the collection of mode indicia are associated with one another in the records of the social interaction hub.
- This and other aspects can include one or more of the following features. The collection of mode indicia can be limited to modes of social interaction that are available for social interaction with the counterparty. At least one of the records can include an availability indicator labeling a first mode indicium in the collection of mode indicia. The availability indicator can indicate that the counterparty is presently available for social interaction via the mode identified by the first mode indicium. The first mode indicium can identify an electronic messaging mode. Each record can also include an interactive graphical element that triggers display of the collection of mode indicia in response to user interaction. Each record can also include a description of a subject of the past social interaction event. For example, a first description of the subject of a first past social interaction event can include a subject line of an electronic mail or text message. A second description of the subject of a second past social interaction event can include an excerpt of a posting on a social network. The mode indicia can identify both direct social interaction modes in which information can be exchanged directly with the counterparty and modes mediated by a social network server. At least some the mode indicia in the collection can be variants of the mode indicium identifying the mode by which the past social interaction event occurred. The social interaction hub can include information describing a disposition of the currently displayed social interaction records within a larger collection of social interaction records and an interactive graphical element that triggers display of additional social interaction records within the larger collection in response to user interaction.
- In another aspect, a data processing device includes a display screen displaying a social interaction hub. The social interaction hub includes a collection of records each characterizing a past social interaction event. The characterized social interaction events including direct social interaction events in which users have exchanged information directly with one another and a social interaction event mediated by a social network server. The records characterizing the direct social interaction events are interspersed with the records characterizing the social interaction events mediated by the social network server.
- This and other aspects can include one or more of the following features. The records characterizing the direct social interaction events and the records characterizing the social interaction events mediated by the social network server can be ordered chronologically according to order of occurrence. Each record can include one or more of the following: a counterparty identifier identifying a counterparty of a past social interaction event; a mode indicium identifying a mode by which the past social interaction event with the counterparty occurred; a collection of mode indicia each identifying a mode by which a future, outgoing social interaction event with the counterparty can occur; and an interactive graphical element that triggers display of the collection of mode indicia in response to user interaction. Each record can include a description of a subject of the past social interaction event.
- In another aspect, a user-portable device includes a display screen, one or more data communication interfaces, a data storage device configured to store a phone/message log, and a data processing system programmed to perform activities in accordance with the logic of one or more sets of machine-readable instructions.

- These and other aspects can, in certain of the implementations described herein, provide the following advantages. An application may provide access to communication with a user's acquaintances through a variety of communication modes, including by social networking sites. A user's contact list may be displayed on a mobile device in alphabetical order. When the user presses an image of an acquaintance, a control bar can be generated that shows each of the mechanisms by which the acquaintance can be communicated with. The user of the device may then select an icon for one of the modes to begin communicating immediately via that mode. For example, pressing the telephone icon can cause the acquaintance's telephone number to be dialed, while pressing a social networking icon can cause a text box to be presented so that one can write on the other user's wall.
- Other manipulation of the input control can cause recent communications by the particular mode of communication to be displayed. For example, long pressing on a social networking icon can cause the last five posts to the acquaintances wall to be display for the user.
- The interface may also be genericized, so that any image of acquaintances can be an object that exhibits the behavior shown here. Thus, for example, whenever a user sees a photo of an acquaintance, the user will know that he or she can quickly access modes of communicating with that acquaintance.
- Data for such an application may be provided via a standard and public API. For example, when a user makes the interactions described above, the user's device may make requests to data sources internal to the device (e.g., contact information) and to services outside the device (e.g., social networks), which may then return information according to the pre-determined requests. Such services may also authenticate a user before providing the user with certain forms of information.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of asystem 100 of electronic devices that exchange information and provide social interaction.System 100 includes a handheld,mobile device 105 that is associated with a first individual user.Mobile device 105 includes one or more wireless or wired data communication components. The user ofmobile device 105 can use the data communication components to interact socially with other individuals, as described further below. - In the illustrated implementation of
system 100,mobile device 105 includes two wireless data communication components, namely, a mobile phone transceiver and a WiFi transceiver. The mobile phone transceiver is able to exchangemessages 110 with aphone base station 115. The WiFi transceiver is able to exchangemessages 120 with aWiFi access point 125 andmessages 130 with a peermobile device 135 that also includes a WiFi transceiver. Peermobile device 135 is associated with another individual user. -
Phone base station 115 andWiFi access point 125 are connected for data communication with one or moredata communication networks 140 viadata links social interaction servers mobile device 135 may also be able to exchangemessages 175 with WiFi access point 125 (or another WiFi access point) for data communication withdata communication networks 140 and access tosocial interaction servers mobile devices 180, which are associated with one or more other individual users, may also be able to exchangemessages 185 with phone base station 115 (or another base station) for data communication withdata communication networks 140 and access tosocial interaction servers personal computing devices 190, which are associated with one or more other individual users, may also be connected for data communication with one or moredata communication networks 140 via adata link 190 for access tosocial interaction servers -
System 100 supports both direct and server-mediated social interaction by the users with whomdevice device 105 is associated can telephone the user with whomdevice 180 is associated. These user can talk to one another directly, without intermediation by a server. As another example of direct social interaction, the user with whomdevice 105 is associated can establish a peer-to-peer wireless link with the user with whomdevice 135 is associated. These users can, e.g., text one another or send photos to one another. - Server-mediated social interaction allows users to exchange messages, photos, or other media with a server data processing device mediating the exchange. The illustrated implementation of
system 100 includes four different examples of servers that can mediate such social interaction, namely, anelectronic mail server 155, asocial network server 160, atext message server 165, and aphoto server 170. Each ofsocial interaction servers electronic mail server 155 is programmed to allow a user to access electronic mail from an electronic mail client.Social network server 160 is programmed to allow users to access a social network where messages, photos, and/or other media are exchanged. For examples,social network server 160 can support social networks such as FACEBOOK™, MYSPACE™, YAHOO! 360™, LINKEDIN™, ESSEMBLY™, ORKUT™, FRIENDSTER™, and others. -
Text message server 165 is programmed to allow a user to exchange text messages with other users.Photo server 170 is programmed to allow a user to access a collection of one or more photographs posted tophoto server 170 by other individuals. In some implementations,photo server 170 may restrict a user to accessing photographs posted by other individuals who have somehow approved the user's access. - For each user with whom a
device system 100 can be classified as either “outgoing” or “incoming.” In the context of a user with whomdevice 105 is associated, outgoing social interaction events include, e.g., outgoing phone calls and text messages, e-mail messages sent to other users, photographs posted tophoto server 170, comments posted on a social network hosted bysocial network server 160, posts to message boards, comments on blog or other pages, and the like. In the context of a user with whomdevice photo server 170, comments posted on the user's page in a social network hosted bysocial network server 160, responses to that users posts to message boards or blog or other comments, and the like. - In addition to one or more wireless or wired data communication components,
mobile device 105 can also include adisplay screen 195 and one ormore input devices 197. In some implementations,display screen 195 can act as both an input and an output. For example,display screen 195 can be a touch screen that both displays graphical elements on a screen and detects the presence and location of interaction with the screen.Input devices 197 can include one or more, e.g., key, pad, trackball, or other component that receives mechanical, audio, or other input from a user. In some implementations,mobile device 105 can include additional components such as a GPS unit, accelerometers, a digital camera, audio jacks, and the like. -
FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of one implementation of asocial interaction hub 200 displayed onmobile device 105.Social interaction hub 200 is displayed on all or a portion ofdisplay screen 195 and includes a collection ofsocial interaction records social interaction record - In the illustrated implementation,
social interaction records social interaction record 205 occurred before the electronic mail event characterized insocial interaction record 210. In turn, the events characterized in bothrecords social interaction record 215, which in turn occurred before the social network event characterized insocial interaction record 220. In other implementations,social interaction records social interaction records - Each
social interaction record indicium 225 identifying the counterparty involved in a past social interaction event, anindicium 230 identifying the category of that past social interaction event, and acollection 235 of indicia identifying modes by which future, outgoing social interaction events can occur.Counterparty indicium 225 can be one or more of text (e.g., a person's name), a photo, a glyph, a telephone number, or other symbol identifying the involved counterparty. For example, in the illustrated implementation,counterparty indicium 225 inrecord 205 identifies that “Peter Rabbit” was the counterparty in the social interaction event characterized byrecord 205 whereascounterparty indicium 225 inrecord 210 identifies that “Peter Piper” was the counterparty in the social interaction event characterized byrecord 210. - Each
category indicium 230 can be one or more of text, a photo, a glyph, or other symbol that identifies the mode of the past social interaction event. For example, in the illustrated implementation,category indicium 230 inrecord 205 identifies that the social interaction event characterized byrecord 205 was a telephone call.Category indicium 230 inrecord 210 identifies that the social interaction event characterized byrecord 210 was an electronic mail event.Category indicia 230 inrecords records category indicia 230 identifying that social interaction events as postings on a social network can include, e.g., a logo or other identifier of the social network, as described further below. - In some implementations, social commerce interaction events can be identified by
category indicia 230. Social commerce interaction events are commercial offers, or information about commercial offers, that are distributed directly from peer-to-peer rather than through, e.g., mass media. One example of a social commerce interaction event is a printable coupon or discount link that is forwarded from one individual to another. Another example of social commerce interaction event are events that are tailored for commerce that relies on near field communication for, e.g., mobile ticketing, mobile payment, and the like. Commercial offers, or information about commercial offers, that are recognized by near field communication devices can be exchanged between individuals. Such exchanges can be can be identified bycategory indicia 230 insocial interaction hub 200. - In some implementations,
social interaction hub 200 can be limited to records that characterize either incoming or outgoing past social interaction events. In other implementations,social interaction hub 200 can include records that characterize both incoming and outgoing social interaction events. In some implementations, the records can be limited to characterizing either incoming or outgoing social interaction events for some modes of social interaction but characterize both incoming and outgoing social interaction events for other modes of social interaction. For example, in some implementations,social interaction hub 200 can include records characterizing both incoming and outgoing telephone calls but only outgoing postings on a social network or outgoing electronic mail. This approach can help limit the characterization of social interaction events that occur very frequently, such as postings by others on a social network. - In some implementations,
category indicia 230 can identify whether the past social interaction event was an incoming event or an outgoing event. For example,category indicium 230 inrecord 205 includes anarrow symbol 265 indicating that the past social interaction event characterized byrecord 205 was an outgoing telephone call rather than an incoming telephone call.Category indicia 230 can identify whether the past social interaction event was an incoming event or an outgoing event in a variety of way, including color, highlights, and other graphical devices. - In some implementations,
social interaction hub 200 can exclude certain categories of social interaction events altogether. For example,social interaction hub 200 can exclude all text messages from characterization by a social interaction records. In other implementations,social interaction hub 200 can use a single record to characterize a group or a collection of events of the same category. For example, a chain of related electronic mail correspondence or a series of text messages exchanged with the same counterparty or counterparties can be characterized in a single record insocial interaction hub 200. - In some implementations,
social interaction hub 200 can be limited to social interaction events involving specified counterparties. For example,social interaction hub 200 can be limited to social interaction events involving a defined group of contacts, such as a user's social contacts. -
Indicia collection 235 can include text, photos, glyphs, or other symbols that identify modes by which a future outgoing social interaction event can occur. The modes identified in eachindicia collection 235 can be limited to the modes which are available for social interaction with the same counterparty identified by theperson indicium 225 of that record. For example,indicia collection 235 inrecord 210 only identifies two modes which are available for social interaction with the counterparty “Peter Piper” identified bycounterparty indicium 225 in that same record. As another example,indicia collection 235 inrecord 220 identifies five modes which are available for social interaction with the counterparty “Peter Rabbit” identified bycounterparty indicium 225 in that same record. If a mode of interaction is not available for the counterparty identified by theperson indicium 225, a mode indicium for that mode of interaction can be omitted. - In general, the indicia in
indicia collection 235 are also interactive elements that allow a user to trigger social interaction with the counterparty identified by theperson indicium 225 of that record via the identified mode. For example, amobile device 105 can present graphical elements tailored for social interaction via the mode identified by an indicium or attempt to establish social interaction via the mode identified by an indicium in response to user interaction with that indicium. - Five different
example mode indicia mode indicium mode indicium 240 in acollection 235 identifies that text messages are available for social interaction with the counterparty identified in that record.Mobile device 105 can, e.g., present a text entry screen or other modality for entering text messages in response to user interaction withmode indicium 240. - The presence of
mode indicium 245 in acollection 235 identifies that a photosharing network is available for social interaction with the counterparty identified in that record.Mobile device 105 can, e.g., navigate to a website of the photosharing network in response to user interaction withmode indicium 245. - The presence of
mode indicium 250 in acollection 235 identifies that the counterparty identified in that record can be telephoned.Mobile device 105 can, e.g., place a telephone call to a counterparty in response to user interaction withmode 250. - The presence of
mode indicium 255 in acollection 235 identifies that the counterparty identified in that record can be electronically mailed.Mobile device 105 can, e.g., present a text entry screen or other modality for entering electronic mail messages in response to user interaction withmode indicium 255. - The presence of
mode indicium 260 in acollection 235 identifies that a social network is available for social interaction with the counterparty identified in that record.Mobile device 105 can, e.g., navigate to a website of the photosharing network in response to user interaction withmode indicium 260. - In some implementations, the symbols used in
mode indicia category indicium 230. For example,mode indicia various category indicia 230. Thus, in some implementations,mode indicia - In the illustrated implementation,
indicia collection 235 includes only one mode indicium for each category of social interaction. This is not necessarily the case. For example, mode indicia that identify different social networks which are available for social interaction with the same counterparty can be included in asingle indicia collection 235. As another example, mode indicia that identify different telephone numbers which are available for social interaction with the same counterparty can be included in asingle indicia collection 235. - As shown, unlike a call log on a cellular phone, the records in
social interaction hub 200 are not constrained to characterizing only one or a limited number of different modes of social interaction. Instead, the records insocial interaction hub 200 can characterize multiple modes of social interaction, including social network interaction. Further, the records insocial interaction hub 200 are not constrained to characterizing social interaction that is implemented by a single data communication component. For example, in the context ofmobile device 105 ofsystem 100,social interaction hub 200 can characterize events that are implemented using a mobile phone transceiver and events that are implemented using a WiFi transceiver. The events characterized in a singlesocial interaction hub 200 can be both direct social interaction events and server-mediated social interaction events. -
FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of an implementation of asocial interaction hub 300 displayed onmobile device 105. In addition to features described in detail above, selectedmode indicia indicia collections 235 are labeled with anavailability indicator 305.Availability indicators 305 are graphical elements that indicate that the counterparties identified byindicia 225 in respective social interaction records are presently available for social interaction via the labeled mode. For example, anavailability indicator 305 associated with amode indicium 260 can indicate that a counterparty is presently logged in to and available on a social network. As another example,availability indicator 305 associated with amode indicium 240 can indicate that a counterparty is presently online and available to exchange text messages. -
Availability indicators 305 can label a mode indicium in a variety of ways. For example,availability indicators 305 can include a highlight, a color change, or other modification of a mode indicium itself.Availability indicators 305 can also be a separate graphical element that labels a mode indicium by virtue of positioning relative to the mode indicium, as is the case for theover-line availability indicators 305 in the illustrated implementation. - In some implementations,
availability indicators 305 can indicate that a counterparty is not presently available for social interaction via a labeled mode. For example, a mode indicium can be modified, e.g., by darkening to indicate that the a counterparty is not presently available for social interaction via that mode. -
FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of an implementation of asocial interaction hub 400 displayed onmobile device 105. In addition to features described in detail above, eachsocial interaction record description 405 of the subject of the past social interaction event characterized in that record.Subject descriptions 405 can include text or other graphical element that describes the past social interaction event.Descriptions 405 can be, e.g., the subject line of an electronic mail, an excerpt or other “peek” from a text message, text accompanying a photograph posted on a photo sharing website, or an excerpt or other “peek” from a posting on a social network. -
FIG. 5 is a schematic representation of an implementation of asocial interaction hub 500 displayed onmobile device 105. In addition to features described in detail above, eachsocial interaction record description 505 of a location of a counterparty of the past social interaction event characterized in that record.Location descriptions 505 can include text or other graphical element that describes either the present location of the counterparty or a “home” or other default location of the counterparty. In some implementations, the location which is characterized depends upon whether present location information is available. For example, a counterparty may post the counterparty's present location to a social network. If such a posting is available, thenlocation descriptions 505 in one ormore interaction records such location descriptions 505 can describe a default location of the counterparty. -
FIG. 6 is a schematic representation of an implementation of asocial interaction hub 600 displayed onmobile device 105. In addition to features described in detail above, eachsocial interaction record description 605 of the time when the past social interaction event characterized in that record occurred.Time descriptions 605 can include text or other graphical element that describes the time when the past social interaction event characterized in the samesocial interaction record -
FIGS. 7 and 8 are schematic representations of an implementation of asocial interaction hub 700 displayed onmobile device 105. In addition to features described in detail above,social interaction hub 700 includes anotherinteraction record 705 andinteraction records widget 710.Widgets 710 are interactive graphical elements. User interaction withwidgets 710 triggers the display of theindicia collection 235 that identifies modes by which a future, outgoing social interaction events can occur with the counterparty identified in the interaction record associated with thewidget 710. The display of oneindicia collection 235 in response to user interaction with thewidget 710 associated withsocial interaction record 205 illustrated inFIG. 8 . -
Indicia collections 235 thus need not be displayed continuously for everyinteraction record indicia collections 235 are only displayed in response to the receipt of a user's indication that display of the selectedindicia collection 235 is desired. Accordingly,interaction hub 700 can be made relatively smaller and the limited display area ofmobile device 105 used for other ends. -
Social interaction hub 700 also includes anavigation area 715.Navigation area 715 includes one ormore navigation widgets 720 anddescriptive information Information 725 describes the disposition of the currently displayed social interaction records within a larger collection of social interaction records. In the illustrated implementation,information 725 identifies the date on which the events described in the displayedsocial interaction record Information 730 describes thatnavigation area 715 is indeed a navigation area that can be used to navigate to “more” social interaction records.Navigation widget 720 is an interactive graphical element that allows a user to trigger the display of additional social interaction records. In some implementations,navigation widget 720 can include a graphical or other indicia that identifies the social interaction records which will be displayed in response to user interaction withnavigation widget 720. For example, in the illustrated implementation,navigation widget 720 includes a triangle which is oriented downward. In the context of the chronological organization ofsocial interaction record social interaction hub 700, the triangle identifies that social interaction records which characterize events which occurred before the events characterized insocial interaction record navigation widget 720. -
FIG. 9 is a schematic representation of an implementation of asocial status record 900 suitable for display on a mobile device.Social status record 900 is a graphical element that includes one ormore status indicia 905 characterizing the status of a counterparty with whom the user interacts. The status of a counterparty is a state or a condition of the counterparty.Status indicia 905 can include text or other graphical elements that characterize a counterparty's status. In some implementations, the content of astatus indicium 905 can be derived from one or more modes that are available for social interaction with the counterparty, such as a social network or a text messaging network. For example, in the illustrated implementation,status indicium 905 is derived from a the counterparty's GOOGLE TALK™ status. - In the illustrated implementation,
social status record 900 includes acounterparty indicium 225, anindicia collection 235,availability indicators 305, and alocation description 505, in addition tostatus indicia 905. In other implementations,social status record 900 can omit one or both ofavailability indicators 305 and alocation description 505. In some implementations,social status record 900 can include awidget 710 that triggers the display of theindicia collection 235. - In some implementations,
social status record 900 can include a description of the time when the content ofstatus indicia 905 was last confirmed as valid. For example, the time at which a status update was posted on a social or a chat network can be taken as the time when the counterparty's status was last confirmed as valid. - In some implementations, one or more
social status records 900 can be collected into a social interaction hub that is limited to social status records 900. The display of amobile device 105 can present a social interaction hub that is limited to social status records and a social interaction hub that is limited to social interaction records at the same time or one at a time, e.g., in response to triggers received from a user. In other implementations, a single social interaction hub can include one or moresocial status records 900 as well as one or more social interaction records. For example, one or moresocial interaction records 900 can be included in one or more ofsocial interaction hubs FIGS. 2-8 ) and presented onmobile device 105. -
Social status records 900 can be arranged in a social interaction hub chronologically, e.g., in the vertically downward direction in the order in which the content ofstatus indicia 905 was last confirmed as valid. In implementations where social status records and social interaction records appear in the same social interaction hub, the times when status was last confirmed as valid can be compared with the times when social interaction events last occurred and the corresponding record arranged chronologically. - In some implementations, the
social status records 900 that are presented in any social interaction hub can be limited to specified counterparties. For example,social status records 900 can be limited to a defined group of contacts, such as a user's social contacts. - In the illustrated implementation of
social status record 900,indicia collection 235 includes acontact indicium 910.Contact indicium 910 is an interactive graphical element that allows a user to navigate to additional information regarding the counterparty identified bycounterparty indicium 225. For example, in response to user interaction withcontact indicium 910,mobile device 105 can, e.g., present a contact card or other assembly of information characterizing the counterparty. As illustrated inFIGS. 7, 8 , social interaction records can also include acontact indicium 910, e.g., disposed withinindicia collection 235. -

Data stores Data store 1020 stores a phone and message log that stores information describing past social interaction events that have occurred by telephone and text messaging.Data store 1020 can include, e.g., information characterizing the counterparty (e.g., a telephone number) and information characterizing the timing of the past social interaction events. In some implementations,data store 1020 only stores information describing direct social interaction events, e.g., that occurred overphone interface 1010 and a cellular or other phone. -
Data store 1025 stores a collection of contact information that characterizes counterparties with whom social interaction can occur. Among the contact information that can be stored atdata store 1025 is information for establishing different modes of social interaction. For example,data store 1025 can include information characterizing counterparty's home and work telephone numbers, information characterizing a counterparty's home page or other contributions to a social networking site or a photosharing site, information characterizing one or more electronic mail, instant message, or other messaging addresses of a counterparty, as well as other information such as postal address information, a photograph, and the like. - In some implementations,
data store 1025 can also include grouping information characterizing groups of counterparties. As described above, in some implementations, a social interaction hub can be limited to social interaction with a specified group of individuals. Such a group of individuals can be specified by grouping information indata store 1025. -
Data store 1030 stores one or more sets of machine-readable instructions for creating a social interaction hub. When implemented by one or more data processors, the instructions can cause the implementing data processors to aggregate data and present a social interaction hub ondisplay screen 195. -
Data processing system 1035 is one or more digital data processors that perform operations in accordance with the logic of one or more sets of machine-readable instructions.Data processing system 1035 can implement one or more modules for performing operations for presenting a social interaction hub ondisplay screen 195 in accordance with the logic of such instructions. Among the modules that can be implemented bydata processing system 1035 are auser interface module 1040, a variety of differentserver interface modules 1045, and adata aggregation module 1050. -
User interface module 1040 is a set of data processing activities that prepare instructions for presenting a social interaction hub ondisplay screen 195.User interface module 1040 can, e.g., select the particular data which is to be displayed in a particular social interaction and respond to user interaction with the displayed social interaction hub. -
Server interface modules 1045 are sets of data processing activities that interface with social interaction servers, such asservers FIG. 1 ). In general, eachserver interface modules 1045 is dedicated to obtaining information suitable for presentation in a social interaction hub from a different social interaction server.Server interface modules 1045 can be, e.g., an electronic mail or message clients, as well as dedicated clients tailored to the characteristics of a specific social or photosharing network. - The
server interface modules 1045 can obtain information for presentation in a social interaction hub, e.g., by issuing service requests to a social interaction server and extracting the formation from the responses to those requests. The requests and responses are communicated frommobile device 105 to the relevant social interaction server over one or both ofinterfaces -
Data aggregation module 1050 is a set of data processing activities that aggregates information drawn from phone/message log 1020,contact information 1025, andserver interfaces 1045 for presentation of that information in a social interaction hub. In some implementations,data aggregation module 1050 compares the names or other identifiers of counterparties involved in a past social interaction event with names or other identifiers information associated with information drawn from phone/message log 1020,contact information 1025, andserver interfaces 1045 and aggregate information associated with the same identifier for a social interaction event record characterizing that past social interaction event.Data aggregation module 1050 can also compare names or other identifiers of counterparties in information drawn from phone/message log 1020,contact information 1025, andserver interfaces 1045 to aggregate information for social status records. - In general,
data aggregation module 1050 includes rules for filtering the social interaction events which are characterized in a social interaction hub or the counterparties for whom social status records are presented. As described above, the past social interaction events characterized in a social interaction hub can be limited in several different ways, including whether the past event was an incoming or outgoing social interaction event, whether the past event was direct or server-mediated, or whether the past event involved a specified counterparty.Data aggregation module 1050 can filter social interaction events to implement these and other limitations. - In some implementations,
data aggregation module 1050 can also include conflict resolution activities for resolving conflicts between information drawn from phone/message log 1020,contact information 1025, andserver interfaces 1045. For example, a counterparty may be identified as residing at a first location incontact information 1025 but at a second location in a social network server.Data aggregation module 1050 can resolve the conflict betweencontact information 1025 and the social network server based on, e.g., the last time information on either was updated or a user indication that one is to be relied upon for presentation oflocation descriptions 505. - In some implementations,
data aggregation module 1050 can also include extraction rules for extracting appropriate information for presentation fro, e.g., electronic mail and text messages, phone andmessage log 1020, and the responses to service requests received byserver interfaces 1045. For example,data aggregation module 1050 can extract the subject line of electronic mail messages or a title of a posting on a photosharing or social network for presentation ofsubject descriptions 405. - In some implementations,
data aggregation module 1050 can also include rules for collapsing a chain of electronic mail or text messages or other social interaction events into a single social interaction event. For example,data aggregation module 1050 can compare the subject line of electronic mail messages to identify a chain of related electronic mail messages.Data aggregation module 1050 can then aggregate those messages so that a single social interaction event record characterizing them all is presented. -
FIG. 11 is a schematic representation of acollection 1100 of components of amobile device 105.Collection 1100 can include both hardware and software components, as well as one or more data storage devices and one or more data processors that perform operations for presenting a social interaction hub ondisplay screen 195 of amobile device 105. For example,collection 1100 can present one or more ofsocial interaction hubs mobile device 105. - In addition to the components described above,
data store 1030 ofcollection 1100 also stores one or more sets of user preference information. The user preference information indata store 1030 specifies user preferences for the presentation of a social interaction hub ondisplay screen 195. For example, the user preference information can specify limitations on the counterparties who are characterized in social status records. As another example, the user preference information can specify limitations on the past social interaction events that are characterized in a social interaction hub, including whether the past event was an incoming or outgoing social interaction event, whether the past event was direct or server-mediated, or whether the past event involved a specified counterparty. -
FIG. 12 is a schematic representation of a collection 1200 of user preference information that specifies limitations on the characterization of past social interaction events in a social interaction hub. - In the illustrated implementation, collection 1200 is implemented in a data table 1205. Data table 1205 organizes user preference information into
rows columns row column - In the illustrated implementation, the data in
columns rows columns rows 1220. For example, the group associated withrows 1220 may be a user's immediate family and the user may desire that a social interaction hub exhaustively present all social interaction event involving those family members. -
FIG. 13 is a schematic representation of acollection 1300 of components of amobile device 105.Collection 1300 can include both hardware and software components, as well as one or more data storage devices and one or more data processors that perform operations for presenting a social interaction hub ondisplay screen 195 of amobile device 105. For example,collection 1300 can be used present one or more ofsocial interaction hubs FIGS. 2-8 ) or a social interaction hub that is limited to social status records on amobile device 105. - In addition to many of the components described above,
collection 1300 includes an integrated socialinformation data store 1305. Integrated socialinformation data store 1305 is a database or other data store that integrates the storage of information characterizing contacts and information characterizing social interaction events that had occurred by a variety of different social interaction modes. For example, integrated socialinformation data store 1305 can store information characterizing all of the different social interaction modes by which the user of amobile device 105 can interact with his or her contacts in a single integrated database. -
FIG. 14 is an example of adatabase schema 1400 of integrated socialinformation data store 1305.Database schema 1400 represents an extensible database of contact-related information and includes acontacts class 1405, araw contact class 1410, a contact data class 1415, and astatus update class 1420.Contacts class 1405 has a one-to-many relationship 1425 withraw contact class 1410.Raw contact class 1410 has a one-to-many relationship with contact data class 1415. Contact data class 1415 has a one-to-one relationship withstatus update class 1420. -
Contacts class 1405 is a class that stores information characterizing contacts. Contacts are individuals who may be counterparties in one or more social interaction events. Information can be stored in instances ofcontacts class 1405 bydata aggregator 1050. In some implementations, each of multiple rows in a data table can be dedicated to storing information characterizing each such individual and form separate instances ofcontacts class 1405. - In some implementations, the information characterizing contacts that is stored in
contacts class 1405 is limited, withcontacts class 1405 essentially storing only a numeric or other unique identifier and links to instances ofraw contacts class 1410 that can be combined and presented as a single logical person. For example, in the illustrated implementation,contacts class 1405 includes a numeric or other unique identifier of the contact (i.e., the “contact_ID” field shown inFIG. 14 ), a name or other textual identifier of the contact (i.e., “display_name”), and any links to instances ofraw contacts class 1410. - In some implementations,
contacts class 1405 includes a predefined set of data kinds for characterizing contacts and additional data kinds that are added, e.g., by different applications. The set of data kinds that can be stored incontacts class 1405 can thus in some implementations be open-ended. -
Raw contact class 1410 is a class that stores information characterizing a “raw contact” from a single account of the user with whommobile device 105 is associated. An account is the result of a contractual or other arrangement between the user with whommobile device 105 is associated and an entity. The entity can be an entity that mediates social interaction. For example, the user with whommobile device 105 is associated may have an electronic mail account with the provider of anelectronic mail server 155, a social network account with the provider of asocial network server 160, a text message account with the provider of atext message server 165, or a photo account with the provider of a photo server 170 (FIG. 1 ). - As used herein, a “raw contact” is a representation of an individual (i.e., the contact) at an account of the user with whom
mobile device 105 is associated. The individual can be a counterparty to past social interaction events or otherwise identified as associated with the user with whommobile device 105 is associated. For example, “raw contacts” in the context of a social network can be individuals who are friends of the user with whommobile device 105 is associated or those individuals who are followed by the user with whommobile device 105 is associated. As another example, a “raw contact” in the context of an electronic mail account can be individuals whose contact information is saved in the electronic mail account or individuals whom are commonly mailed by the user with whommobile device 105 is associated. - At times, a single real-world individual may be represented by multiple instances of
raw contact class 1410. For example, the user with whommobile device 105 is associated may have the same person as a contact in an electronic mail system and as a friend in two different social networks. In this case, the same person could be represented by three different instances ofraw contact class 1410. As discussed above, each instance ofcontacts class 1405 can include links to such multiple instances ofraw contact class 1410 and such multiple instances ofraw contact class 1410 can be combined and presented as a single logical person. - In some implementations, a row in a data table can be dedicated to storing information characterizing each instance of a raw contact. Among the information characterizing a raw contact that may be stored in
raw contact class 1410 are a numeric or other unique identifier of the individual (i.e., “contact_ID”), a numeric or other unique identifier of the category of the account in which the individual is represented (i.e., “account_type”), a numeric or other unique identifier of the raw contact class instance (i.e., “raw_contact_ID”), the name of the account (i.e., electronic mail address, telephone number, social network account name, or the like), an indication of the number of times the individual has been contacted using the account, an indication of the last time the individual had been contacted using the account, an indication of whether a custom ringtone is associated with the representation of the individual in the account, and the like. In some implementations, the category of the account is constrained to follow a naming convention, e.g., the JAVA package naming convention. Such a constraint can help ensure that duplicate accounts can be identified and aggregated. - In general,
raw contact class 1410 is indexed on a numeric or other unique identifier of the individual (i.e., the “contact_ID”) so that multiple raw contacts that represent the same real-world individual in different accounts can be identified quickly. Further, in some implementations,raw contact class 1410 is also indexed on account type and account name so that multiple raw contacts from a single account source can be identified quickly. - Contact data class 1415 is a class that stores data points from raw contacts characterized in instances of
raw contact class 1410. In some implementations, each row in a data table can form an instance of contact data class 1415 that is dedicated to storing a single piece of information drawn from a raw contact (such as a phone number or electronic mail address) and its associated metadata (such as what type of data is stored, whether it is a work or home number, and the like). Among the information that may be stored in contact data class 1415 are a numeric or other unique identifier of the raw contact class instance that is characterized (i.e., “raw_contact_ID”), a numeric or other unique identifier of the contact data class instance (i.e., “data_ID”), generic fields that can hold a variety of different kinds of contact data (e.g., “data_1” and “data_2”) and type data that identifies the type of contact data stored in each generic field (e.g., “type”). For example, the type data can indicate that a generic field stores a phone number, an electronic mail addresses, an account in a social or photo network, or the like. The data types are generally constrained to a predefined set of types. For example, in some implementations, the data types can be constrained to being Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) data types. By constraining the data types predefined set of types,mobile device 105 can determine how to display data points drawn from different raw contacts. For example, different phone numbers drawn from different accounts can be recognized as such and displayed accordingly. - In some implementations, contact data class 1415 includes a predefined set of data kinds and additional data kinds that are added, e.g., by different applications. The set of data kinds that can be stored in
contacts class 1405 can thus be open-ended. Such additional data kinds can also be the subject of requests and responses between a correspondingserver interface module 1045 and its server. - In some implementations, first generic fields (e.g., “data_1”) form an indexed column in a contact data class table and store data that is expected to be frequently used in database queries. For example, in the case of a row representing an electronic mail address, the first generic field can generally include the electronic mail address itself. Other generic fields can store auxiliary information that characterizes the data in the first generic field, such as whether the electronic mail address stored in the first generic field is a home or business electronic mail address.
-
Status update class 1420 is a class that stores a contact's latest status updates from a corresponding raw contact characterized inraw contact class 1410. Among the information that may be stored instatus update class 1420 are a numeric or other unique identifier of the contact data class instance that is characterized in the status update class instance (i.e., “data_ID”), a uniform resource identifier (URI) or other identifier of a storage location of an icon that represents the entity with which the contact has the corresponding account (i.e., “source_icon”), a uniform resource identifier (URI) or other identifier of a storage location of a name or other label identifying the entity with which the contact has the corresponding account (i.e., “source_label”), a numeric or other identify of the contact's latest status (i.e., “status”), any text of the status update (e.g., “text”), and a timestamp when status was last updated by the contact at the corresponding account (e.g., “timestamp”). - The status updates that can be stored in
status update class 1420 can take a variety of forms. For example, in some implementations, the contact's latest status (i.e., “status”) is constrained to have one of a predetermined set of allowed values, such as “offline,” “invisible,” “away,” “idle,” “do_not_disturb,”, and “available,” whereas the text of a status update (i.e., “status”) can have a range of values such as, e.g., “having lunch” or “enjoying watching Federer rally against Nadal in Palm Springs,” as shown inFIG. 7 . - A database schema such as
database schema 1405 provides a number of different advantages. For example, different numbers of different kinds of accounts can be associated with each contact. The account information is stored in data structures that can accommodate not only a variety of different types of accounts but also new types of accounts as they are developed by different entities that mediate social interaction. In some implementations, information characterizing the accounts can be stored in a single data table, with records characterizing different kinds of accounts interspersed among each other. - A single most recent status update can be stored for each different kind of account, along with information identifying the time when status was last updated by the contact at the corresponding account. In some implementations, the timestamps when status was last updated at the different accounts is used to select one of the status updates for display as the most current status update, e.g., in a social status record 900 (
FIG. 9 ). - Information drawn from a variety of different entities that mediate social interaction can be stored in a single location and integrated for use in presenting one or more of
social interaction hubs FIGS. 2-8 ) or a social interaction hub that is limited to social status records on amobile device 105. - Further, access to the information in
database schema 1405 is facilitated bydatabase schema 1405. For example, information identifying the raw contacts of a single real-world individual can be accessed relatively quickly by a search of instances ofraw contact class 1410. For example, a query can identify the rows or other records in instances ofraw contact class 1410 that share the contact_ID of a particular social interaction counterparty when determining which mode indicia are to be included in a particular contact'sindicia collection 235. Only after a particular mode indicium has been selected for an outgoing social interact do data points tied to the raw contact corresponding to the selected indicium need to be accessed from contact data class 1415. - Implementations of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions, encoded on computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. A computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Moreover, while a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially-generated propagated signal.

- Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few. Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.
