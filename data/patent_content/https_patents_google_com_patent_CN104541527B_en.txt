Server 150 can also include position data processing module 306, be configured as to position data reception module
The 302 received position datas of institute are handled.Location server 150 can in many ways be handled position historical data
And analysis.For example, can be handled original geographic location history data (such as shown in Fig. 4) with generation " visiting field
Institute " geodata.For example, can be handled position historical data through the collection for being directed to neighbouring location history data point
Group calculate the center of circle and by home position historical data with visit position it is related.The cluster of location history data point can be defined as
The physically set of location history data point close to each other, and the center of circle can be defined as the cluster of such data point
Geographic center.This can be referred to as the cluster based on distance.Furthermore it is possible to which use date and time carry out further strain position
Historical data and the cluster for generating all close data point in terms of room and time two.For example, for existing in anticipating user
The multiple data points assembled during (for example, in night) period of family, it is understood that there may be corresponding to different in the house of user
Data point of position, such as kitchen, bedroom, living room etc..Latitude may be shown for the location history data of the period
With the small size variation of longitude, but it is all involved in single place-family.Therefore, such geographically to connect whithin a period of time
Close point can be considered as indicating the cluster in single place.Small size change in location in such a period of time can with
It is observed when the various types of positions of visiting of family, above-mentioned position includes tourist attractions, holiday village, dining room, hotel etc..Pass through determination
The center of circle between position varied slightly carries out cluster and is capable of providing single geographical location to indicate visited position, and energy
It is enough associated with the time span spent there (for example, span is gone through for first from the cluster to a last position
The time of history data point).In addition, cluster can aid in reduce position data collect inaccuracy (for example, from GPS or its
The error of the position acquisition in its source) caused by location history data changeability.
Other than the center of circle to be determined as to indicating the single geographical location of visited position, other processing may include reversed
Geographic code is searched to obtain the information in relation to the position, such as address or enterprise name.It is, for example, possible to use be referred to as geography
Position data is converted to human-readable address from geographical coordinate by the processing of coding and reverse geographic coding.Geocoding refers to
It is converted the human-readable address of wherein such as 12345North Shoreline Boulevard, Mountain View, CA
For with the processing of the position data of such as geographical coordinate of latitude 37.423021 and longitude 122.083739.Reverse geographic coding
Refer to reverse process, i.e., geographical coordinate is converted into address.For carrying out the computer journey of geocoding and reverse geographic coding
Sequence another example is geocoding API.The program can receive geographical coordinate and return to corresponding address or on the contrary
?.Such information can be stored with location history data.Alternatively, these processing are able to use to home position
Historical data point carries out reverse geographic coding and therefore for example by clicking through to the location history data for being related to individual address
Row clusters and forms cluster.This can be referred to as the cluster based on address.
Data represented by clustering processing discussed above can take longitude, latitude, starting and end time
Form, wherein longitude and latitude is for the center of circle and start and end time then indicates that user appears in particular place
Time span.Clustered location history data can also include radius, can reflect inaccuracy, the people of out position measurement
Movement in the cluster or both.In addition, the data can reflect in the location history data of user for phase
With the multiple visiting in place.In such an example, which may include the vector of visiting time, wherein each visiting time
Pairing including starting and end time.
Server 150 can also include information collection module 308, be configured as collecting the field near in relation to current location
Information.The information of collection the visited position of relevant user may include the geography using location history data from the user
Position (such as from the home position historical data point center of circle calculated) carries out local search.In one example, geographical location
Position and time can be included at least.In some instances, geographical location can also include radius or the distance away from the position.
The radius can be obtained from the accuracy information in relation to the technology for obtaining geographical location or it can be based in cluster
Change in location.Alternatively, it is able to use for the pre-selected value of radius institute.The purpose for carrying out local search is to return to connect
It is bordering on the destination in the geographical location.In general, destination and sight spot are the places that can be indicated user and may visit
Enterprise, address or it is other can map mark feature.
The local search can carry out on local search engine.Local search engine can be attempt to return specific geographic
The search engine of business listing and/or related web page within region.For local search, user can input search inquiry simultaneously
And the specified geographic area that execute the search inquiry in its vicinity.Local search engine can return to correlated results to user,
Enterprise and destination in such as geographic area include and/or the related web page in relation to the geographic area.
In one example, can by using location history data from the user geographical location and will be wherein
The radius for executing search is called local search engine to carry out local search.For example, it may be possible to for latitude and longitude with
And such as 200 meters of radius carries out local search.The latitude and longitude are generally from the collection of the location history data of user
The point of group or the center of circle.The radius can be calculated as described above or its can be it is pre-selected, such as
200 meters.Expection accuracy of 200 meters of the radius in the historical data of position may be to have in the case where being in 100 meters of magnitudes
It is helped.In this way it is possible to be searched in a part as local search with firmly believing the actual purpose of user
Within the region of rope.
The local search can also return to classification for each positioned destination.For example, dining room may return to " food
The classification of product ", and theater may then return to the classification of " theater " or " art ".In some instances, the classification returned the result
It can be confined to provide the visiting most probable type in position.For example, travelling is (for example, make if user is determined going out to leave home
With the above described technology), then can it is special or at least prior to be likely to be at office near related destination of travelling,
Including for local manufacturing enterprises etc. provides the local search results in relation to tourist attractions, dining room, hotel etc..
Whether it can also include determining the position visited of user far from home location associated with the user that information is collected
More than some distance.The determination can be used to determine that user is on a journey or the user is only attached in its home location
Closely carry out normal commuting activity.In some examples, it may be desirable to exclude to indicate activity or the position of user while travelling
The data set.In order to determine that user whether far from associated home location at least certain distance, can calculate visiting position
Geographical location (for example, center location, from the address of such position reverse geographic coding, the purpose returned from local search
Position etc.) the distance between with the geographical location of associated home location.Home location associated with the user can be by
User presets, or can be determined based on the analysis to location history data associated with the user.Carrying out this really
Timing is able to use any desired distance value, but the value should be preferably sufficiently large to exclude the daily of most users
Stroke.For example, be set lower than about 10 miles of distance value and will continue include user go to work, the daily commuting of food supply retail shop etc.
Activity.By the way that sufficiently high distance value is arranged to exclude such activity, the information in relation to position of visiting can be limited to use
Open air goes out when leaving home to travel the position that (for example, on holiday when) is visited.For a user, with list its normal schedule in detail
Display compared to may the personal travelling of the more desirable travelling in relation to these types show.For example, the distance threshold can be big
About 200 miles.
In some instances, information collection module 308 can be referred to as inquiring and being interconnected by using the name in place
Net search is to collect information.For example, information collection module 308 can inquire internet search engine.Search result for example can be with
Including the place page comprising the various information in relation to the place near current location, such as related urls, the related place
Description information, such as text description, telephone number, map and picture.
In some cases, information collection module can be from the local search results for corresponding to the place near current location
Retrieve information.For example, local search can return related in place hair other than the title in the place near current location
The information of raw event.The event information for example may include one or more titles of the event, the verbal description of the event
And it is directed toward the URL of the details in relation to the event.
Information collected by information module 304 can also include arriving for the grading in the place, the history in relation to the place
Data provided by visit information, the relevant search item in relation to the place and other users.For example, number provided by other users
According to may include one or more comments, warning and patch scholar in relation to neighbouring place.In some instances, which can wrap
Include the information in relation to neighbouring place provided by the good friend (for example, other users in the social networks of user) of user.For example,
The information may include the model issued on social networks in the proximal site by the good friend of user.
The position of user can also be determined from other sources, such as be answered as user using a variety of social activities registered are provided
In any one a position use register module 310 carry out this " registering " when, when user passes through in specific position
It plugs when pin (drop a pin) is perhaps equally selected using map software and indicates its current location or works as and use
When family makes a response the prompt for its current location.
Fig. 5 is that the example of the social application run in the mobile device 120 for illustrate such as smart phone is registered screen 500

Classification algorithm.In one example, prediction module 312 constructs histogram based on the location history of user.Prediction module 312
Classification across the place visited constructs histogram.In this way, prediction module 312 easily can be arrived periodically for user
The classification of visit checks data.Prediction module 312 information can be used for predict purposes (for example, user is on Sunday 6:
00pm visits Italian restaurant) or prediction module 312 be able to use the information to construct the profile of user so as to the user
Transmit associated recommendation.
In the histogram, which may include time and date, classification and at least indicates the score repeatedly visited.
The histogram can be based on mode weekly.Although other time frame can be used, many users had based on week
Come the schedule arranged and one week may be used as convenient time frame.In addition, histogram weekly can be divided into time slot.Example
Such as, two hours time slots can be divided within one week.In this example, each two hours time slots can be as storage user
The bucket (bucket) of the classification of the enterprise to be visited during the time slot.If a time slot indicates Monday Morning from 9:
00am to 11:00am, then period proceeds to all data of visit between the bucket will be collected at this moment.It, can for one week
Can only have lesser data sample, but within more weeks in the case where building data, if specific user likes particular time-slot use
In particular category, then this situation can be determined from histogram data.The data may show specific user in the time slot
Cafe is often removed, or carries out carwash or some other enterprise sorts.As explained below, the subsequent energy of prediction module 312
Enough using the data before the time slot occurs next time ,-for example before Monday Morning 9:00am-triggering is for the spy
The recommendation of the classification often occurred in timing gap.
The data that prediction module 312 is used to construct the histogram are also based on local activity.That is, such as the above institute
It explains, the data for being potentially based on the outgoing travelling of leaving home of user can be excluded when constructing the histogram.For example, from New York
Often Tennessee may be removed on given Sunday in the user that Sunday takes a trip to Italian restaurant to have a meal and select roasting
Butcher's's dining.This selection may be the result of user's travelling and not therefore, when trial, prediction user exists for the change-of preference
Another Sunday, which is in, nearby may eat that when can exclude the data.
The search history (the selected search result of inquiry and user that such as user is submitted) of user is also to be used for
Determine the good source of user interest.It, can be right in the case where user selects to agree to and obey issued privacy limitation
Such as the user's search history being stored in inquiry log database accesses to determine the search interest of user.User into
In the case that row is searched for and selects to fall into the search result among the classification of the classification covered corresponding to the histogram, this is straight
Square figure can be by including reflecting searching in given classification in the histogram data for the category by search history field
Rope selects number and is reflected to such search.
It is time-based for generating a kind of example recommended triggering.It shows in histogram data on Sunday 6:
In the case where the trend of 00pm visiting Italian restaurant, prediction module 312 can be provided before Sunday 6:00pm for position
