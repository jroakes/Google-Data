Definitions
- This computer-based method of person identification by a facial image relates to the field of information technologies, in particular to the biometric methods of identification, which can be used to develop computer systems for identification, security, and control of access to premises and information as well as other purposes.
- eigenface technique U.S. Pat. No. RE36041
- This technique is based on image decomposition in an orthonormalized Karhunen-Loeve (KL) basis.
- KL Karhunen-Loeve
- the coefficients of the image decomposition are used as an image features vector.
- Image recognition by the eigenface technique is based on a search of a e 0 template from the set E of templates, which has the least distance to the input image f among all the other templates, also presented in KL basis as
- e 0 arg ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ min e k ⁇ ⁇ E ⁇ ⁇ f - e k ⁇ .
- the results of identification by the eigenface technique are unreliable when changes between facial images occur due to lighting conditions, as well as when there are errors in normalization of the facial image that is being recognized.
- a face feature index or vector is a sequence of pairs such as ⁇ element code, model code>.
- a template of a person's face in a database is a “generalized face bunch graph” with its nodes corresponding to nodes of a net overlaid over the inputted facial image. Face features are determined for each of these nodes. These features are the informative characteristics of a face around the point corresponding to the graph node. These features represent absolute values of convolutions of the image with 32 two-dimensional Gabor filters.
- a Gabor filter is a linear filter whose impulse response is defined by a harmonic function multiplied by a Gaussian function.
- the Fourier transform of a Gabor filter's impulse response is the convolution of the Fourier transform of the harmonic function and the Fourier transform of the Gaussian function. More than one feature vector may correspond to each of these graph nodes.
- the feature vectors relate to different variations of the respective image element (e.g., open eyes, closed eyes).
- FIG. 1 is a flow diagram of the method for facial image recognition.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of the method for searching for eye pupil centers.
- FIG. 3 illustrates arcs along which the gradients are calculated during searching for the eye pupil centers.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a diagrammatic representation of a computer system according to one embodiment.
- An input facial image in one example embodiment, is normalized to a predetermined scale and oriented based on the detected eye pupil centers by the algorithms described below, and subsequently normalized by brightness using additional algorithms.
- Distances between an input and a template image are measured based on DCT (Discrete Cosine Transformation) features of the image blocks, which may be calculated in two stages. First, the distances are calculated as a weighted sum of minimal distances between each facial image block and the subset of template blocks. Then, the facial image blocks and the template blocks are overlapped. The facial image is then recognized based on these distances.
- DCT Discrete Cosine Transformation
- the computer-based method of face recognition may comprise the following steps:
- FIG. 1 illustrates, in accordance with one example embodiment described below, image recognition, mono image template creation, and 3D stereo pair template creation.
- FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate how, in one example embodiment, eye pupils are found and arcs along which the gradients are calculated during searching for the eye pupil centers.
- localization of faces in the image consists of two stages.
- AdaBoost Adaptive Boost
- the rectangles covering quasi-frontal faces in the image are defined.
- the face position is defined more precisely within the limits of each previously determined rectangle.
- Such definition may be based on detection of the eye pupil centers by one of the following two methods.
- the first method is based on the “AdaBoost” algorithm trained on large numbers of eye images. Experiments have shown that this is a reliable method for detection of the eye pupil centers in video facial images when the same faces from different video frames are oriented differently and eyes are narrowed or closed.
- the second method is based on direct detection of the eye pupils and is the most appropriate for using in access control systems typically dealing with frontally oriented facial images with open eyes. Under such circumstances, the second method typically may provide more precise detection results than the first method.
- This second method is based on a search of face features describing pairs of pupils, and consists of the following steps or phases.
- a comparatively small number of points are searched, each of which may be the center of an eye pupil in the picture, and for each point, a determination is made of the most appropriate value of the pupil's radius with a center in this point.
- all pairs of points located approximately on a horizontal line and at a certain distance from each other are considered.
- the value of the compatibility between the points in the pair is determined for each of these pairs.
- the centers of the eye pupils may be selected based on a predetermined threshold of compatibility.
- the segments should meet the following conditions:
- the first stage may be performed faster than the second stage because at the first stage, a number of operations do not depend on the evaluated pupil radius r.
- the values of the coordinates of the pupil centers and the radiuses r are defined. For an eye pupil with the center at the point (x, y), the most appropriate value is considered to be that of pupil radius r 0 , which corresponds to the maximum value Grad (x, y, r 0 ) of change in radial direction of total pixel brightness at the left [ ⁇ 45°, 60°] and the right [120°, 225°] arcs of the circle with center (x, y) and radius r 0 .
- average intensities of image pixels Br L , (x t ,y t , r t ) and Br R (x t ,y t , r t ) are determined. Pixels are localized along the left and the right arcs, respectively, of the circle with center (x t ,y t ) and radius r t .
- the list of points that are candidates for eye pupil center is reduced at the end of the second stage.
- a point is excluded from the list if there is another point with a greater value of index (1) nearby.
- SIM(t 1 , t 2 ) Sim(t 1 )+Sim(t 2 )+Sim a (t 1 , t 2 ), where t 1 and t 2 are the centers of the eye pupils.
- the value of an additional index Sim a (t 1 , t 2 ) decreases when the angle of the line tilt connecting these points is greater than 15°, or if the parameters of the respective pupils differ by a threshold value.
- a person's face is localized based on the selection of such a pair of points—centers of eye pupils that has a maximum value of their common index SIM(t 1 , t 2 ) among all other pairs and this value exceeds the certain threshold.
- these images before comparing the input facial image with the template image, these images must be reduced to a standard form, in which the coordinates of the eye pupil centers in the image have certain fixed values.
- the line that connects these pupil centers must be horizontal.
- Such normalization may be performed by rotating and zooming the image.
- the zooming coefficient is calculated by the formula:
- eyes_dist is the fixed distance between the centers of the eye pupils.
- this image may be normalized by brightness by the following two methods:
- normalization of image by histogram equalization is invariant to any monotone function of brightness of image pixels, including any affine transformation of brightness. Under such conditions, the order of pixels by value of their brightness is preserved, and changes happen only in the values themselves. If the input image histogram has any peaks, these peaks will be preserved on the histogram of the normalized image, i.e., equalization does not affect the general form of the histogram, and only extends it along the whole interval [0, 255].
- the algorithm of image normalization by brightness which uses a non-linear equalization of the histogram, includes the following steps. First of all, the histogram h(j) of brightness of image pixels f (x, y) is determined:
- f norm ⁇ ( x , y ) C ⁇ ( f ⁇ ( x , y ) ) C ⁇ ( 255 ) ⁇ 255.
- Local contrast Lc(x, y) in pixel (x, y) shall be determined as a ratio of this pixel brightness and average image brightness within a predetermined neighborhood:
- normalization based on a calculation of the local contrast may be more efficient as compared to the previous algorithm in the following cases:
- a normalized facial image will be compared with normalized template images kept in the database.
- template facial images shall correspond to different orientations of a face in left-right and upward-downward directions. Accordingly, image normalization of such faces may not be performed solely based on values of coordinates of eye pupil centers.
- Templates to be used in comparison to such images may be obtained either by processing of some input images (“Mono” method), or by a preliminary reconstruction of a 3D face model by stereo-pair image (D. Ryabokon, “Reconstruction of spatial configuration of objects and scenes using their stereo-images,” Control systems and machines, 2005, No. 1, Kiev, pp. 22-31) and subsequent application of these 3D models for generation of template images which correspond to the different angles of face orientations in space (“Mono3D” method).
- the recognition of a normalized input facial image is based on the calculation of the distance of this image to every normalized template image in the database.
- input and template images may be split into pixel blocks (e.g., 8 ⁇ 8 pixel blocks) and each of these blocks may be described by a set of features obtained from the DCT of this block (Z. M. Hafed and H. D. Levine. “Face recognition using the discrete cosine transform,” International Journal of Computer Vision, 43(3), 2001).
- each block that has vertical and horizontal neighboring blocks it is necessary to a) calculate the table (e.g., 8 ⁇ 8) of DCT coefficients of this block, b) extract a predetermined number of the most informative (e.g., first 15) DCT coefficients via a zigzag scan of the DCT coefficients for this block starting at a corner (e.g., the top-left coefficient), and c) replace the first DCT coefficients (e.g., first three) by values (e.g., two values) being the weighted differences of corresponding coefficients in neighboring horizontal and vertical blocks.
- a number of feature values for the block are obtained. For example, if the number of the extracted most informative DCT coefficients is 15 and the number of replaced first DCT coefficients is 3, then the number of the feature values for the block is 18.
- the distance of the facial image to a template is a weighted sum of the distances between the blocks in the facial image and the template blocks.
- the distance of each image block to the template may be calculated as the shortest among nine values comprising the first distance to the corresponding template block with the same coordinates and the distances of the image block to eight template blocks that are neighbors of this corresponding template block.
- the distances between every two blocks add up to the sum of 18 items, each being the absolute value of the difference between corresponding features, divided by the sum of the absolute values of those features.
- Weighting during summing of per block distances may be performed by defining a weight map according to the location of the block.
- Weighted distances per block may then be sorted and a small part of the first most-different blocks are discarded and not accounted for in the overall image to template distance. This kind filtering allows reliable recognition of faces, which are mostly close but have large differences in very small areas of the image.
- the distance of the facial image to the template may be calculated in two steps.
- the blocks are not overlapped.
- each block overlaps its horizontally and vertically neighboring blocks by 50%. Therewith, the second step is carried out only if the distance obtained in the first step is close to the predetermined threshold.
- recognition of the input grayscale image may be organized into two stages ( FIG. 1 ).
- the input image and template images may be normalized by brightness using histogram equalization. If, at the first stage, the decision is made that the person on the image is not known, there may be a recognition attempt in the second stage.
- the input image and templates may be normalized using a local contrast calculation. Experiments have shown that using these two methods of normalization by brightness may reduce the dependency of the recognition results on lighting conditions and increase recognition accuracy (Hansen F. Chen, Peter N. Belhumeur, and David W. Jacobs. “In search of illumination invariants,” In Proc. of CVPR-2000, Hilton Head, S.C., USA, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 1254-1261).
- decision-making in each of the two stages may comprise the following calculations:
- the decision on rejection of an image as not known may be made when d (1) is greater than the predetermined threshold ⁇ 1 (the template image is not similar to the input one), or when a is less than the predetermined threshold ⁇ 2 (two template images are similar to the input one). Otherwise, the decision may be made that the person p j is depicted in the input image.
- the template is a 3D model of a person's head, which may facilitate generation of template images corresponding to different head orientations in space.
- This method may be more accurate than the Mono method for smaller changes in angular orientation (e.g., up to 25°) of a person's head.
- the technology described herein facilitates automated 3D reconstruction of an object using stereo-pairs of images being used to build a 3D model of a face.
- the decision may be made based on the DCT classifier described above.
- FIG. 4 shows a diagrammatic representation of a machine in the example electronic form of a computer system 400 , within which a set of instructions for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein may be executed.
- the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines.

- 3D model templates were used to generate each stereo-pair face image. Because of the unavailability of external databases of such templates, seventeen 3D models of real persons' faces were created for testing of a Mono3D algorithm. Each of these 3D templates was used for obtaining 11 template images that correspond to different orientation changes (up to 25°) from a frontal position of the person's head.

- the first mode (Test for identification)
- a template of a person being recognized is included in the database. Accordingly, the correct decision is an accurate recognition of a person; an error is made if a person is recognized incorrectly, and the recognition is not made when the system cannot recognize the person.
- Test for access denial To test if no recognition is made when there is no corresponding image in the database (Test for access denial); a database was chosen having no template of a person whose image was input in the algorithm. In this case, the only correct decision is rejection of recognition.
- the Mono3D algorithm provides higher accuracy than the Mono algorithm. Most errors were caused by lighting condition differences between the template and the input image as well as changes in facial expression. A smaller percentage of errors (e.g., 1.1%) were caused by the wrong localization of the face or the eyes in the image. The third source of errors was excessive rotations of the image.
- results of one example embodiment using the Mono algorithm were worse when compared to those of the Mono3D algorithm but better than that of well-known algorithms utilized in the CSU Face Identification Evaluation System.
- the results of the Mono algorithm may be improved by using several template images instead of one for each person. These templates may differ from one another, for example, by orientations of the head, facial expressions, lighting conditions, etc.
Abstract
Description
-
- localization of the facial image;
- detection of the eye pupil centers on the face;
- normalization of the facial image by scaling and rotation so that the coordinates of pupil centers in the facial image have certain fixed values;
- normalization of the image based on the brightness;
- computation of distances between the normalized input and template images from the database, obtained either by processing some of the input images, or by using preliminarily reconstructed 3D face models based on stereo-pair images; distances are computed based on DCT features, defined on the overlapped blocks of the input and template images;
- recognition of an input facial image based on computed distances.
-
- a) the values of image brightness gradient at the line segment ends exceed a threshold value;
- b) the average brightness Bright(x, y, and r) of image pixels along this line segment is below a threshold value, and r is an admissible value of pupil radius.
Grad(x t ,y t ,r t)=Grad L(x t ,y t ,r t)+Grad R(x t ,y t ,r t) are determined,
where
Grad L(x t ,y t ,r t)=Br L(x t ,y t ,r t+2)−Br L(x t ,y t ,r t),
Grad R(x t ,y t ,r t)=Br R(x t ,y t ,r t+2)−Br H(x t ,y t ,r t),
-
- if the following is met:
max(Grad L(x t ,y t ,r t),Grad R(x t ,y t ,r t))>10,
min(Grad L(x t ,y t ,r t),Grad R(x t ,y t ,r t))>0. - Finally, Grad(x, y, r0)=Grad(xtc, ytc, rtc) and r0=rtc, where Grad(xtc, ytc, rtc) is maximal gradient value among all other calculated values. Then the quality index of point t(x, y) is to be the center of the pupil with radius r calculated by the formula:
Sim(t)=Grad(x,y,r)−Bright(x,y,r)·0.25+r. (1)
- if the following is met:
the distance between these points is greater than 4.5·D and less than 9·D, where D=(r 1 +r 2); a)
|x 2 −x 1 |>|y 2 −y 1|·2.8; b)
|r 2 −r 1|≦2. c)
a=−arc tan(b y /b x),
where b is the vector connecting eye pupil centers.
where eyes_dist is the fixed distance between the centers of the eye pupils.
At the second step, the so-called “cumulative” histogram C(i) is obtained:
-
- where r is a parameter determining degree of nonlinearity. For normalization of facial images, one shall use r=0.5 or r=1.
-
- the lighting is not frontal (i.e., the source of lighting is not located in front of the face, but, for example, on a side);
- the image has a limited dynamic brightness range (i.e., in insufficient or evening lighting).
