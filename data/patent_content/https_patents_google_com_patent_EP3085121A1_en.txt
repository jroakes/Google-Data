Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to identifying entities associated with wireless network access points.
- Electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, mobile phones, wearable computing devices, and other electronic devices, can scan for available wireless network access points (e.g. Wi-Fi hotspots) for connection to a network, such as the Internet.
- An electronic device can provide for display a user interface presenting the available wireless network access points for connection by the electronic device. The user can then interact with the user interface to connect with wireless network access point.
- an electronic device can see many different wireless network access points. In some cases, it can be difficult to determine the entity or establishment with which the wireless network access point is associated.
- Location-based services can leverage the physical location of an electronic device to provide an enhanced service or experience for a user.
- a location-based service can use one of several techniques for determining the position of an electronic device. For instance, signal strength of various wireless network access points detected by an electronic device can be used to determine the location of an electronic device. The location of the electronic device and other information can optionally be used to provide personalized applications and services.
- One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer- implemented method of identifying an entity associated with a wireless network access point.
- the method includes accessing, by one or more computing devices, an estimated location of a wireless network access point and accessing, by the one or more computing devices, a network name associated with the wireless network access point.
- the method further includes analyzing, by the one or more computing devices, the network name to identify at least one text signal and identifying, by the one or more computing devices, an entity associated with the wireless network access point based at least in part on the text signal and the estimated location of the wireless network access point.
- the method further includes providing, by the one or more computing devices, information associated with the entity for display in a graphical user interface.
- FIG. 1 depicts an example representation of detected wireless network access points by an electronic device
- FIG. 2 depicts an example system for identifying an entity associated with a wireless network access point according to example embodiments of the present disclosure
- FIG. 3 depicts an example method for identifying an entity associated with a wireless network access point according to example embodiments of the present disclosure
- FIG. 4 depicts a flow diagram of an example method for identifying an entity associated with a wireless network access point based at least in part on a confidence score according to example embodiments of the present disclosure
- FIG. 5 depicts the example identification of a plurality of candidate entities associated with a wireless network access point according to example embodiments of the present disclosure
- FIG. 6 depicts an example user interface providing a semantic location of an access point according to example embodiments of the present disclosure
- FIG. 7 depicts an example computing systems according to example embodiments of the present disclosure.
- example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to identifying entities, such as local businesses, restaurants, cafes, museums, establishments, and other entities, associated with wireless network access points (e.g. Wi-Fi access points) detectable by electronic devices.
- Good approximations of the locations of wireless network access points can be difficult to obtain.
- approximations of wireless network access point locations can be determined based on satellite positioning information (e.g. GPS data) and wireless network access point data (e.g. connection data and signal strength). These approximations can be of low quality in areas where satellite positioning information quality is low, such as in indoor environments. In addition, these approximations may not provide semantic information naming the entity with which the wireless network access point is associated.
- Network names can be analyzed using various text analysis techniques (e.g. tokenization techniques) to recognize wireless network access points belonging to entities with high confidence.
- the entity information can be provided to the user. For instance, information associated with the entity can be provided for display in a graphical user interface to the user. The information can be semantic information naming the entity associated with the wireless network access point.
- user device connections to the wireless network access point can be used, for instance, to provide a strong signal indicative of the location of the user device.
- data identifying a wireless network access point can be accessed, for instance, by an electronic device (e.g. smartphone, tablet, mobile phone, wearable computing device, etc.) detecting the wireless network access point.
- the data identifying the wireless network access point can include a network name (e.g. SSID) associated with the wireless network access point.
- An estimated location of the wireless network access point can be obtained from, for instance, position data associated with an electronic device detecting the wireless network access point and/or signal strength of the wireless network access point and other wireless network access points detected by the electronic device. The estimated location of the wireless network access point in
- combination with the network name can be used to reliably identify the entity associated with the wireless network access point.
- a database of entity information that links entities to geographic locations can be accessed.
- a set of candidate entities can be determined based on the estimated location of the wireless network access point.
- the set of candidate entities can be the set of entities that are located within a defined radius of the estimated location of the wireless network access point.
- the size of the radius can be defined as a function of, for instance, an uncertainty associated with the estimated location of the wireless network access point, an uncertainty associated with an entity's location in a database of entity information, and an estimated range of the wireless network access point.
- a confidence score can be determined for each of the candidate entities.
- the confidence score for a candidate entity can be indicative of how likely the wireless network access point is associated with the candidate entity.
- the candidate entity having the highest confidence score and/or a confidence score that exceeds a threshold can be identified as associated with the wireless network access point. For instance, if entity A has a confidence score of .85 and entity B has a confidence score of .64, the entity A can be identified as associated with the wireless network access point.
- the confidence score for each candidate entity can be determined based at least in part on the network name associated with the wireless network access point using a scoring function. More particularly, the network name can be analyzed using textual analysis techniques to identify one or more text signals or tokens.
- the scoring function can determine a confidence score based on the text signals. For example, the scoring function can provide a confidence score by matching text signals with at least a portion of an entity name or other text or information associated with an entity (e.g. address, website, phone number, etc.). Each match between a text signal and at least a portion of the entity name or other information associated with the entity can be weighted and used to calculate the confidence score.
- an entity name or other text or information associated with an entity e.g. address, website, phone number, etc.
- the scoring function can take into account other parameters in determining the confidence score, including, but not limited to, popularity of text signals in network names both regionally and nationally, complexity of the text signals, such as the length of the signal token, distance between the estimated location of the wireless network access point and the location of the entity, signals indicative of the user being present at the entity at the time of detection of the wireless network access point (e.g. the user check in at the entity using social media), the location of other wireless network access points, and other factors.
- the reliable identification of entities associated with wireless network access points can be used for a variety of purposes.
- the identified entity can be used to provide information associated with that entity such as its official name, phone number, or business hours, in association with the wireless network access points in a graphical user interface. This can help the user in determining whether to connect to a particular wireless network.
- a user at Cafe Intermezzo can desire to connect to the wireless network access point associated with Cafe Intermezzo as opposed to a different nearby wireless network access point associated with a different entity.
- the graphical user interface can provide information indicating that a particular network is associated with Cafe
- Intermezzo so that the user can more easily connect to the proper wireless network access point.
- this can be provide a very reliable signal that the user was located at the entity in a location- based services platform.
- This signal can be used for a variety of purposes, such as for location-based services optionally requested by the user or to be used as training data for a model used to identify user device locations based at least in part on proximity to wireless network access points.
- Various embodiments discussed herein may access and analyze personal information about users and/or entities, or make use of personal information or entity information, such as wireless network access point information, user device location information, user connection information, and other information.
- personal information or entity information such as wireless network access point information, user device location information, user connection information, and other information.
- the users and entities may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect the information and control whether and/or how to receive content from the system or other application. No such information or data is collected or used until the user has been provided meaningful notice of what information is to be collected and how the information is used. The information is not collected or used unless the user provides consent, which can be revoked or modified by the user at any time.
- the user can have control over how such information is collected and used by the application or system.
- certain information or data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user.

- this can be a reliable signal indicative of the user being present at the entity matched with the wireless network access point. This can be used, for instance, to provide information to the user based on the user's semantic location.
- FIG. 3 depicts a flow diagram of an example method (200) for identifying an entity associated with a wireless network access point according to example embodiments of the present disclosure.
- the method (200) can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in FIG. 7.
- FIG. 3 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion. Those of ordinary skill in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will understand that various steps of any of the methods disclosed herein can be adapted, omitted, rearranged, expanded, or modified in various ways without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure.
- the method includes accessing an estimated location of a wireless network access point.
- Accessing the estimated location of the wireless network access point can include accessing previously determined estimated location information stored, for instance, in a memory and/or can include determining an estimated location of a wireless network access point, for instance, based at least in part on signal strength of the wireless network access point.
- the estimated location of the wireless network access point can have a degree of uncertainty. For instance, the estimated location can have an uncertainty of 1 km relative to the actual location of the wireless network access point.
- the method includes accessing a network name associated with the wireless network access point.
- wireless network access points can broadcast a network name (e.g. SSID) that is detectable by electronic devices.
- the network name can include a text string having a plurality of characters.
- Accessing a network name can include obtaining a network name for the wireless network access point, for instance, provided by an owner of the wireless network access point and stored in a memory or can also include detecting a network name broadcast by the wireless network access point.
- the method can include analyzing the network name to identify at least one text signal.
- a text signal can refer to a token (e.g. a set of one or more characters that form words, phrases, symbols or other meaningful elements) derived from at least portion of the network name.
- the network name can be analyzed to identify one or more text signals using a variety of textual analysis techniques.
- the text signals can be identified using one or more generic tokenization techniques for a particular language. For instance, tokenization can be performed based on spacing and punctuation marks for network names in the English language. For network names in other languages, such as polysynthetic languages or orthographies without word spacing, other more advanced tokenization techniques can be used to tokenize a network name into one or more text signals.
- text signals can be identified based on boundaries between character classes. As an example, [cafe] and [123] can be identified as relevant text signals from the network name "Cafe 123.” Text signals can also be identified based at least in part on upper/lower case distinctions in the network name. For instance, BobsCafe can be tokenized into [Bobs] and [Cafe] and/or [bobs cafe]. In particular implementations, a generic n-gram model for likely word boundaries in a language can be used to identify text signals.
- the text signals can be filtered based on a corpus of default network names and default name patterns to remove text signals associated with common network names that are unlikely to carry entity information. For instance, text signals such as [default], [NET GEAR], [2 Wire] can be filtered as these text signals are unlikely to provide much information about the entity associated with the wireless network access point.
- the method includes identifying an entity associated with the wireless network access point based at least in part on the one or more text signals and the estimated location of the wireless network access point. More particularly, a set of candidate entities can be identified based on the estimated location of the wireless network access point.
- Confidence scores can be generated for the set of candidate entities based at least in part on the text signals identified from the network name.
- the confidence scores can be used to rank the candidate entities and/or to select the candidate entity most likely to be associated with the wireless network access point.
- FIG. 4 depicts a flow diagram of an example method (300) for identifying an entity associated with a wireless network access point based at least in part on a confidence score according to example embodiments of the present disclosure.
- the method (300) can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in FIG. 7.
- a database of entity information can be accessed.
- the database of entity information can link entities in a geographic area to a particular location.
- the database of entity information can be a database in a geographic information system that indexes information by geographic coordinates of its elements.
- Other suitable databases of entity information can be accessed without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure.
- the database of entity information can link entities to geographic locations with degree of uncertainty. For instance, the locations of entities provided by the database of entity information can be accurate to within a degree of uncertainty associated with the database of entity information.
- the database of entity information can be accessed, for instance, from a remote computing device such as a web server associated with a geographic information system.
- the database of entity information can also be stored locally on a client device.
- a regional dataset can be fetched from a remote device and stored locally at a client device. The information can then be processed at the client device according to any of the example methods according to aspects of the present disclosure to identify an entity associated with a wireless network access point.
- the regional dataset can include information associated with local establishments as well as regionally common stop- words to be used, for instance, in determining a confidence score for one or more entities as will be discussed in more detail below.
- the regional dataset can be compressed tightly so that it can be downloaded to a client device at reduced expense of bandwidth and client device storage.
- the regional dataset can be fetched based at least in part on the location of a user device as determined, for instance, by a positioning system.
- a plurality of candidate entities can be identified based on the estimated location of the wireless network access point. More particularly, the set of entities associated with a geographic location within a defined radius of the estimated location of the wireless network access point in the database of entity information can be identified as the plurality of candidate entities.
- the radius can be defined as a preset value.
- the radius can be defined based on one or more parameters, such as an uncertainty associated with the estimated location of the wireless network access point, an uncertainty associated the location of the entity in a database of entity information, and an estimated range of the wireless network access point.
- FIG. 5 depicts the example identification of a plurality of candidate entities associated with a wireless network access point according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure.
- a wireless network access point AP can have an estimated location at 410.
- the plurality of candidate entities can be identified as the entities in a database of entity information associated with a location that is within a space 415 defined by a radius about the estimated location 410 of the wireless network access point 410.
- X can be the uncertainty associated with the estimated location of the wireless network access point (e.g. 1 km).
- Y can be the uncertainty associated with the location of an entity in the database of entity information (e.g. 200 m).
- Z can be the estimated maximum distance at which a signal from a wireless network access point can be detected (e.g. 400 m).
- radius R can be equal to the sum of the uncertainty associated with the estimated location of the wireless network access point and the estimated maximum distance at which a signal from a wireless network access point can be detected.
- Entity A, entity B, entity C, and entity D can each have an estimated location in a database of entity information (e.g. a geographic information system database). The circles around the respective entities are representative of the varying uncertainties associated with the locations of each entity in the database of entity information.
- entity A, entity B, entity C, and entity D can have a location (taking into account the uncertainty) within the radius R of the estimated location 410 of the wireless network access point. Accordingly, entity A, entity B, entity C, and entity D can be identified as candidate entities.
- Entity E is not associated with a location within radius R of the estimated location 410 of the wireless network access point. Entity E is not identified as a candidate entity.
- a confidence score can be determined for each identified candidate entity based at least in part on the one or more text signals identified from the network name.
- the confidence score can be indicative of how likely the entity is associated with the wireless network access point.
- the confidence score for each candidate entity can be determined using a scoring function.
- the scoring function can provide a confidence score for each of the plurality of candidate entities as a function of the one or more text signals.
- the scoring function can be configured to provide a confidence score based at least in part on a match between the text signal and name information associated with the entity.
- the confidence score can be determined, for instance, based on each match of the text signal with one or more aspects of the entity names. Each match can contribute to the confidence score in accordance with a weighting factor assigned to the match.
- Example matches between text signals and entity name or other entity information are provided as follows: (1) match with the full name of the entity (e.g., the entity name "Cafe Intermezzo” matched with text signal [cafe intermezzo]); (2) match with individual words in the entity name (e.g., the entity name "Cafe Intermezzo” matched with the text signal [intermezzo]); (3) match based on word prefixes; (e.g., the entity name "Cafe Intermezzo" matched with
- Network name patterns can also be clustered for multiple branches of the same business. For instance, the network name "Hotel Rewards Wifi" can be associated with multiple branches of the same hotel. A text signal [hotel rewards wifi] can be matched with the branch of the hotel located proximate to the estimated location of the wireless network access point, if there is such a branch. Other suitable factors can be considered when matching a text signal with an entity without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure.
- the contribution of each match to the confidence score can be modified and/or determined based on various factors. For instance, text signals indicative of frequent names (e.g. first or last names, terms frequently occurring in business names such as [inc], [bros], or [cafe]) can be downweighted in determining the confidence score for an entity. As an example, a confidence score determined based on a text signal [John] matched with the entity name "John's cafe” should be lower than a confidence score determined based on the text signal [brobdingnag] matched with the entity name "Brobdingnag Massage Parlor.”
- the scoring function can determine and/or modify the confidence score based on a popularity associated with text signals. For instance, regional popularity of text signals can be used to downweight matches with the text signals. As an example, a text signal [bear] near UC Berkeley can be very popular. A match between the text signal [bear] and the entity name "Bear Essentials" should be downweighted. [0053] Text signals associated with local geographic terms can also be downweighted. For instance, the text signal [Springfield] can be fairly common in the town of Springfield, Illinois. As a result, matches based on the text signal [Springfield] should be downweighted when matching an wireless network access point located in or near Springfield, IL, but not when matching a wireless network access point located far away from any town named Springfield.
- Global popularity can also be used to determine and/or modify a confidence score associated with an entity. For instance, matches based on common text signals such as [wifi], [inc], [11c], can be downweighted. Low entropy signals can also be downweighted. For instance, matches based on text signals with one or two characters (e.g. [at]) can be deemphasized in the determination of the confidence score.
- the scoring function can modify and/or determine the confidence score based at least in part on a distance between the estimated location of the wireless network access point and the location of the candidate entity as determined, for instance, from the database of entity information. A smaller distance between the estimated location of the wireless network access point and the location of the candidate entity can result in a higher confidence score for the entity.
- the following factors can be considered in determining and/or modifying the confidence score based on this distance: (1) the shortest feasible distance between the location/layout of the entity and the estimated location of the candidate access point; (2) probability distributions of the error in estimates of the geometry of the premises and the estimated location of the wireless network access point; and/or (3) probability distributions for wireless network access point visibility (experimentally derived or theoretical), taking into account, for instance, general information about the nearby location (e.g. urban v. rural or population/building density) or specific information (e.g. the typical absorption of a wireless network access point signal by specific walls expected to be between the wireless network access point and the establishment).
- general information about the nearby location e.g. urban v. rural or population/building density
- specific information e.g. the typical absorption of a wireless network access point signal by specific walls expected to be between the wireless network access point and the establishment.
- the scoring function can use one or more other signals or factors to determine the confidence score. For example, a user presence signal that is strongly indicative of a user being present at an entity (e.g. a social network check-in) can be used to determine the confidence score for an entity. As another example, the known locations of other wireless network access points and/or the reliable identification of entities associated with other wireless network access points can be used to determine and/or modify a confidence score determined for an entity. For instance, a text signal matched with an entity known to already be associated with a different wireless network access point can be downweighted in the determination of the confidence score.
- a user presence signal that is strongly indicative of a user being present at an entity (e.g. a social network check-in) can be used to determine the confidence score for an entity.
- the known locations of other wireless network access points and/or the reliable identification of entities associated with other wireless network access points can be used to determine and/or modify a confidence score determined for an entity. For instance, a text signal matched with an entity known to already be
- the entity associated with the wireless network access point can be identified based on the confidence score determined for each of the plurality of candidate entities.
- the plurality of candidate entities can be ranked based on the confidence scores determined for each of the plurality of candidate entities. The highest ranked candidate entity can be identified as the entity associated with the wireless network access point.
- the confidence score for each candidate entity can be compared to a threshold. If the confidence score for a candidate entity exceeds the threshold, the candidate entity can be identified as the entity associated with the wireless network access point.
- the entity can be output for use by one or more systems or applications.
- information associated with the entity e.g. the name of the entity
- the user can use the information associated with the identified entity, for instance, to determine whether to connect to a particular wireless network access point.

- the semantic entity name "University" can be displayed in conjunction with the wireless network access point having a network name Student Wifi as shown at 524 in the graphical user interface 520.
- the semantic information naming the entity can assist the user in picking the wireless network access point with which to connect.
- Information identifying the entity associated with the wireless network access point can be used for other purposes. For instance, referring to FIG. 3 at (212), the location of the electronic device can be determined based at least in part on the identified entity. More particularly, a signal can be received indicative of a user device connecting (e.g. through an authentic or other suitable connection) to the wireless network access point associated with the entity. This can be a very reliable signal that the electronic device is located at the entity. Accordingly, the semantic location (e.g. name of the entity) of the user device can be identified from information associated with the entity identified as associated with the wireless network access point.
- the reliable signal of electronic device location can be used for a variety of purposes. For instance, the semantic location of the electronic device can be presented to the user in a graphical user interface. The location of the electronic device can be used for one or more location-based services, such as focused search results, travel directions, etc. The reliable signal of electronic device location can also be used to determine information associated with the entity, such as popularity of the entity, trending, repeat visits, peak times, hours of operation, and other characteristics of the entity. The reliable signal of electronic device location can also be used as ground truth data for constructing a model correlating semantic location information with, for instance, electronic device proximity to wireless network access points or other electronic device location signals.
