Definitions
- Online content may be received from various first-party or third-party sources.
- first-party content refers to the primary online content requested or displayed by the client device.
- first-party content may be a webpage requested by the client or a stand-alone application (e.g., a video game, a chat program, etc.) running on the device.
- Third-party content in contrast, refers to additional content that may be provided in conjunction with the first-party content.
- third-party content may be a public service announcement or advertisement that appears in conjunction with a requested webpage (e.g., a search result webpage from a search engine, a webpage that includes an online article, a webpage of a social networking service, etc.) or within a stand-alone application (e.g., an advertisement within a game).
- a first-party content provider may be any content provider that allows another content provider (i.e., a third-party content provider) to provide content in conjunction with that of the first-party.
- third-party content may be selected for presentation with first-party content based on the results of a content auction.
- third-party content providers may place bids in a content auction to compete for the ability to provide an advertisement with first-party content.
- the third-party content providers may also have disparate goals in mind when placing content auction bids. For example, a provider of a public service message may wish to maximize exposure of the public service message to users. In contrast, an online retailer may wish to maximize the number of times that an advertisement is presented with first-party content and leads to an online sale.
- Implementations of the systems and methods for determining a bid modifier value to maximize a return on investment in a hybrid campaign are disclosed herein.
- One implementation is a method of determining a bid modifier value to maximize a return on investment in a hybrid campaign.
- the method includes determining, for one or more sets of keywords used in the campaign, a predicted conversion rate for a first device type and a predicted conversion rate for a second device type.
- the method also includes calculating, by a processor, predicted campaign-level conversion rates for the first and second device types using the predicted conversion rates for the one or more sets of keywords used in the campaign.
- the method further includes determining a ratio between the predicted campaign-level conversion rate for the first device type and the predicted campaign-level conversion rate for the second device type.
- the method additionally includes using the ratio as the bid modifier value that relates bids for the first device type to bids for the second device type.
- the system includes one or more processors configured to determine, for one or more sets of keywords used in the campaign, a predicted conversion rate for a first device type and a predicted conversion rate for a second device type.
- the one or more processors are also configured to calculate predicted campaign-level conversion rates for the first and second device types using the predicted conversion rates for the one or more sets of keywords used in the campaign.
- the one or more processors are further configured to determine a ratio between the predicted campaign-level conversion rate for the first device type and the predicted campaign-level conversion rate for the second device type.
- the one or more processors are also configured to use the ratio as the bid modifier value that relates bids for the first device type to bids for the second device type.
- a further implementation is a computer-readable storage medium having machine instructions stored therein, the instructions being executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform operations.
- the operations include determining, for one or more sets of keywords used in a campaign, a predicted conversion rate for a first device type and a predicted conversion rate for a second device type.
- the operations also include calculating predicted campaign-level conversion rates for the first and second device types using the predicted conversion rates for the one or more sets of keywords used in the campaign.
- the operations further include determining a ratio between the predicted campaign-level conversion rate for the first device type and the predicted campaign-level conversion rate for the second device type.
- the operations also include using the ratio as the bid modifier value that relates bids for the first device type to bids for the second device type.

- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an electronic display showing first-party search results with third-party content
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram depicting the steps taken in one implementation of a process for determining a bid modifier value for a hybrid campaign.
- FIG. 4 depicts an iterative process for determining a bid modifier value for a hybrid campaign.
- a content selection service may determine a bid amount for a third-party content provider based on any number of factors.
- the content selection service may use data indicative of interactions with third-party content to determine a bid amount on behalf of a third-party content provider (e.g., the bid amount may be based in part on how frequently users click on the third-party content when the content is selected).
- the content selection service may also use content interaction data to determine the performance of the first-party provider's content. For example, users may be more inclined to click on third-party content on certain webpages over others. Auction bids to place third-party content may be higher for high-performing websites, while the bids may be lower for low-performing websites.
- a content selection service may be configured to allow a third-party content provider to create one or more campaigns, such as an advertising campaign.
- the third-party content provider may set any number of parameters that control how and when the third-party content provider participates in a content auction.
- a campaign may include sets of one or more keywords that control when a bid is placed in a content auction on behalf of the third-party content provider. If a user executes a search query containing any of the sets of keywords, the third-party content provider may bid in a content auction to include the third-party content with the search results.
- Another auction parameter that may be set in a content selection service is a parameter that controls which device types are eligible to receive the third-party content from a third-party content provider.
- the content selection service may categorize devices as being either mobile devices (e.g., cellular phones) or desktop devices (e.g., a home computer). Tablet computing devices may be categorized under either category or their own category, but may typically fall under the desktop devices category, since many tablet devices are only WiFi enabled. Thus, a third-party content provider may specify that they only wish to provide advertisements to mobile or desktop devices. Any other grouping of device types may be used by the content selection service to control which device types are eligible to receive third-party content from a particular provider, in other implementations.
- a content selection service may allow a third-party content provider to establish a hybrid campaign in which the third-party content is eligible to be provided to two or more device types.
- a third-party content provider may place auction bids in a content auction to provide content to both desktop and mobile devices.
- the content selection service may use a bid modifier value to relate bids used for different device types.
- a bid modifier value is a value that defines a linear relationship between bids used for different device types. For example, assume that a third-party content provider places a bid of $1 for desktop devices and a bid modifier value of ⁇ 50% for mobile devices. Accordingly, the third-party content provider may bid $0.50 for mobile devices
- Some third-party content providers may have the goal of a user being presented with third-party content from the provider, the user interacting with the content (e.g., clicking on the content), and the user performing a particular action (e.g., making an online purchase, downloading software, signing up for an alert, etc.).
- the content selection service may be configured to automatically generate a bid modifier value for a third-party content provider to achieve the specified goal, such as the presentation of the provider's content leading to a user performing a particular action. For example, the content selection service may determine that a bid modifier value that relates mobile to desktop bids should be ⁇ 20%, to maximize the cost per resulting user action for the third-party content provider.
- the user may be provided with an opportunity to control which programs or features collect such information, the types of information that may be collected (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, a user's current location, etc.), and/or how third-party content may be selected by a content selection service and presented to the user.
- Certain data such as a device identifier, may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters) used by the content selection service to select third-party content.
- a device identifier may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information about its corresponding user can be determined from it.
- a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a precise location of the user cannot be determined.
- location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a precise location of the user cannot be determined.
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content selection service.

- content selection service 104 may conduct a real-time content auction in response to client device 102 requesting first-party content from one of content sources 108 , 110 or executing a first-party application.
- Content selection service 104 may use any number of factors to determine the winner of the auction.
- the winner of a content auction may be based in part on the third-party provider's bid and/or a quality score for the third-party provider's content (e.g., a measure of how likely the user of client device 102 is to click on the content).
- the highest bidder is not necessarily the winner of a content auction conducted by content selection service 104 , in some implementations.
- Content selection service 104 may be configured to allow third-party content providers to create campaigns to control how and when the provider participates in content auctions.
- a campaign may include any number of bid-related parameters, such as a minimum bid amount, a maximum bid amount, a target bid amount, or one or more budget amounts (e.g., a daily budget, a weekly budget, a total budget, etc.).
- a bid amount may correspond to the amount the third-party provider is willing to pay in exchange for their content being presented at client device 102 .
- the bid amount may be on a cost per impression or cost per thousand impressions (CPM) basis.
- a bid amount may correspond to a specified action being performed in response to the third-party content being presented at a client device.
- a bid amount may be a monetary amount that the third-party content provider is willing to pay, should their content be clicked on at the client device, thereby redirecting the client device to the provider's webpage.
- a bid amount may be a cost per click (CPC) bid amount.
- the bid amount may correspond to an action being performed on the third-party provider's website, such as the user of client device 102 making a purchase. Such bids are typically referred to as being on a cost per acquisition (CPA) or cost per conversion basis.
- CPC cost per click
- exemplary parameters that control when a bid is placed on behalf of a third-party content provider may include, but are not limited to, a topic identified using a device identifier's history data (e.g., based on webpages visited by the device identifier), the topic of a webpage or other first-party content with which the third-party content is to be presented, a geographic location of the client device that will be presenting the content, or a geographic location specified as part of a search query.
- a selection parameter may designate a specific webpage, website, or group of websites with which the third-party content is to be presented. For example, an advertiser selling golf equipment may specify that they wish to place an advertisement on the sports page of a particular online newspaper.
- Content selection service 104 may also be configured to determine a bid modifier value for use in a hybrid campaign (e.g., a campaign having parameters that specify two or more device types as being eligible to receive third-party content from a provider, such as desktop and mobile devices).
- the bid modifier value relates bids for one type of device to bids for another type of device.
- a bid modifier value of +120% that relates desktop bids to mobile bids may correspond to a mobile bid of $12 if the desktop bid is $10.
- content selection service 104 is configured to upgrade one or more campaigns to be a hybrid campaign that uses a bid modifier value.
- Content selection service 104 may generate a bid modifier value on behalf of a third-party content provider determined by content selection service 104 to optimize one or more metrics regarding the presentation of the provider's content (e.g., a conversion rate, an ROI, etc.).
- Content selection service 104 may be configured to generate a bid modifier value in some or all of the following cases: 1) sibling campaigns are merged into a single hybrid campaign (e.g., campaigns that use the same or similar parameters for different devices types), 2) a bid modifier is suggested for a hybrid campaign, or 3) automatically combining a bid modifier with a determined bid amount for bidding in a hybrid campaign.
- sibling campaigns are merged into a single hybrid campaign (e.g., campaigns that use the same or similar parameters for different devices types)
- a bid modifier is suggested for a hybrid campaign
- 3) automatically combining a bid modifier with a determined bid amount for bidding in a hybrid campaign.
- two or more campaigns that focus on different device types may be merged together based on their common parameters (e.g., keywords used in both campaigns) and a bid modifier may be used to relate bids for the different device types.
- two campaigns that specify the keywords “best insurance rates” and focus on different device types may be combined using a bid modifier value that relates bids for mobile devices to bids for desktop devices.
- bid modifier values that maximize a provider's ROI may be suggested to the provider and/or used in conjunction with varying bids that are determined to maximize the provider's ROI.
- content selection service 104 may determine a bid modifier value by calculating a predicted conversion rate for each keyword/device type pair in a campaign. For example, assume that a third-party content provider specifies the keywords “cheap insurance” and “lowest cost insurance” as keywords in one or more campaigns. Also, assume that the provider has specified both desktop and mobile devices as part of the campaigns. Content selection service 104 may determine predicted conversion rates for the “cheap insurance” keywords for both desktop and mobile devices and predicted conversion rates for the “lowest cost insurance” for both desktop and mobile devices. Content selection service 104 may determine campaign level predicted conversion rates for each device type based on the predicted keyword-level device types.
- content selection service 104 may base a bid modifier value on predicted campaign-level conversion rates for different device types.
- content selection service 104 predicts a campaign-level conversion rate for a device type using a weighted average of conversion rates for the keywords.
- the keyword-level conversion rates may be weighted using a traffic metric for the keywords (e.g., number of impressions, clicks, etc. in a given time period).
- content selection service 104 may predict a campaign-level conversion rate for a device type as follows:
- pcvr ⁇ ( device — ⁇ type ) ⁇ i ⁇ KW ⁇ click i * pcvr i ⁇ ( device — ⁇ type ) ⁇ / ⁇ ⁇ i ⁇ click i
- pcvr(device_type) is the predicted conversion rate for a particular device type (e.g., desktop devices, mobile devices, etc.)
- i represents a set of one or more keywords used in a campaign
- click i is a metric regarding the number of times a user clicked on third-party content that was selected by content selection service 104 based in part on the set of keywords.
- content selection service 104 may use the ratio of predicted campaign level conversion rates as a bid modifier value. For example, content selection service 104 may determine a bid modifier value ( ⁇ ) as follows:
- ⁇ pcvr ⁇ ( mobile ) pcvr ⁇ ( desktop )
- pcvr(mobile) and pcvr(desktop) are the predicted campaign-level conversion rates for each device type.
- Other ratios may also be used for the bid modifier value in other implementations (e.g., the ratio of a conversion rate for desktop devices to a conversion rate for mobile devices, etc.).
- content selection service 104 may determine a predicted, campaign-level conversion rate as follows:
- pcvr ⁇ ( desktop ) ⁇ i ⁇ KW ⁇ click i , d * pcvr i , d ⁇ ( desktop ) ⁇ / ⁇ ⁇ i ⁇ click i , d
- pcvri,d(desktop) is the predicted conversion rate for desktop devices using a particular set of keywords (e.g., the ith set of keywords)
- clicki,d is the number of clicks for desktop devices using the set of keywords.
- KW may represent all of the sets of keywords for a campaign.
- KW may represent all of the sets of keywords across multiple campaigns of a third-party content provider that use different device types.
- metrics regarding keyword sets that overlap in desktop-only and mobile-only campaigns may be used by content selection service 104 in the calculation of the predicted conversion rates for both mobile and desktop devices.
- content selection service 104 may not calculate a bid modifier value if traffic metrics for a third-party content provider heavily favor one device type over another.
- content selection service 104 may provide an alert to a third-party content provider that a bid modifier value cannot be determined because the provider's traffic to one device type is below a threshold amount.
- Content selection service 104 may use linear extrapolation or another projection technique to determine the value of the bid modifier value (a).
- Content selection service 104 may also iteratively calculate the projected traffic for mobile devices and the resulting bid modifier values until the bid modifier values converge on the optimal solution. For example, one projection for mobile devices may be:
- Content selection service 104 may also restrict the traffic extrapolation range using a click through rate (CTR) variance at different values based on the current bid. in other words, content selection service may determine the pcvr(mobile) as follows:
- pcvr ⁇ ( mobile ) ⁇ i ⁇ KW ⁇ projection ⁇ ( ⁇ , i ) * pcvr i , m ⁇ / ⁇ ⁇ i ⁇ projection ⁇ ( ⁇ , i )
- a is the ratio of predicted conversion rates for mobile devices to desktop devices.
- the calculations of the mobile conversion rate (e.g., pcvr(mobile)) and the bid modifier value may be repeated iteratively until a converges within a predefined threshold.
- content selection service 104 may automatically determine a new bid modifier value based on a specified goal of a third-party content provider.

- a third-party content provider may specify that he or she wishes to maximize the number of conversions or revenues the result from content selection service 104 selecting the provider's content for presentation with first-party content.
- ⁇ 0 is an initial bid modifier value determined by content selection service 104 .
- bids may be determined by content selection service 104 such that the expected return for each keyword is the same.
- CPA target cost per action
- content selection service 104 may use an iterative approach to periodically update a bid modifier value or to suggest a change to a bid modifier value to a third-party content provider.
- content selection service 104 recalculates the bid modifier value for a campaign every hour, day, week, month, or at any other periodic amount of time. For example, assume that content selection service 104 has calculated a bid modifier value m for mobile bids.
- Content selection service 104 may provide an indication of third-party content selected via a content auction to client device 102 for presentation with first-party content.
- the indication is the selected third-party content itself.
- content selection service 104 may provide an advertisement to client device 102 for presentation within an application on client device 102 (e.g., a game, a navigation program, etc.), on a first-party webpage (e.g., a webpage served by content source 108 to client device 102 ), or with first-party search results from an online search engine.
- the indication of the selected third-party content may correspond to a command sent to client device 102 that causes client device 102 to retrieve the selected third-party content.
- client device 102 may retrieve the selected third-party content from one of content sources 108 , 110 or from a cache of third-party content stored in memory 114 .
- content selection service 104 may also determine such a value for any other grouping of keywords. For example, content selection service 104 may determine a bid modifier value for a sub-group of keywords that are part of a campaign (e.g., an ad group). In another example, content selection service 104 may determine a bid modifier value at the account level for a content provider (e.g., an account that may include one or more campaigns).
- a content provider e.g., an account that may include one or more campaigns.
- client device 102 may access a first-party search engine via network 106 by executing a web browser 200 .
- the search engine may provide search results for display by client device 102 within a stand-alone application.
- a navigation application executed by client device 102 may include a search feature that allows search results from the search engine to be presented within the application.
- Web browser 200 may operate by sending a webpage request to a network address entered into field 202 by a user input device (e.g., a keypad, a touch screen display, etc.). For example, the user of client device 102 may enter the URL of www.example.org/search.html to visit the corresponding web-based search engine. Web browser 200 may also include various controls 204 configured to allow the user of client device 102 to navigate between webpages.
- a user input device e.g., a keypad, a touch screen display, etc.
- Web browser 200 may also include various controls 204 configured to allow the user of client device 102 to navigate between webpages.
- the first-party search engine accessed by client device 102 may provide a webpage 206 to client device 102 that is configured to allow for searches and search results to be updated on the fly.
- webpage 206 may include a search field 208 that receives a search query and webpage 206 may also display search results obtained using the query.
- search field 208 may be displayed separately from the search results (e.g., search field 208 and the search results may appear on different webpages, screens, etc.).
- Search field 208 is generally configured to receive one or more search terms to be searched by the search engine.
- the search term “flowers” may be entered into search field 208 and used to search for links to online resources devoted to flowers.
- a search query may be entered into search field 208 via a touch screen display, keyboard, a microphone (e.g., via voice recognition), or another user interface device of client device 102 .
- the search engine may retrieve any number of links to websites or other online services regarding the query. For example, the search engine may retrieve the URLs of websites devoted to the topic of flowers and provide them as hyperlinks 212 , 214 on webpage 206 as search results. In some implementations, the search engine may maintain an index of keywords used on webpages or other resources. Search results may then be ordered by the search engine based on the relevancy of the indexed webpages relative to the search query. A summary of the webpage or other resource may also be provided on webpage 206 by the search engine. For example, hyperlink 214 may have an associated description 216 that gives more detail about the linked webpage. Since hyperlinks 212 , 214 are presented as search results based solely on their relevancy to the search query, they may be considered first-party content.
- webpage 206 may also include third-party content 210 selected by content selection service 104 .
- Third-party content 210 may be, in one example, a hyperlink 218 to a third-party content provider's website.
- Third-party content 210 may also identify itself as being third-party content, such as including a notification that the hyperlink is a paid link.
- Other exemplary forms of third-party content that may be presented in conjunction with search results may include a location (e.g., the location of the nearest florist to client device 102 ) or links to perform online actions, such as playing a piece of media content.
- Content selection service 104 may conduct a content auction to select third-party content 210 .
- content selection service 104 may first determine which third-party content providers are to compete in a content auction. For example, only third-party content providers that specify the search term “flowers” may participate in the content auction (e.g., based on the providers specifying the keyword “flowers” as part of a campaign).
- Another exemplary campaign parameter that may also be used to control which third-party content providers participate in the auction includes the geographic location of client device 102 . Such a geographic location may correspond to a particular city, zip code, state, country, or other area.
- a third-party advertiser located in Great Britain may only be interested in advertising to client devices located there and not in the United States of America.
- the device type of client device 102 may also be used as a further parameter to control which third-party content providers participate in the content auction. For example, only certain providers may participate in the auction if client device is a mobile device. Based on the bid amounts of the providers that participate in the content auction and other factors, content selection service 104 may select third-party content 210 for presentation with the search results on webpage 206 .
- FIG. 3 a flow diagram of a process 300 for determining a bid modifier value for a hybrid campaign is shown.
- predicted conversion rates for keyword sets and device types are determined (step 302 )
- the keyword-level conversion rates are then used to predict campaign-level conversion rates for the different device types (step 304 )
- the ratio of the campaign-level conversion rates is then determined (step 306 )
- the ratio is used as a bid modifier value relating bids for the different device types (step 308 ).
- Process 300 may be implemented by one or more computing devices executing stored instructions.
- process 300 may be implemented by content selection service 104 shown in FIG. 1 .
- process 300 includes determining predicted conversion rates for different pairs of device types and keyword sets (step 302 ). For example, assume that a third-party content provider has a first campaign that is desktop-only and uses the keyword sets “best bagel” and “favorite bagel” as campaign parameters. Further, assume that the content provider also has a second campaign that is mobile-only and uses the same keyword sets as the desktop-only campaign.
- the predicted conversion rates may be based on a history of traffic metrics regarding the third-party content provider's content. The traffic metrics may be generated over any period of time, such as a day, a week, thirty days, etc. For example, the number of conversions in the past thirty days for a given set of keywords and device type may be divided by the number of times the third-party content was provided, to generate a predicted conversion rate.
- Process 300 includes determining campaign-level conversion rates for the device types (step 304 ). After the keyword-level conversion rates are predicted in step 302 , these conversion rates may be combined to predict campaign-level conversion rates for each device type. In some implementations, a campaign-level conversion rate may be predicted using a weighted average of the keyword-level conversion rates. Each keyword-level conversion rate may be weighted based on the comparative amount of traffic associated with each set of keywords and/or based on other factors as well.
- the predicted conversion rate for the “best bagel” keyword set may receive a greater weighting than for “favorite bagel,” when determining a campaign-level predicted conversion rate.
- Process 300 includes determining a ratio of campaign-level conversion rates for the device types (step 306 ).
- a ratio of the campaign-level conversion rates determined in step 304 may be calculated.
- the ratios of other device types may be determined in other implementations.
- the ratio of conversion rates for tablet devices to desktop devices may be determined in other implementations.
- Process 300 includes using the ratio of predicted conversion rates as a bid modifier value (step 308 ).
- a may be used as a bid modifier value that relates bids for one device type to bids for another device type.
- the bid modifier value may be used to combine device-specific campaigns into a hybrid campaign.
- the bid modifier value may be used to upgrade a mixed device campaign into a hybrid campaign that uses a bid modifier value to control bids across different device types.
- Process 400 generally includes determining a campaign-level bid modifier value (step 402 ) and adjusting bids at the keyword level (step 404 ). These steps may be repeated iteratively any number of times, to determine new bid amounts and bid modifier values.
- Process 400 may be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as content selection service 104 shown in FIG. 1 .
- Process 400 includes setting a campaign-level bid modifier value (step 402 ).
- the bid modifier value is set by determining a ratio of predicted conversion rates for different device types.
- the bid modifier value may be determined as the ratio of a predicted conversion rate for mobile devices to a predicted conversion rate for desktop devices.
- process 400 may be implemented in conjunction with process 300 .
- process 400 may use an initial bid modifier value determined in process 300 (e.g., when a campaign is first upgraded to a hybrid campaign).
- Process 400 includes adjusting bids at the keyword level (step 404 ).
- the bid strategy at the keyword level may be based on an assumption that the return for each keyword is the same.
- steps 402 and 404 of process 400 may be repeated iteratively any number of times to update the bid modifier value calculated in step 402 .
- an updated bid modifier value 406 determined in step 402 may affect the traffic metrics 408 for each set of keywords.
- the keyword traffic mix for the different sets of keywords may change when the bid modifier value is updated.
- the conversion rate for each set of keywords may vary based on the updated bid modifier value 406 . Since the campaign-level bid modifier value set in step 402 is based on the keyword-level conversion rates in traffic metrics 408 , steps 402 and 404 may be repeated iteratively to update the bid modifier value.
- steps 402 and 404 may be repeated periodically (e.g., every n number of minutes, every day, every week, etc.), in response to a request from a third-party content provider, or at any other time.
- a smoothing function may be applied to the iteratively calculated bid modifier value, to prevent oscillations.

where pcvr(device_type) is the predicted conversion rate for a particular device type (e.g., desktop devices, mobile devices, etc.), i represents a set of one or more keywords used in a campaign, and clicki is a metric regarding the number of times a user clicked on third-party content that was selected by
where pcvr(mobile) and pcvr(desktop) are the predicted campaign-level conversion rates for each device type. Other ratios may also be used for the bid modifier value in other implementations (e.g., the ratio of a conversion rate for desktop devices to a conversion rate for mobile devices, etc.).
where pcvri,d(desktop) is the predicted conversion rate for desktop devices using a particular set of keywords (e.g., the ith set of keywords) and clicki,d is the number of clicks for desktop devices using the set of keywords. In some implementations, KW may represent all of the sets of keywords for a campaign. In further implementations, KW may represent all of the sets of keywords across multiple campaigns of a third-party content provider that use different device types. For example, metrics regarding keyword sets that overlap in desktop-only and mobile-only campaigns may be used by
bidi,m=bidi,d*α
where bidi, and bidi,d are the keyword-level bid amounts for mobile and desktop devices, respectively, and a is a bid modifier value that is the ratio of predicted, campaign-level conversion rates for the mobile and desktop devices, respectively.
where i is the ith keyword or set of keywords used in the campaign and a is a bid modifier value that changes the bid for desktop devices (e.g., bidi,d) to determine a mobile bid amount,
where a is the ratio of predicted conversion rates for mobile devices to desktop devices. To determine the value of the bid modifier value a, the calculations of the mobile conversion rate (e.g., pcvr(mobile)) and the bid modifier value may be repeated iteratively until a converges within a predefined threshold.
bidi,m=bidi,d*α0
bidi =c*pcvr i*CPA_target
where c is the average cost per action across all sets of keywords (e.g. cpci/pcvri=c) and CPA_target is an upper bound amount that a third-party content provider has agreed to pay for an action (e.g., a user making a purchase on the provider's website).
m(t+1)=β*m(t)+(1−β)*m′(t+1)
where m′(t+1) is the bid modifier value calculated at
bidi =c*pcvr i*CPA_target
where c is the average cost per action across all sets of keywords (e.g. cpci/pcvri=c), CPA is a cost per action value, and target is the target CPA specified by the third-party content provider.
