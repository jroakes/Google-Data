Embodiment
Present disclose provides the technology for load balance.Technology distribution is included with least one memory communication extremely
The management computing system of a few processor or the calculating utilization rate of data handling system.Especially, it is this disclosure relates to wherein objective
The technology of family end computing device issue request (for example, searching request in internet search engine), and data handling system
In response to the request data are provided to client computing device.
Can be handled in real time in management computing system or data handling system please as client computing device
Ask.For example, search engine is per second can to handle tens thousand of individual search inquiries.But the number of search inquiry may one day it
Interior change.Rush hour is there may be, during this period, client computing device sends a large amount of search inquiries (for example, 1000 are looked into
Inquiry/second, 8000 inquiry/seconds, 10,000 inquiry/seconds, 20,000 inquiry/seconds, 30,000 inquiry/seconds, 40,000
Inquiry/second, 50,000 inquiry/seconds, 60,000 inquiry/seconds, 70,000 inquiry/seconds, 100,000 inquiry/seconds or one
A bit than low or high non-peak speed other speed), and the off-peak hours are there may be, calculated set by client during this period
Preparation go out relatively small amount search inquiry (for example, 800 inquiry/seconds, 1,000 inquiry/second, 1,800 inquiry/seconds, 2000
Inquiry/second, 3,000 inquiry/seconds, 5,000 inquiry/seconds, 7,000 inquiry/seconds, 10,000 inquiry/seconds 15,000
Inquiry/second, 20,000 inquiry/seconds, 25,000 inquiry/seconds, 30,000 inquiry/seconds or some are lower than high-speed other
Speed).The distribution of peak and off-peak hours are possibly also dependent on the geographical position of client computing device in one day.For example,
During rush hour, the more multiserver ratio in data handling system is utilized to provide client during the off-peak hours
The request of computing device.During rush hour, the utilization rate of data handling system inner treater, memory and network link is very
Height, this may cause high data processing, data storage and Network cost.However, high data are avoided during rush hour
Processing, data storage and Network speed are probably challenging.
In addition, for the angle of data handling system, selection and the content item for providing such as advertisement are computationally money
Source intensity, because selection course includes many complicated and expensive steps.Therefore, selection course is in content selection and service
The delay of negative effect client computing device is introduced in stream.In addition, content selection process is used CPU, internal memory uses and internal
Network has high cost.Content item is provided all day, but during rush hour, will show more content items, so as to
Cause to run more selection courses, calculated so as to need more servers or computing resource to handle.However, in non-peak
During time, these Additional servers are underused, therefore service efficiency is low.
The system and method for this solution, which were related to during rush hour, alleviates high data processing, data storage and network
Service rate.The system and method for this solution, which can provide, to be configured to promote to reduce the operating lag in immobilized substance distribution

The calculating utilization rate of device.Data handling system can retrieve the information relevant with the calculating utilization rate of data handling system, and
Based on the information retrieved, it is determined that start in a data processing system or calculate the time window of calculating task, time interval or
Time point.Data handling system can it is determined that time point start, perform or initiate calculating task calculating.
For example, in order to reduce the operating lag in immobilized substance distribution, data handling system can identify content activity
Multiple candidates flash (impression) flashed as guarantee.Candidate, which flashes, can refer to the standard of flashing with being likely to occur in the future
Flash.Data handling system can perform offline selection service, technology or process to identify flashing for these candidates.For example,
Data handling system can candidate flash actual appearance former apocalypses it is dynamic or perform offline selection.Data handling system can be with
Establish multiple candidates to flash, to meet every day from now on.The candidate established for content activity, which flashes, to be properly termed as ensureing content
Flash.
Content item object is distributed by being flashed in the forward direction candidate that the request to content is received from client computing device,
Data handling system can skip real-time selection step (e.g., including in client computing device request content in service time
The selection course of the on-line selection process started afterwards and before content is provided to client computing device), this causes data
Processing system can quickly operate than performing real-time selection process and provide content item object to client computing device.Separately
Outside, flashed and content item object corresponding to distributing by identifying candidate during non-peak calculates the utilization rate time, and in height
Content item object is provided during peak time, data handling system can reduce CPU, memory and net during peak business condition
Network operating cost.As a result, data handling system, server, processor and its memory is more efficiently utilized.
Data handling system may determine whether offline selection technique being applied to content activity.Data handling system can be with
Meet to distribute come predictive content activity for certain content activity or the possibility of target is (for example, budget is spent or the number that flashes
Mesh).Data handling system can determine to trigger offline selection course based on the comparison of the possibility and threshold value of prediction.For example,
If content activity is predicted as it is expected the 80% of distribution by data handling system in the case of without using offline selection technique,
Data handling system can determine to initiate offline selection course.However, if content activity is predicted as mesh by data handling system
Target 50%, then data handling system may disable offline selection technique, because it may too resource-intensive.In another example
In, if data handling system, which determines that advertising campaign is predicted to reach, it is expected the 100% of distribution, data handling system can be true
Determine without using offline selection technique.
In offline selection course, data handling system can retrieve content activity data, including such as content selection mark
Accurate, history is flashed record, the bid amount of money or mass fraction.Data handling system can use retrieved data to identify at least
One following to flash to retain the content item object of content activity or content activity.For example, data handling system can be based on
Such as sudden strain of a muscle of the type of time, client computing device, geographical position, keyword or the other factorses used in content selection
Show standard to identify that candidate flashes.Data handling system can distribute candidate to content activity and flash.
Data handling system can monitor in real time it is available flash, and the standard currently flashed and content activity will be distributed to
Or the candidate of content item object flashes and is compared.The current standard and in being distributed of flashing is determined in response to data handling system
Matching between the standard of flashing of appearance activity, data handling system can provide the content item object of content activity.
Data handling system can (1) expired based on content activity and the degree of closeness for it is expected distribution, or content activity
Foot it is expected that the possibility (for example, based on percentage of remaining duration or residual in content activity) of distribution determines
Run the offline selection course of content activity；(2) data handling system can identify load balance characteristic, with determine one day when
Between (or one week when) initiate, perform, run or start offline selection course, and perform and selected on what server
Journey；(3) start offline selection course with identify each by the standard of flashing (for example, the time of one day, computing device type,
Reason position or keyword) list flashed of the candidate that defines；(4), will in response to the request to content from client device
Associated with asking flashes standard compared with the standard of flashing that candidate flashes to identify matching；(5) in response to identification
Match somebody with somebody, disable real-time selection process, but content item object is provided from the content activity corresponding with the standard of flashing of matching.

Negative keyword, with the content net for avoiding, prevent, stopping or disabling particular search result webpage or match these negative keywords
Content on page is placed.Content provider can specify the match-type for selecting content item object, such as match completely, word
Group matching or broad match.
Content provider 125 can provide the one or more content item objects selected for data handling system 120.When
Content places chance when being made available by, and data handling system 120 can select content item object, the content place chance with it is pre-
Calculation, content scheduling, maximum bid, keyword and the other alternative conditions matching specified for content group.Different types of content item
Object can be included in such as content of text item, picture material item, video content item, audio content item, content of multimedia item, exhale
Cry in the content group that content item or content item link.
Content provider 125 may want to establish the fixation of the content item object of content activity or predetermined distribution.For example,
Content provider 125 may want to time interval or in the duration (such as 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 30 days or it is other continue when
In) have 1000 times and flash.In another example, content provider 125 can be that the time interval establishes fixed budget, and
Wish to spend whole fixed budget during the time interval.Because various payment technologies are (for example, paying can be based on dodging every time
Existing, click, selection or conversion), and due to the meter of content item object is selected and serviced during the peak resource utilization time
Calculate intensive, at preset time intervals during realize content activity content item object fixation or predetermined distribution be probably to have
Challenge.
In order to promote to realize the fixation of the content item object of content activity or predetermined distribution, distributor engine 130 can be true
Determine the distribution measurement of content activity.Distributor engine 130 can the predetermined distribution based on content activity, current point of content activity
Match somebody with somebody, one or more of remaining duration of the apportionment ratio of content activity and content activity determines distribution measurement.Example
Such as, distribution measurement can indicate that content activity realizes possibility that is predetermined or it is expected distribution.
Distributor engine 130 can determine distribution measurement based on the consumption percentage of content activity.For example, content activity
Budget be probably 100 dollars.Distributor engine 130 can use the content-data data being stored in data repository 155
History impression data in structure 160 determines the cost amount of content activity.Content-data data structure 160 can include whenever interior
Hold selector assembly 140 and select the content item object of content activity with the bid gold when being shown in client computing device 110
Volume, and cumulative bid amount is to determine total cost of upper content activity in predetermined time interval.For example, distributor engine
130 can determine that the cost amount of money up to the present is $ 80.Distributor engine 130 may further determine that this is that content provides
The 80% of the budget that person 125 establishes for the content activity.Therefore, in some cases, distributing measurement can include being content
The percentage for the budget that activity is spent.
Distributor engine 130 can be based upon the budget of content cost and the remaining duration of content activity to determine point
With measurement.Distributor engine can combine duration of spent budget, residual, remaining duration or completion with
It is determined that distribution measurement.Distributor engine 130 can be determined distribution measurement based on residual amount and remaining duration
For ratio.If for example, residual percentage is 20%, and remaining duration percentage is 20%, then distributor draws
1 can be defined as by distribution measurement by holding up 130.This can indicate that content activity is being carried out to realize desired distribution or cost.
In another example, residual percentage is probably 50%, and the remaining duration is probably 10%.In this example,
The ratio of remaining duration and residual can be remaining duration percentage divided by residual percentage or distribution
0.2 value of measurement.Distribution measurement can indicate that content activity realizes the possibility for it is expected distribution.Compared with distribution measurement 1, point
It can indicate that content activity is realized with measurement 0.2 and it is expected that the possibility of distribution is relatively low, this can indicate content activity in foundation
Realize that the distribution of foundation is carried out or progressively carried out during time interval.Distribution measurement more than 1 can indicate content activity
It is to shift to an earlier date than scheduling, and desired distribution can be realized in the time interval less than foundation.
Distributor engine 130 can generate time series prediction model, with the data based on previous observation or identification come really
Fixed distribution measurement.For example, distributor engine 130 can generate the prediction distribution of duration based on time series prediction model.
Distributor engine 130 can determine that the standard deviation of model realizes the possibility of established distribution with predictive content activity.Point
Distribution measurement can be determined based on the duration of apportionment ratio and content activity with engine 130.For example, distributor engine 130
It can determine that content activity averagely has 10,000 time daily based on history impression data to flash, and content activity is remaining 10 days.
Distributor engine 130 can determine that standard deviation is low (for example, 15%, 10%, 5%, 3%, 2% or 1% less than average value).
Distributor engine 130 can determine that content activity realizes the possibility for it is expected to distribute using forecast model.Such as, if it is desired to
Distribution be to flash for 100,000 time, then current number of flashing is 50,000, and average daily number of flashing is 10,000, tool
Have 10% standard deviation, and there remains 10 days, distributor engine 130 can determine content activity realize needed for distribution can
Energy property is big.Distributor engine 130 can determine that possibility is big, flash and will cause because being averaged 10,000 time daily in 10 days
Flash for 100,000 times, outside 50,000 time except having occurred and that is flashed, it is up to or more than 100, the 000 times phases flashed
Hope distribution.
Distributor engine 130 can be by distribution measurement compared with threshold value.The comparison with threshold value is measured in response to distribution,
Distributor engine can be that offline selecting module 145 selects content activity.In some cases, distributor engine 130 can lead to
Cross the parameter of set content activity, mark content activity, sign content activity, or otherwise provide in offline selection course
The instruction of the middle content selection for performing content activity enables offline selecting module 145 to be directed to content activity.If distributor draws
Hold up 130 and determine that content activity possibly can not realize desired distribution within the duration of foundation, then distributor engine 130 can be with
Content activity is carried out using offline selecting module 145.If distributor engine 130 determines that content activity may holding in foundation
Reach during the continuous time within the predetermined percentage for it is expected distribution, then distributor engine 130 can use offline for content activity
Selecting module 145.For example, if contents advertising activity is 80% distribution, and the remaining duration is 10%, then distributes
Device engine 130 can enable the offline selection to content activity.If however, content activity be 80% distribution and it is remaining
Duration is 1%, then distributor engine 130 can disable the offline selection to content activity.
Numeral that threshold value can include promoting determining whether performing content activity offline selecting module 145, percentage,
Scope, rule, strategy, condition or the trigger event of value, value.Threshold value can be changed based on the type that distribution is measured.For example, such as
Fruit distribution measurement is to be based on remaining duration percentage divided by residual percentage, then the threshold value can include one or more
Individual value or scope, such as 0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,1.1,1.2,1.5,1.6,2,2.5,3,3.5 or promote enable
Or some other values of the offline selection course of disabling.Threshold value can include the scope of such as [0.7,1.3].Distributor engine 130
Can be by distribution measurement compared with scope, to determine whether distribution measurement falls within the range.If distribution measurement is at this
In the range of, then distributor engine 130 can select content activity to be selected offline.For example, 0.7 to 1.3 scope can be with
Indicate that budget divided by remaining time are more than 0.7 and represent that content activity is not far behind desired distribution, and distribute measurement
The apportionment ratio of the content activity on the duration can be indicated less than 1.3 not over the desired distribution in the duration too
It is more.If apportionment ratio is too backward, distributor engine 130 can disable offline selection or not select to select offline, because slowly
Leg speed may indicate that the expectation to content activity is too high or content selection criteria is not chosen correctly.If apportionment ratio is high, and
And instruction content activity will easily meet desired position (for example, apportionment ratio is than scheduling in advance 40%), then distributor engine
130 can determine not selecting the content activity for selecting offline, because content activity can organically meet desired distribution.
In some cases, distributor engine 130 can be based on the content selection criteria associated with content activity come pre-
Future candidate is surveyed to flash number.For example, if the content selection criteria of content activity is set including geographical position, keyword and calculating
Standby type, then distributor engine 130 can be had and the content selection of content activity to predict based on time series prediction model
The number that the future candidate of the standard of flashing of matches criteria flashes.If distributor engine 130, which is predicted, to be had and content selection
Enough future candidates are there may be during the time interval of the standard of flashing of matches criteria to flash, then distributor engine 130 can
So that content activity can be selected offline.What if the prediction of distributor engine 130 may be not enough will be with content selection
The future candidate of matches criteria flashes, then distributor engine 130 can not select content activity to be used to select offline.It is for example, interior
Holding selection standard can include：It is located geographically in the equipment and keyword swimsuit in the Antarctic Continent.Desired distribution continued at 1 week
Can be 10,000 on time, and remaining distribution can be 9,900, and the remaining time can be 1 day.Distributor draws
Holding up 130 can predict that it is daily 30 times to meet that the future candidate of content selection criteria flashes, and this may be insufficient for desired
Distribution.Therefore, distributor engine 130 can determine not select offline selection course for the content activity, because may be impossible
Desired distribution is realized on the duration established.
Distributor engine 130 can determine the distribution measurement of one or more content activities, and distribution measurement is entered with threshold value
Row compares, and compares offline selection or the real-time selection for determining to enable or disable each content activity based on this.

Operating cost.As a result, data handling system and its server is more efficiently utilized.
For example, data handling system can identify the subset flashed from every day, and these are sold before actually occurring
Flash.Data handling system can remove from real-time auction during same time period and win these presell contents flashed
.If flashed not by " presell ", real-time auction can be submitted it.
Content selection process, therefore data are won because which bid the clicking rate and mass fraction of estimation may influence
Processing system can use flashes relevant information with candidate.For example, data handling system can use gathered based on computing device
The estimation clicking rate and mass fraction of class mechanism.Data handling system can have foot daily using these behavior aggregate to identify
Enough consistent impressions counts are so that its predictable computing device cluster.Then, data handling system can use these clusters
In the subset of each distribute flashing for fixed allocation content selection technology.
Can based on the set by the selection standard flashed is met come (for example, before request content) before recording
Distribution is flashed.Receive predistribution content item object computing device by with the selection standard with matches criteria of flashing to content
Request be associated, the search term such as alignd with content activity or the time of one day.
Ensure that standard pool can include map or content activity list, which ensure that flashing and content activity is in this standard
Under the number of flashing that wins.Seeing that day for flashing, the standard of flashing flashed can be entered with the standard set of these guarantees
Row compares.Being matched if flashed with from the set of circumstances for ensureing pond, data handling system can select content item from pond,
And the content activity and the remaining of standard pool are ensured into number reduction one of flashing.
During last several days of content advertising campaign, data handling system can use this model by content activity from reality
When auction selection course be transferred to Assured Mode, to distribute last working capital.Some activities may bid deficiency, and
Because the bid of content provider is inadequate, so almost having no chance to realize whole number of flashing.In these cases, at data
Reason system can determine that activity may disqualification obtain guarantee and flash.Therefore, data handling system can make activity complete target
The entirety of distribution.Therefore, motion may be more than likely complete the whole of Target Assignment, or be significantly less than target because of bid deficiency.
Because standard can be with narrow, therefore data handling system can filter out and flashing of ensureing is incompatible activity or close
Key word.For example, data handling system may retain extensive keyword or the keyword usually asked, and filter out narrow sense or
Specific keyword or accurate matching.
