Middle use.
The different piece of input data 111 is by different mapper 120a-120d process.?
During some realize, input data 111 can be organized into data division or " block ", and often
Individual mapper 120a-120d processes the different piece of input data 111.In some implementations,
System 100 can include one or more main processing block (not shown), described main process mould
Block distribution and/or tracking are by the input data 111 handled by each mapper 120a-120d
A part.
Based on input data 111, it is defeated as mapper that mapper 120a-120d generates key-value pair
Going out, the most each key-value pair mark is for training the training sequence of acoustic model 140.Relevant
The group of key-value pair is illustrated as data set 122.Even so, but each key-value pair can be independently
Transmit to abbreviation device 130a-130d.Data set 122 can such as include following key-value pair its
Each identify the different amounts of voice around the particular phoneme in the particular instance with language
The training sequence of linguistic context.Key-value pair in each data set 122 identifies has common spy
Determine the relevant of characteristic (the central aligned phoneme sequence such as occurring in each related training sequences)
Training sequence.
Mapper 120a-120d exports key-value pair in data set 122, and in the stage of shuffling
Middle key-value pair is distributed to each abbreviation device 140a-140b.As described further below, definition
For the subregion key shuffled, in order to each key-value pair in data-oriented collection 122 is sent to
Identical abbreviation device 130a-130d.Such as, the subregion key being associated with training sequence can be based on
Central aligned phoneme sequence in training sequence.Due to each related training sequences have identical in
Centre sequence, the most each key-value pair is associated with identical subregion key, and thus is assigned to phase
Such as, distribution is used for processing the number being associated with this subregion key same abbreviation device 130a-130d(
According to abbreviation device).
Each abbreviation device 130a-130d is assigned one or more subregion key, and receives and it
The all of key-value pair that allocated one or more subregion keys are associated.In some implementations,
Each subregion key is distributed to definitely an abbreviation device 130a-130d, in order to single abbreviation
Device 130a-130d transmits and is processed the key-value pair in each data set 122 by it.Each abbreviation
Device 130a-130d is responsible for generating the acoustics of the one or more subregion keys allocated corresponding to it
The particular zones 140a-140d of model 140.Received based on each abbreviation device 130a-130d
Key-value pair, each abbreviation device 130a-130d polymerization training sequence also trains acoustic model 140
Distribution subregion 140a-140d(such as, by the aggregate number of the subregion key to each distribution
According to carrying out statistical analysis).The acoustic model subregion 140a-140d of storage abbreviation device output is permissible
It it is the section of distribution (such as, subregion) Associate array.
After the training of acoustic model 140, speech recognition system 150 can use with in order to
The subregion key that the subregion key of training acoustic model 140 is identical accesses in acoustic model 140
Data.When receiving voice data 162 from calculating equipment 160, speech recognition system 150
Can use acoustic model 140 to assess voice data 162 candidate transcription (for example, it is assumed that).
For given candidate transcription, a component can be selected by characteristics of speech sounds based on this candidate transcription
Qu Jian.Then from Associate array, retrieve the acoustic model number being associated with selected subregion key
According to.Data for each subregion key can be by being divided during the training at acoustic model 140
It is furnished with the subregion 140a-140d acquisition that the abbreviation device 130a-130d of this subregion key is trained.Language
Sound identification system 150 uses acoustic model data to be correct probability to evaluate candidate transcription.
Speech recognition system 150 then provides one or more to calculating equipment 160 and is confirmed as
It is likely to be the hypothesis 164 correctly transcribed of voice data 162.
Fig. 2 is to illustrate by the schematic diagram of the example of the process performed by mapper processing module.
As example, it is illustrated that the mapper 120a of Fig. 1 processes specific input to generate training data
One of collection 122.Each mapper in mapper 120a-120d can input data with other
The process performing to be similar to is to generate other data sets 122.Each mapper 120a-120d energy
Enough come in a manner described below the word level section of sample voice data is performed process.
The mapper 120a of Fig. 1 accesses particular utterance (speech polling that such as user is submitted to)
Speech data 112a.Mapper 120a also access identities speech data 112a transcribes 113a
Data, these data indicate in the example shown in the series of figures transcribes 113a and includes " action " item.
In some implementations, mapper 120a receives the input block each including multiple record.
Each record can include the speech waveform of language, the word level of language is transcribed and other elements.
In some implementations, in order to prevent with wrong data to train acoustic model 140, map
Device 120a guarantees to meet the minimum threshold confidence score transcribed, and this minimum threshold confidence level obtains
Point indicate transcribe be probably correct.When transcribe be unsatisfactory for minimal confidence threshold time, no
Process further and transcribe and associated data, and mapper continues with other input data.
Mapper 120a mark transcribes the phonetic representation 220(202 of 113a).Mapper 120
Can obtain from pronunciation dictionary and transcribe 113a to the phonetic element representing the pronunciation transcribing 113a
The mapping of ((CI) phoneme that such as linguistic context is unrelated) sequence.Such as, for word
"<s>action</S>", it is thus achieved that phonetic representation 220 " sil ae k sh ih n sil ".Symbol
"<s>" and "</S>" representing sentence boundary, its pronunciation is for long quiet, at phonetic representation
" sil " it is designated as in 220.In some implementations, CI phoneme can increase with word circle symbol
Sound, this word circle symbol occupies the position of themselves in phonetic representation.
Phonetic representation 220 is directed at (204) with transcribing 113a by mapper 120a.Such as,
Mapper 120a is at the speech frame 112a of speech data and transcribes and generates linguistic context between 113a and depend on
Rely sexual state level Viterbi alignment (Viterbi alignment).H C L can be used to come
Obtaining described alignment, wherein L, C and H correspondingly represent that pronunciation dictionary, linguistic context rely on pass
System tree and HMM are to the FST (FST) of state.In some implementations,
Alignment relates to identifying the voice corresponding to context dependency HMM state each in phonetic representation
Frame, wherein linguistic context is current phoneme and surrounding phoneme.Alignment may include determining whether and each phoneme
The time started index of the corresponding voice data of each HMM state and end time rope
Draw.
Mapper 120a extracts training sequence 230a-230c(206 from phonetic representation 220).
Each training sequence 230a-230c is referred to as M-phoneme, and it is building of labeling phonemes sequence
Form unit.M represents the integer number of the linguistic context phoneme of central authorities' phoneme in sequence.Each
Training sequence 230a-230c or M-phoneme describe corresponding to context dependency HMM state
The different sections continuously of acoustic features.Each training sequence 230a-230c can include from voice
Express the different context phone set of the continuous part of 220.
The M-phoneme with different M value includes extending to the central sound from phonetic representation 220
The left side of element and the different number of linguistic context phoneme on right side.As example, 5 rank M phoneme (examples
As, 5 phonemes) include 5 phonemes before central authorities' phoneme and 5 after this central authorities' phoneme
Individual phoneme, thus the sequence of 11 continuous phonemes in phonetic representation 220 is described.As separately
One example, 3 rank M phonemes (such as, 3 phoneme) comprise 3 sounds before central authorities' phoneme
3 phonemes after element and this central authorities' phoneme, therefore describe the sequence of 7 phonemes.1 rank M
Phoneme (or 1 phoneme) includes 3 phonemes altogether, and is therefore referred to as " triphones " (its
It is different from 3 phonemes of a length of 7 phonemes).When phonetic representation 220 long enough, can
Extract the M phoneme of any integer M value.
In order to extract one group of training sequence 230a-230c, mapper 120a selects central authorities' phoneme,
This central authorities' phoneme represent each training sequence 230a-230c by centered by middle position.Right
In central authorities' phoneme, mapper 120a extracts the M sound that M value scope is from 1 to predetermined maximum
Element.The phoneme of high-order M that described maximum mark is to be fetched.The maximum of M such as may be used
Being 3,4,5 or 7, or another M value.In some implementations, when generating acoustic mode
During type 140, the maximum of M is for all of mapper 120a-120d and all of input
Data can be consistent.
Mapper 120a extracts the M phoneme for maximum M value, and mapper 120a is also
Extracting " rollback " M phoneme, described " rollback " M phoneme each includes less linguistic context sound
Element.Mapper 120a from the phoneme of high-order M (such as, including the maximum number of linguistic context phoneme
M phoneme) in extract and there is the M phoneme of relatively low M value, until being extracted 1 rank M sound
Element.Such as, if maximum M value is 5, then rollback M phoneme be 4 phonemes, 3 phonemes, 2
Phoneme and 1 phoneme.
In the example shown in the series of figures, each training sequence 230a-230c is with same central phoneme
Different M phonemes centered by " ih ".Mapper 120a uses the maximum M value of " 3 " conduct,
Thus most 3 the linguistic context phonemes before and after central authorities' phoneme " ih " to be used for giving birth to by instruction
Become acoustic model 140.Altogether extract 3 M phonemes (such as, gather M={1,2,3}
M phoneme).The phoneme of high-order M in set includes the M phoneme of most phoneme
It is training sequence 230a, i.e. 3 phonemes.Training sequence 230b(2 phoneme) and training sequence
Row 230c(1 phoneme) it is the rollback M phoneme in set.Each training sequence 230a-230c
Including shared section " sh__n " part of phonetic representation 230, wherein " _ _ " for marking
The placeholder of the position of note central authorities' phoneme " ih ".As described further below, Mei Gexun
Practicing sequence 230a-230c is that the training data corresponding with a part of speech data 112a is real
Example.The expression uniquely identifying M phoneme is referred to as M phoneme key.M phoneme key can be instruction
The character string practicing sequence 230a-230c is expressed or another lattice of mark training sequence 230a-230c
Formula.
In some implementations, use multiple state or unit to model each phoneme.Such as,
Phoneme can be modeled by three states in HMM.State " ih_1 ", " ih_2 " can be passed through
" ih_3 " models phoneme " ih ", wherein state " ih_1 ", " ih_2 " and " ih_3 "
Correspondingly represent the characteristic at beginning, centre and the end of " ih " phoneme.Therefore, instruction can be used
Practice sequence and model the particular state in phoneme, rather than whole phoneme.Although it is the most right to illustrate
Should be in one group of training sequence 230a-230c of state " ih_1 ", but mapper 120a can extract
Other state for " ih " phoneme and the shape for other phoneme in phonetic representation 220
The similar training sequence collection of state.
In some cases, the amount around the voice linguistic context of central authorities' phoneme can not be symmetry.
In such cases, the M phoneme of extraction can include the linguistic context of asymmetric amount.Such as, for
Phonetic representation 220, have 4 linguistic context phonemes before the phoneme " ih " and phoneme " ih " it
After have 2 linguistic context phonemes.As result, training sequence 230a before phoneme " ih " and
There is different number of linguistic context phoneme afterwards, and represent the sequence of 6 phonemes rather than to 3
The sequence of 7 phonemes desired by phoneme.In order to extract training sequence, mapper 120a can
By only extracting asymmetric rollback M phoneme from the longer end rollback of asymmetric phonetic representation.
When reaching the linguistic context of weighing, mapper 120a can proceed with symmetrical rollback.Can be
Asymmetric M phoneme uses such as "～" etc. symbol indicate do not have linguistic context phoneme can
Vacant location context.
Mapper 120a exports key-value pair 240a-240c, and described key-value pair 240a-240c is each
One of mark training sequence 230a-230c, and speech data (208) can be included.For
Each training sequence in training sequence 230a-230c generates and output key-value pair 240a-240c.
Training sequence 230a-230c(or their other codings are expressed) serve as key-value pair 240a-240c
In key.Value in key-value pair 240a-240c can be speech frame or other speech datas, but
This value can also be empty.
In some implementations, only for phoneme (such as, the high-order including highest number
M phoneme) the key-value pair 240a of training sequence 230a include speech frame.In order to avoid
Send excess data to abbreviation device, do not include for rollback M in key-value pair 240b, 240c
The speech frame of phoneme.As result, the data in data set 122 comprise the steps that (i) key assignments
To<M phoneme key, speech frame>, for the longest training sequence；And (ii) key-value pair < M
Phoneme key,<empty>>, for each rollback M phoneme.
Although not providing speech frame for single rollback M phoneme, but may have access to corresponding language
Sound frame is as the subset of the speech frame provided for high-order M phoneme.If with each key
Value is to 240a-240c speech frames, then speech frame will be replicated and transmit M time, from
And bandwidth demand to system is significantly increased.By only coming with one of key-value pair 240a-240c
Speech frames, and at abbreviation device, cache speech frame, reduce the demand to bandwidth.
Various technology can ensure that abbreviation device is able to access that the language of each training sequence 230a-230c
Sound frame.Shuffle period, transmit each key-value pair to identical abbreviation device 130a-130d
240a-240c is for process.Based on subregion key, each key-value pair 240a-240c is routed to
Suitable abbreviation device 130a-130d(passes through mapper 120a and/or other processing modules).
As discussed above, can be processed by an abbreviation device 130a-130d definitely and give
The data that subregion key is associated.Subregion key is the function of central authorities' triphones, this central authorities' triphones
Shared by each training sequence 230a-230c.Owing to each training sequence 230a-230c has
There is identical central triphones " sh ih n ", therefore for each training sequence 230a-230c
Key-value pair 240a-240c be assigned identical subregion key, and therefore by identical abbreviation device
130a-130c is received.All include same central triphones (such as, " sh ih n ")
Key-value pair by identical abbreviation device 130a-130d process, whether which mapper
120a-120d creates this key-value pair.
In the example shown in the series of figures, subregion key is the function of central authorities' triphones.Alternately, exist
Some use another subregion key system in realizing.Such as, can be based on central authorities' phoneme or based on 2
Phoneme determines subregion key, thus causes the different division of labor between abbreviation device 130a-130d.
Owing to only one key-value pair 240a includes speech frame in data set 122, therefore receive key
Value caches this speech frame to the abbreviation device of 240a-240c.As described further below, abbreviation device
To process key-value pair 240a-240c from long training sequence to the order of short training sequence.
Therefore, the key-value pair of the key-value pair what rollback in office M phoneme of any given M phoneme it
Before processed by abbreviation device.Abbreviation device can cache all rollback M sounds down to central authorities' triphones
The speech frame of element.
In some implementations, the caching of sequence and speech frame in order to promote training sequence, can
Before abbreviation device output training sequence, each described training sequence is being reset key.Such as,
Training sequence 230a " ih_1/ae k sh__n sil～" can be determined key is " ih_1/sh n k sil
Ae～", in order to ensure that processing " subregion (ih_1/sh__n) " at abbreviation device sentences from
Long linguistic context processes the data of same central triphones to the order in phrase border.
Except output is for the data set 122 of " ih_1 " (the first state of phoneme " ih ")
Outside, mapper 120a also can extract training sequence output identification for " ih_2 " and " ih_3 "
The key-value pair of the training sequence of (other states of phoneme " ih ").Mapper 120 can also
Generate the data set 122 using other phonemes in phonetic representation 220 as central authorities' phoneme.Example
As, can generate respectively using " ae ", " k ", " sh " etc. as the data of central authorities' phoneme
Collection 122.In some implementations, mapper 120a is for phoneme each in phonetic representation 220
Each state generate data set 122.Mapper 120a continues then to additional input data
Operation described by repetition.
Fig. 3 is mapper processing module 520a-520d and the abbreviation device processing module of pictorial image 1
The diagram of the mutual example between 530a-530d.This diagram illustrate in details the most further by
Process performed by abbreviation device processing module.In the example shown in the series of figures, three mappers
120a-120c is accordingly based on phonetic entry "<S>action<S>", "<S>fashion
<S>" and "<S>faction<S>" and generate key-value pair 240a-240i.For illustrative purposes,
During the illustrated each tagging of key-value pair 240a-240i with identical central phoneme " ih_1 " is
The training sequence (such as, M phoneme) of the heart.Each training sequence also includes by M phoneme key
The identical central triphones sequence that " ih_1/sh__n " is identified.
Process shuffle the stage during, the output of mapper 120a-120c is distributed to abbreviation
Device 130a-130c.Each abbreviation device in abbreviation device 130a-130c distributes different subregions
Keyset.Shuffling period, each abbreviation device 130a-130c receives all in company with its subregion keyset
Training sequence.As previously discussed, the central triphones in training sequence is used to determine instruction
Practice the subregion key of sequence.Identical central triphones is all included, therefore due to training sequence
Described training sequence is all sent to identical abbreviation device.
In the example shown in the series of figures, to abbreviation device 130b distribution subregion key " ih_1/sh__n ".
All of training sequence all includes identical central triphones, and is therefore associated with identical
Subregion key " ih_1/sh__n ".As result, all of training sequence is all in the phase of shuffling
Between be sent to identical abbreviation device 130b.
Shuffling period, key-value pair mark can be directly or through other equipment one or more
Indirectly it is sent to the training sequence of abbreviation device.In some implementations, mapper can determine that
Each training sequence is processed from allocated being used for of the specific abbreviation device of one group of abbreviation device.Such as,
Mapper or another processing equipment may have access to form and determine to being associated with dividing of given key-value pair
Which abbreviation device Qu Jian distributes.Its other party to suitable abbreviation device route key-value pair can be used
Method.
In some implementations, one or more shuffle device processing modules are exported by mapper
Key-value pair 240a-240i stream be ranked up, in order to make key-value pair 240a-240i with specific suitable
Sequence, such as, to arrive at abbreviation device from long training sequence to the order of short training sequence.
Such as, the key assignments stream arriving at abbreviation device can be ranked up, in order to the lexicographic order (example of key
As, M phoneme training sequence) sort and arrive at the key-value pair of abbreviation device.Above-described right
The resetting key and can promote this sequence of training sequence, so as to use standard character string sorting
Obtain suitable order.Key-value pair 240a-240c is arranged by coming by this way
Sequence, it is possible to ensure abbreviation device process do not include speech frame rollback M phoneme key-value pair it
Before, process the key-value pair of the phoneme of high-order M including speech frame.
Independently each key-value pair can be directed to suitable abbreviation device.Such as, can be from key assignments
To key section in mark be associated with the subregion key of key-value pair, its identify specific training sequence or
M phoneme.From the sequence of key section, such as central authorities' triphones, can be used for determining this key assignments
To suitable subregion key.
The data of abbreviation device polymerization key assignments centering.In the example shown in the series of figures, abbreviation device 130b gathers
Data in the key-value pair 240a-240i that splice grafting receives, the most each key-value pair represents training sequence
One example of row.Abbreviation device 130b can be polymerized by adding training sequence to storehouse 310
Data.In storehouse 310, training sequence is placed according to their length.Such as, relatively
It is (all that short training sequence (such as " sh__n ") is positioned to long sequence in storehouse
Such as " ae k sh__n～") lower.
When abbreviation device 130b receives the key-value pair of the phoneme of high-order M (such as, including speech frame
Key-value pair 240a) time, abbreviation device places it in the top of storehouse 310.When high-order
When the key-value pair of M phoneme is positioned at the top of storehouse 310, the key-value pair (example of rollback M phoneme
As, do not include key-value pair 240b, 240c of speech frame) arrive at subsequently.Rollback M phoneme exists
Storehouse 310 is placed on the lower section of the phoneme of high-order M, and quotes for the sound of high-order M
Element and the speech frame that provides.As result, although the most individually providing language with rollback M phoneme
Sound frame, but rollback M phoneme is still associated with the corresponding speech frame in storehouse 310.
Each entry in storehouse 310 can represent unique training sequence or voice linguistic context.Change
The data of the different instances of identical training sequence can be accumulated and be stored in storehouse 310 by Yan Zhi
In single entry in.When abbreviation device 130a accumulation is from the data of mapper 120a-120d
Time, receive the multiple key-value pairs for aligned phoneme sequence.In other words, receive representative to occur
The data of the example of the same voice linguistic context in different phonetic sample.As example, abbreviation
Device 130b receive identify identical training sequence " sh__n " three key-value pair 240c, 240f,
240i.Each key-value pair 240c, 240f, 240i or the example phase of training sequence " sh__n "
Should correspond to as speech frame " frames_A ", " frames_B " and " frames_C " on ground
The different speech frame of subset.
After shuffling, and by the data aggregate from key-value pair 240a-240i in heap
After in stack 310, abbreviation device 130b uses aggregated data to generate the one of acoustic model 140
Part.Abbreviation device 130b removes top entry from storehouse, and uses corresponding to training sequence
Speech frame estimates gauss hybrid models (GMM) (such as, the Gauss for training sequence
The linear combination of distribution).Produced GMM can be context dependency, specific to
The GMM of state.Such as, the GMM using given sequence and generate can be to training sequence
Central phoneme specific HMM state output distribution modeled.Owing to GMM is
Relative based on the voice linguistic context (such as, the sequence of linguistic context phoneme) each and in training sequence
The speech frame answered and generate, therefore GMM depends on this voice linguistic context.
The output of abbreviation device 130b can be the form of array entry<M phoneme, GMM>, its
Can be stored in Distributed Correlation array.Abbreviation device 130b moves from the top of storehouse 310 then
Except next entry, and estimate the GMM of training sequence representated by this entry.Abbreviation device 130b
Continue based on each entry in storehouse 310 generate acoustic model data, the most each
Mesh represents different voice linguistic context.Paired training sequence and GMM are written to distributed
Associate array.In some implementations, Distributed Correlation array is the immutable B-tree that continues, all
Such as SS table.
As previously discussed, can be represented each phoneme by multiple HMM states (such as, can be by
HMM state " ih_1 ", " ih_2 " and " ih_3 " represents " ih ").Real at some
In Xian, each GMM stored in acoustic model 140 can specific to particular phoneme
The output distribution of HMM state is modeled.GMM is with HMM state (such as, " ih_1 ")
The condition that is designated, and also with voice linguistic context (such as, the linguistic context in M phoneme of surrounding
Phoneme) it is condition.Correspondingly, by the voice linguistic context of surrounding, central authorities phoneme mark and
The specific HMM state of central authorities' phoneme identifies each GMM.Each GMM can such as exist
GMM stores multiple Gauss component and the weight of each component.Diagonal angle association side can be used
Difference Gauss distribution, the distribution of full covariance Gaussian, or other expression.Additionally, each GMM
Can have with for training pattern and/or use model to identify the dimension of the characteristic vector of voice
Equal dimension.Such as, if using 39 dimensional feature vectors to describe characteristics of speech sounds, then may be used
39 dimension GMM are used to store the data of each characteristic dimension in 39 characteristic dimension.
In some implementations, when at least receiving the example of minimal amount of training sequence,
Abbreviation device only generates entry in acoustic model 140.Such as, abbreviation device 130b determines pin
Number to the speech frame collection of training sequence accumulation.If the number of frame is more than or equal to minimum
Threshold value, then abbreviation device 130b produces the GMM of training sequence, and exports < M to Associate array
Phoneme, GMM > entry.If the number of frame is less than minimum threshold, then from model, ignore instruction
Practice sequence.By this way, it is to avoid for the training sequence seldom occurred in input data
Train acoustic model 140.In some implementations, based on specific with phoneme during training
The number of the speech frame of HMM state alignment determines the number of Gauss component in given GMM
Mesh.It is, for example possible to use log-linear is regular, the function as the number n of frame adjusts
The size of GMM:
Log (number of mixed composition)=log (β)+α log (n),
Wherein β and α is the constant that experience draws, it is selected for arranging Gauss in GMM and mixes
The proper number of charge-coupled part.β can represent the default number of mixed composition, and α can control to be wrapped
The degree of the additional mixed composition contained.Generally, α has the value less than 1.Use and retouched herein
The training technique stated, it is possible to use a large amount of Gaussian Mixture components model given HMM shape
State and voice linguistic context.In some implementations, can be in the linguistic context that HMM state is modeled
Dependency GMM includes 50,100,500 or 1000 or more height
This mixed composition.
In some implementations, threshold value is exceeded when the number of the speech frame collection of given training sequence
Time, abbreviation device uses the subset of this speech frame collection.Such as, when the training data of training sequence
When the number of example exceedes threshold value, abbreviation device can use cistern sampling techniques (erservior
Sampling technique) proper subclass based on training data example and produce GMM.
In order to use housebroken acoustic model 140, system can consult GMM find sense emerging
The special sound linguistic context of interest.For the cycle tests of phoneme, based on the central authorities in sample sequence
Triphones determines suitable subregion key.Subregion key mark storage for cycle tests (and
For the every other voice linguistic context including same central triphones) the distribution array of data
Particular zones.In the subregion of the mark of distribution array, if existed in array
The corresponding GMM of cycle tests, then sample sequence itself may act as searching this correspondence
The key of GMM.

Fig. 5 is that diagram can use the voice linguistic context of variable-length to perform the system of speech recognition
The diagram of the example of 500.System 500 can use the acoustics of the voice linguistic context identifying different length
Model (such as acoustic model 140) identifies voice.System 500 includes being referred to as mapper
Multiple processing modules of 520a-520d.System 500 also includes control module 510, Yi Jitong
The speech recognition system 550 crossing network 570 and communicate with calculating equipment 560.
Calculating equipment 560 can be such as desk computer, laptop computer, honeycomb electricity
Words, smart phone, PDA(Personal Digital Assistant), tablet PC, wearable computing
Machine, navigation system, or another calculating equipment.Carried out by speech recognition system 550
Operation can be carried out by single computer systems, or can be distributed in multiple computer system
Between.Speech recognition system accesses and is stored in the acoustics on one or more data storage device
Model 540, described data storage device can be directly connected to or be connected by network 570.
Network 570 can be cable network or wireless network, or a combination of both.Network 570
One or more common network or dedicated network can be included, and the Internet can be included.
System 500 can use different amounts of voice linguistic context to evaluate the candidate transcription of language.WillThere is the linguistic context that the cycle tests of different number of voice unit is identified with acoustic model 140 Compared with.The maximum amount of voice linguistic context identified by acoustic model 140 is used to come candidateTranscribe and carry out ranking.During the assessment to candidate transcription, " rollback " is to use less languageBorder can catch a packet.This reflects voice linguistic context relatively small in acoustic model 140Coupling shows that the accuracy lower than the coupling to voice linguistic context bigger in acoustic model 140 canCan property.
Such as, the data of the candidate transcription of speech data and this speech data of mark are received.Can
To access the phonetic representation of this candidate transcription.Can be for the particular phoneme in this phonetic representation
Extract multiple cycle tests.Each cycle tests in the plurality of cycle tests can include around

Score.
In the example illustrated in Figure 5, calculate equipment 560 record containing by calculating equipment 560
The audio frequency of language 562 " fashion " said of user 502.Calculating equipment 560 will such as
The speech frame 564 including language 562 of waveform or other coded audio forms sends to voice
Identification system 550.
Speech recognition system 550 can include the front end extracting speech parameter from speech frame 564
Module.Such as, speech recognition system 550 can extract a series of speech frame 552, the most each
Frame is characterized vector, represents the characteristics of speech sounds occurred during the input voice of about 10 milliseconds.
Any suitable feature extraction algorithm can be used, such as, include that extracting mel-frequency cepstrum divides
The algorithm of amount (mel-frequency cepstral component, MFCC).
Speech recognition system 550 performs " first round " speech recognition to identify language 562
Candidate transcription.Speech recognition system 550 can use the acoustic mode being different from acoustic model 140
Type.Such as, the acoustic model for the described first round can be locally stored rather than divide
Cloth, and voice linguistic context (such as, 3 phoneme) rather than the variable of fixed amount can be used
Voice linguistic context.In some implementations, use with in order to train the training of acoustic model 140
Data or the different training data of training technique or training technique are trained and are identified for the first round
Acoustic model.
First round cognitive phase produces candidate transcription 554a-554c, the most each candidate transcription quilt
It is assigned score 555a-555c of correspondence.Each score 555a-555c can such as indicate this
Candidate transcription assigned by point is the probability correctly transcribed of language 562.Such as,
Dividing 555a-555c can be the confidence score identified for the first round by acoustic model output,
Its instruction candidate transcription is correct model confidence.Candidate transcription 554a-554c is according to score
555a-555c carrys out ranking.
Speech recognition system 550 uses acoustic model 140 to select candidate transcription 554a-554c
Subset for " second takes turns " speech recognition.For example, it is possible to select candidate transcription 554a-554c
Top ranked subset (such as, it is believed that of candidate transcription 554a-554c is just most likely to be
True set).In some implementations, speech recognition system 550 selects N number of top ranked
Candidate transcription 554a-554c, wherein N is integer, such as 5,10 or 20.All right
Use other N values.
The distributed computing framework that speech recognition system 550 takes turns speech recognition to execution second is defeated
Going out speech frame 552 and identify data 553, described identification data 553 identify candidate transcription
554a-554c and corresponding score 555a-555c.Such as, speech recognition system 550 can be by
Identify that data 553 are sent to control module 510, the main process mould that such as MapReduce realizes
Block.Control module 510 distributes identification mission to mapper 520a-520d, and coordinates second and take turns
The output identified.
In some implementations, control module 510 allocation map device 520a-520d identifies voice Different Discourse in sequence. for example, control module 510 is multiple from what said by user 502 the sequence of word provides the speech frame of the first word and candidate to transcribe to mapper 520a, Xiang Ying emitter 520b provides the speech frame of the second word and candidate to transcribe, and by that analogy. therefore, can process the said a series of language of user 502 by different mapper 502a-502d. class like, when identification is during from multiple users' voice, each mapper 502a-502d can identify the language of different user.
In illustrated example, control module 510 is distributed single mapper, for example mapper 520a, assessing all candidates transcribes 554a-554c. and is all assessed at identical mapper 520a place because all candidates corresponding to language 562 transcribe 554a-554c, therefore without copying voice frame 552 between multiple mapper 520a-520d, this has saved bandwidth and has promoted the efficient processing to mass data.
As described in further detail about Fig. 6 below, mapper 520a determines the phonetic representation of transcribing 554a-554c for each candidate, and extract the cycle tests of voice unit. for example, transcribe for given candidate, cycle tests can comprise high-order M phoneme and the corresponding rollback M phoneme of each HMM state of the each phoneme in the phonetic representation of transcribing for candidate. mapper 520a extracts the cycle tests of transcribing 554a-554c for each candidate the candidate of high rank in transcribing set.
Use the cycle tests extracting, mapper 520a obtains acoustic model data from acoustic model 140. and can visiting acoustic model 140. by distributed array management service 542, to serve 542 can be that in memory key assignments service system is (for example, SS shows service), it has S server module (not shown), wherein S/mono-, of the data in each server module storage acoustic model 140 for example, the each server module in a described S server module can be in RAM the one or more subregions in partition holding 140a-140d.
In response to request, if there are the data for this voice sequence in acoustic model 140, serving 542 corresponding to the acoustic model data of given cycle tests (for example can search, the GMM storing in acoustic model 140). mapper 520a sends the batch processing request of the cycle tests of marker extraction. and as response, the acoustic model data for cycle tests is retrieved in service 542 from each subregion 140a-140d of acoustic model 140.
In order to identify the suitable subregion therefrom obtaining for the data of given cycle tests, service 542 use the subregion key identical with subregion key in order to train acoustic model 140. for example, mark the subregion key of knowing cycle tests is the HMM status indicator of this sequence and the letter of central triphones number. as example, for cycle tests " ih_1/ae k sh__n sil～", subregion key can to be " ih_1/sh__n ", or another expression of this sequence. service 542 marks are right should be in the suitable subregion 140a-140d. of subregion key in the subregion of mark, can use uniquely specify the acoustic model 140 corresponding with cycle tests a part key (for example, based on the key of complete cycle tests " ih_1/ae k sh__n sil～") obtain for this test order the acoustic model data of row. for each cycle tests, service 542 is by corresponding acoustic mode type data offer the mapper 520a. of these data of request
Mapper 520a adjusts candidate with acoustic model data and transcribes 554a-554c's score 555a-555c. for example, transcribe for each candidate, mapper 520a can be based on connecing the data from acoustic model 140 of receiving generate score, this score indicates candidate and turns record be to speech frame 552 and from but the possibility of correctly transcribing of dialogue language 562. can be by the score of the data based on from acoustic model 140 and the score of identifying from the first round 555a-555c combine to produce score 575a-575c. through adjusting according to through adjust divide 575a-575c to transcribe 554a-554c to candidate and carry out rank again.
As described further below, use the model data of the maximum voice linguistic context of identifying for acoustic model 140 to carry out the assessment that candidate transcribes. when obtain for the cycle tests as high-order M phoneme (it represents the voice linguistic context of maximum) acoustic model data time, with this acoustic model data generate through adjust score. but, in the time that the acoustic model data for high-order M phoneme is unavailable, mapper 520a uses for having the acoustic model data of the rollback M phoneme of the linguistic context phoneme of high number and generates through adjusting score. therefore, transcribe for given candidate, can there is the output corresponding with the voice linguistic context of different length and distribute in order to evaluate the acoustic model data of different HMM states. some GMM that use may be 5 phonemes based on before or after main body phoneme and being trained, other GMM that use use 4 phonemes before or after central phoneme and are trained, and by that analogy. however, by using the acoustic model data for the voice linguistic context of maximum, system can improve the degree of accuracy of identification.
Candidate being transcribed to 554a-554c again after rank, mapper 520a is to controlling mould Block 510 sends mark and is updated over the evaluator data 578 of ranking, the other device data 578 of and control module 510 is by this knowledge be sent to speech recognition system 550. speech recognition system 550 use through upgrade rank select one or more candidates transcribe 554a-554c with provide it to calculate establish Standby 560. in illustrated example, provide candidate to transcribe 554b " fashion " and transcribe possible the transcribing of .Although candidate transcription 554a " action " is considered as by first round speech recognition as language 562, but use second of acoustic model 140 to take turns, thereby rank is adjusted to Indicate candidate transcription 554b " fashion " and be just most likely to be correct.
Generally speaking, assess to transcribe with the linguistic context phoneme of higher number and can produce than using The linguistic context phoneme result the most accurately of relatively low number.Correspondingly, recognizable multiple length is usedThe acoustic model 140 of voice linguistic context of degree can provide than the voice linguistic context only identifying regular lengthThe more preferable recognition accuracy of system.With the acoustics using only use regular length voice linguistic contextThe technology of model is compared, and the raising in accuracy of the acoustic model of use rollback M phoneme can quantizes aspect lower word error rate (WER).
Fig. 6 be being used for of being undertaken by mapper of diagram assess that the candidate of language transcribes locate The diagram of reason.In the example shown in the series of figures, N rank candidate the highest of the mapper 520a of Fig. 5 receives knowledge mentioned aboveOther device data 553 and speech frame 552. mapper 520a assessment language 562 transcribes 554a-554c.
Mapper 520a mark is for the phonetic representation 620(602 of candidate transcription 554a).
As described above, mapper 520a such as can obtain phonetic representation 620 from pronunciation dictionary.
Speech frame 564 is directed at (604) by mapper 520a with candidate transcription 554a.As are mentioned above, mapper 520a can generate context dependency state levels Viterbi and aim at after composition H C L, and wherein L, C and H correspondingly represent that pronunciation dictionary, linguistic context dependency tiee and HMM are to state FST.
Mapper 520a extracts cycle tests 630 (606 from phonetic representation 620) .As mentioned above, cycle tests 630 can be M phoneme .Such as, for phonetic representation 620 In each HMM state of each phoneme, high-order M phoneme can be extracted, and also can Extract rollback M phoneme until central authorities triphones.The maximum of M can be used for training acoustic mode The M maximum of type 140 is identical.In the example shown in the series of figures, the maximum of M is 3, but also Other values such as such as 2, 4, 5, 7 can be used.
As described above, when voice linguistic context around phoneme is asymmetric, mapper 520a
Extraction includes the cycle tests of the linguistic context phoneme of the asymmetric number before and after this phoneme.
Symbol "～" represent the vacant location context in asymmetric M phoneme.For example, with only
Use lower-order M phoneme and ignore the one or more languages from the one end with the longest linguistic context
Border phoneme is compared, and extracts asymmetric M phoneme and allows at acoustic model as cycle tests 630
More substantial linguistic context is mated in 140.Use asymmetric M phoneme for identifying now or leaning on
It is bordering on the phoneme (wherein the voice linguistic context of phoneme side may be limited) of word or sentence boundary
Can be particularly helpful.Mapper 520a can by only from central authorities phoneme include the maximum number of
Until there is symmetry number purpose linguistic context phoneme around central authorities' phoneme in the side rollback of linguistic context phoneme
Extract asymmetric cycle tests.Mapper 520a can be then from whole both sides rollback, hereafter
Generate the cycle tests of the symmetry number purpose linguistic context phoneme having around central authorities' phoneme.
In some implementations, mapper 520a obtains phonetic representation (602), by this voice
Express and be directed at (604) with speech frame 564, and extract for each candidate transcription 554a-554c
Cycle tests (606).Such as, mapper 520a extracts for time from phonetic representation
The cycle tests 631 of 554b " fashion " is transcribed in choosing.Also extract for candidate transcription 554c
Cycle tests with any other candidate transcription that mapper 520a is received.Realize at some
In, mapper 520a adds for all candidate transcription 554a-554c to pond or set 640
Cycle tests 630,631.For each language (such as, each word) to set 640
Once initialize.
Mapper 520a obtains the acoustic model of the cycle tests 630,631 in set 640
Data (608).Such as, mapper 520a is to management service 542 transmission of distributed array
The data of the cycle tests 630,631 in logo collection 640 are asked as batch processing.Specifically
For, mapper 520a can initiate remote procedure call to the main processing block of service 542,
Identify the cycle tests 630,631 in set 640.Main processing block is attempted searching then
Corresponding to the GMM of each cycle tests in set 640.
Main processing block is to each cycle tests application partition function, thus obtains cycle tests
Respective partition key.If acoustic model 140 exists the GMM corresponding to cycle tests,
Then which subregion 140a-140d subregion key identifies by the data containing this GMM.Subregion
Data in 140a-140d can be by the different server mould being each assigned different subregion key
Block is supplied.Main processing block mark is assigned to the server module of identified subregion key,
And from the request of each server module for relevant to its allocated one or more subregion keys
The GMM data of the cycle tests of connection.One or more when by handled by server module
Subregion 140a-140d includes that the GMM entry for cycle tests is (such as, for uniquely
The entry of key corresponding to this cycle tests) time, GMM data are provided by server module
To main processing block, GMM data are supplied to mapper 520a by this main processing block.When
One or more subregion 140a-140d of server module do not include the bar for cycle tests
During mesh, it is not returned for the data of this cycle tests.
Mapper 520a selects corresponding to the longest test from the acoustic model data received
The acoustic model number of sequence (such as, including the test data of linguistic context phoneme of highest number)
According to (612).As example, the cycle tests 630 for candidate transcription 554a includes pin
3 phoneme 630a, 2 phoneme 630b and 1 phoneme 630c to " ih_1 " HMM state.
If receiving the acoustic model number for cycle tests each in cycle tests 630a-630c
According to, then use the data for 3 phoneme 630a received to come " ih_1 " HMM shape
State is marked, and does not use for 2 phoneme 630b and the data of 1 phoneme 630c.But,
If being not received for the acoustic model data of 3 phoneme 630a, then use the pin received
Data to the cycle tests (2 phoneme 630b) of the linguistic context phoneme with secondary highest number.
By selecting the acoustic model number of the cycle tests for the linguistic context phoneme with highest number
According to, mapper 520a guarantees the maximum amount of voice linguistic context using acoustic model 140 to be identified.
Mapper 520a uses selected acoustic model data to adjust candidate transcription then
Score 555a-555c of 554a-554c.About Fig. 7, acoustic model is described in further detail
The selection of data and the adjustment of score 555a-555c.
Fig. 7 is the diagram of the scoring of diagram candidate transcription.Fig. 7 includes table 700, and often
Individual row 702a-702f is corresponding to different cycle testss 704.Table 700 also indicates each test
The rank 706 of sequence 704, or in other words, included at central authorities' sound in cycle tests 704
The number of the location context before and after element.
When mapper 520a request is for the acoustic model data of cycle tests 704, point
Cloth array management service 542 can provide for the survey more less than all of cycle tests 704
The acoustic model data of examination sequence.In other words, it is understood that there may be some represent not by acoustic model
The cycle tests 704 of the voice linguistic context that 140 are identified, and therefore do not have the data of correspondence to use.
When the sound for high-order training sequence (such as, in the example shown in the series of figures for M rank=3)
When model data is unavailable, mapper 520a rollback is to use for representing small amount of language
The data of the training sequence of sound linguistic context.
As example, row 702a-702c each includes and candidate transcription 554a " action "
Phonetic representation in the corresponding training sequence 704 of " ih_1 " HMM state.But,
Table 700 instruction is not for 3 phonemes (including the linguistic context phoneme of highest number) in row 702a
Available acoustic model data.As result, use for one of rollback cycle tests
Acoustic model data.Specifically, for the acoustic model data of 2 phonemes in row 702b
It is available, therefore uses the acoustic model data for this cycle tests to generate " ih_1 "
The score of HMM state.
As another example, row 702d-702f each includes and candidate transcription 554b
The training sequence 704 that " ih_1 " HMM state in the phonetic representation of " fashion " is corresponding.
Owing to for the acoustic model data of high-order cycle tests (3 phonemes in row 702d) being
Can use, therefore select the acoustic model data for this row.
Mapper utilizes selected acoustic model data to carry out the voice table for each candidate transcription
Each HMM state assignment HMM state score 708 in reaching.HMM state score 708
In the case of can indicate that the voice linguistic context in given cycle tests 704, HMM state is accurate
Really represent the probability of the speech frame of correspondence.The sound for cycle tests 704 retrieved
Learn model data and can include describing the data of the GMM trained for specific HMM state
With by the voice linguistic context indicated by training sequence 704.
In order to punish the use to lower-order training sequence, can be for having less than maximum M
The training sequence on the rank 706 of value and produce every frame rollback cost.For rollback training sequence
Punishment 710 can be distributed by below equation:
Punishment=C x (MmaxO),
Wherein C is the unit cost of each rollback phoneme, MmaxAmount be the maximum of M, and
O is the rank of cycle tests.Correspondingly, abandon or the phoneme of rollback the most (thus by test sequence
Location context representated by row is the fewest), then punishment 710 is the highest.In some implementations, no
Punishment includes the cycle tests of the linguistic context phoneme of asymmetric number.By asymmetric cycle tests
Rank o be calculated as central authorities phoneme before linguistic context phoneme number and central authorities phoneme after linguistic context
The maximum of the number of phoneme.
In the example shown in the series of figures, C value is set to 0.2, and MmaxValue be 3.Right
2 phonemes in row 702b, neglect a linguistic context phoneme relative to high-order 3 phoneme
Or location context.As result, the punishment 710 for row 702b is 0.2x (3-2), from
And obtain punishing 0.2.By contrast, 3 phonemes in row 702d are high-order training sequences,
And owing to not ignoring linguistic context phoneme, the most do not cause punishment.
It is final to generate that mapper 520a applies punishment 710 to HMM state score 708
HMM state score 712.Punishment 710 can be such as by from HMM state score 708
In deduct punishment, or by otherwise adjusting HMM state score 708 with instruction
Go out the confidence level reduction that HMM state is correct to apply.Then final HMM shape is used
State score 712 generates the score of candidate transcription.Described technology can be used for generating for
The final HMM shape of each HMM state of each phoneme in the phonetic representation of candidate transcription
State score.
In some cases, acoustic model data is for given HMM state and voice language
Any cycle tests in border is the most unavailable.In this case, mapper 520a can be dependent on
The produced previous score for this HMM state during first round speech recognition.By
Do not identified by acoustic model 140 in described cycle tests, therefore can be to first round score
Apply punishment.When mapper 520a mono-road rollback is to when using first round acoustic model, can be by
Rank o is considered as 0, and every phoneme rollback cost can reach its maximum.
Then use combined HMM state score collection to generate each candidate transcription
Overall scores.In the example shown in the series of figures, score 720 is distributed to candidate transcription 554a " action "
The different HMM states of phonetic representation.Combination to score 720 produces candidate transcription 554a
The overall scores that score value is " 0.5 " 722.Score 730 is distributed to candidate transcription 554b
The different HMM states of the phonetic representation of " fashion ".Combination to score 730 produces
The score value of candidate transcription 554b is the overall scores 732 of " 0.8 ".In the example shown in the series of figures,
The higher overall scores of candidate transcription 554b indicates, and has variable voice linguistic context by use
Acoustic model 140, transcribe " fashion " and be considered more likely compared with " action "
It is correctly transcribing of speech frame 564.
The overall scores 722,732 of acoustic model 140 can be known with from first round voice
Other score 555a-555c is combined and determines for the candidate transcription in Fig. 5
554a-554c carries out adjusted score 575a-575c of ranking.By by first round acoustics
Score 555a-555c produced by model and use second are taken turns produced by acoustic model 140 total
Log-linear interpolation between body score 722,732 calculates each candidate transcription 554a-554c
Adjusted score 575a-575c.Below equation can be used to calculate final score:
Wherein A represents that acoustic features, W represent sequence of terms, and λ is to arrange the first round and second
The weighted value of the impact of wheel acoustic model.In the example shown in the series of figures, first round acoustic model and
The weight of the second score taking turns acoustic model is equal.Addition in log probability space causes
Multiplication in canonical probability space.As example, score 575b of candidate transcription 554b
Can have by the value (such as, 0.7) of score 555b with score 732(such as, 0.8) it is multiplied
And the value 0.56 drawn.
In some implementations, for candidate transcription carried out the score of ranking be additionally based upon one or
The output of multiple language models.Based on acoustic model probability score and probabilistic language model score
The combination score of candidate transcription may utilize below equation and calculate:
LogP (W | A)=1/lmw logPAM(A|W)+logPLM(W),
Wherein A represents that acoustic features, W represent sequence of terms, and lmw is language model weight.
The score simultaneously reflecting acoustic model output and language model output can be used to select quilt
It is defined as being most likely to be correct one or more transcribe.
Fig. 8 is that diagram uses the voice linguistic context of variable-length to identify the process 800 of voice
Flow chart.Briefly, process 800 includes: receives speech data and identifies this voice number
According to the data of candidate transcription, access the phonetic representation of candidate transcription, carry from phonetic representation
Take multiple cycle tests, receive indicate acoustic model include with in the plurality of cycle tests
The data of the corresponding data of one or more cycle testss, wrapped from described acoustic model
Select among the one or more cycle tests that the data that include are targeted to include highest number
The cycle tests of linguistic context phoneme；Access the survey corresponding to select from described acoustic model
The data of examination sequence, and based on the test sequence corresponding to select from described acoustic model
Row data and generate the score of candidate transcription.
Further specifically, receive speech data and identify the candidate transcription of this speech data
Data (802).Speech data can include the characteristic vector indicating characteristics of speech sounds.Can receive
For the characteristic vector of each speech frame in multiple speech frames, the most each speech frame is such as
Represent the voice of 10 milliseconds.Speech data can be received at distributed computing system and candidate turns
Record.
Obtain the phonetic representation (804) of candidate transcription.Phonetic representation can be that linguistic context is unrelated
The sequence of phoneme.
Multiple cycle tests (806) is extracted from phonetic representation.The plurality of cycle tests
It is to extract for the particular phoneme in phonetic representation, and in the plurality of cycle tests
