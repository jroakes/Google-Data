Definitions
- This instant specification relates to speech recognition.
- a speech recognizer can convert the verbal input into symbolic representations for use by the application.
- Some current speech recognizers may use a single recognition system that attempts to identify possible speech within the verbal input. Use of a single speech recognition system may limit the accuracy of the speech identification to the accuracy associated with the single speech recognition system.
- Other current speech recognizers may use sequential speech recognitions, where two or more passes are performed on the verbal input to determine what speech is most likely represented by the verbal input. The use of multiple passes may increase the time required to generate a final speech recognition result.
- multiple speech recognition systems can each completely process the verbal input and then the output results. This use of multiple speech recognition systems also may increase the time required to generate a final result because the length of the processing time is determined by the slowest speech recognition system (and/or by the slowest computers executing the speech recognition algorithms).
- this document describes recognizing speech using multiple speech recognition systems (SRS's) in parallel, but aborting some before completion if the generated recognition result(s) meet a desired threshold.
- SRS speech recognition systems
- each SRS may have a different latency and accuracy in performing speech recognition tasks. If SRS's with a lower latency output a speech recognition result and a confidence value expressing a high confidence in the result, speech recognition tasks executed by the remaining SRS's can be aborted. If the confidence value is too low relative to a confidence threshold, more SRS's may be permitted to generate results. If these results meet a confidence threshold, the SRS's that still have not completed the speech recognition task may be aborted and so on.
- a computer-implemented method includes receiving an audio signal and initiating speech recognition tasks by a plurality of speech recognition systems (SRS's).
- SRS speech recognition systems
- Each SRS is configured to generate a recognition result specifying possible speech included in the audio signal and a confidence value indicating a confidence in a correctness of the speech result.
- the method also includes completing a portion of the speech recognition tasks including generating one or more recognition results and one or more confidence values for the one or more recognition results, determining whether the one or more confidence values meets a confidence threshold, aborting a remaining portion of the speech recognition tasks for SRS's that have not generated a recognition result, and outputting a final recognition result based on at least one of the generated one or more speech results.
- a system in a second general aspect, includes a plurality of speech recognition systems that initiate speech recognition tasks to identify possible speech encoded in a received audio signal.
- Each speech recognition system (SRS) is configured to generate a recognition result and a confidence value indicating a confidence in a correctness of the recognition result.
- the system also includes a recognition managing module to receive recognition results as the recognition results are generated by the SRS's and to receive confidence values associated with the generated recognition results.
- the recognition management module aborts uncompleted speech recognition tasks by SRS's that have not generated recognition results if one or more of the received confidence values meets a confidence threshold.
- the system includes an interface for transmitting a final recognition result selected based on the confidence values of the generated recognition results.
- a system in a third general aspect, includes a plurality of speech recognition systems that initiate speech recognition tasks for a received audio signal—each speech recognition system (SRS) configured to generate a recognition result identifying possible speech within the audio signal and a confidence value indicating a confidence in a correctness of the recognition result.
- the system includes means for receiving one or more recognition results and one or more corresponding confidence values from each SRS as the one or more recognition results are generated by the SRS, aborting uncompleted speech recognition tasks by SRS's that have not generated recognition results if one or more of the received confidence values meets a confidence threshold, and selecting a final recognition result based on the confidence values of the generated recognition results.
- the system also includes an interface for transmitting a final recognition result that represents possible speech within the audio signal.
- a system using multiple speech recognition systems to decode audio in parallel can provide improved join optimization of latency and accuracy in that it may permit unfinished recognition tasks to be aborted if satisfactory results are received. Additionally, a system using multiple recognition systems can improve rejection rates (i.e., decrease the rates). A system may also increase accuracy by comparing recognition results output by multiple recognition systems.
- a framework for scaling e.g., increasing an amount of computation resource used to provide increasing recognition performance may also be provided.

- FIG. 10 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document.
- each of the SRS's have different characteristics such as accuracy, latency, dictionaries, etc so that some of the multiple SRS's output a recognition result before other SRS's. If the output recognition results satisfy certain requirements (e.g., one or more of the generated results are associated with a specified confidence value that meets or exceeds a threshold confidence), a speech decoding system can abort the remaining SRS's before they complete their speech recognition tasks.
- certain requirements e.g., one or more of the generated results are associated with a specified confidence value that meets or exceeds a threshold confidence
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example system 100 for recognizing speech.
- the system 100 includes multiple SRS's that process a received audio signal from, for example, a cell phone.
- a user calls a voice-enabled telephone directory service that forwards an audio signal containing the user's voice to a speech recognizer that has the multiple SRS's.
- the multiple SRS's can process the audio signal in parallel, but some SRS's may generate recognition results before other SRS's. If the SRS's that generate the recognition results express a high enough confidence in those results, the remaining uncompleted speech recognition tasks can be aborted and a final recognition result can be determined based on the currently generated recognition results instead of waiting for all of the SRS's to complete their speech recognition tasks.
- the example system 100 includes a cell phone 102 that transmits voice input in the form of an audio signal 104 to a voice-enabled telephone directory information server 106 , which permits a cell phone user to verbally request telephone directory information and responses with the requested information.
- the information server 106 transmits the audio signal 104 to a speech recognizer 108 for decoding the speech embedded in the audio signal 104 .
- the speech recognizer 108 includes multiple SRS A-B that operate in parallel to decode the speech within the audio signal 104 .
- a speech recognition system (SRS) management module 110 monitors whether any of the SRS's have generated a recognition result and collects confidence values associated with those results. This monitoring is illustrated in the diagram 112 showing a parallel execution of the SRS's. The diagram 112 shows that SRS A generates a recognition result first with a confidence value of 0.3. Next, SRS E generates a recognition result with a confidence value 0.6. A little later, SRS B generates the recognition result with a confidence value 0.8. The SRS management module 110 can abort the remaining speech recognition tasks performed by SRS C,D after the recognition result is generated by SRS B because, in this implementation, the recognition result generated by SRS B has a confidence value which satisfies a predetermined confidence threshold.
- SRS speech recognition system
- a final result selection module 113 within the SRS management module 110 can select a final recognition result 114 to output to the voice-enabled telephone directory information server 106 .
- the SRS management module 110 can select the final recognition result based on a set of generated recognition results and associated confidence values 116 that are output by the SRS A,B,E that have completed the speech recognition tasks.
- the final recognition result 114 is a symbolic representation of probable speech that was decoded from the audio signal 104 .
- the directory information server 106 may have prompted the user to say the name of a city and state.
- the spoken city and state name can be encoded in the audio signal 104 received from a user of the cell phone 102 and decoded by the speech recognizer 108 .
- the final result is the speech that the decoder has determined is most probably represented by the audio signal 104 .
- the selection module 113 can transmit the final recognition result 114 to an interface 118 that, in turn, can transmit the final recognition result 114 to the voice-enabled telephone directory information server 106 .
- the interface 118 uses a set of APIs that interface with software executed at the information server 126 .
- the information server 126 may execute software that has public methods for inputting textual representations of cities, states, and business names.
- the interface 118 can include networking protocols (e.g., TCP/IP) for transmitting the information over a network to the information server 126 .
- FIG. 1 shows the directory information server 106 and the speech recognizer on separate computing devices, this is not necessary. In some implementations, both systems can be implemented on a single computing device. Similarly, each of the systems can be implemented using several computing devices. For example, each of the SRS's may be implemented using one or more computers as shown in FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example system 200 for decoding speech embedded in an audio transmission.
- the system 200 is divided into two segments: an audio transmission segment 202 and a speech recognizer segment 204 .
- the audio transmission segment 202 shows example architecture for transmitting an audio signal from a user to an application server.
- the speech recognizer segment 204 shows example architecture for interpreting or decoding speech represented by the audio transmission.
- the decoding is performed on behalf of the application server and the decoded speech is transmitted back to the application server for use in processing the user's request.
- the system 200 , the audio transmission segment 202 includes a telephone device such as the cell phone 206 , which transmits an audio signal 208 over a network (e.g., POTS, cellular, Internet, etc.) to telephony server 210 .
- the telephony server can transmit the audio to another computing device, such as a software application server 212 or directly to a voice recognition system subsequently described.
- the software application server 212 may include a software application with which the user is verbally interacting.
- the software application server can be a calendar application.
- the user can call the calendar application and request that the calendar application create an event on May 16, 2012 from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM.
- the software application server 212 can forward the received verbal input requesting the event creation to the speech recognizer segment 204 for decoding.
- the speech recognizer segment 204 includes speech recognition systems, SRS A-D and a speech recognition system (SRS) management module, which can coordinate the SRS's for use in determining what utterance is most likely represented by the audio signal 208 .
- SRS speech recognition system
- each of the SRS's can differ in one or more ways.
- the SRS's may differ by their underlying acoustic models.
- different acoustic models may target specific conditions, e.g., a user's gender, accent, age-range, or specific background and foreground noise conditions, or a specific transmission channel.
- the acoustic models may also vary by their architecture and size, e.g., smaller models with fewer parameters may produce faster recognition and larger models with more parameters may produce more accurate results.
- the acoustic models may differ by their training procedures (e.g., different randomized training sets may be used to train the model or different training algorithms may be used).
- the SRS's may differ by their language models.
- the models may target different types of data, e.g., different domain specific language models, different granularity, or different geo-locations.
- the models may differ by their architectures, sizes, training procedure, etc.
- the SRS's can differ by other components such as an end-pointer, front-end, dictionary, confidence estimation algorithm, search configuration, etc.
- a language model 252 For illustrative purposes, a language model 252 , acoustic model 254 , and speech recognition algorithms 256 for SRS D are shown in FIG. 2 .
- the SRS management module 250 when the SRS management module 250 receives the audio signal 208 , it initiates a process by which the incoming utterance is recognized using two or more of the SRS's in parallel. For example, four speech recognition tasks are executed in parallel by the four SRS's (SRS A-D ) in an attempt to recognize the same utterance represented by the audio signal 208 .
- each SRS may have a specific latency.
- the latency may depend on the SRS architecture (e.g., acoustic model, language model, or other components), but it also may vary based on a specific instantiation of a speech recognition task. For example, if a SRS has information indicating that the utterance will fall within a certain group of words (e.g. yes, no, nope, min, affirmative, negatory, no way, yipper, etc.), the latency for a particular model may be much shorter than when the SRS does not have information indicating a constrained context in which the utterance was uttered (e.g., the utterance was not in the context of a yes or no question).
- each SRS upon completion of its speech recognition task, outputs a recognition result (e.g. what the SRS determines the incoming utterance said), and a measure of how confident the SRS is in the correctness of its result.
- a recognition result e.g. what the SRS determines the incoming utterance said
- the SRS management module 250 has a recognition result monitor 258 that keeps track of recognition results 262 that are generated by the SRS's.
- the result monitor 258 can also monitor the confidence values 264 , or scores, associated with the recognition results 262 .
- the result monitor 258 can calculate combined confidence scores for each recognition result. For example, SRS A and SRS B may generate a recognition result “May 16” for an incoming utterance SRS A may associate its result with a confidence value of 0.8 and SRS B may associate its result with a confidence value of 0.7 The result monitor 258 can calculate that the current running average for the result “May 16” is 0.75 (i.e., (0.8+0.7)/2). The combined confidence value can be updated every time the recognition result (and corresponding confidence value) is generated by a SRS.
- the SRS management module 250 may also include a latency monitor 260 that tracks the latency (e.g., actual or estimated time to completion of the speech recognition task) for each of the SRS's. For example, the latency monitor 260 can track how long a particular speech recognition task has taken a SRS to produce a recognition result.
- a latency monitor 260 that tracks the latency (e.g., actual or estimated time to completion of the speech recognition task) for each of the SRS's. For example, the latency monitor 260 can track how long a particular speech recognition task has taken a SRS to produce a recognition result.
- the latency monitor 260 can also monitor whether or not a SRS has completed a speech recognition task (e.g. by monitoring whether the SRS has output a recognition result). Additionally, the latency monitor 260 can estimate a predicted latency for a SRS to complete a speech recognition task. For example, the latency monitor 260 can access empirical information gathered for the SRS that indicates how long the SRS has taken to complete a similar speech recognition tasks (e.g., how long it has previously taken a SRS to decode an utterance spoken in a similar context such as in answer to a particular prompted question).
- the latency monitor 260 may also access information about characteristics of underlying model(s) to determine an estimated time for a SRS to complete a speech recognition task (e.g., the latency monitor 260 can determine whether the SRS may take longer to complete a speech recognition to due to a larger dictionary of words that must be searched to identify a recognition result).
- the SRS management module can include a SRS aborter 270 that communicates with the latency monitor 260 and/or the recognition result monitor 258 to determine whether to transmit abort commands 266 for SRS's that have not yet completed decoding the received audio signal 208 .
- the SRS aborter 270 may determine whether the tracked confidence values and/or latencies satisfy an operating point or curve. If so, all remaining speech recognition to can be aborted.
- the SRS management module 250 may determine that a confidence threshold of 0.75 for a recognition results should be reached before aborting any unfinished speech recognition tasks.
- the confidence threshold may vary for different speech recognition tasks. For example, if context information associated with a particular speech recognition task indicates that the recognition result is limited to a relatively small number of utterances (e.g., the recognition task is in the context of an answer to a yes or no question presented to the user), the SRS supporter 270 can determine that the confidence value should be relatively high (e.g., 0.8, 0.9, 0.95).
- the SRS aborter 270 can determine that the confidence threshold for the recognition result may be relatively low (e.g., 0.49, 0.55, 0.61) and still acceptable to the SRS management module 250 .
- the aborter 270 can transmit the abort command 266 to any unfinished SRS's. For example, if the combined confidence value of the SRS A,B is equal to or greater than 0.75, the aborter 270 can transmit the abort command 266 to the SRS's that have not generated a recognition result yet.
- threshold confidence point e.g. 0.75
- the aborter 270 can transmit the abort command 266 to the SRS's that have not generated a recognition result yet.
- the aborter 270 may transmit the abort commands 266 if one of the recognition results has a confidence value that is equal or greater than 0.75.
- the confidence value may not be a combined confidence value but instead may be a single confidence value associated with a recognition result in generated by a single SRS.
- the SRS aborter 270 can transmit abort commands based on actual or estimated latencies for the SRS. For example, if SRS A and SRS B have generated recognition results and the recognition results are associated with very low confidence values, the SRS aborter 270 may abort the remaining unfinished speech recognition tasks. In this case, the remaining speech recognition tasks may be cancelled under an assumption that the SRS's that have not completed the recognition task will not produce a recognition result that has a high confidence value because other SRS's have not produced such a recognition result.
- the SRS aborter 270 can transmit the abort commands 266 and initiate a process where the user is requested to repeat an utterance 274 .
- the SRS's can then attempt to decode the new utterance.
- the SRS management module 250 can initiate a process in which a request is made to switch to a human operator.
- the human operator can intercept the audio signal in response to the user as indicated by an arrow 276 , which illustrates routing the audio signal to a call center 278 .
- the human operator can address the request or information conveyed by the user.
- the SRS aborter 270 can first query the latency monitor 260 to determine whether to transmit the abort commands 266 to the unfinished SRS's. For example, if the SRS aborter 270 queries the latency monitor 260 and determines that one of the unfinished SRS's will likely complete in a relatively short amount of time, the SRS aborter 270 can hold off to obtain the results from the nearly completed SRS. After the result(s) are generated, the SRS aborter 270 can transmit the abort commands 266 to stop the remaining unfinished SRS's from completing the speech recognition.
- the additional recognition result and associated information may be valuable enough to delay transmitting the abort command until a nearly finished SRS has completed. For example, if characteristics associated with the nearly finished SRS indicate that its recognition results are often more accurate than the results of the previously completed SRS's, the aborter 270 may wait until the nearly finished SRS has generated a recognition result before aborting the remaining unfinished speech recognition tasks.
- the confidence threshold is determined using a function with one or more variables.
- a confidence function can have variables including the confidence values and latencies. If the generated confidence values and observed latencies satisfy the confidence function, the aborter 270 can cancel any unfinished speech recognition tasks. For example, within short latency periods, the confidence function may dictate that the confidence values should be very high for the confidence function to be satisfied. This may be based partially on an assumption that if the aborter 270 quickly issues an abort command, the probability that the generated result is correct should be very high because other potential recognition results will not be generated. As the latency increases, the required confidence values may drop under an assumption that a speech recognition task that takes longer to process may be more difficult, and thus, the confidence in the result will likely be lower.
- the SRS management module 250 can also include a final results selection module 280 that, in some implementations, selects a final recognition result from the generated recognition results.
- the selection module 280 can select a recognition result with the highest combine confidence value or the recognition result with the highest single confidence value.
- the selection of the final recognition result can be influenced based on which SRS generated the recognition result.
- the selection module 280 may weight, or favor, the selection of a recognition result if it is generated by SRS's that have relatively different components (e.g. language models, acoustic models, speech recognition algorithms, etc.) and/or that typically produce different recognition results.
- a SRS correlation monitor 282 can track a correlation between the output recognition results for SRS's. If the output recognition results indicate that two SRS's are not highly correlated, yet in a particular recognition task they generate the same recognition result—that result can be more heavily weighted, or favored, in the selection of the final recognition result. Alternatively, if the SRS's that generate a recognition results are highly correlated, the recognition result may be discounted, or not weighted so that the result is not necessarily favored in the selection of the final recognition result.
- the correlation monitor 282 can dynamically update correlation values that specify a correlation between two more SRS's based on recognition results generated by the SRS's. For example, two SRS's that are associated with a low correlation value may begin to produce similar recognition results.
- the correlation monitor 282 can update the correlation value (e.g., increase it) to reflect the increase overlap in recognition results between the SRS's.
- the SRS management model can transmit the result back to the software application server that requested that the audio signal be decoded.
- the software application server can use the decoded audio signal to process the user's request.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example method 300 for recognizing speech using parallel decoding.
- the method 300 may be performed, for example, by a system such as the systems 100 and 200 and, for clarity of presentation, the description that follows uses the systems 100 and 200 as the basis of an example for describing the method. However, another system, or combination of systems, may be used to perform the method 300 .
- an audio signal is received.
- the speech recognizer 108 may receive the audio signal 104 .
- the audio signal 104 has already been sampled and segmented into digital frames for processing before transmission to the speech recognizer 108 .
- the speech recognizer 108 performs these functions as well.
- the audio signal may have been pre-processed to identify which portions of the signal contain speech and which portions are determined to be noise.
- the received audio signal 104 may only include the portions determined to have speech, which may then be decoded by the speech recognizer 108 in the following steps.
- steps 304 A-N speech recognitions tasks (SRT's) are initiated.
- the SRT's are initiated substantially simultaneously and begin to decode speech represented by the audio signal 104 .
- SRS's such as SRS A-D of FIG. 2 , may have different latencies in processing the audio signal so that the SRT's may required different amounts of time to complete.
- step 306 the progress of the SRT's is monitored.
- the latency monitor 260 can track the latency (both actual and estimated) associated with each SRS.
- step 308 it is determined whether any of the SRT-N have generated recognition results.
- the SRS's may output the recognition results (or an indication that the result exists) to the recognition result monitor 258 after they are generated. If none of the SRS's has generated recognition results, the method 300 can return to step 306 and continue monitoring the progress of the SRT's. If the SRS's have generated one or more recognition results, the method can continue to step 310 .
- step 310 a determination is made whether any confidence values associated with the generated recognition result(s) satisfy a confidence threshold.
- the SRS aborter 270 can compare confidence values (either single or combined confidence value) for the recognition results to a confidence point or a confidence function as previously described. If the current confidence values do not meet the confidence threshold, the method 300 can return to step 306 where the progress of the SRT's are monitored. If the confidence threshold is met, the method 300 can proceed to step 312 .
- step 312 unfinished SRT's are aborted. For example, if there are ten SRT's executing in parallel and four have completed, the remaining six SRT's can be canceled or aborted.
- the SRS aborter 270 can transmit abort commands 266 to the appropriate SRS's so that they cease speech recognition tasks.
- one or more of the speech recognition tasks are not aborted, but merely “paused,” (e.g., the state of the processing task may be saved and restarted at a later time). For example, if a recognition result turns out to be incorrect (e.g., a user replies in the negative when the software application server prompts a user to confirm the speech has been decoded correctly), the “paused” speech recognition tasks can be restarted.
- the SRT's can be selectively paused based on, for example, the accuracy of the SRS executing the SRT. For example, if a recognition result is associated with a confidence value that just barely meets the confidence threshold, the aborter 270 may selectively pause the SRT's of the more accurate SRS's while aborting the rest of the SRT's. If the recognition result turns out to be incorrect, the paused SRT of the more accurate SRS can be restarted.
- the SRT's that previously completed and the ones that were previously aborted can be started simultaneously with the “unpaused” SRT. This may give the more accurate SRT more time to complete than if the SRT was completely restarted.
- information inferred or determined based on the user's confirmation of the incorrect recognition can be integrated into the unpaused SRT's as will as the restarted tasks. For example, the erroneous utterance can be removed from consideration in the new round of speech decoding. Additionally, some sounds, words, etc. used to determine the erroneous result may be discounted or excluded from consideration in the second round of recognition processing.
- a final recognition result is selected based on the generated results.
- the final result selection module 280 can identify a recognition result that is associated with the highest averaged confidence score.
- the selection can also be weighted based on the accuracy of the SRS producing the result, where results from typically accurate SRS's are favored over less accurate SRS's.
- the selection can also be based on the correlation between machines that generate the result or a frequency of occurrence associated with the result.
- the selected result can be output to the application that requested decoding of the audio signal.
- the method can end.
- FIGS. 4 A-C show diagrams illustrating executions of example speech recognition tasks.
- FIG. 4 A shows the execution of four SRT's by four SRS's.
- the SRT's are initiated in parallel and SRS A generates a recognition result first.
- the SRS A determines a confidence value of 0.7 for its recognition result.
- the SRS management module 110 can compare the confidence value against a confidence threshold. If the confidence value does not meet the threshold, the remaining tasks are permitted to execute. For instance, if the confidence threshold was fixed constant of 0.9, the SRS management module would permit the remaining SRS's to continue because the initial recognition result of 0.7 did not meet the threshold.
- SRS B generates a recognition result and an associated value of 0.85. This confidence value does not meet the 0.9 confidence threshold either, so the remaining tasks are allowed to continue.
- the SRS management system may also track the latency associated with each of the SRS's and may compare these latencies to a permitted latency threshold. As shown in FIG. 4 A , in some implementations, the SRS management module 110 can transmit an abort command to SRS's (e.g., SRS C and SRS D ) if they do not produce a recognition result before the latency threshold.
- SRS's e.g., SRS C and SRS D
- the SRS management module 110 may select a result that has the highest confidence value even if it did not meet the confidence threshold. In some implementations, the next highest confidence value may have to be within a determined range of the confidence threshold (e.g., 10%) to be selected. In yet other implementations, if a recognition result is not selected, the SRS management module 110 may send a request that the verbal input be repeated.
- FIG. 4 B is a diagram illustrating aborting unfinished SRT's once a SRS generates a recognition result having a confidence value that meets a confidence threshold.
- the confidence threshold is 0.9.
- the SRS A generates a recognition result first, but it assigns a confidence value of 0.7 to the result, which is lower than the confidence threshold. Consequently, the SRS management module 110 permits the SRS B-D to continue executing.
- SRS B generates a recognition result next and assigns it a confidence value of 0.9.
- the SRS management module 110 compares this confidence value to the confidence threshold and determines that the threshold is met.
- the SRS management module may then send out an abort command to SRS C and SRS D , which stop their respective SRT's without producing a recognition result.
- FIG. 4 C is a diagram illustrating aborting unfinished SRT's based on low confidence values of recognition results that have been generated in this example, the confidence threshold may be set at a fixed point of 0.9.
- the SRS A and the SRS B generate recognition results, however, both results are associated with relatively low confidence values 0.3 and 0.25, respectively.
- the SRS management module 110 may transmit an abort command to SRS C and SRS D under an assumption that these SRS's are unlikely to produce a recognition result having a confidence value that meet a confidence threshold because the previous SRS's produced recognition results having confidence values significantly below the confidence threshold.
- the SRS management module 110 can wait a determined amount of time before transmitting the abort command based on the low confidence values of previously generated recognition results. In some implementations, the SRS management module 110 initiates the time period based upon when the last recognition result was generated. The determined time period may allow for another SRS to complete its SRT; however, if no result is generated during the time period allowed, the command to abort any unfinished of SRT can be transmitted.
- the determination of the time period to wait may be based on an estimated latency of one or more of the SRS's that have not generated a recognition result.
- the SRS management module 110 may determine that the SRS C has the shortest estimated latency of the remaining SRS's. For instance, the SRS C may have a typical latency of 0.5 seconds. If the SRS B generates a recognition result after 0.4 seconds, the speech recognition management module 100 may delay 0.1 seconds to determine if the SRS C generates a recognition result before transmitting an abort command.
- the abort command can be transmitted immediately.
- the SRS management module 110 can transmit an abort command after a determined number of SRS's generates a recognition result also associated with a low confidence value.
- the abort command is transmitted as soon as half of the SRS's return a recognition result associated with a low confidence value.
- the system continues to receive more recognition results until the system confirms that the composite (e.g., total/accumulated) confidence value is above some threshold. With some recognition tasks, the confirmation never occurs, and the system can end the recognition process by rejecting the utterance. Therefore, in some implementations, there are three types of confidence: first, an original confidence from each recognition process; second, an accumulated total confidence determined from the original confidences from each recognition process, and third, an expectation that the total confidence may change (e.g., increase) as the system waits for more recognition events.
- the system receives a sufficient number of consistently low confidence results across de-correlated recognizers to encourage aborting all recognition tasks and rejection the utterance. If the rejection occurs, the system can prompt the user to repeat the utterance.
- the rejection case may occur, for example, when the individual original confidence values are consistently low, the accumulated total confidence is low, and the expectation that the total confidence may change with more recognition is also low.
- training for the estimated expected confidence change given a particular set of confidence values is performed ahead of time by counting distributions of final recognition confidence given training examples of partial recognition confidences. (e.g., after seeing 20 confidence values below 0.1 from the first 20 fast recognizers, the system never experiences examples where the combined confidence value with more than 20 recognizers increased the total confidence value above 0.5. Thus, the system is trained to reject the utterance when this situation occurs).
- FIGS. 5 A-C are diagrams of example recognition results and confidence values generated by SRS's and different method of selecting a final recognition result. Specifically, FIGS. 5 A-C show SRS A output 502 from SRS A , SRS B output 504 from SRS B , and SRS C output 506 from SRS C . In this example, the output is generated in response to each SRS attempting to decode an audio signal that represents the word “carry” Because each of the SRS's may be different, the recognition results produced by the SRS's may be different as illustrated by FIGS. 5 A-C .
- the SRS output includes a top N recognition results (where N can represent any positive integer or 0) that are selected based on which recognition results are associated with the greatest confidence values.
- FIG. 5 A shows an example selection algorithm that selects a recognition result associated with the highest confidence value.
- the final result selection module 113 may compare all of the recognition results and select the one associated with the greatest confidence value.
- the result “carry” is selected as a final recognition result because it is associated with the highest confidence value—0.75—out of all the confidence values.
- the selection module may then output the recognition result “carry” for further processing by the application that requested the speech decoding.
- FIG. 5 B shows an example selection algorithm that selects a recognition result based on which result has a highest combined confidence value. For example, more than one SRS may generate the same recognition result, but may assign a different confidence value to the result. In some implementations, multiple confidence scores for the same result can be averaged (or otherwise combined) to create a combined confidence score. For example, the recognition result “carry” is generated by both SRS A and SRS C , however, SRS A assigns the result a 0.75 confidence value and SRS C assigns the result a 0.2 confidence value. The average of these confidence values is 0.475.
- the selection module 113 may select “quarry” as the final recognition result because its combined confidence value is greater than the combined confidence values of the other results. Notice that this selection algorithm produces a different final result than the algorithm described in FIG. 5 B despite the fact that the selection was made from the same pool of recognition results.
- FIG. 5 C shows an example selection algorithm that takes into account weighting factors in a selection of the recognition result.
- the weights may be based on a frequency of occurrence of the recognition result.
- a table 550 lists three weights that may be multiplied times the combined confidence scores previously discussed to create new weighted confidence scores.
- a weight of “1” is multiplied times the combined confidence score if the recognition result is generated by a single SRS (e.g., if the result occurs with a frequency of“one”). Consequently, if the recognition result only occurs once, it will not receive any benefit from the weighting. If a recognition result occurs twice, it may be weighted using a factor of 1.02, which slightly favors the recognition result over another recognition result that only occurs once. If a recognition result occurs three times, it may be weighted by a factor 1.04.
- the combined confidence value for the recognition result “Cory” would be weighted against a factor of 1.04, which results in a weighted value of 0.6344.
- the combined confidence value for the recognition result “quarry” would be weighted against a factor of 1.02, which results in a weighted value of 0.6324.
- the selection module 113 may select the result “Cory” over the result “quarry” because the weighted combined confidence score of the former is the higher than that of the latter even though the unweighted combined confidence score of “Cory” is less than that of the result “quarry.”
- Values used to select the final recognition result may be weighted based on several criteria including, but not limited to, the distribution of confidence scores generated by an SRS, characteristics of a SRS that generated the recognition result (e.g., overall accuracy, accuracy in a particular context, accuracy over a defined time period, etc.), and the similarity between the SRS's that produce the same recognition result.
- the final recognition result may be weighted using a correlation of recognition confidence values with recognition errors for a recognizer and for the final composite recognizer. For example, during training the system can count a number of times that a particular recognizer comes back with a confidence value of 0.3, and also count how often those “0.3 confidence recognition results” are errors for that recognizer and how often the final combined recognition is also a recognition error. The system may use the same normalization counting when combining similar recognition results. The combined confidence can be estimated from a number of times that the recognizers had the same result (with given confidence values) and that the common result was correct.
- FIG. 6 is an example graph 600 of a distribution of confidence values used to weight values used in a selection of a final recognition result.
- the y-axis of the graph indicates where along a normalized scale (from 0.0 to 1.0) a particular confidence value falls.
- the x-axis of the graph labels which particular SRS produces which recognition result.
- the SRS A generates five recognition results, four of which are clustered relatively close together toward the mid-to-lower range of possible confidence values.
- a single recognition result, quarry is located substantially separate from the other recognition results and has a relatively higher confidence value. This may indicate that SRS A has more confidence that the result “quarry” is significantly better than the other results, which are more fungible for each other.
- the outlier, or separate, higher confidence value can be weighted to favor selection the associated recognition result.
- the selection module 113 can weight the confidence value 0.9 for the result “quarry” with a constant of 1.05. The resulting confidence value for “quarry” then increases to 0.945.
- the confidence values that are more evenly spaced may not receive additional weighting (or may receive less weighting).
- the confidence values for the recognition results generated by the SRS B are more evenly spaced with no significant outliers.
- the selection module 113 may not add a weight to a confidence value for the top ranked recognition result “quarry,” because it is less likely that the top ranked recognition result is correct (e.g., “quarry” does not stand out as far and away the top result among a cluster of results with lower confidence values).
- FIGS. 7 A-E are Venn diagrams shown example recognition result sets output by SRS's and correlations between the sets, which may be used to weight the recognition results.
- FIG. 7 A is a Venn diagram 700 that includes three recognition result sets—recognition results A generated by SRS A , recognition results B generated by SRS B , and recognition results C generated by SRS C .
- results A , results B , and results C partially overlap.
- results A and results A have more results which overlap compared to the overlap between results A and results C or results B and results C . This may indicate that the SRS A and SRS B often produce the same recognition result (or results), whereas SRS C 's results do not correspond to the results of SRS A or SRS B as often.
- the intersection of results is based on which SRS's produce the same recognition results in response to a particular speech recognition task. For example, if two SRS's generate a top ranked recognition result for a particular task, this result may be added to the intersection set.
- results that are not both associated with a top ranking may be added to the intersection result, but may also be associated with a discount factor that indicates they differ in ranking. For example, a difference between the two rankings can be used to discount a weighting factor associated with the intersection (e.g., each difference in rankings may be associated with a discount factor).
- the absolute difference is 3, which may be associated with a discount factor of 0.3 that is multiplied times a weight associated with the intersection.
- the weight is 1.03 and the discount factor is 0.3
- the total weight can be multiplied against the “boost” factor of the weight 1.03, namely, against 0.03. This results in a new, lower boost factor of 0.01 so that the new total weight value is 1.01.
- an overlap in recognition results between SRS's may be used to weight the recognition results so that they are favored or disfavored in a selection of a final recognition result. For example, if a recognition result is generated by two SRS's that often agree, it may be weighted less (or disfavored) relative to a recognition result that is generated by two SRS's that do not often agree. FIGS. 7 B-E illustrates this in more detail.
- FIG. 7 B shows a Venn diagram 710 that only includes the results A and results B from the Venn diagram 700 of FIG. 7 A .
- the SRS A and SRS B may be classified as somewhat similar based on the similarity in their recognition results.
- a weighting factor can be assigned to a recognition result that falls within an overlap between two (or more) SRS's. For example, a weighting factor of 0.01 may be associated with recognition results that fall within this set.
- this weighting factor is smaller when the overlap is bigger, and the weighting factor is greater when the overlap is smaller. This may reflect an assumption that results that are generated by SRS's that do not often agree should be favored because these overlapping results are more likely to be correct. For example, SRS's that produce differing results may have different underlying architectures and be susceptible to different types of recognition errors.
- FIG. 7 C shows a Venn diagram 720 that only includes the results A and results C from the Venn diagram 700 of FIG. 7 A .
- the overlap between the results is smaller than the overlap shown in FIG. 7 B .
- the weighting factor of 0.06 is greater for results that fall within the overlap relative to results within the intersection shown in FIG. 7 B .
- FIG. 7 D shows a Venn diagram 730 that includes the results B and results C .
- the intersection of these results is of a size between the intersections of FIGS. 7 B and 7 C .
- the weighting factor is also of a size (e.g., 0.03) between the weighting factors associated with the intersections of the FIGS. 7 B and 7 C .
- FIG. 7 E shows the Venn diagram 700 also shown in FIG. 7 A , however, an intersection between the results of all SRS A-C is highlighted.
- the intersection reflects a set of recognition results that have been generated by each of the SRS's. Given that agreement between the three SRS's is relatively rare (in this example), a recognition result that falls within this set may be associated with a weight that is higher than the other weights, namely, 0.1.
- FIGS. 8 A and 8 B show Venn diagrams 800 and 810 that illustrate how the intersection between SRS's may adapt or change during runtime operation of the system. In some implementations, as an intersection of recognition results changes, weights associated with the intersection may change as well.
- FIG. 8 A shows an example first intersection in recognition results generated by SRS A and SRS B .
- the first intersection is associated with a weight of 0.01.
- the speech recognizer 108 performs additional speech decoding and generates additional recognition results.
- the SRS correlation monitor 282 can monitor the results and identify intersections of the results between the various SRS's.
- the correlation monitor 282 can dynamically update the intersection calculations as more results are generated. This is illustrated by FIG. 8 B , which shows the same SRS A and SRS B in FIG. 8 A except that the intersection has changed. In this example, the intersection has grown because the number of times that the SRS's have agreed for a particular speech recognition task has increased relative to the number of tasks that the SRS's have performed.
- the weight can also be decreased.
- the intersection result set of the diagram 810 can be associated with a lower weight of 0.001.
- the change in the weight value can be linearly associated with the change in the size of the intersection result set.
- the system may weight or favor a result from a recognizer less when the recognizer is similar to another recognizer.
- a similarity in recognition results for two recognizers is expressed as an intersection between the two recognizers, where the greater the intersection, the less weight the system may attach to the recognition results when both recognizers generate the same result.
- FIG. 9 is a graph 900 illustrating an example correlation between an SRS's error rate and weights to associate with recognition results.
- recognition results generated by SRS's with low error rates may be weighted more heavily in a selection of the final recognition results. For example, if a SRS has a high error rate, its recognition result may be discounted (or not weighted as heavily) compared to a recognition result generated by a highly accurate SRS.
- the graph 900 illustrates an example function, or algorithm, for assigning weights to particular SRS.
- the y-axis of the graph 900 indicates the error rates associated with SRS's, and the x-axis indicates the weight associated with the SRS's.
- a discounting weight e.g., 0.9, 0.95, 0.8
- a boost weight e.g., 1.01, 1.04, 1.1
- a neutral weight e.g., 1 is used to weight SRS's that fall on the error threshold (e.g., SRS D ).
- the error rate associated with each SRS may be updated based on confirmation that the recognition result is incorrect (e.g., the result is selected as the final recognition result and is rejected by a user, a first result is selected as the final recognition result and is determined to be correct based on a user's acceptance so the unselected results are recorded as erroneous results, etc.).
- the selection module 113 can dynamically vary the weight based on the updated error rate associated with each SRS.

- the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer.

- a keyboard and a pointing device e.g., a mouse or a trackball
- Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well, for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- the systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components.
- the components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), peer-to-peer networks (having ad-hoc or static members), grid computing infrastructures, and the Internet.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- peer-to-peer networks having ad-hoc or static members
- grid computing infrastructures and the Internet.
- the computing system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network.
- the relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- a combined, or joint, confidence score of multiple SRS's may include features such as consistency of hypotheses, or guesses as to an utterance's identity. For example, three SRS's outputting a first result with a confidence of 0.8 may be more reliable than one SRS outputting a second result with a confidence of 0.9.
- a predetermined set of SRS's can be selected for use based on latency or other factors. For example, if audio is received in response to prompting a user for an answer to a yes or no question, the fastest two SRS's can be selected to process the answer instead of permitting all available SRS's to process the answer.
- overall confidence in a final recognition result may drop when individual recognition results generated by SRS's do not agree.
- One example algorithm for selecting a “best” current result when recognition results do not overlap at all is to select a recognition result with a highest individual confidence.
- the combined confidence would be the expected number of correct recognition results counted during training when the system had a similar condition of no overlap and similar given confidence values. Similar counts and statistics also can be estimated for given amounts of partial overlap in recognition results. Therefore, the overall system can assign a higher confidence value to a combination of partially overlapping recognition results, since/if the degree of overlap is correlated to fewer overall recognition errors during training.
