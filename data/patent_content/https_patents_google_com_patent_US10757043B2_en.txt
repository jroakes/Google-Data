Definitions
- Mobile devices are advantageous in that they can be taken anywhere. However, with their small screens and limited bandwidth, it can be difficult for users to obtain information that they need in a timely manner. In addition, users may prefer chatting using their mobile devices; however, some information may only be available by making a phone call and speaking with a human.
- Implementations generally relate to messaging applications. Certain implementations may automatically analyze one or more of content of one or more messaging conversations (also referred to herein as “message exchange threads”) and/or user information to automatically provide suggestions to a user within a messaging application. In certain examples, the suggestions may automatically incorporate particular non-messaging functionality into the messaging application. In certain other examples, the automatic suggestions may suggest one or more appropriate responses to be selected by a user to respond in the messaging application, and/or may automatically send one or more appropriate responses on behalf of a user.
- messages exchange threads also referred to herein as “message exchange threads”
- the suggestions may automatically incorporate particular non-messaging functionality into the messaging application.
- the automatic suggestions may suggest one or more appropriate responses to be selected by a user to respond in the messaging application, and/or may automatically send one or more appropriate responses on behalf of a user.
- the automatic suggestions may be customized based on whether a chat bot is participating in the messaging conversation. That is, in certain examples, a first set of automatic responses may be suggested if a chat bot is absent in a messaging conversation, while a second set of automatic responses may be suggested if a chat bot is present in the messaging conversation, with the first and second sets of responses being at least partially different.
- the implementations may employ an understanding of the conversational rules followed by the chat bot, and suggest responses to a user based on the rules.
- response(s) may be suggested that conform to the rules followed by the given chat bot, whereas the response(s) may not have been suggested if the given chat bot were absent (yet the messages of the conversation were the same).
- This mitigates the challenges that users typically have in communicating with chat bots in a language and in a format that is easily understood by the chat bots.
- This may also reduce network traffic and/or other computational resources by increasing the likelihood that communications to chat bots are in a language and format understood by the chat bots, which may mitigate the need for additional communications to/from the chat bots to clarify responses that do not conform to language and format requirements of the chat bots.
- contextually relevant suggestions may provide participant(s) with content that is directed to a contextually relevant entity, without requiring the participant(s) to switch from an application rendering the message exchange thread to another application in order to acquire such content. This may reduce the use of certain computational resources that would otherwise be consumed in switching to another application to satisfy the informational needs. For example, switching to another application may require usage of processor, memory, and/or battery resources via launching and/or surfacing of the application. Further, switching to another application to obtain content in lieu of obtaining the content in a message exchange thread may increase the amount of time a participant needs to spend obtaining the information—which may lead to a corresponding increase in consumption of computational resources in obtaining the content.
- a computer-implemented method implemented by one or more processors includes receiving one or more messages of a message exchange thread between multiple users.
- the multiple users include a first user and a second user, and the one or more messages are each submitted by a corresponding one of the multiple users via a corresponding messaging application.
- the method further includes determining a first bot of a first type based on the one or more messages and determining a second bot of a second type based on the one or more messages.
- the second type is different from the first type.
- the type of the bot corresponds to a task performed by the bot.
- a bot of a first type may be a restaurant reservation bot and a bot of a second type may be a food order bot.
- the method further includes selecting the first bot over the second bot based on content within the one or more messages, and transmitting a bot command to the first bot based on the content. Transmitting the bot command to the first bot is in response to selecting the first bot over the second bot.
- the method further includes receiving responsive content from the first bot in response to transmitting the bot command to the first bot, and providing the responsive content from the first bot for presentation to at least the first user via the corresponding messaging application of the first user.
- These and other implementations may, by selecting the first bot over the second bot, not transmit to the second bot any bot command that is based on the content. This may conserve network resources by not transmitting the bot command to the second bot and/or may conserve computational resources associated with the second bot by preventing the second bot from needing to act on the command. Moreover, these and other implementations may, by providing the responsive content for presentation via the corresponding messaging application, prevent the user from switching to another application to obtain the content, which may conserve various computational resources.
- selecting the first bot over the second bot based on the content within the one or more messages includes: (a) determining a topic from the one or more messages; and selecting the first bot based on the topic; and/or (b) performing semantic analysis on the one or more messages; and selecting the first bot based on the semantic analysis.
- determining the first bot and the second bot includes: determining that at least one term, of a given message of the one or more messages, is associated with invocation of both the first bot and the second bot.
- selecting the first bot over the second bot based on the content includes: selecting the first bot based on at least one additional term, of an additional message of the one or more messages, being associated with invocation of the first bot but not being associated with invocation of the second bot.
- the additional message may be, for example, an additional message submitted in the message exchange thread prior to the given message.
- selecting the first bot based on the content within the one or more messages includes: generating, prior to the message exchange thread, a trained machine learning model from a training set data; applying the content to the trained machine learning model to generate output over the trained machine learning model; and selecting the first bot based on the output indicating the first bot.
- selecting the first bot over the second bot is further based on at least one of: a location of the first user and user information associated with the first user.
- the method further includes: requesting, from an information source, additional information that is particularized to the first bot; receiving the additional information based on the requesting; and generating the bot command to conform to the first bot based on the additional information.
- the method further includes: determining that the one or more messages are associated with a destination; and determining a time that the first user will be at the destination.
- the bot command identifies the destination and the time.
- the method further includes: determining that the first user is associated with an active role based on the one or more messages; and based on determining that the first user is associated with the active role, choosing the first user over the second user to receive the responsive content from the first bot.
- providing the responsive content from the first bot for presentation to at least the first user includes providing the responsive content for presentation to the first user without providing the responsive content for presentation to the second user.
- the method further includes: receiving, responsive to providing the responsive content, a question from the first user that is directed to the first bot; responsive to receiving the question, instructing the first bot to ask a business owner of a business that is associated with the first bot for additional information; generating an answer that includes the additional information; and providing the answer for presentation to the first user in response to receiving the question.
- the method further includes: determining that the additional information includes new information; and updating, in one or more computer readable media, a business profile for the business based on the new information. Some of those implementations thus modify the business profile to reflect the new information and prevent the need to again ask an owner for the additional information in response to another instance of the question, which may prevent transmissions and/or other computational resource consumptions associated with again asking.
- providing the responsive content from the first bot includes providing the first user with a user interface that includes a field that sends text entered into the field or a selection to the first bot.
- Some of these implementations may ensure further text and/or selections are in a format that is understood by the first bot and/or may enable the first user to provide less inputs in further communications with the first bot (e.g., the user may need to only make a single selection and/or may directly input text into the field without needing to explicitly address the text to the first bot with further inputs).
- the method further includes: determining a writing style of the first user based on sentiment, punctuation, and/or an emoji that are in the one or more messages; and providing the responsive content to the first user in the writing style of the first user.
- a computer-implemented method to automatically provide bot services in a messaging application includes receiving one or more messages between a first user and a second user, determining a first bot of a first type for the first user based on the one or more messages, determining a second bot of a second type for the first user based on the one or more messages, where the second type is different from the first type, selecting the first bot over the second bot based on content within the one or more messages, and providing a bot command to the first bot based on the content.
- selecting the first bot based on content within the one or more messages includes at least one of determining a topic from the one or more messages, performing semantic analysis on the one or more messages.
- the method may further include determining initial words related to one or more services provided by the first bot and determining related words that are related to the initial words.
- Selecting the first bot based on content within the one or more messages may further include generating a machine learning model from training set data and applying the machine learning model to determine whether the content corresponds to a desire and that the content occurs during a predetermined time period when the first user is likely to act on the desire.
- the first bot may be selected from at least one of a bot store and a list that is part of a messaging interface.
- Determining the first type of bot may be further based on at least one of a location of the first user, a request that is part of the content submitted by the first user, and user information associated with the first user.
- the method may further include requesting additional information from the bot from a third-party server and generating the bot command based on the additional information.
- the method may further include determining that the one or more messages are associated with a destination, determining a time that the first user will be at the destination, and where the bot command is related to the destination and the time.
- Determining the first bot of the first type for the first user based on the one or more messages may further include determining that the first user is associated with an active role based on the one or more messages and choosing the first user over the second user to receive a bot suggestion from the first bot.
- the method may further include receiving a question from the first user that is directed to the first bot, instructing the first bot to ask a business owner of a business that is associated with the first bot for additional information, and generating an answer that includes the additional information.
- the method may further include determining that the additional information includes new information and providing an update to a business profile for the business based on the new information.
- the method may further include providing the first user with a user interface that includes a field that sends text entered into the field or a selection to the first bot.
- the method may further include determining a writing style of the first user based on at least one of sentiment, punctuation, and an emoji that are in the one or more messages and providing a suggestion to the first user in the writing style of the first user.
- the method may further include providing a suggestion to the first user to process a payment for the first user based on the one or more messages.
- the method may further include providing a first suggestion with two or more services, receiving a selection of one of the two or more services from the first user, and providing an additional suggestion based on the selection of the one of the two or more services.

- the messages may be from a first user that is directing the messages to bots instead of other users.
- the messages may be communicated between a first user and a particular food truck bot, where the first user is looking to see if the particular food truck still has chicken available.
- the messages may be between more than two users.
- the first user sends a message to a second user or a bot by messaging a phone number (e.g., when the messaging application 103 works over SMS) or selecting the user or the bot from a contacts list (e.g., when the messaging application 103 works over rich communications services (RCS) or another chat interface).
- the messaging application 103 provides group messages from multiple entities associated with a bot from a single SMS number so that it appears to the first user that messages are coming from a single source.
- a first bot of a first type may be determined for the first user based on the messages.
- the bot may be a human agent, an automated agent, an automatic responder, etc.
- the bot may be a hybrid where communications are provided by multiple entities that may include a human agent at some points, and an automatic agent at some other points.
- the bot may be named Mike's Bikes so that both the business owner Mike and an automated bot may interact with the first user.
- it allows multiple entities to interact with the first user without the first user getting confused about managing the multiple entities individually.
- the messaging application 103 may determine the first bot of the first type based on a location of the first user, a request that is part of the content submitted by the first user, and/or upon user consent, user information associated with the first user.
- the first bot may be a reservation bot that is determined based on the first user writing “I want to try that new Thai restaurant.” because the first user indicates a desire to visit a physical location of a restaurant.
- a second bot of a second type for the first user may be determined based on the messages.
- the second bot may include a food order bot that automatically orders food for the first user.
- the second bot may be determined based on detecting words in the messages, such as “lunch” and “ordering.”
- the first bot may be selected over the second bot based on content within the one or more messages. For example, the first bot may be selected based on “meet” appearing more times than “order” in the messages.
- the first bot may be selected from a bot store that is maintained (e.g., in one or more databases) by the messaging application 103 or by the bot server 120 . Alternatively or additionally, the first bot may be included in a list that is part of a messaging interface that is visible to the first user and the second user.
- the messaging application 103 selects the first bot based on determining a topic from the messages.
- the topic may be food and is determined based on the word “lunch.”
- the messaging application 103 may additionally or alternatively select the first bot based on performing semantic analysis on the messages.
- the first bot may be selected based on “order” being followed with a negative sentiment (e.g., “no” or in this example “nah”).
- a trained sentiment classifier may be utilized to determine the sentiment of a word and/or a string of text.
- the first bot may be selected based on determining initial words related to one or more services provided by the first bot and determining related words that are related to the initial words.
- the first bot may be determined based on detecting the initial word “lunch” and the related word “meet,” which relate to the service of making restaurant reservations.
- the messaging application 103 additionally or alternatively selects the first bot based on machine learning. For example, the messaging application 103 may generate a machine learning model from training set data and apply the machine learning model to determine whether the content corresponds to a desire and that the content occurs during a predetermined time period when the first user is likely to act on the desire. For example, continuing with the example above, the messaging application 103 may determine that the desire is to eat lunch at a restaurant and that the users are likely to act on the desire because, based on user consent to use their location histories, the users are typically at restaurants and/or the users have been known to be at restaurants together at 11:30 a.m.
- the messaging application 103 determines that a given message of the messages includes one or more terms that are associated with invocation of two or more bots. For example, a given message of “reservations?” may be associated with invocation of both a restaurant reservation bot and a separate airline reservation bot. In some of those implementations, the messaging application 103 selects one of the bots over the other bots based on one or more additional terms of an additional message of the messages also being associated with invocation of the selected bot, but not being associated with invocation of the non-selected bot(s). For example, if “lunch” and/or “restaurant” are present in an additional message (e.g., a preceding message) the restaurant reservation bot may be selected in lieu of the airline reservation bot. Terms that are associated with invocations of bots and/or otherwise associated with bots may be stored in association with the bots in one or more databases.
- a bot command may be provided to the first bot based on the content.
- the messaging application 103 may instruct the first bot to offer to make a reservation for the first user and the second user at the restaurant discussed in messages exchanged between them.
- the first bot may determine various factors that are not explicitly discussed in the messages and make the offer based on the determined factors. For example, the first bot may determine the name of the restaurant based on the words “new Thai restaurant” and “El Camino” in the messages and determine that the users would prefer to go at 11:30 a.m. based on user activity associated with the users that corresponds to the users eating together at 11:30 a.m.
- the messaging application 103 determines that the messages are associated with a destination, determines a time that the first user will be at the destination, and the bot command is related to the destination and the time.
- the first bot may provide a standard introduction (e.g., “Hi, I'm first bot”) and then provides an offer.
- the first user may send a message to multiple bike shop bots asking if the shops have a specific brand and model of bike in stock.
- the first user may send a message to an air conditioning repair guy to schedule an appointment to fix the first user's air condition, schedule an appointment, and pay by credit card.
- the messaging application 103 requests additional information for the first bot from an information server and generates the bot command based on the additional information.
- the messaging application 103 may request information from a search server or a server that provides knowledge cards (e.g., rich cards).
- the messaging application may request additional information from the information server 130 that includes different restaurants that the first user might want to eat at.
- the messaging application 103 may request information about restaurants that offer Vietnamese food that are located on El Camino, restaurants that are near the location of the first user, restaurants that have high ratings, etc.
- the first bot may incorporate the restaurant names into an offer to make reservations at those restaurants for two people at times that are currently available for reservations.
- the messaging application 103 may provide a suggestion to the first user and the second user. For example, the messaging application 103 provides on behalf of the first bot, an offer to make a reservation at Tasty Thai. In some implementations, the messaging application 103 may determine that the first user is associated with an active role based on the messages and choose the first user over the second user to receive a bot suggestion from the first bot. For example, where two users are discussing a trip together the messaging application 103 may determine that one of the users is an organizer for the event and the bot suggestion may include a suggestion for the organizer to pay for a car service.
- Determining that the one of the users is an organizer may be based on various factors, such as that user initiating the conversation, that user providing more messages to the conversation, that user's messages including more terms that relate to the selected bot than do message(s) of other user(s).
- the suggestion may include an advertisement.
- the first bot may provide the first user with a coupon for 30% off at Tasty Thai.
- the messaging application 103 may determine a writing style of the first user based on sentiment, punctuation, or an emoji that are in the messages and provide a suggestion to the first user in the writing style of the first user. For example, if the first user tends to write messaging with no capitalization, the messaging application 103 may provide the suggestion with no capitalization.
- the messaging application 103 may provide a suggestion to the first user to process a payment for the first user related to the messages within the messaging application 103 .
- the messaging application 103 may select a third bot that offers to process a payment for the meal at Tasty Thai or reimburse the first user if the first user pays for the second user's food.
- the first bot may provide an automated response when the first user requests information that is available to the first bot, such as where the bike shop is located.
- the first bot may communicate with the business owner to obtain additional information if the first bot does not have access to requested information or the information is associated with a confidence score that falls below a threshold value.
- the first user may ask if the bike shop is open. Although the posted hours may state that the business is open, if the business owner has not been active on the messaging application 103 for several hours or the bike shop is known to close with no warning, the first bot may ask the business owner for confirmation that the bike shop is open. In some implementations, where the first bot asks the business owner for additional information, the first bot may provide the business owner with suggested responses. Continuing with the example about whether the bike shop is open, the first bot may provide the business owner with the option to respond with “Yes until 5 pm,” “No, but we're open tomorrow starting at 10 am,” or an option to provide a different answer.
- the suggestion may be shared with other conversations.
- the messaging application 103 may determine that people connected to the two users may want to view the suggestion. For example, if the two users frequently go out to lunch with a third user, the third user may want to know that the two users are going to eat at Tasty Thai at 11:30. In another example, the messaging application 103 may share the suggestion with people that are unrelated to the two users but that are having a similar conversation.
- the messaging application 103 may provide the first user with a user interface that includes a field that sends text entered into the field or a selection to the first bot. For example, in FIG. 3 , responsive to the ReservationBot suggesting to make a reservation for the user at Tasty Thai for 11:30, the user may accept the suggestion or modify the suggestion to select a different number of people, a different restaurant, and a different reservation time.
- the messaging application 103 may update information based on interactions between one of the users and the first bot. For example, the messaging application 103 may receive a question from the first user that is directed to the first bot about Tasty Thai's hours of operation. The messaging application 103 may instruct the first bot to ask a business owner of Tasty Thai for the additional information about Tasty Thai's hours of operation by transmitting a request, such as an email, to a third-party server 120 associated with Tasty Thai. In some implementations, the first bot may respond to the question from the first user unless the first bot determines that the answer is associated with a confidence score that falls below a predetermined threshold value—in which case it may then ask the business owner for an answer.
- the business owner's answer may then be used to update, in one or more databases, an entry for “Tasty Thai” with information from the answer (e.g., Tasty Thai's hours of operation).
- the business owner may be able to answer the question at any time.
- the first bot asks the business owner questions, without first being prompted by a user, to enable answers to be proactively available to users. For example, the first bot may ask the business owner if the business is open on Christmas, store the answer in association with the business, and then provide the answer to a user in response to a message directed to a corresponding bot that enquires about Christmas hours of the business.
- the messaging application 103 may receive the additional information and generate an answer that includes the additional information for the first user.
- the messaging application 103 may provide an update to a business profile for the business based on the new information.
- the messaging application 103 may instruct the first bot to transmit the update to a website that maintains business information.
- the first bot may also transmit an update to the website that maintains business information for information that comes from the first bot proactively asking the business owner a question.
- the messaging application 103 may provide a first suggestion that includes two or more services to be performed by the first bot.
- the messaging application 103 may provide an offer to make the reservation, provide additional information about the restaurant, and rate the restaurant.
- the messaging application 103 may receive a selection of one of the two or more services from the first user, for example, the first user asks the first bot to make the reservation.
- the messaging application 103 may provide the first user with additional suggestions corresponding to the selected service.
- the messaging application 103 provides a second suggestion to select the restaurant, pick a time, and select a number of people for the reservation.
- providing the additional suggestion includes providing graphical icons that the user can scroll through.
- the additional suggestion includes an advertisement.
- the messaging application 103 analyzes messages that are part of an initial conversation between two or more users to determine one or more entities that may be associated with an action.
- An entity can be a person, place, or object in the message.
- the suggestion application 132 identifies that the message “great weather!” includes “great,” “weather” and ‘!” based on parsing the message, and determines a first entity “great” and a second entity “weather” from the message.
- Other messages in the initial conversation are analyzed to determine contextual indicators.
- the messaging application 103 analyzes other conversations (e.g., previous conversations, conversations from a third-party application) related to one or more of the users. For example, from the message “would you like to meet at ABC coffee store?” and user profile information, the messaging application 103 determines, subject to user consent, that an entity “ABC coffee store” is near the user's work location.
- Other contextual indicators include sentiment indicators, conversation flows, tense of the message, recency of the message, the day and/or time at which the message was sent, the day and/or time associated with the entity, conversation metadata, etc.
- the messaging application 103 determines contextual indicators and, based on the contextual indicators, determines whether the entity is actionable.
- the contextual indicators may include conversation flows, tense, sentiment indicators (e.g., an emotion symbol), verbs used in the message, whether a question is asked in the message, conversation metadata, etc.
- the messaging application 103 determines the entity A in the message “I like A” is non-actionable, but determines that the entity B in the message “I am going to buy B” is actionable. If user C asks user D “meet at XYZ?,” the messaging application 103 may determine that the location “ABC” is actionable after receiving user D's positive answer in the conversation flow.
- the messaging application 103 generates a suggestion for an actionable entity based on the contextual indicators. For example, if two users want to meet at a store, the messaging application 103 could provide the users with directions to the store and a calendar entry to schedule a meeting time. Based on the contextual indicators, a map may indicate directions to a particular store close to both users, and a calendar may highlight time slots that are available to both of the users.
- the suggestion generation process may include several types of automation.
- the messaging application 103 may determine whether to generate a suggestion, and when and where in the conversation to insert the suggestion. For a question “meet at coffee house?” from user A to user B, the map to the coffee house may be suggested to the two users if user B answers “great!” to the question. For example, the map suggestion may not be provided to the two users if user B answers “I'd like to go, but . . . ”
- the messaging application 103 may also determine whether a suggestion is appropriate based on the contextual indicators. For example, if a user recently received bad news, a celebration suggestion would be inappropriate.
- the messaging application 103 may determine a list of entities that the user dislikes and, the messaging application 103 may not suggest anything from the list to the user.
- FIG. 4A includes graphic representations of example conversation interfaces showing a suggestion.
- the conversation interfaces 1000 , 1050 are displayed on Aaron's mobile screen.
- Aaron receives a message 1002 “Want to eat at Park Chow?” from Bob.
- the messaging application 103 determines that the location “Park Chow” is actionable. A suggestion therefore can be generated for Aaron and Bob to take an action on the location.
- the messaging application 103 generates a map 1004 of the location “Park Chow” for Aaron and Bob.
- Aaron and Bob can view the map 1004 or share the map 1004 using the share button 1006 .
- the map 1004 is displayed twice before and after Aaron sends a message 1008 “Sure” to respond the message 1002 .
- the determining engine 228 determines that the location “Park Chow” is actionable only if Aaron positively answers the question 1002 , for example, with the message 1008 “Sure”.
- the location suggestion (e.g., the map 1004 ) may only be displayed once after Aaron sends the message 1008 .
- Aaron and Bob may also select the “Umm, nope” option 1010 to indicate that the map is not the suggestion the users want or the map is wrong or other negative reactions.
- the entire suggestion generation process is handled by a messaging application 103 .
- FIG. 4B is a graphic representation of an example conversation interface showing a conversation generated by a conversation service.
- An ongoing conversation between users Melissa G., Alice Z., Chris B. is displayed on the conversation interface 1100 .
- the users Melissa G., Alice Z., Chris B may be members of a social network in this non-limiting example.
- the conversation session between the users is generated and managed by a first application (e.g., a messaging application 103 ) in the social network.
- the conversation interface 1100 can be displayed on Melissa's computer screen.
- the users converse about a plan that night, Melissa expresses interest in shopping and states that “Dress Factory is good.
- the messaging application 103 identifies that the important entities in this message are “Dress Factory” and “discount,” the messaging application 103 generates a suggestion based on these important entities. However, instead of generating a suggestion by the messaging application 103 as in FIG. 10 , the messaging application 103 feeds the information “Dress Factory” and “discount” to another service (e.g., a promotion service) to generate a suggestion.
- a promotion service e.g., a promotion service
- FIG. 4C a graphic representation of an example conversation interface is illustrated that shows a suggestion generated by a promotion service.
- the conversation interface 1150 is displayed on Melissa's mobile screen.
- the conversation interface 1150 includes a suggestion 1152 “Dress Factory has 20% off for dress and jewelry until May 30.”
- the promotion service generates suggestion 1152 based on the entities “Dress Factory” and “discount” identified by the messaging application 103 in FIG. 11A .
- the promotion service may perform a search for the entities on the Internet to generate the suggestion 1152 .
- the suggestion generator 132 may receive the suggestion 1152 and then provide the suggestion 1152 to all participants of the conversation in FIG. 11A , e.g., Melissa G., Alice Z., Chris B.
- FIG. 11B displays the suggestion 1152 on a mobile screen of Melissa, identical to the suggestions shown to Alice or Chris.
- FIG. 4D is a graphic representation of an example conversation interface showing one-tap replies.
- the conversation interface 1200 is displayed on Aaron's mobile screen.
- the messaging application 103 may predict a potential response from Aaron based on previous user actions of Aaron (e.g., a purchase history), and generates a one-tap reply 1204 for Aaron.
- the auto reply 1204 lists the flight number, the arrival time and a flight status. Aaron therefore saves time to type an answer to Bob.
- the messaging application 103 determines that this is a yes or no question, and generates a one-tap auto reply 1208 to include two options “YES” or “NO” for Aaron to choose.
- FIG. 4E is a graphic representation of an example conversation interface showing a conversation report.
- the conversation interface 1300 includes a search box 1302 , where the user can search for conversations based on participant name, topic, time, combinations thereof, etc.
- the user searched for conversations about a movie “star wars.”
- the messaging application 103 may generate a report.
- the report may start with a summary 1304 on when the user discussed the topic and the other participants in the conversations, e.g., that Mellissa, Alice and Jenny discussed “star wars” between 7:10-7:30 pm on Wednesday.
- the report may also include the conversation messages from each participant in a time order.
- the report may also highlight the keyword “star wars” 1306 searched by the user.
- the report may highlight certain entities (e.g., actors “AA” 1108 and “BB” 1310 ), to enable the user to retrieve more information (e.g., biography, photos) on the entities.
- Each highlighted and identified entity may be associated with a hyperlink that enables the user to perform a search for the entity on the Internet.
- FIG. 4F is a graphic representation of an example conversation interface showing a conversation summary.
- the conversation interface 1400 includes a conversation summary 1402 generated by the messaging application 103 for a user summarizing the conversations that the user participated in during a week.
- the conversation summary may include two exemplary portions 1402 and 1404 .
- the summary may include the number of conversations the user participated in during the past week, and some basic information on the conversations, e.g., time of day, date, identities of the other participants, and the like.
- the first portion 1402 may also include a detail option 1406 for each conversation that provides further details on each conversation including conversation messages from each participant, the time when each message was sent, etc.
- the second portion 1404 may include salient information on the conversations conducted in the past week including, for example, the topics discussed in the conversations (optionally, a pie chart 1408 describing the percentage of each topic in the conversations), audio/visual content shared in the conversations (optionally, a link 1410 to play the content), the photos 1412 shared in the two conversations.
- FIG. 4G includes graphic representations of example conversation interfaces showing serial presentation of suggestions.
- the conversation interface 1500 is displayed on a user's mobile screen. Responsive to receiving a message 1502 “meet up for a meal?,” the messaging application 103 generates and displays options 1504 for “lunch,” “dinner,” “brunch,” etc. The user may select one of the options 1504 first suggested to the user, which triggers a second suggestion to be generated.
- FIG. 4G displays a conversation interface 1550 generated responsive to receiving the user selection as shown in the option 1506 . Upon the user's selection for lunch in the option 1506 , the messaging application 103 generates and displays certain restaurants open for lunch. In certain implementations, the messaging application 103 may display only those restaurants that are within a certain distance range of all of the participants in the conversation.
- the restaurant information 1508 may include a restaurant name, a restaurant type, a review and a price.
- the displayed restaurant information may be selectable and actionable.
- the user may select a particular restaurant and display it to the other participants in the conversation, e.g., as a message including the restaurant name, as a message including the restaurant name and prefilled default words suitable to the conversation (e.g., “let's meet at . . . ”).
- the user may select a particular restaurant to perform a search for the restaurant on the Internet, retrieve merchant information from a website, retrieve a map of the restaurant location, and the like. The user may then choose to display the retrieved information to the other participants in the conversation, e.g., by inserting a map of the restaurant location into the conversation interface.
- a messaging application user interface receives a message between a first user and a group, where the group includes other users.
- the group is a football group and the message is a first user asking a second user that is one of the other users how close the second user is to a location of a football game that the other users are at.
- a context of the message, the first user, and the other users is determined.
- the context may include an event or a holiday.
- the context is that the message is a request for an estimated time of arrival of the user.
- a suggested response for each of the other users to share with the group based on the message and the context is determined.
- the suggested response may include an image to share with the group (e.g., taken from a second user's phone), a location to share with the group (e.g., based on the location of the second user), or a calendar event to share with the second user (e.g., based on the message mentioning attending the event).
- the suggested response may be based on using machine learning to develop a personalized model for a second user.
- the messaging application 103 may generate a machine learning model and use the machine learning model to generate the suggested response by filtering examples from a corpus of messages or conversations, train a neural network to suggest responses based on the examples, and modify the suggested responses based on personalization of the suggested responses based on information associated with the second user.
- the machine learning model may incorporate additional services in the suggested responses.
- the messaging application 103 may use the machine learning model to obtain location information about the user, photos associated with the user, purchasing information associated with the user, etc.
- the machine learning model may suggest that the second user attach photos from a vacation where the photos are retrieved from a photo server and identified as photos that were taken during the vacation and/or at the location of the vacation. If the first user provides a link to a baseball hat to the second user and asks the second user if she likes the baseball hat, the machine learning model may suggest that the second user response “I love it” based on a recent purchase of the baseball hat, a high rating of the baseball hat on a commerce website, etc. If the first user asks the second user “Where are you?” the machine learning model may suggest providing a map of the second user's location from a mapping application to the first user.
- the suggestion may be provided to the second user as a suggestion for including in a reply, that is a reply to the message “Where are you?”.
- a given user is composing and/or has sent a message of “I'm on my way”.
- a location of the given user may be suggested to the given user for inclusion in the message (if composing) and/or for providing as an additional message (if sent).
- the suggested response may be customized based on whether a chat bot is participating in messages associated with the group.
- the messaging application 103 may determine whether the chat bot is present. Responsive to the chat bot being present, the messaging application 103 generates a first set of automatic suggested responses. For example, the first set of automatic suggested responses may be based on conversational rules followed by the chat bot. The conversational rules help create a format that is easily understood by the chat bots for ease of communication. Responsive to the chat bot being absent, the messaging application 103 generates a second set of automatic suggested responses. For example, the second set of automatic suggested responses may be based on user preferences.
- the messaging application 103 may provide an option to a user to switch to a bot mode, which changes the user's avatar to a bot and automatically replies to conversations using a highest ranked suggested response. In some implementations, the messaging application 103 may determine what conversations, messages, and senders are important to a user and the suggested response is modified accordingly.
- the suggested response may be based on a personality of a second user.
- the messaging application 103 may determine a personality of the second user based on punctuation use, emoji use, categorizing words in the message based on a whitelist as including humor or sarcasm, etc.
- a notification may be generated with the suggested response for a second user of the other users that allows the second user to respond with a one-tap action.
- the suggested response includes determining a distance between the second user and the location of the football game, an estimated travel time, and the suggested response written in the style preferred by the second user.
- the messaging application 103 may determine the estimated time of arrival for the second user based on a location of the second user, a calendar event that includes a location of the calendar event, and/or information about a destination from a mapping application.
- the message may include a request for information about a recent event.
- the messaging application 103 may determine the suggested response by determining an image that corresponds to the recent event and a social network post that relates to the recent event.
- the suggested response may be based on sensor data, one or more preferences, a conversation history, or one or more recent activities performed by each of the other participants. Based on sensor data, it may be determined that the user is in transit and the one-tap action may be based on determining that the second user is in transit.
- the user interface may include multiple suggested responses if a user is stationary but if the messaging application 103 determines that the user is driving, the messaging application 103 may suggest the one-tap action response.
- the messaging application 103 determines a trending response based on other messages in a region, a market, or a country related to a location of a second user. For example, the messaging application 103 may determine trending responses during the presidential election, a response for a special occasion such as “Happy New Year!” or “Go Seahawks!” if the messaging application 103 determines that the Seahawks are trending and the second user is a fan of the Seahawks. The messaging application 103 may include the trending response as part of the suggested response.
- the messaging application 103 provides a second user of the other users with a graphical user interface that includes an option to specify a type of personality and a level of the type of personality to be used for determining the suggested response.
- the user interface may include a slider for specifying whether the suggested response should include an emoji.
- the messaging application 103 determines a conversation starter suggestion.
- the messaging application 103 may provide the conversation starter suggestion based on a threshold time passing since a last message was received in a conversation. For example, the messaging application 103 may determine that it has been 24 hours since the last message was received in a conversation. As a result, the messaging application 103 may provide the conversation start suggestion to the last person to provide a message, the most frequent contributor to the conversation, a group leader, etc.
- the messaging application 103 may determine the content of the conversation starter suggestion based on a topic associated with the group, a trending topic (trading a popular baseball player), a recent event related to the topic associated with the group (a baseball team made the playoffs), an activity associated with one of the users (e.g., a vacation, a visit to a ballgame), etc.
- FIG. 5B is a graphic representation of an example set of suggested responses.
- the messaging application 103 may provide three suggested response that include an emoji, a time period for replying, and a simple affirmation.
- text suggestions organized according to the type of suggestion include an emoji, a time period for replying, and a simple affirmation.

- the suggested response may pertain to media and not simply text.
- FIG. 5C illustrates an example where a first user sends a second user a picture of the second user's baby. The picture is not illustrated in FIG. 5C for the sake of simplicity, but may be presented to the second user above the suggestions of FIG. 5C .
- the messaging application 103 provides suggestions based on performing analysis on the picture to identify that the picture includes a baby dressed in a Santa suit and that the suggested responses (“Cute!”, “Merry Christmas!”, and “Sunny smile”) should include a reaction to the picture of the baby in the Santa suit.
- the picture may be applied as input to a neural network trained to predict objects in images, and output generated over the network that indicates a baby is present and a Santa suit is present.
- Suggestions “Cute!” and “Sunny smile” may be selected based on being suggested responses for “baby pictures” and “Merry Christmas!” selected based on being a suggested response for “Santa”.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a general LSTM model that includes the messaging application 103 receiving a token (e.g., a previous message) and a previous LSTM state.
- the messaging application 103 performs token embedding by tokenizing each message in a conversation, generates a modified LSTM model based on an original LSTM model, applies a hidden Markov model, and applies softmax to predict the next token (e.g., the suggested response) by, for example, mapping the LSTM's output to a probability distribution.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a personalized LSTM model where the messaging application 103 receives a token and a user identifier, the token is embedded, the user identifier is embedded, and concatenation is performed.
- the tokens are lower-cased.
- the concatenation may include generating a count for each token, for a number of occurrences, and a number of unique users that have used the tokens. If a token has been associated with less than a predetermined number of unique users (e.g., 1000 unique users), the token is mapped to a throwaway database. A predetermined number of tokens that are ranked as exceeding a threshold ranking are mapped to a token vocabulary database and the rest are mapped to the throwaway database.
- a predetermined number of unique users e.g. 1000 unique users
- the concatenation may also include generating counts for a number of total tokens used for each user. If a user is associated with a number of tokens that is greater than a predetermined token value (e.g., a minimum token count per user), the tokens are associated with a user vocabulary database and the rest are mapped to the throwaway database.
- a predetermined token value e.g., a minimum token count per user
- the messaging application 103 may generate a modified LSTM model based on an original LSTM model and performs concatenation. In some implementations, the messaging application 103 may consider messages independently (i.e., without context of their conversation). The messaging application 103 may discard messages authored by users that are in the throwaway database. For the rest of the messages, the messaging application 103 may sort the message by time, include the first 75% in a training set of data, and include the last 25% in a Test set. In some implementations during a one-time step, 100 known whitelisted users may be selected by randomly selecting 10 users from each decile of users (ranked by a number of tokens). The train and test data for each of the users may be extracted into separate tables to experiment with personalized models. The messaging application 103 may perform a hidden Markov model and applies soft max to predict the next token.
- the messaging application 103 receives human-rated semantic clusters, applies a model that predicts a set of the most likely clusters that the predicted reply will belong to, and for each predicted cluster a suggested reply is predicted by the scoring model using a beam search over a token trie, such as the token trie illustrated in FIG. 8 .
- the messaging application 103 uses a recall at three metric that describes given that a message is a reply in the whitelist, how often the model ranks the message within the top three. The recall at three metric may be exact if exactly the right message was predicted or cluster if the predicted message falls in the same semantic cluster as the right message.
- FIG. 9 illustrates statistics associated with a number of messages as a function of a number of messages and a type of model.
- the implementations of the specification can also relate to a processor for performing one or more steps of the methods described above.
- the processor may be a special-purpose processor selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.
- a computer program may be stored in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, including, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, ROMs, CD-ROMs, magnetic disks, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memories including USB keys with non-volatile memory, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, each coupled to a computer system bus.
- the specification can take the form of some entirely hardware implementations, some entirely software implementations or some implementations containing both hardware and software elements.
- the specification is implemented in software, which includes, but is not limited to, firmware, resident software, microcode, etc.
- a computer-usable or computer-readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.
- a data processing system suitable for storing or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus.
- the memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.
- the systems provide users with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or control whether and/or how to receive content from the server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the server.
