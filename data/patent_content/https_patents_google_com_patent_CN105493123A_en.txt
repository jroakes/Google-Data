Embodiment
Can based on mutual the obtained information of one or more user and media store if the developer of the content in media store can access, then can be useful for user and developer.Media store can be sold, stream send or otherwise provide digital content (such as application, film, song, books etc.).User can via the electronic equipment of such as smart phone, computing machine, flat computer etc. and media store mutual.Such as, media store can be activated as the application on smart phone or use web browser to visit.User in access medium shop with such as install application or buy can be play by the electronic equipment of user film time, the account comprising user certificate (such as user name, password, credit card information, electronic payment data, purchase history etc.) can be utilized.Therefore media store can store the behavior of associated subscriber when utilizing media store and/or relative application and the information of action.Developer can wish can based on collected by media store or analysis data determined and provide sales promotion or other guide to being energized the user making purchase.Usually, such information is unavailable to protect the anonymous rights and interests of privacy of user and/or maintenance customer for developer.But, media store can the purchase history of calling party, comprises purchase volume, those dates bought, those themes bought, the frequency of purchase, the time of purchase, user have checked content for buying but select the contact do not bought between its example, such behavior or history and similar information.Can to the data execution analysis collected by media store to be associated for the standard selecting one or more user to receive specified by sales promotion with by developer by user grouping and/or by specific user.
Such as, user may perform the search of the romance to the Victorian era.User may check first result manifesting " Frankenstein " (Frankenstein), and determines not buy after novel webpage at substantial time on media store website.Then, user may check second result, " Sense and Sensibility " (SenseAndSensibility), and determines to buy it.Media store can have the information of browsing custom of associated subscriber on the every one page for " Frankenstein " and " Sense and Sensibility ".Information can indicating user read one or more selected extracts, user comment and/or comment of experts and/or check or select one or more external linkage.Information also can indicating user spend in these books every on media store website Website page on check or the time span of content of consumption.It also can select not buy " Frankenstein " by indicating user before " Sense and Sensibility " is bought in selection.Therefore, the analysis data that can obtain via media store can comprise such as buy history, browsing histories, device type, the position of user, time reference, click-through rate, wherein selected user to receive the example of sales promotion number and for the corresponding success ratio (such as, user utilizes or otherwise activate the number of the example of sales promotion) of sales promotion and user profiles.
As another example, some users can be the frequent buyers of the content from media store, and described content is such as applied and/or content available in application-specific, such as " in application " content.In application, the example of content is included in the function or enhancing bought in application, such as play, be supplied to except those application all users except the expansion of existing application or renewal, the promotion project and the like that intersects, the such as application of described intersection promotion project can be used for buying based on the advertisement in Another application or other notices.Other users can be buyer more infrequently or the previous content do not bought from shop of possibility of content.Send out the person of opening and may wish that sales promotion is supplied to user by frequency or quantity based on making purchase in shop, comprise user whether previously from shop and/or make purchase from developer from meaningful.
The developer that its products & services can be sold to user may not know that user is about the purchase of media store or browsing histories.That is, developer may not have about whether specific user is the information of the user frequently making purchase.Therefore, developer possibly cannot optimize its marketing investment or be activated at a part of user media store being made purchase.No matter whether user is new user, in media store, whether highly participates in purchase activity or inactive in media store, and excitation can be supplied to whole user by developer.This can reduce the budget that can be used for the user encouraging may more take like a shot directional sales promotion or excitation.
According to the embodiment of disclosed theme, application programming interface (API) can be provided as the assembly of media store or as the assembly of the such as particular device of mobile phone, flat computer or laptop computer.Application developer or other guide supplier can make to API call determine to check and/or whether the specific user in access medium shop or the application of doing same thing have the qualification of sales promotion or excitation.The various standards that API can buy history and/or browsing histories based on such as user return the response of true or false.Such as, made in the past and buy if seem more likely user and may tend to future make purchase, then user can be regarded as the qualification with sales promotion or excitation.Such as, application developer may wish to select specific user to receive sales promotion, and wherein user makes the purchase of $ 50 or more in 90 days and it is positioned at Russia in the past.API can determine to meet these standards and it has downloaded the user pond of the application of developer, and returns the true/false instruction that whether can be used for sales promotion about each user in pond.True response can meet those standards by indicating user.
Sales promotion or excitation can refer to such as discount, sales promotion code, Gift Card, present, the reward voucher (electronics or otherwise) that can cash, to the upgrading of application or content or like this.Can be such as free or the additional chapters and sections of books are provided with certain discount to the upgrading of application, allow the role in game to receive free upgrade, and this can make the game currency of certain form of user effort usually, or like this.Application-specific or the content of sales promotion qualification request are made in sales promotion from it without the need to being bound to.Such as, user may play GameA.The developer of GameA may be interested in determining whether user has sales promotion qualification.The user being confirmed as having sales promotion qualification can receive the sales promotion for the Another application given a discount of identical developer.
In some instances, API can return false answer in response to inquiry, wherein user does not have sales promotion qualification, or user has been selected at random as disqualification.With the frequency of specifying, API can return does not have the response of the qualification of sales promotion and/or excitation to the user of inquiry, even if user otherwise may qualify according to standard provided above (such as buying history and/or browsing histories).Randomization can be performed to protect the privacy of user to the response of API.Such as, developer may wish to select to live in Canada, in the past made content purchase in one week and in the previous year in bought the user for sales promotion of at least one application upgrade feature.Ten user User1-10 may meet the standard of being specified by developer.Whole ten users commonly may return "True" for sales promotion qualification request.Random function can be applied to the result of sales promotion qualification request, no matter make the determination of sales promotion/excitation qualification, will return vacation/unqualified response for the subset of inquired about user.In this example, developer can receive the instruction that User1 does not have sales promotion/excitation qualification.This can protect the privacy of User1, because developer cannot guarantee that in fact User1 exceeds specified standard or whether User1 has been limited by the random function having covered sales promotion qualification API.Similarly, in the time of identical or different weight percentage, for the user by providing "false" response for it, API substitutes and can return "True" response.Therefore, API provides the fact of "True" or "false" response really can not meet for determining whether user has the standard of sales promotion qualification to requestor's indicating user in any particular instance.This random function or multiple random function can be configured to almost any number to change coupling respectively or not match-on criterion but the size of the subset of user got rid of or included, with prevent about specific user information for developer or like this known to.
Another kind of for guaranteeing that the technology of protection privacy can carry out choice criteria for the signal mixed between plus or minus, make single true/false response might not indicate the existence of the element keeping privately owned.This may contribute to such as guaranteeing the user of certain percentage to remove from obtaining defined true/false signal the existence not indicating concealed element.Such as, if the existence activating purchase account to be used as in the standard returning true/false response, then return at random " incorrect " true/false response make response itself under any particular case not indicating user whether have and effectively buy account, this can be useful for API.
Also can by API only to binary search (such as, Yes/No, true/false or qualified/disqualification) provide response to support the right of privacy.Further, in the configuration of API and media store binding operation, which reduce the demand of developer to the personal information of request user in advance, because API hides the identity of user to developer.
In addition, user data and correlation analysis are abstracted into simple queries, all binary search described above, can be useful for using the developer of API.Such as, substitute each developer to require to carry out Collection and analysis user data for a large number of users, and only depend on by the data collected by its own application, each developer can access foregoing API simply and obtain the instruction whether specific user has sales promotion qualification.This can make complexity be starkly lower than each developer independently to make qualified/alternative of disqualification determining and arrange, and requires the few development& testing time more obvious than it thus.
In some configurations, third-party application can be inquired about API and never make purchase to determine that user once made buying still in the past.Whether third-party application (or its developer) may have the effective modes of payments (such as Gift Card, preferential code etc.) to understanding user or stop buyer interest.Stop buyer and can refer to the user not yet making purchase within the time interval of specifying via media store or application-specific associated with it.Third party application developer can such as use to the response of Membership Queries to provide achievement in sales promotion and/or game, to pay or like this to unlock.Whether such as specific user has the effective payment account in media store also may to expect to prevent developer from determining.Such as, media store can realize privacy policy, and this prevents other entities from obtaining payment account or its appointed information lacked of associated subscriber; Similarly, some authorities can require that this and similar information is not provided to third party by the entity of such as media store.In this case, the use of foregoing random factor can provide the secret protection of suitable degree.Such as, if API returns true/false result randomly in the time of 20%, then, when developer inquires about API and determine that user has or do not have a sales promotion qualification, with any rational determinacy, developer can not know that in fact this user has effective payment account.As another example, can partly choice criteria be revealed by the true/false response returned by API to prevent such information.As particular example, true response can be configured to mean do not have account to be associated with user or account is not yet used in the time of a certain length, and spurious response can for have active account user or for not obtaining not the having the user of the random number percent of account of qualification from returning true result and returned.Therefore, the existence of active account no matter is not all indicated from the true response of API or spurious response.In addition, even if when developer can specify certain standard, such as should contribute to determining whether user has sales promotion qualification " having effective payment account ", based on the result of API Calls, developer also only cannot distinguish that user has effective payment account really.
Sales promotion as herein described can be provided by the developer or third party making request via API, or they can be provided by media store itself.Such as, application can ask specific user whether to have the determination of sales promotion qualification via API.When so determined, media store can continue sales promotion that is predetermined or that dynamically generate to be supplied to specific user.Such configuration can provide higher convenience degree for developer, and described developer is then without the need to being also provided for sales promotion in the mechanism of passing selected user.In addition, because developer will not know whether user has sales promotion qualification, therefore further privacy rights and interests can be provided for user.
In one embodiment, provide its example in figure 3, at 310 places, can from the inquiry of requestor's reception for the sales promotion qualification of one or more user.Such as, requestor can be foregoing developer or represent its third party acted.Inquiry can specify one or more standard, and described standard can be used to the available pool that filter request person is just attempting the user it being determined to sales promotion qualification.At 320 places, can obtain for the disabled user data of requestor.User data can based on the purchase history of user, browsing histories and at least one in the history and/or aforesaid expression of content.Can obtain and utilize other forms of user data as the basis determining sales promotion qualification, the age group, geographic position etc. of such as user.History specific to content can refer to school or the type of content, the romance of such as the Victorian era.The expression buying history can be such as the analysis result merging purchase history data.
At 330 places, based on for the inquiry of one or more user and user data, the determination whether about one or more user with sales promotion qualification can be made.Such as, in honour of Canada's National Day, inquiry can be specified developer to be willing to mean in Canada the possibility estimating to have 65% and be made sales promotion in application that the user bought in application provides for GameXYZ.Live in Canada's (such as, providing or position that GPS determines based on user) based on those, install those users being just provided the application of sales promotion of developer, system can the available pool of filter user.Past based on user buys history and ludic activity history, can calculate the estimation to buying possibility.Such as, if user is once via media store or the purchase making any type in application, then user can be assigned with quintile.If user has made in application any one in the application of developer and having bought, then user can be assigned with three points.If user has made in application GameXYZ and having bought, then user can be assigned with four points.If user once played GameXYZ in three days in the past, then user can be assigned with three points.Similarly, if user once played GameXYZ between three and 30 days, then user can be assigned with two points.Further, if user once played GameXYZ, but only played during before one to three month, then user can receive one point.Based on this example, the maximum total score for user will be 15 points.In this example, the possibility of purchase can be confirmed as the number percent accounting for 15 points of each (those users such as having Canadian geographic position and installed GameXYZ) distributing to the user in filtering ponds.According to embodiment disclosed herein, the additive method determining to buy possibility, other data and other tolerance can be adopted.
At 340 places, can be provided the response of inquiry or be back to requestor.Continue previous example, requestor (developer in such as this example) can receive the standard how many users provide in queries based on requestor and the instruction disabled user data of developer to sales promotion qualification.In some configurations, requestor can specify and the user for having sales promotion qualification is sent sales promotion.In some configurations, requestor can be required the details inputting or otherwise provide sales promotion, to continue sales promotion to be dispatched into those users being determined to have sales promotion qualification.As an alternative, requestor or can provide sales promotion before request is submitted to simultaneously.Use in such as Email, application, in content, the various technology of hyperlink and/or text message, sales promotion itself can be provided to selected user (such as in response to return the inquiry of the user with sales promotion qualification those).
In one embodiment, provide its example in the diagram, at 410 places, can start on the equipment be associated with user and apply.Such as, user can sign in equipment with the certificate of user or otherwise have the account be associated with the user linking to equipment.If there is any purchase at 420 places, then application can record the history being made purchase by user, and it can comprise for the done time reference bought each time.As a part for operating system (such as serving) and/or when user asks, automatically application can be started.Local application can store the purchase history of user's equipment and/or the instruction of other behaviors and it periodically can upload instruction to be processed by remote server.In some instances, application can be to its inquiry sales promotion qualification.Such as, GameXYZ can store user data about it uses (such as the activity time, use duration, in ludic activity, purchase activity etc.) and be responsible for generating the request to sales promotion qualification.GameXYZ can from the developer identical with ApplicationABC and two methods can store user data and the user data of storage each other can be obtained.
At 430 places, such as at the time point of specifying or dynamically based on trigger event (such as, user makes application from media store and buys, utilizes application during time of designated length, completes particular task etc. with application), the request to sales promotion qualification can be generated.Such as, the purchase history of local application can indicating user in the past in made and having bought several times, but not buy in three months in the past.Local application can be configured to comprise primary standard to determine whether that sales promotion qualification request is made in relation with media shop.Such as, if user in the previous year in once showed the wish making purchase, but stopped to make purchase at least two middle of the month, then can generate sales promotion qualification request at 430 places.Application can use aforesaid sales promotion qualification API and generate and ask to determine whether user has sales promotion qualification at 440 places.One or more standard and the weight for it can be supplied to media store and/or application by developer.As previously mentioned, application can calculate one or more tolerance (such as buying possibility) and tolerance can based on the one or more standards provided by developer before the request for sales promotion qualification of transmission.Such as, if indicate the possibility bought to exceed predetermined threshold value (such as by the developer applied as the value set by " standard ") by applying the tolerance that calculates, then described above, at 430 places, apply the request that can generate for sales promotion qualification.
At 450 places, the request for sales promotion qualification can be transferred into media store.At 460 places, the response from API can have sales promotion qualification by indicating user.Such as, API can be responded based on determining that this specific user once makes other for other application in three months in the past and to buy and those class types bought are similar to those that provide in subject application.At 470 places, sales promotion can be received on equipment and be presented to user by application, Email, text message etc.Such as, when user again logging in game time, application can for game in currency buy for user provide 30% discount.
The example of system disclosed herein shown in Figure 5.System comprises the database for storing purchase information for one or more user 510 or other user data, and this database is such as associated with media store 530.At 540 places, user can preserve the account in media/application shop 530.The account of user can with utilized by user other serve (such as Email, social networks etc.) and be associated.Therefore, user data can obtain from each provenance and can be able to use for media/application shop 540.Processor can be communicatively coupled to database and be configured to receive as above for the inquiry of the sales promotion qualification of one or more user at 550 places.Processor can be associated with media store 530.As previously mentioned, the user data of one or more user can be obtained.In some configurations, the one or more tolerance of buying for user can be pre-determined by system and/or be dynamically updated along with obtaining the more user data about one or more user.Such as, if user starts to make in application for the anti-game of tower to buy recently, then user as above buys possibility score value can increase.Similarly, if user unloads a series of Role Playing Game (" RPG "), then user can be represented as reduction for the interest of RPG.In some instances, no matter whether receive inquiry, can computation measure.Such as, system it is expected to developer or requestor 520 and may want only to make to have certain user buying possibility and have sales promotion qualification.In some instances, no matter whether pre-determine tolerance, it can the standard that provides of reason requestor/developer 520 and calculated or recalculate.At 560 places, based on for the described inquiry of described one or more user and described user data, processor can determine whether described one or more user has sales promotion qualification.In Figure 5, step 560 is illustrated as being performed by media/application shop 530; But this process can be performed by the processor being connected to database, and described database is away from media/application shop 530.At 570 places, requestor 520 can be provided to the response of inquiry.As mentioned above, response can be the binary responses of such as true/false or Yes/No and this response can be in harmonious proportion with random function.At 580 places, requestor/developer 520 can provide instruction to be considered as titular user sales promotion to be dispatched into based on inquiry response.At 590 places, sales promotion can be dispatched into one or more user 510.
