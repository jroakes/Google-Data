Definitions
- the present disclosure generally relates to techniques for detecting poor machine translations of key terms.
- On-line advertising has become an effective means to target potential consumers.
- One form of on-line advertising is advertising in search engines using key terms.
- a key term may be a phrase including one or more words or strings of characters that a search engine user may include in a query for a particular topic.
- An advertiser can direct Internet traffic to one or more web pages (called landing pages) using a search engine advertising campaign which utilizes key terms. The advertiser will provide a list of key terms that the advertiser believes a potential customer would enter when looking for a web page that contains subject matter similar to the landing page.
- a purveyor of hiking boots could provide a list of key terms to a search engine that includes “hiking boots,” “hiking shoes,” “trail shoes,” and “outdoor gear” such that when a search engine user executes a search using any of the key terms as the search term, an advertisement containing a hyperlink to the landing page of the advertiser is presented to the user.
- a computing technique includes a user interface module configured to receive a key term including one or more words in a source language and a language determination module configured to determine a target language to which the key term is to be translated.
- the computing technique further includes a translated key term determination module configured to obtain one or more potential translated keys term by obtaining a translation of the key term from the source language to the target language.
- the computing technique further includes a geographic location diagnostic module that performs a geographic location diagnostic for each one of the one or more potential translated key terms, the geographic location diagnostic module being configured to: (i) determine whether the key describes a first geographic location, (ii) determine whether the one potential translated key term describes a second geographic location, and (iii) when the key term describes the first geographic location and the one potential translated key term describes the second geographic location, determine whether the second geographic location geospatially corresponds to the first geographic location.
- the computing technique further includes a narrow-to-broad diagnostic module that performs a narrow-to-broad diagnostic for each one of the one or more potential translated key terms, the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module being configured to: (i) determine a first traffic value corresponding to a first number of search queries containing the key term that are provided to a search engine, (ii) determine a second traffic value corresponding to a second number of total search queries provided to the search engine in the source language, (iii) determine a third traffic value corresponding to a third number of search queries containing the one potential translated key term that are provided to a search engine, (iv) determine a fourth traffic value corresponding to a fourth number of total search queries which were provided to the search engine in the target language, (v) determine a first ratio of the first traffic value to the second traffic value, (vi) determine a second ratio of the third traffic value to the fourth traffic value, and (vii) discard the potential translated key term when the second ratio is greater than the first ratio by more than a predetermined magnitude
- the computing technique also includes a local term diagnostic module configured to perform a local term diagnostic for the key term by: (i) determining a first degree of significance of the key term in a first geographic area where the source language is a primary language, (ii) determining a second degree of significance for the key term in one or more other geographic areas where the source language is a primary language, and (iii) comparing the first degree of significance with the second degree of significance.
- the computing technique further includes a reverse translation diagnostic module that performs a reverse translation diagnostic, the reverse translation diagnostic module being configured to: (i) obtain one or more reverse translations of the one or more potential translated key terms from the target language to the source language, (ii) compare each one of the one or more reverse translations with the key term, and (iii) when at least one of the reverse translations match the key term, discard the potential translated key terms having reverse translations that do not match the key term.
- the key term determination module is further configured to selectively adopt, for each one of the one or more potential translated key terms, the one potential translated key term as a translated key term based on the geographic location diagnostic, the narrow-to-broad diagnostic, the local term diagnostic, and the reverse translation diagnostic.
- a computer-implemented technique for verifying machine translations includes receiving, at a computing device having one or more processors, a key term including one or more words in a source language, determining, at the computing device, a target language to which the key term is to be translated, and obtaining, at the computing device, one or more potential translated keys terms by obtaining a machine translation of the key term from the source language to the target language.
- the technique also includes determining, at the computing device, whether to adopt any of the one or more potential translated key terms as a translated key term by performing, at a geographic location diagnostic module, a geographic location diagnostic for each one of the one or more potential translated key terms by: (i) determining whether the key term describes a first geographic location, (ii) determining whether the one potential translated key term describes a second geographic location, and (iii) when the key term describes the first geographic location and the one potential translated key term describes the second geographic location, determining whether the second geographic location geospatially corresponds to the first geographic location.
- the determining whether to adopt the any of the one or more potential translated key terms as translated key terms is further achieved by performing, at a narrow-to-broad diagnostic module, a narrow-to-broad diagnostic for each one of the one or more potential translated key terms by determining whether the key term is more narrowly defined than the one potential translated key term, performing, at a local term diagnostic module, a local term diagnostic for the key term by: (i) determining a first degree of significance of the key term in a first geographic area where the source language is a primary language, (ii) determining a second degree of significance for the key term in one or more other geographic areas where the source language is a primary language, and (iii) comparing the first degree of significance with the second degree of significance.
- the determining whether to adopt the any of the one or more potential translated key terms as translated key terms is further achieved by, for each one of the one or more potential translated key terms, selectively adopting the one potential translated key term as an acceptable translation based on the geographic location diagnostic, the narrow-to-broad diagnostic, and the local term diagnostic.
- determining whether the key term is more narrowly defined than the one potential translated key term further includes determining a first traffic value corresponding to a first number of search queries which contain the key term in the source language that were provided on a search engine, determining a second traffic value corresponding to a second number of total search queries provided to the search engine in the source language, determining a third traffic value corresponding to a third number of search queries which contain the one potential translated key term that were provided to search engine, determining a fourth traffic value corresponding to a fourth number of total search queries which were provided to the search engine in the target language, and determining whether to discard the one potential key term based on the first traffic value, the second traffic value, the third traffic value, and the fourth traffic value.
- the computer-implemented method further includes determining a first ratio of the first traffic value to the second traffic value and a second ratio of the third traffic value to the fourth traffic value.
- the computer-implemented method further includes discarding the potential translated key term when the second ratio is greater than the first ratio by more than a predetermined magnitude.
- determining whether to adopt any of the one or more potential translated key terms as the translated key term further includes performing, at a reverse translation diagnostic module, a reverse translation diagnostic by: obtaining one or more reverse translations of the one or more potential translated key terms from the target language to the source language, and comparing each one of the one or more reverse translations with the key term.
- the computer-implemented method includes discarding any of the potential translated key terms having reverse translations that do not match the key term.
- the computer-implemented method when none of the reverse translations match the key term, further includes discarding none of the potential translated key terms.
- the one potential translated key term is selectively adopted as the acceptable translation when the second geographic location geospatially corresponds to the first geographic location.
- the second geographic location geospatially corresponds to the first geographic location when the second geographic location and the first geographic location overlap.
- the local term diagnostic includes: determining the first degree of significance by determining a first ratio of a first number of search queries containing the key term and originating from the first geographic area to a second number of search queries containing any terms and originating from the first geographic area, and determining the second degree of significance by determining a second ratio of a third number of search queries containing the key term and originating from the one or more other geographic areas to a fourth number of search queries containing any terms and originating from the one or more other geographic areas.

- the key term determination module 304 for each possible key term identified in the text portion of the advertising creative and the website corresponding to the hyperlink, can determine whether to include the possible key term in the plurality of key terms to be analyzed. It is appreciated that the key term determination module 304 may make this determination in any suitable manner. For instance, the key term determination module 304 may query a query log database 316 to determine whether a possible key term is to be included in the plurality of key terms. It is noted that the query log database 316 may be a component of the regional expansion module 200 or may be located at a different location or server. The key term determination module 304 may access the query log database 316 via a network, such as an intranet or the Internet.
- a network such as an intranet or the Internet.
- the query log database 316 is a database that stores a representative sampling of search queries provided to one or more search engines, as well as web pages that have been accessed as a result of the search query. It is noted that the query log database 316 may only include commercial searches, and may exclude private or non-commercial search queries and results, thereby protecting the privacy of a search engine user. Further, the query log database 316 can also store search queries anonymously, to further protect the privacy of a search engine user.
- the key term determination module 304 can provide each possible key term to the query log database 316 to determine which of the possible key terms can be considered legitimate search queries. If the possible key term has been used as a search query in more than a nominal amount of searches, then the possible key term may be included in the plurality of key terms to be analyzed. If the possible key term has not been used as a search query or has only been used a nominal amount of times as a search query, then the possible key term can be disregarded. It is appreciated that the foregoing technique for determining whether potential key terms should be included in the plurality of key terms to be analyzed is provided for example only. Other techniques can be implemented and are within the scope of this disclosure.
- the key term determination module 304 can be further configured to determine one or more pertinent languages of the geographic area.
- the key term determination module 304 can obtain the one or more pertinent languages of a geographic area from a languages database 314 .
- the languages database 314 can store pertinent languages of a plurality of different geographic areas.
- the pertinent languages of a geographic area can be based upon any suitable metric.
- the pertinent languages of a geographic area can be based upon the amount of total search engine queries that originate from the geographic area in a particular language. For example, if 100,000 search engine queries originate from the particular geographic area, and 50,000 search queries are in English, 25,000 are in French, 20,000 are in Dutch, 4,000 are in Flemish, and the rest of the search engine queries are in various other languages, the pertinent languages of the geographic area may be English, French, Dutch, and Flemish, but not any of the various other languages.
- a language is considered a pertinent language of a particular geographic area if the amount of searches originating from the particular geographic area in the language in relation to the total amount of searches originating from the particular geographic area in any language is greater than a predetermined threshold, e.g., 5%. If the total amount of searches is greater than the predetermined threshold, then the language is considered a pertinent language of a geographic area.
- a predetermined threshold e.g., 5%.
- the key term determination module 304 can translate each key term from the source language to each of the pertinent languages of a geographic area, thereby obtaining a plurality of translated key terms in each of the pertinent languages of the geographic area.

- the translation engine 310 can return a plurality of translated key terms in a pertinent language to the key term determination module 304 .
- the plurality of translated key terms can be analyzed to determine whether each of the plurality of translated key terms are appropriate translations.
- the translation engine 310 may return a translation that is too broad. For example, the key term “laptop bag” translated from English to Russian, may result in a translated key term “cy MK a,” meaning “bag.”
- the key term determination module 304 may be configured to discard overly broad translated key terms. It is appreciated that the translated key terms may be analyzed for other deficiencies in the machine translation provided by the translation engine 310 , such as an inaccurate geographic translation or an overly narrow translation.
- the key term determination module 304 can obtain translations of key terms in any other suitable manner.
- the key term determination module 304 may be configured to perform machine translation of key terms using techniques now known or later developed.
- the key term determination module 304 obtains a plurality of translated key terms for each pertinent language for each of the one or more geographic areas. Either prior to translating a key term or after a translated key term is received, techniques such as removing the stop words, e.g., “a,” “an,” and, “the”, from either the key term or the translated key term may be performed by the key term determination module 304 .
- the key term determination module 304 can provide the plurality of translated key terms to the scoring module 306 .
- the key term determination module 304 may further provide the geographic area to which a plurality of translated key terms corresponds.
- the scoring module 306 receives a plurality of translated key terms and the geographic area to which the translated key terms correspond. For instance, if the key terms “baby stroller” and “infant stroller” translate to “kinderwagen” and “kleinkindz kinderwagen,” respectively, in German, and the geographic area being analyzed is Germany, the scoring module 306 can receive the plurality of translated key terms, e.g., “kinderwagen” and “kleinkind kinderwagen,” and a geographic area indicator, e.g., “Germany.” For each one of the plurality of translated key terms, the scoring module 306 determines advertising statistics for the translated key terms in the geographic area. In some embodiments, the scoring module 306 may retrieve advertising statistics for a particular translated key term from the statistics database 312 .
- the statistics database 312 stores the advertising statistics for a plurality of key terms in a plurality of different languages for a plurality of different geographic areas.
- the advertising statistics of a translated key term may be indicative of a traffic value of the translated key term in the geographic area, a cost value of the translated key term in the geographic area, a click-through rate of the translated key term, and a competition value for the translated key term in the geographic area.

- the traffic value may be indicative of an average amount of monthly search queries containing the translated key term that were provided to a search engine from the geographic area.
- the cost value of a translated key term can correspond to a price associated with utilizing the translated key term in a search engine advertising campaign for the geographic area.
- the cost value may indicate a cost-per-click for the translated key term in the geographic area, e.g., an amount of money the advertiser must pay each time the advertising creative is displayed and the hyperlink contained therein is clicked by a user.
- the click-through rate of a translated key term corresponds to a number of instances where an advertisement is presented to one or more search engine users in response to a search query originating from the one geographic area and containing the translated key term in relation to a number of instances where the one or more search engine users click on a hyperlink associated with the advertisement.
- the click-through rate of a translated key term is defined by:
- CTR TKT Clicks TKT Displays TKT where CTR TKT is the click-through rate of a translated key term, Displays TKT is the amount of times an advertising creative is displayed to one or more search engine users in response to a search engine query containing the translated key term, and Clicks TKT is the amount of times the one or more users clicked on the hyperlink. For example, if an advertising creative is presented to search engine users 10 times in response to a search engine user providing a search engine query containing a particular translated key term, and the search engine user clicked on the hyperlink of the advertising campaign 5 times, the click-through rate may be 0.50.
- the competition value of a translated key term can correspond to a number of entities that have registered the translated key term in other advertising campaigns directed to the geographic area.
- the competition value can be normalized, such that the amount of competition can be represented on a scale of, for example only, 0-1 or 0-100. For example, if a maximum amount of competition for a particular key term is 100 advertisers, and currently 90 advertisers have registered the particular key term in other advertising campaigns, the competition value may be 90/100 or 0.9.
- the scoring module 306 can determine a term-specific score for each translated key term of corresponding to the pertinent language.
- the scoring module can determine the term-specific score of a translated key term based on the advertising statistics of the translated key term.
- a term-specific score of a translated key term may be indicative of a degree of desirability of using the translated key term in a search engine advertising campaign in the geographic area.
- the term-specific score is based on the advertising statistics of the translated key term in the geographic area. For example, the term-specific score of a translated key term may be determined using the following formula:
- Score TKT Traffic TKT * CTR TKT Cost TKT where Score TKT is the term-specific score of the translated key term in the geographic area, where Traffic TKT is the traffic value of the translated key term in the geographic area, CTR TKT is the click-through rate of the translated key term in the geographic area, and Cost TKT is the cost value of the translated key term in the geographic area
- the term-specific score can be determined using other formulas or metric.
- the term-specific score of a translated key term may be determined using the following formula:
- Score TKT Traffic TKT Competition TKT * Traffic TKT Cost TKT
- Score TKT is the term-specific score of the translated key term in the geographic area
- Traffic TKT is the traffic value of the translated key term in the geographic area
- Competition TKT is the competition value of the translated key term in the geographic area
- Cost TKT is the cost value of the translated key term in the geographic area.
- a key term may translate to multiple translated key terms.
- the scoring module 306 can score the multiple translated key terms in the pertinent language individually.
- the scoring module 306 can determine term-specific scores of the plurality of translated key terms for each pertinent language of each of the geographic areas. Furthermore, for each of the geographic areas, the scoring module 306 can generate a language-specific score for each pertinent language of the geographic area, and an area-specific score for each of the geographic areas. For example, if the geographic area is Germany, and the pertinent languages are English, German, Russian, and Spanish, the scoring module 306 may generate language-specific scores for each pertinent language, e.g., the language-specific score of German with respect to Germany can be obtained by averaging the term-specific scores of all the translated key terms in German. Further, the scoring module 306 can generate an area-specific score for Germany by, for example, averaging the language-specific scores of each pertinent language of Germany or by averaging the term-specific scores of all the translated key terms corresponding to Germany.
- the suggestion module 308 can determine a market suggestion indicating one or more of the geographic areas in the market selection. For each of the one or more geographic areas, the suggestion module 308 can determine whether to include the geographic area in the market suggestion based on the term-specific scores corresponding to the geographic area, the language-specific scores corresponding to the geographic area, and/or the area-specific score of the geographic area. In some embodiments, the suggestion module 308 sorts or ranks the geographic areas in accordance with the area-specific scores of the geographic areas. The suggestion module 308 can suggest geographic areas to the user based on the rankings of the geographic areas. For example, the suggestion module 308 may suggest the top five or ten geographic areas. In some embodiments, the suggestion module 308 can suggest any geographic area having a score above a threshold.
- the suggestion module 308 can further rank the pertinent languages of a geographic area in accordance with the language-specific scores of the pertinent languages. For each geographic area, the suggestion module 308 may select one or more pertinent languages to suggest for advertising based on the rankings of the pertinent languages with respect to their geographic area. For example, if the pertinent languages of a geographic area are English, Spanish, and Arabic, and the language-specific scores of English and Spanish are relatively high, but the language-specific score of Arabic is relatively low, the suggestion module 308 may suggest to the user to advertise in English and Spanish, but not in Arabic. It is appreciated that the suggestion module 308 may select the highest ranked pertinent languages, e.g., the top four pertinent languages, or may select any pertinent language with a language-specific score above a predetermined threshold.
- the plurality of translated key terms corresponding thereto may be ranked in accordance with their respective term-specific scores.
- the suggestion module 308 may select one or more translated key terms corresponding to the pertinent languages to suggest for inclusion in an advertising campaign based on the rankings of the translated key terms with respect to their pertinent language. For example, if the translated key terms in English include a first translated key term, a second translated key term, and a third translated key term, and the term-specific scores of the first translated key term and the second translated key term are relatively high, but the term-specific score of the third translated key term is relatively low, the suggestion module 308 may suggest to the user to use the first and second translated key terms in an advertising campaign but not the third translated key term.

- the translated key term determination module 704 may obtain a translation of the key term from the source language to the target language by providing the key term to a translation engine 310 , which returns the one or more potential translated key terms in the target language.
- the translated key term determination module 704 can adopt one or more of the potential translated key terms as the one or more translated key terms by performing diagnostics on the potential translated key terms.
- the diagnostics can include a geographic location diagnostic that can be performed by the geographic location diagnostic module 706 , a narrow-to-broad diagnostic that can be performed by the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 , a local term diagnostic that can be performed by the local term diagnostic module 710 , and a reverse translation diagnostic that can be performed by the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 . Each of the diagnostics is described more fully below.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can analyze a key term and a potential translated key term to determine whether they both describe geographic locations, and if so, whether the key term and the translated key term have a geospatial correspondence. As can be appreciated, machine translations are sometimes inaccurate or inappropriate. One such inaccuracy that may occur is that one geographic location may be translated to a different geographic location. For example only, a key term of “London Trains” may be translated to “Amsterdem Treinin” in Dutch, which literally means “Amsterdam Trains” in English. The foregoing translation is inaccurate and should not be adopted as a translated key term. The geographic location diagnostic module 706 can be implemented to discard such translations.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 receives a key term and one or more potential translated key terms.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can parse a received key term to determine whether the key term includes one or more words describing a first geographic location.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can provide one or more words of the key term to a geographic locations engine 714 .
- the geographic locations engine 714 may be any service that receives one or more words or strings of numbers and determines a geographic location corresponding thereto. It is appreciated that the geographic locations engine 714 may define an application programming interface (API) that allows the geographic location diagnostic module 706 to provide the one or more words to the geographic locations engine 714 .
- the geographic locations engine 714 can be configured to return an error code or any other type of indicator when the words do not describe a geographic location, or to return a first geographic location corresponding to the one or more words when the one or more words describe a geographic location.
- API application programming interface
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can also parse a potential translated key term into one or more translated words.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can provide the one or more translated words to the geographic locations engine 714 to determine whether one or more of the translated words describe a geographic location. If the one or more words describe a geographic location. If the one or more translated words describe a geographic location, the geographic locations engine 714 can return a second geographic location corresponding thereto.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can compare the first geographic location with the second geographic location to determine whether the two geographic locations correspond to one another. It is appreciated that bounding boxes of a predetermined area can be defined around the first and second geographic locations to determine whether the two geographic areas overlap, and therefore correspond. If the two geographic locations overlap, the two geographic locations are said to geospatially correspond. If there is no overlap between the two geographic locations, e.g., London and Amsterdam, then the two geographic locations do not correspond, and the potential translated key term can be discarded.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary technique 800 for performing a geographic location diagnostic.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can receive the key term and one or more potential translated key terms.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can parse the key term into one or more words, as shown at 804 .

It is appreciated that the geographic locations engine 714 can return a geographic location corresponding to one or more of the one or more words provided, if the one or more words describe a geographic location.
- the geographic locations engine 714 may return an error code or another indicator that the geographic locations engine 714 was unable to determine a geographic location corresponding to the one or more provided words.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 determines whether the one or more words of the key term describe a first geographic location based on the response of the geographic locations engine 714 . If the key term does not describe a first geographic location, then the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can stop executing. If, however, the key term does describe a first geographic location, then the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can further analyze the potential translated key terms.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 parses one of the one or more potential translated key terms into one or more translated words.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can provide the one or more translated words to the geographic locations engine 714 , as shown at 812 .
- the geographic locations engine 714 can return a geographic location corresponding to the potential translated key term or an error code or indicator.
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 determines whether the potential translated key term describes a second geographic location. If the potential translated key term does not describe a second geographic location, then the potential translated key term may be discarded, as shown at step 820 .
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can determine whether the first geographic location geospatially corresponds to the second geographic location, as shown at 816 . As described above, two geographic locations can be determined to geospatially correspond, for example, if the two geographic locations overlap one another. If the first and second geographic locations geospatially correspond, then the potential translated key term is not discarded, as shown at 818 . If the first and second geographic locations do not geospatially correspond, then the potential translated key term is discarded, as shown at 820 .
- the geographic location diagnostic module 706 can determine whether there are any remaining potential translated key terms to analyze. If there are remaining potential translated key terms, the geographic location diagnostic module 706 obtains the next potential translated key term, as shown at 824 , and returns to 810 . If there are no remaining potential translated key terms left to be analyzed, the geographic location diagnostic module 706 may stop executing and may return a list of potential translated key terms that were not discarded.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 determines whether the key term is more narrowly defined than any of the one or more potential translated key terms.
- the term “laptop bag” may be machine translated to “cymka” in Russian, which literally translates to “bag” in English. This example translation may be considered a narrow-to-broad translation in that a “narrow” term (laptop bag) was translated to a “broad” term (bag).
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 may utilize advertising statistics, such as corresponding traffic values for a key term and a potential translated key term, to determine whether the key term is more narrowly defined than the translated key term.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can obtain: (i) a traffic value for the key term, (ii) a traffic value for the potential translated key term, (iii) a traffic value for all search queries in the source language, and (iv) a traffic value for all search queries in the target language.
- the traffic values can be constrained to include search queries originating from one or more specific geographic areas or can be unconstrained, such that the traffic values include search queries originating from anywhere in the world.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can determine a first ratio of the traffic value of the key term to the traffic value of all search queries in the source language of the key term.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can also determine a second ratio of the traffic value of the potential translated key term to the traffic value of all search queries in the target language of the potential translated key term.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can compare the first ratio with the second ratio. If the second ratio is greater than the first ratio by more than a predetermined magnitude, e.g., 4 times greater, than the translation of the key term to the potential translated key term is considered to be a narrow-to-broad translation, and the potential translated key term can be discarded.
- the potential translated key term is not considered to be a narrow-to-broad translation, and the potential translated key term may be further analyzed by the other diagnostic modules of the key term determination module 304 .
- FIG. 9 illustrates an exemplary technique 900 for performing a narrow-to-broad translation diagnostic.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 receives the key term and one or more potential translated key terms.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can then obtain a first traffic value for the key term, as shown at 904 .
- the first traffic value as well as other traffic values discussed herein, may be obtained from the statistics database 312 .
- the first traffic value can be indicative of a first number of search queries that are provided to a search engine that contain the key term.
- the first traffic value, as well as the traffic values discussed below can be constrained to one or more particular geographic areas or can encompass search queries originating from anywhere in the world. It is appreciated however, that if all of the traffic values, e.g., the first, second, third, and fourth traffic values, correspond to the same geographic area, the performance of the narrow-to-broad diagnostic may be improved.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can obtain a second traffic value indicating a total number of searches provided to the search engine in the source language. The narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can then determine a first ratio of the first traffic value to the second traffic value, as shown at step 908 .
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can determine a second ratio for the potential translated key term.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can obtain a third traffic value indicating the number of searches provided to the search engine which contain the potential translated key term that is currently being analyzed.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can obtain a fourth traffic value indicating the total number of searches provided to the search engine in the target language.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can determine a second ratio of the third traffic value to the fourth traffic value. It is appreciated that the second ratio is specific to the potential translated key term that is currently being analyzed.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can then compare the second ratio to the first ratio to determine if the second ratio is greater than the first ratio by more than a predetermined magnitude. If the second ratio is not greater than the first ratio by more than the predetermined magnitude, then the potential translated key term is not discarded, as shown at 918 . If the second ratio is greater than the first ratio by more than the predetermined magnitude, then the potential translated key term can be discarded as being an overly broad translation, as shown at 920 . At 922 , the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can then determine whether there are any additional potential translated key terms to analyze.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 obtains the next potential translated key term, as shown at 924 , and returns to 910 . If there are no remaining potential translated key terms, the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can stop executing.
- a local term diagnostic module 710 can be configured to perform a local term diagnostic on the key term.
- a key term is considered to be a local term if the key term has a special significance in a geographic area. For example, the term “stock car racing” may have more significance in the United States than throughout the rest of the world, as stock car racing is a popular American pastime but not popular throughout the rest of the world.
- the local term diagnostic module 710 utilizes advertising statistics for the key term in the source geographic area, which can be received via the user interface module 302 , and advertising statistics of the key term in other geographic areas where the source language of the key term is considered a primary language. A language may be classified as a primary language of a geographic area based on various criteria.
- a language is the official language of a geographic area
- the language may be the primary language.
- the primary language of a geographic area can be determined based on the amount of search queries originating from the geographic area in a language in relation to search queries originating from the geographic areas in other languages. In the example of “stock car racing,” India, England, and Canada may be considered geographic areas where English is a primary language.
- the local term diagnostic module 710 can be configured to determine a first degree of significance of the key term with respect to a source geographic area and a second degree of significance of the key term with respect to one or more other geographic areas where the source language of the key term may be considered a primary language.
- the first degree of significance can be determined by calculating a first ratio of the traffic value of the key term in the source geographic area to a traffic value for all search queries in the source language that originate from the source geographic area.
- the second degree of significance can be determined by calculating a second ratio of the traffic value of the key term in one or more other geographic areas where the source language is the primary language to a traffic value for all search queries in the source language that originate from the one or more other geographic areas.
- the local term diagnostic module 710 can compare the first degree of significance with the second degree of significance to determine whether the key term has a local significance in the source geographic area. For example, if the first degree of significance is greater than the second degree of significance by more than a predetermined magnitude, e.g., 5 times greater, then the key term is determined to be a locally significant term.
- a predetermined magnitude e.g. 5 times greater
- FIG. 10 illustrates an example technique 1000 for performing a local term diagnostic.
- the local term diagnostic module 710 receives the key term, the current market information of the key term, and the language of the key term. As described above, the key term, the current market information and the language of the key term may be provided by a user to the regional expansion module 200 , via the user interface module 302 .
- the local term diagnostic module 710 obtains a traffic value for the key term in a first geographic area. For example, the local term diagnostic module 710 can obtain a first traffic value for the key term in the geographic area in which the advertiser is currently advertising. The local term diagnostic module 710 can also obtain a second traffic value for all search queries originating from the geographic area, as shown at 1006 .
- the local term diagnostic module 710 can determine a degree of significance with respect to the first geographic area, for example, by calculating a first ratio of the first traffic value to the second traffic value, as shown at 1008 .
- the first ratio is indicative of a number of search queries that are directed to the key term in the geographic area in comparison to all search queries that originate from the geographic area.
- the local term diagnostic module 710 can also determine other geographic areas where the language of the key term is a primary language.
- the local term diagnostic module 710 can determine the other geographic areas where the language of the key term is a primary language from the languages database 314 , as shown at 1010 .
- the local term diagnostic module 710 can then obtain a third traffic value for the key term in one or more of the other geographic areas, as shown at 1012 , and a fourth traffic value for all search queries originating from the other geographic areas, as shown at 1014 .
- the local term diagnostic module 710 can determine a second degree of significance for the key term in the other geographic areas. For example, the local term diagnostic module 710 can determine a second ratio of the third traffic value to the fourth traffic value, as shown at 1016 . It is noted that the first ratio and the second ratio should be determined in the same manner, so the comparisons thereof provide insightful data.
- the local term diagnostic module 710 compares the first ratio to the second ratio, as shown at 1018 . In comparing the first ratio with the second ratio, the local term diagnostic module 710 determines whether the first ratio is greater than the second ratio by more than a predetermined magnitude, e.g., 5. If the first ratio is not greater than the second ratio by more than the predetermined magnitude, then the key term is determined to not have a local significance and is not considered a local term, as shown at 1018 . If the first ratio is greater than the second ratio by more than the predetermined magnitude, then the key term is determined to have a local significance and can be considered a local term, as shown at 1022 . If a key term is determined to have a local significance, the potential translated key terms corresponding thereto may be discarded or may be identified as being translations of a key term having local significance.
- a predetermined magnitude e.g. 5
- the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can perform a reverse translation diagnostic.
- the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can obtain, for each potential translated key term, a reverse translation of the potential translated key term from the target language to the source language.
- the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can provide the potential translated key term to the translation engine 310 , which can return a machine translation of the potential translated key term from the target language to the source language.
- Each of the reverse translations is compared with the key term to determine if each respective reverse translation matches the key term. If a reverse translation matches the key term, the potential translated key term corresponding to the reverse translation is not discarded. If a reverse translation does not match the key term, the potential translated key term corresponding to the reverse translation is discarded.
- the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can be configured to override the discarding of the potential translated key term when all of the potential translated key terms are discarded because none of the reverse translations matched the key term. In these situations, all of the potential translated key terms are kept.
- FIG. 11 illustrates an example of a technique 1100 for performing a reverse translation diagnostic.
- the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 receives the key term and one or more potential translated key terms, as shown at 1102 . For each one of the one or more potential translated key terms, the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can obtain a reverse translation of the potential translated key term from the target language to the source language, as shown at 1104 . In some embodiments, the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 provides a potential translated key term to the translation engine 310 and requests that the potential translated key term be translated from the target language to the source language. For each one of the potential translated key terms, the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 receives a reverse translation corresponding to the potential translated key term, and determines whether the reverse translation matches the key term, as shown at 1106 .
- the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 does not discard the corresponding potential translated key term, as shown at 1108 . If the reverse translation does not match the key term, then the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 discards the corresponding potential translated key term, as shown at 1110 . At 1112 , the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can determine whether there are any further potential translated key terms left to analyze. If there are more potential translated key terms left to analyze, the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 obtains the next potential translated key term, as shown at 1114 . If there are no remaining potential translated key terms left to analyze, the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 may stop executing.
- the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 determines that all of the potential translated key terms are to be discarded, i.e., none of the reverse translations matched the key term, the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can keep all of the potential translated key terms, rather than discarding all of the potential translated key terms.
- the translated key term determination module 704 can selectively adopt a potential translated key term as an acceptable translation based on the geographic location diagnostic, the narrow-to-broad diagnostic, the local term diagnostic, and/or the reverse translation diagnostic. For example, the translated key term determination module 704 may provide the one or more potential translated key terms to the geographic location diagnostic module 706 . The geographic location diagnostic module 706 can then perform the geographic location diagnostic, and in doing so, may discard one or more of the potential translated key terms. The non-discarded potential translated key terms can be returned to the translated key term determination module 704 .
- the translated key term determination module 704 can provide the potential translated key terms that were not discarded by the geographic location diagnostic module 706 to the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 .
- the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can perform a reverse translation diagnostic on the received potential translated key terms, and may discard one or more of the received potential translated key terms.
- the remaining potential translated key terms e.g., the potential translated key terms not discarded by either the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 or the geographic location diagnostic module 706 , can be returned to the translated key term determination module 704 .
- the translated key term determination module 704 can then provide the key term to the local term diagnostic module 710 , which may perform a local term diagnostic on the key term. If the key term is not a local term, the remaining potential translated key terms can be provided to the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 .
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can perform the narrow-to-broad diagnostic on the remaining potential translated key terms, and may discard some of the remaining potential translated key terms when determined to be narrow-to-broad translations.
- the remaining potential translated key terms can be adopted as translated key terms. It is appreciated that the foregoing sequence is not intended to be limiting and the diagnostics can be performed in any other suitable manner. For example, the diagnostics can be performed concurrently, such that after the diagnostics are preformed, any remaining potential translated key terms may be selectively adopted as translated key terms.
- the key term determination module 304 can be analyzed to determine if the key term is a trade name.
- the key term can be used to provide a query to a trade name database (not shown) that stores any known trade names such as known trademarks, service marks, and/or business names. If the key term is determined to be a trade name, then the key term determination module 304 can obtain a transliteration of the key term in the target language rather than a translation of the key term.
- the translated key term determination module 704 is described as discarding potential translated key terms based on individual diagnostics. It should be appreciated that in some embodiments, the translated key term determination module 704 can be configured to determine whether to adopt a potential translated key term as a translated key term based on the collection of diagnostics as well. In these embodiments, the geographic location diagnostic module 706 , the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 , the local term diagnostic module 710 , and the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can each be configured to generate translation scores for each potential translated key term. The translated key term determination module 704 can determine whether to adopt or discard a potential translated key term based on the translation scores provided from the diagnostic modules 706 , 708 , 710 , and 712 .
- the translated key term determination module 704 can aggregate or average the translation scores corresponding to a potential translated key term, and determine whether to adopt or discard the potential translated key term based on whether the aggregated or averaged translation score of the potential translated key term exceeds a predetermined threshold.
- each diagnostic module 706 , 708 , 710 , and 712 can be configured to assign a translation score of a potential translated key term based on the diagnostic performed. For instance, when the geographic location diagnostic module 706 determines that a potential translated key term geospatially corresponds to the key term, the geographic location diagnostic module 706 may assign a relatively high translation score to the potential translated key term. When the geographic location diagnostic module 706 determines that the potential translated key term does not geospatially correspond to the key term, the geographic location diagnostic module 706 may assign a relatively low translation to the potential translated key term. When the geographic location diagnostic module 706 determines that the potential translated key term and/or the key term do not describe a geographic area, the geographic location diagnostic module 706 may assign a relatively neutral score the potential translated key term.
- the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 can assign a translation score to a potential translated key term. For instance, when the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 determines that a potential translated key term is much broader than the key term, the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 may assign a relatively low translation score can be assigned to the potential translated key term. When, however, the potential translated key term is not an overly broad translation, the narrow-to-broad diagnostic module 708 may assign a relatively high score to the potential translated key term.
- the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can assign a translation score to a potential translated key term. For instance, when the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 determines that a reverse translation of a potential translated key term matches the key term, the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can assign a relatively high translation score to the potential translated key term. If, however, the reverse translation does not match the key term, the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 can assign a relatively low translation score to the potential translated key term.
- the local term diagnostic module 710 can assign a translation score to all of the potential translated key terms based on whether the key term is a local term. For instance, when the local term diagnostic module 710 determines that the key term is a local term, then the local term diagnostic module 710 can assign a relatively low translation score to all of the potential translated key terms. If the local term diagnostic module 710 determines that the key term is not a local term, the local term diagnostic module 710 can assign can assign a relatively high translation score to all of the potential translated key terms.
- the translated key term determination module 704 can receive the translation scores of each potential translated key term and determine whether to discard or adopt the potential translated key term based on the received translation scores. Furthermore, the translated key term determination module 704 can assign weights to each of the translation scores from each diagnostic module 706 , 708 , 710 , and 712 . For instance, greater weight may be given to translation scores received from the reverse translation diagnostic module 712 , and lesser weight may be given to translation scores received from the local term diagnostic module 710 .
