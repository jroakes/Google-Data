BACKGROUND
-
Users of mobile computing devices, such as, for example, wearable computing devices such as smart glasses, smart watches and the like, handheld computing devices such as smartphones, tablet computing devices and the like, may like to use their mobile computing devices to learn more about objects, entities and the like in the environment in which the user, and the mobile computing device is operating. Mobile computing devices may include various sensors, communication capabilities, access to external resources and the like that collect data that may be indicative of a user's interest in objects, entities and the like in the physical environment. In some situations, the user may use one or more of these mobile computing devices to access additional information related to the objects/entities of interest by, for example, conducting individual searches related to the various objects/entities. While this approach may eventually yield the information the user seeks, this may be cumbersome and/or time consuming and/or inconvenient. A system and method that provides information to the user without relying on user-initiated, individual searches related to the objects/entities may provide enhanced functionality and utility to the user.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
-
Users may use a number of different types of computing devices to access information related to objects and/or entities in the physical environment. Such computing devices may include, for example, for example, handheld computing devices (smartphones and the like), wearable computing devices such as hand and/or wrist worn computing devices (smart watches, smart bracelets, smart rings and the like), head mounted computing devices (smart glasses, goggles, headsets and the like), ear worn computing devices, neck worn lanyard computing devices, other mobile computing devices (tablet computing devices, laptop computing devices and the like). In some examples, the user may use one or more of these types of computing devices to, for example, conduct a search for additional information related to the objects and/or entities in the physical environment. In some situations, the user may wish to access additional information related to multiple different objects and/or entities observed in the physical environment, substantially simultaneously and/or in real time. The information may provide a comparison of one or more common characteristics of the objects and/or entities. The information provided for each of the objects and/or entities may allow the user to analyze the information and make an informed decision selection from amongst the multiple the objects and/or entities. Conducting individual searches for the comparison information related to the common characteristics of each of the multiple objects and/or entities, collecting and/or tabulating the additional information, and referring back to the individually collected information may be cumbersome and time consuming for the user, particularly in a situation in which the user is using a mobile computing device to actively collect the additional information and make an informed decision in real time. A system and method that provides for the identification of the objects and/or entities, and that provides additional, relevant information to the user in connection with the objects and/or entities, may enhance the functionality of these types of devices.
-
Systems and methods, in accordance with implementations described herein, may use data collected by one or more sensors of a computing device to identify objects and/or entities in the physical environment. The one or more sensors may include, for example, image sensors such as cameras, audio sensors such as microphones, location sensors, position and/or orientation sensors, and other such sensors. Systems and methods, in accordance with implementations described herein, may access information related to the identified objects and/or entities. In some examples, the information is available from data stored on the computing device. In some examples, the information is available in an external database that is accessible to the computing device. In some examples, the information provides a comparison of the objects and/or entities, using the one or more common characteristics as a basis for the comparison, so that the objects and/or entities may be compared on a consistent basis.
-
In some examples, the one or more common characteristics may be based on a standard of measurement that may provide for differentiation amongst the objects/entities. In some examples, the common characteristic may be based on a quantifiable standard of measurement that is based on, for example, the composition of the object. In some examples, this may include, for example, nutritional components of the object. In some examples, this may include, for example, cost of the object. In some examples, this may include, for example, weight of the object. In some examples, this may include, for example, dimensions of the object. In some examples, this may include numerous other such quantifiable standards of measurement having to do with the composition of the object. In some examples, the common characteristic may be based on a standard of measurement that is determined based on data obtained in relation to the object. In some examples, this may include, for example, rating data. In some examples, this may include, for example, popularity data. In some examples, this may include, for example, origin/production data. In some examples, such standards of measurement may include other data that is descriptive of the objects, and that may serve as a basis for comparison of the objects, or a discriminator amongst the objects.
-
Systems and methods, in accordance with implementations described herein, may present the information related to multiple objects and/or entities in the physical environment substantially simultaneously, to provide for comparison amongst the multiple objects and/or entities. The presentation to the user of the information related to the multiple objects and/or entities at substantially the same time may allow the user to make an informed decision related to the multiple objects and/or entities substantially in real time, based on a comparison of common characteristics, without relying on individual manual/user implemented searches for relevant information related to the identified objects and/or entities. In some examples, the information is accessed and provided by the system in response to a user request. In some examples, the system may access and provide the information in an anticipatory manner, based on a set user profile, user preferences and/or history, and other such factors.

For example, the objects may be processed by a recognition engine and/or a search engine (for example, provided in the additional resources 210 described above with respect to FIG. 2 ), for processing and identification of the products 310, 320, 330, 340.
-
In some examples, the identification of the products 310, 320, 330, 340 captured within the field of view of the outward facing image sensor 116 of the computing device 100A may be conducted in response to detection of an identification condition that triggers identification of the products 310, 320, 330, 340. In some examples, the identification condition may include detection of a gaze directed at the products 310, 320, 330, 340 that has a duration that is greater than or equal to a preset threshold duration/preset amount of time. In some examples, the detection of the gaze may be detection of an eye gaze detected, for example, by the gaze detection device 120 of the computing device 100A. In some examples, detection of the gaze may be detection of fixation on the arrangement 300 of the group of products 310, 320, 330, 340 based on consistency in the grouping of products 310, 320, 330, 340 captured within the field of view of the outward facing image sensor 116 for greater than or equal to the preset threshold duration/preset amount of time. In some examples, the identification condition may be triggered in response to a user input. The user input may include, for example, a touch input detected at a touch input portion of the computing device 100A, a gesture input detected based on images captured by the outward facing image sensor 116, an audible input detected by the audio input device 107 (and transcribed into an executable command input by, for example a transcription engine included in the additional resources 210 as described above with respect to FIG. 2 ), an input received via another device that is paired with, or in communication with the computing device 100A, and other such user inputs.

The view illustrated in FIG. 3C includes virtual objects, superimposed at corresponding positions on the user's view of the physical products 310, 320, 330, 340 in the physical environment 1000. The virtual objects provide for the output of information related to the identified products 310, 320, 330, 340. In particular, the virtual objects may provide for the output of information that allows for comparison of common characteristics associated with the multiple physical products 310, 320, 330, 340. In the example shown in FIG. 3C, the common characteristic of the physical products 310, 320, 330, 340 that is provided for comparison is rating information. The rating information may provide a measurement standard for comparison of the products 310, 320, 330, 340 by the user, based on data obtained, for example, through searches conducted for ratings of the physical products 310, 320, 330, 340.
-
In the example shown in FIG. 3C, a virtual object 311 provides rating information related to the first product 310, a virtual object 321 provides rating information related to the second product 320, a virtual object 331 provides rating information related to the third product 330, and a virtual object 341 provides rating information related to the fourth product 340. The product rating information output via the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 may provide for a comparison of at least one common characteristic associated with the products 310, 320, 330, 340 (in this example, consumer rating information for each of the products 310, 320, 330, 340). In some examples, the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 providing product related information may be triggered for output (i.e., display by the display device 104 of the computing device 100A, output by the audio output device 106 of the computing device 100A, and the like) in response to a detected output condition including a specific user input or user request (for example, a specific user request for consumer product rating information), a gaze directed at the products 310, 320 330, 340 having a duration of greater than or equal to a set threshold duration, and the like. In some examples, the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 providing product related information may be triggered for output (in this example, triggered for display by the display device 104 of the computing device 100A) based on a set hierarchy for display of product related information. In some examples, the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 providing product related information may be triggered for display based on set user preferences. In some examples, the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 providing product related information may be triggered for display based on historical usage associated with a particular user. The additional information displayed via the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 may be available locally, on the computing device 100A. In some examples, the additional information may be obtained based on a search conducted by, for example, a search engine available to the computing device 100A via the additional resources 210 described above with respect to FIG. 2 .
-
In some examples, the computing device 100A may output the product information to the user in the form of audio signals (for example, via the audio output device(s) 106 of the computing device 100A), in addition to or instead of the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 displayed to the user.
-
In some examples, the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 may be output in an anticipatory manner, without a specific input or request from the user. In some examples, images captured by the outward facing camera 116 of the computing device 100A including the arrangement 300 of products 310, 320, 330, 340 on shelves, may be processed (for example, by the recognition engine) to determine that the user is in a retail establishment. This determination may be made based on image recognition alone or together with location data associated with the current location of the computing device 100A, not necessarily relying on the detection and tracking of user gaze. In some examples, the computing device 100A may output a prompt to the user, prior to displaying the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341, to confirm that the user wants product related information, would like to do a product comparison, and the like, prior to outputting product related information. The example prompt 355 shown in FIG. 3B shown in FIG. 3B is output by the computing device 100A in the form of a virtual object displayed to the user by the display device 104, for purposes of discussion and illustration. In some examples, the prompt may be, for example, an audible signal output by the audio output device 106 of the computing device 100A. In this example, the computing device 100A may output the information related to the products 310, 320, 330, 340 (for example, in the form of the example virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 as shown) in response to a user input in one of the numerous forms described above (i.e., a touch input, an audible input, a gesture input and the like input at the computing device 100A and/or an external device in communication with the computing device 100A).
-
In FIG. 3E, the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 have been modified to output additional information related to the product ratings provided in FIG. 3C. This additional information may allow the user to further discern amongst the products 310, 320, 330, 340, and/or may cause the user to further explore consumer product reviews. In some examples, this additional information may be provided in response to a user request for additional information related to the product ratings, such as, for example, an audible user input, a touch input, a gesture input and the like. In some examples, the additional information related to the product ratings may be provided in response to detection of a sustained gaze or dwell time on the rating information shown in FIG. 3C that is greater than or equal to a set threshold time or duration. In some examples, a user input requesting additional information may be provided in response to a prompt 350 displayed to the user, as shown in FIG. 3D. In some examples, the additional information related to the product ratings may be provided in response to a detected user input, in the form of, for example, a touch input, a gesture input, an audible input (detected by the audio input device 107 and transcribed by, for example a transcription engine as described above with respect to the additional resources 210 available to the computing device 100A), and other such user inputs.
-
The related product information provided to the user via the virtual objects 311, 321, 331, 341 in this manner provides a compilation of rating information for the specific products 310, 320, 330, 340 within the current field of view of the user. In this example, this product information is provided to the user without the need for separate, user initiated searches for each of the individual products 310, 320, 330, 340. Thus, the product information provided to the user in this manner may facilitate user selection of one or more of the products 310, 320, 330, 340, allowing the user to make an informed decision quickly and easily.

The view illustrated in FIG. 3F includes virtual objects 312, 322, 332, 342, superimposed at corresponding positions on the user's view of the physical products 310, 320, 330, 340 in the physical environment 1000. The virtual objects 312, 322, 332, 342 provide for the output of information related to the identified products 310, 320, 330, 340. In the example shown in FIG. 3F, the virtual objects 312, 322, 332, 342 provide nutritional information that is of specific interest to this particular user. The nutritional information output via the virtual objects 312, 322, 332, 342 may provide for a comparison of a common characteristic associated with the products 310, 320, 330, 340 (in this example, nutritional information for each of the products 310, 320, 330, 340). In this example, the user may be interested in controlling, or reducing, or eliminating specific elements from their diet. In some examples, the additional information (i.e., the nutritional information, in this example) may be obtained based on a search conducted by, for example, a search engine available to the computing device 100A via the additional resources 210 described above with respect to FIG. 2 and provided to the computing device 100A. Thus, in the example shown in FIG. 3F, the common characteristic of the physical products 310, 320, 330, 340 that is provided for comparison is the nutritional information. The nutritional information may provide a quantitative measurement standard based on the composition of the products, for comparison of the products 310, 320, 330, 340 by the user.
-
As described above, in some examples, the information provided via the virtual objects 312, 322, 332, 342 may be provided in response to a specific user input or a specific user request. The specific user input or request may be, for example, a touch input, a gesture input, an audible input and the like that is detected and processed by the computing device 100A for output of the virtual objects 312, 322, 332, 342 including the requested product information. In some examples, the information provided via the virtual objects 312, 322, 332, 342 may be provided based on known user preferences, known user history and the like. In some examples, the information provided via the virtual objects 312, 322, 332, 342 may be provided by the system proactively, in an anticipatory manner, without the need for specific user prompting or requests.
-
In some examples, the system may highlight one or more of the products determined to be most suitable for the user based on, for example, set user preferences, stored user data such as, for example, data associated with the user's previous purchase history, purchase history associated with the user's established family group, and the like. In the example shown in FIG. 3F, the product 310 is highlighted. The information displayed via the virtual objects 312, 322, 332, 342 may be available locally, on the computing device 100A and/or may be accessible to the computing device 100A from an external resource. This product related information may be provided to the user in a proactive, anticipatory manner. The product related information is provided to the user without the need for separate, user initiated searches for each of the individual products 310, 320, 330, 340 and/or manual comparison of the products within the retail establishment, thus facilitating user selection of one or more of the products 310, 320, 330, 340.
-
As noted above, in some examples, one or more products may be highlighted or suggested based on, for example, stored user data and/or user preferences. In some examples, the stored user data may include, for example, previous purchase history. In the example shown in FIG. 3H, the product 310 may be highlighted based on previous purchases of the product 310 by the user. In some examples, the product 310 may be highlighted based on previous purchases of the product 310 by a group of users connected to the user. In some examples, the group of users may be, for example, a family group with which the user is associated. In some examples, the group of users may be, for example, another type of group with which the user is associated, such as, for example, via social media and the like. In some examples, in addition to highlighting the product 310, the system may output a prompt (not shown) indicating that the product 310 is most frequently purchased by a particular user in the previously established user group, by a number of users connected to the user via one or more social media outlets, and the like. Thus, in some examples, the highlighting of the product 310 as shown may indicate to the user that the product 310 is the one (of the products 310, 320, 330, 340 being compared) most frequently purchased by the user and/or one or more groups associated with the user.

The view illustrated in FIG. 3G includes virtual objects 313, 323, 333, 343, superimposed at corresponding positions on the user's view of the physical products 310, 320, 330, 340 in the physical environment 1000. The virtual objects 313, 323, 333, 343 provide for the output of information related to the identified products 310, 320, 330, 340. In the example shown in FIG. 3G, the virtual objects 313, 323, 333, 343 provide information related to the production practices associated with the products 310, 320, 330, 340 that is of specific interest to this particular user. The production practices information output via the virtual objects 313, 323, 333, 343 may provide for a comparison of a common characteristic associated with the products 310, 320, 330, 340 (in this example, production practices information for each of the products 310, 320, 330, 340). In some examples, this type of information may be gathered by a search engine that accesses external resources to obtain the information specific to the products 310, 320, 330, 340 identified. In some examples, this type of information is obtained in an anticipatory manner, based on user preferences, known user history and the like. In some examples, this information is obtained in response to a user input such as, for example, a touch input, a gesture input, an audible command issued by the user and transcribed into an executable command input, and the like.
-
In this example, the production practices associated with each of the products 310, 320, 330, 340 may be of great importance to the user in selecting one or more of the products 310, 320, 330, 340 for purchase. In this example, separate searches for this type of information related to these individual products would otherwise be time consuming and cumbersome to execute in real time, particularly while in the retail establishment with the intention of using this information to make an informed decision regarding product selection and purchase. The system and method, in accordance with implementations described herein, provides for this type of information to be searched, compiled and summarized for the identified products 310, 320, 330, 340, and presented to the user, in real time.
-
In FIG. 3H, a prompt 360 is output, or displayed. The prompt 360 provides the user with access to further information related to the products 310, 320, 330, 340 that can be analyzed by the user in making an informed purchase decision.

FIG. 6 illustrates an example of a computer device 600 and a mobile computer device 650, which may be used with the techniques described here. The computing device 600 includes a processor 602, memory 604, a storage device 606, a high-speed interface 608 connecting to memory 604 and high-speed expansion ports 610, and a low-speed interface 612 connecting to low-speed bus 614 and storage device 606. Each of the components 602, 604, 606, 608, 610, and 612, are interconnected using various busses, and may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate. The processor 602 can process instructions for execution within the computing device 600, including instructions stored in the memory 604 or on the storage device 606 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such as display 616 coupled to high-speed interface 608. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices 600 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system).
-
The memory 604 stores information within the computing device 600. In one implementation, the memory 604 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, the memory 604 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. The memory 604 may also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk.
-
The storage device 606 is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device 600. In one implementation, the storage device 606 may be or contain a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. A computer program product can be tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product may also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 604, the storage device 606, or memory on processor 602.
-
The high-speed controller 608 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 600, while the low-speed controller 612 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of functions is example only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 608 is coupled to memory 604, display 616 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 610, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 612 is coupled to storage device 606 and low-speed expansion port 614. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter.

The computing device 600 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a standard server 620, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of a rack server system 624. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as a laptop computer 622. Alternatively, components from computing device 600 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such as device 650. Each of such devices may contain one or more of computing device 600, 650, and an entire system may be made up of multiple computing devices 600, 650 communicating with each other.
-
Computing device 650 includes a processor 652, memory 664, an input/output device such as a display 654, a communication interface 666, and a transceiver 668, among other components. The device 650 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of the components 650, 652, 664, 654, 666, and 668, are interconnected using various buses, and several of the components may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate.
-
The processor 652 can execute instructions within the computing device 650, including instructions stored in the memory 664. The processor may be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of the device 650, such as control of user interfaces, applications run by device 650, and wireless communication by device 650.
-
Processor 652 may communicate with a user through control interface 658 and display interface 656 coupled to a display 654. The display 654 may be, for example, a TFT LCD (Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid Crystal Display), and LED (Light Emitting Diode) or an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display, or other appropriate display technology. The display interface 656 may include appropriate circuitry for driving the display 654 to present graphical and other information to a user. The control interface 658 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to the processor 652. In addition, an external interface 662 may be provided in communication with processor 652, so as to enable near area communication of device 650 with other devices. External interface 662 may provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces may also be used.
-
The memory 664 stores information within the computing device 650. The memory 664 can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units. Expansion memory 674 may also be provided and connected to device 650 through expansion interface 672, which may include, for example, a SIMM (Single In-Line Memory Module) card interface. Such expansion memory 674 may provide extra storage space for device 650, or may also store applications or other information for device 650. Specifically, expansion memory 674 may include instructions to conduct or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example, expansion memory 674 may be provided as a security module for device 650, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use of device 650. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner.
-
The memory may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 664, expansion memory 674, or memory on processor 652, that may be received, for example, over transceiver 668 or external interface 662.
-
Device 650 may communicate wirelessly through communication interface 666, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary. Communication interface 666 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 668. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver module 670 may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data to device 650, which may be used as appropriate by applications running on device 650.
-
Device 650 may also communicate audibly using audio codec 660, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information. Audio codec 660 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset of device 650. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating on device 650.
-
The computing device 650 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a cellular telephone 680. It may also be implemented as part of a smartphone 682, personal digital assistant, or other similar mobile device.

To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (a LED (light-emitting diode), or OLED (organic LED), or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor/screen) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
-
The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
-
The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
-
In some implementations, the computing devices depicted in the figure can include sensors that interface with an AR headset/HMD device 690 to generate an augmented environment for viewing inserted content within the physical space. For example, one or more sensors included on a computing device 650 or other computing device depicted in the figure, can provide input to the AR headset 690 or in general, provide input to an AR space. The sensors can include, but are not limited to, a touchscreen, accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors, biometric sensors, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and ambient light sensors. The computing device 650 can use the sensors to determine an absolute position and/or a detected rotation of the computing device in the AR space that can then be used as input to the AR space. For example, the computing device 650 may be incorporated into the AR space as a virtual object, such as a controller, a laser pointer, a keyboard, a weapon, etc. Positioning of the computing device/virtual object by the user when incorporated into the AR space can allow the user to position the computing device so as to view the virtual object in certain manners in the AR space. For example, if the virtual object represents a laser pointer, the user can manipulate the computing device as if it were an actual laser pointer. The user can move the computing device left and right, up and down, in a circle, etc., and use the device in a similar fashion to using a laser pointer. In some implementations, the user can aim at a target location using a virtual laser pointer.
-
In some implementations, one or more input devices included on, or connect to, the computing device 650 can be used as input to the AR space. The input devices can include, but are not limited to, a touchscreen, a keyboard, one or more buttons, a trackpad, a touchpad, a pointing device, a mouse, a trackball, a joystick, a camera, a microphone, earphones or buds with input functionality, a gaming controller, or other connectable input device. A user interacting with an input device included on the computing device 650 when the computing device is incorporated into the AR space can cause a particular action to occur in the AR space.
-
In some implementations, a touchscreen of the computing device 650 can be rendered as a touchpad in AR space. A user can interact with the touchscreen of the computing device 650. The interactions are rendered, in AR headset 690 for example, as movements on the rendered touchpad in the AR space. The rendered movements can control virtual objects in the AR space.
-
In some implementations, one or more output devices included on the computing device 650 can provide output and/or feedback to a user of the AR headset 690 in the AR space. The output and feedback can be visual, tactile, or audio. The output and/or feedback can include, but is not limited to, vibrations, turning on and off or blinking and/or flashing of one or more lights or strobes, sounding an alarm, playing a chime, playing a song, and playing of an audio file. The output devices can include, but are not limited to, vibration motors, vibration coils, piezoelectric devices, electrostatic devices, light emitting diodes (LEDs), strobes, and speakers.
-
In some implementations, the computing device 650 may appear as another object in a computer-generated, 3D environment. Interactions by the user with the computing device 650 (e.g., rotating, shaking, touching a touchscreen, swiping a finger across a touch screen) can be interpreted as interactions with the object in the AR space. In the example of the laser pointer in an AR space, the computing device 650 appears as a virtual laser pointer in the computer-generated, 3D environment. As the user manipulates the computing device 650, the user in the AR space sees movement of the laser pointer. The user receives feedback from interactions with the computing device 650 in the AR environment on the computing device 650 or on the AR headset 690. The user's interactions with the computing device may be translated to interactions with a user interface generated in the AR environment for a controllable device.
-
In some implementations, a computing device 650 may include a touchscreen. For example, a user can interact with the touchscreen to interact with a user interface for a controllable device. For example, the touchscreen may include user interface elements such as sliders that can control properties of the controllable device.

Computing device 600 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers and devices, including, but not limited to laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers. Computing device 650 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be examples only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document.
-
A number of embodiments have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the specification.
-
In addition, the logic flows depicted in the figures do not require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In addition, other steps may be provided, or steps may be eliminated, from the described flows, and other components may be added to, or removed from, the described systems. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.
-
Further to the descriptions above, a user may be provided with controls allowing the user to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs, or features described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions, or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), and if the user is sent content or communications from a server. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the user.
