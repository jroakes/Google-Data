- a fingerprint of the audio of a telephone call to a telephone number is generated ( 502 ). For example, if the telephone number is associated with a voicemail system, a fingerprint of the voicemail greeting may be generated. As another example, if the telephone number is associated with a response system, a fingerprint may be generated for audio corresponding to an initial set of options available using the response system.
- a stored fingerprint associated with the telephone number it is determined whether the generated fingerprint matches the stored fingerprint ( 506 ). For example, the stored fingerprint may be accessed from the database and may be compared to the generated fingerprint. If the generated fingerprint matches the stored fingerprint, it is determined to not transcribe information for the telephone number ( 508 ). For example, it may be determined that information has already been transcribed for the telephone number and it may be determined to not repeat transcribing information for the telephone number, such as to avoid unnecessary processing.
- the generated fingerprint does not match the stored fingerprint (e.g., 506 ), or if a stored fingerprint associated with the telephone number does not exist (e.g., 504 ), the generated fingerprint is stored ( 510 ).
- a stored fingerprint may not exist, for example, if information has never been transcribed for the telephone number.
- the generated fingerprint might not match the stored fingerprint, if, for example, a voicemail message or a response system has changed since information was last transcribed.
- the generated fingerprint may be stored, for example, in a database, in association with the telephone number.
- the associated voicemail greeting may be transcribed.
- Text corresponding to the voicemail greeting may be generated, such as by using a speech to text engine.
- the transcribed message may be parsed to identify particular types of information, such as information about open hours, a location, holiday closings, specials or offers, etc.
- the telephone number is associated with a response system
- information about a decision tree that is available via touchtone, voice or other response may be transcribed.
- the response system may be systematically navigated, such as by using a depth-first approach or a breadth-first approach.
- the decision tree may be navigated, for example, by generating and send touch-tones, or by generating or identifying and sending audio commands.
- the audio commands may be sent, for example, based on audio recorded from the response system. For example, portions of the recorded audio that correspond to available commands may be sent to the response system.
- the audio may be converted to text, the text may be parsed to identify available voice commands, portions of the audio that include the identified voice commands may be identified, and the decision tree may be navigated by sending a portion of the audio as a voice command, to the response system.
- the audio may be converted to text, words that are identified as voice commands may be converted to audio, such as using a text to speech engine, and generated audio may be sent to the response system as voice commands to navigate the response system.
- the structure and the options available from the response system may be recorded in a representation of the decision tree.
- the presence of particular options, such as an option to speak to a live operator, or an option to exit the system, may be identified as being available in the response system and may be recorded in the decision tree representation.

- FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an example process 600 for processing interactions with transcribed information.
- the process 600 can be performed, for example, by the transcribing system 112 described above with respect to FIG. 1 .
- a user is provided with transcribed information about a response system ( 602 ).
- the user may be provided with a representation of a decision tree that corresponds to options offered by the response system.
- a selection is received from the user based on the transcribed information ( 604 ). For example, the user may select a node in a decision tree representation, where the node represents a particular option at a particular level in the decision tree. As another example, if the response system offers an option to speak to a live operator or to exit the system, the user may select a control associated with the speak to a live operator option or the exit the system option. In some implementations, such controls may be displayed to the user for the entire time that the decision tree representation is displayed, regardless of the present navigation state of the decision tree representation.
- An input is provided to the response system based on the selection in order to navigate through the response system ( 606 ). For example, one or more touch-tones and/or one or more voice responses may be provided to the response system, based on the selection. In some implementations, one input is provided to the response system for each user selection. For example, in some implementations, if a user selects a top (e.g., first) level node of a decision tree implementation, then an input corresponding to the selection, such as a touch-tone, may be provided to the response system, and if the user selects a second level node of the decision tree, then a second input corresponding to the second selection may be provided to the response system, with the first input and the second input being sent at different times.
- a top e.g., first
- an input corresponding to the selection such as a touch-tone
- the decision tree representation allows the user to navigate to various levels of the decision tree and to select an option at any level of the decision tree.
- Inputs might be provided in response to the selection of an option but not in response to navigating the decision tree (e.g., a control or user interface command used to navigate the decision tree may be different than a control or command used to select a particular option). For example, if the user selects a particular option that is not a top level option, multiple inputs may be provided to the response system, at the same time, corresponding to a set of options that correspond to a navigation path leading to the selected option.
