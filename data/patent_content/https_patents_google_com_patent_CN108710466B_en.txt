Description
Description of the cases
The application belongs to divisional application of Chinese invention patent application No. 201380034357.5 with application date of 2013, 6, month and 25.
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to prioritized management and presentation of notifications.
Background
A computing device may provide a notification module that manages information and/or alerts (e.g., notifications) received from applications executing at the computing device. In some cases, the notification module may output important information and/or alerts for display at the screen. As the number of applications executing at the computing device increases, the number of notifications received by the computing device may increase, which may complicate the management and presentation of notifications by the notification module. For example, the number of notifications displayed to a user at a time may be limited by the size of the screen used to display the notifications. A limited number of notifications can be displayed at one time and the notifications can be presented in a fixed, uniform format regardless of the amount of content associated with each notification. Limiting the number of notifications displayed at one time may require the computing device to replace notifications that include more important information with one or more notifications that include less important information.
Further, a computing device that uses a notification module to manage multiple notifications may require a user to provide input in response to a particular notification generated by the notification module, but within a context outside of the user interface of the notification module itself. For example, the notification tool may receive and cause the computing device to present information about a text message notification, but ask the user to exit the notification module and open a text message application in order to respond to the text message referenced in the text message notification.
Disclosure of Invention
In one example, the present disclosure is directed to a method that includes receiving, by a computing device, an indication of a notification and determining, by the computing device, a priority level associated with the notification. The method also includes determining, by the computing device, content of the notification based at least in part on the priority level, and outputting, by the computing device and for display, in response to receiving the notification of the gesture detected at the computing device, a notification centric graphical user interface comprising a graphical indication of the notification, the graphical indication comprising the content of the notification.
In another example, the disclosure is directed to a method that includes receiving, by a computing device, an indication of a first notification and an indication of a second notification, and determining, by the computing device, a respective priority level associated with each of the first and second notifications. The method also includes determining, by the computing device, respective content for each of the first and second notifications based on the respective priority levels of the first and second notifications. The method also includes outputting, by the computing device and for display, a notification center graphical user interface including a respective graphical indication of each of the first and second notifications, the graphical indication of the first notification including content of the first notification and the graphical indication of the second notification including content of the second notification.
In another example, the disclosure is directed to a system comprising an input device, a display device, at least one processor, and at least one module operable by the at least one processor to receive an indication of a notification and determine a priority level associated with the notification. The at least one module may be further operable by the at least one processor to determine content of the notification based at least in part on the priority level, and output, for display at the display device, a notification centric graphical user interface in response to receiving the indication of the gesture detected at the input device, the notification centric graphical user interface including a graphical indication of the notification, and the graphical indication including the content of the notification.
In another example, the present disclosure is directed to a system comprising an input device, a display device, at least one processor, and at least one module operable by the at least one processor to receive an indication of a first notification and an indication of a second notification, and to determine a respective priority level associated with each of the first and second notifications. The at least one module is further operable by the at least one processor to determine respective content for each of the first and second notifications based on respective priority levels of the first and second notifications. The at least one module is further operable by the at least one processor to output, for display at the display device, a notification center graphical user interface including a respective graphical indication of each of the first and second notifications, the graphical indication of the first notification including content of the first notification and the graphical indication of the second notification including content of the second notification.

Detailed Description
Examples described in this disclosure relate to techniques applied by a computing device that receives one or more notifications and outputs for display a graphical indication of the notifications. In some examples, the computing device includes a notification service module that manages notifications on behalf of the computing device. The notification service module may receive notifications generated by services and applications executing at the computing device and/or executing remotely from the computing device. The notification service module may control presentation of a respective graphical indication associated with each of the one or more notifications. The notification service module may include one or more of these graphical indications within a notification center Graphical User Interface (GUI) that the computing device outputs for display (e.g., at a display device).
The notification can include a first content portion (e.g., a summary textual description of the notification, a graphical icon associated with the notification, etc.) and a second content portion (e.g., a full textual description of the notification, a graphical image associated with the notification, etc.). The second content portion of the notification may include more information about the notification than the first content portion. Some notifications may include only the first content portion. In other words, those notifications having both the first content portion and the second content portion may include more information than those notifications that include only the first content portion.
In some examples, to present multiple graphical indications of notifications simultaneously within a single GUI, the notification service module may restrict presentation of individual graphical indications of notifications by presenting only the first content portion of each notification. In other words, rather than including both the first and second content portions in the graphical indication of a notification having both the first and second content portions, the notification service module may include only the first content portion within the graphical indication.
In some examples, the notification service module may determine a priority level for each notification received and modify the presentation of the notification center GUI accordingly. The computing device may automatically expand the graphical indication of the higher-priority notification to include both the first and second portions of content of the higher-priority notification within its respective graphical indication. The computing device may automatically constrain or collapse the graphical indication of the lower-priority notification to include only the first portion of content within its respective graphical indication.
In some examples, a computing device may present multiple graphical indications of multiple different notifications. One graphical indication may include the first and second content portions of one notification, and at least one other graphical indication may include only the first content portion of a different notification. The computing device may receive the entered indication to select and clear (e.g., remove from display) one of the notifications corresponding to the graphical indication having both the first and second content portions. In response, the computing device may clear (e.g., remove from display) the selected notification by ceasing to display the graphical indication of the selected notification. In the event that the graphical indication of the selected notification is removed, the computing device may automatically expand the graphical indication of the other notification and include within the graphical indication of the other notification the second content portion of the other notification and the first content portion of the other notification.
In some examples, the computing device may receive an indication of an input that causes the computing device to expand a size of the graphical indication of the notification such that the expanded graphical indication includes additional content associated with the notification. For example, a computing device may present a notification center graphical user interface at a display device, such as a presence-sensitive screen. Within the notification center GUI, the notification service module can include a graphical indication of a notification including the first content portion. To enable selection of a notification for expansion, the computing device may detect and/or receive an indication of a gesture input at or near a portion of the presence-sensitive input device that corresponds to a location at which the graphical indication of the notification is displayed. In response to receiving the indication of the detected input, the notification service module may expand the selected graphical indication by, for example, increasing the size of the graphical indication and including a second portion of content within the graphical indication in addition to the first portion of content corresponding to the notification.
In some examples, the notification service module may include one or more selectable options within the graphical indication of the notification. This option may be used to configure the notification, respond to the notification, and/or perform any other action associated with the notification. For example, the notification service module may output one or more selectable graphical elements for display within the graphical indication of the notification. The one or more selectable graphical elements may represent options to configure, delete, clear, remove from display, reply to, uninstall, block, prevent, or otherwise take action with respect to the respective notification. The user may select one or more of these options by, for example, performing a gesture at a portion of the presence-sensitive input device that corresponds to a location at which one or more of the respective graphical elements are displayed. In response to the selection, the computing device may perform a selectable action associated with the selected option.
In other cases, instead of or in addition to presenting graphical elements as options, the notification service module may include a modified user interface to handle more complex user responses and interactions to notifications. For example, the notification service module can present an overlay for interacting with an application associated with the notification as the second content portion of the notification. Exemplary interactions may include replying to a text or email message notification substitute within a message GUI of a notification center GUI, for example, first launching a messaging application that generates the notification.
The techniques of this disclosure may provide one or more advantages. For example, techniques of this disclosure may provide better management of content associated with notifications and may help ensure that a user obtains sufficient information from the presentation of the notification. In addition, by making the presentation of higher priority notifications different from lower priority notifications, the computing device may present the notifications in a more useful manner, which may make it easier for a user to manage the notifications. The techniques of this disclosure may also enable a user to perform an action related to a notification without requiring the computing device to launch an application associated with the notification in order to process the action. Further, by including selectable options within the presentation of the notification, the computing device can be configured and/or customized to process the notification in a manner that is more appropriate for the particular situation or use of the computing device. Better presentation, management, and customization of notifications may provide a better user experience and may require less input from the user to perform actions in response to the notifications.
Fig. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example computing device configured to present notifications in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. In the example of fig. 1, computing device 10 may be a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a laptop computer, a portable gaming device, a portable media player, an e-book reader, a watch, a television platform, or other type of computing device.
As shown in fig. 1, computing device 10 includes a User Interface Device (UID) 12. UID 12 of computing device 10 may serve as an input device and an output device for computing device 10. UID 12 may be implemented using various technologies. For example, UID 12 may function as an input device using a presence-sensitive input screen, such as a resistive touchscreen, a surface acoustic wave touchscreen, a capacitive touchscreen, a projected capacitance touchscreen, a pressure-sensitive screen, an acoustic pulse recognition touchscreen, or another presence-sensitive screen technology. UID 12 may function as an output device using any one or more display devices, such as a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), dot matrix display, Light Emitting Diode (LED) display, Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display, electronic ink, or similar monochrome or color display capable of outputting visible information to a user of computing device 10.
Applications 24 of computing device 10 may perform various functions or access one or more services for computing device 10. Email applications, calendar applications, text messaging applications, gaming applications, stock applications, and weather applications are all examples of applications 24. For example, application 24A may be for a text message that provides functionality associated with viewing, editing, sending, and receiving text messages with computing device 10. Application 24A may be an email application that provides functionality associated with viewing, editing, sending, and receiving email messages with computing device 10. Application 24A may be a calendar application that provides functionality for computing device 10 to schedule and present appointments, meetings, and the like associated with an electronic calendar. The application 24A may be a gaming application that provides gaming functionality for the computing device 10. Application 24A may be a stock application that provides functionality for downloading and presenting financial and other stock-related information from the internet. The application 24A may be a weather application that provides functionality for presenting online weather forecasts and other metrology information.
In the example of fig. 1, notification center 16 presents a graphical indication of text message notification 18A showing a preview of the last three text messages exchanged with a particular contact, as well as a small image of the sender of each message and the contact. Text message notification 18A may be generated by a text message application. Notification center 16 presents an expanded graphical indication of email message notification 18B that shows a preview of new unread emails received by the email application. The graphical indication of notification 18B also includes the name, subject, and top word of the sender of the email. The graphical indication of notification 18B also includes a selectable graphical element 19 that indicates one or more selectable actions associated with notification 18B. For example, the selectable graphical element 19 corresponds to an option to view (e.g., read) an email message received by an email application.
In some examples, notification 18B and notification 18F may correspond to different email message accounts. For example, notification 18B may correspond to a notification from an email application associated with a work email account and notification 18F may correspond to a notification from an email application associated with a personal email account. In addition to presenting the number of unread email messages, the unexpanded graphical indication of email notification 18F may also present an indication of the email account associated with notification 18F.
In some examples, the unexpanded graphical indication of email notification 18F may include a lower priority email (e.g., determined from the sender, subject, email account, etc.) than the email that triggered the generation and display of the expanded graphical indication of email notification 18B. For example, an email application may generate a high priority level email notification 18B in response to receiving an email from a user recipient's supervisor, spouse, important friend, etc., while a different email application may generate a low priority level email notification 18F in response to receiving a corporate advertisement, promotion, and/or junk email.
In addition to processing notifications 18, notification service module 22 may send information and commands to UI module 20 that cause computing device 10 to present notification center 16. For example, notification service module 22 may send information regarding the graphical layout of notification center 16, including information regarding each graphical indication of notification 18. UI module 20 may convert the graphical layout of notification center 16 into a format recognized by UID 12 for presenting notification center 16. Notification service module 22 may also interpret inputs received by computing device 10 when UID 12 presents notification center 16. For example, UID 12 may detect an input (e.g., a gesture) at or near a location at which UID 12 presents a graphical indication of notification 18C. UI module 20 may receive an indication of the detected input from UID 12 and send information generated based on the indication to notification service module 22. Notification service module 22 may process the information about the input and determine one or more modifications to be made to the visual layout of notification center 16 (e.g., one or more of the graphical indications of notification 18 to remove, expand, collapse, etc.).
In the example of fig. 1, computing device 10 may output for display a graphical indication of the notification. In various instances, the notification may be associated with at least one application executing at computing device 10. In other cases, the notification may be associated with at least one application and/or service executing at one or more computing devices remote from computing device 10. The graphical indication of the notification may include one or more selectable graphical elements indicating one or more respective selectable actions associated with the notification.
For example, an email application may receive a new email message. To notify the user of computing device 10 of the receipt of a new electronic mail message, the electronic mail application may generate and send notification 18B to notification service module 22. Notification 18B may include content associated with the new email message. For example, the content of notification 18B may include a first content portion, such as an indication of the name of an email account associated with the new email message. The content of notification 18B may also include a second content portion, such as the name, subject, and first few words of the sender of the email message.
In response to receiving the indication of the input, computing device 10 may perform an optional action associated with the notification. Notification service module 22 may cause computing device 10 to execute an email application that generates notification 18B and present the body of the email at UID 12 when the email application executes. For example, notification service module 22 may cause computing device 10 to execute a process of an email application in order to view an email associated with notification 18B. Email application may cause UI module 20 and UID 12 to present an email corresponding to notification 18B.
In response to receiving the indication of the input, computing device 10 may cease outputting the respective graphical indication of the first notification for display. For example, UI module 20 may receive information about the input detected by UID 12 and determine an input location that approximately corresponds to the location of UID 12 where UID 12 presents the graphical indication of notification 18B. UI module 20 may send information about the input and include an indication of where the input was received relative to the location where the graphical indication of notification 18B was presented. Notification service module 22 may determine, based at least in part on the input, to modify the graphical layout of notification center 16 to remove the graphical indication of notification 18B.
In response to receiving the indication of the input, computing device 10 may output a corresponding graphical indication of the second notification to include the second portion of content in addition to the first portion of content. In other words, in addition to removing the graphical indication of notification 18B from the graphical layout of notification center 16, notification service module 22 may output the graphical indication of notification 18F (e.g., by automatically expanding the graphical indication) to include the second portion of content in addition to the first portion of content. The second content portion may include more information than the mere number of new email messages corresponding to notification 18F. For example, the second content portion may include more information indicating the sender and subject matter of each new email message indicated by the first content portion. In other words, notification service module 22 may display a first graphical indication of a notification in an expanded state having both the first and second content portions and a second graphical indication in an unexpanded state having only the first content portion. After removing the first graphical indication from display (e.g., clearing the first notification), notification service module 22 may automatically expand the second graphical indication and include the second portion of content and the first portion of content.
For example, notification service module 22 may determine a priority level associated with one or more notifications 18 received from application 24. The priority level may indicate a measure of importance of one of notifications 18 (e.g., notification 18A) compared to other notifications 18 and/or relative to predicted user interests. For example, a high priority notification may represent a notification from a text messaging application because notification service module 22 may determine that a user may find a notification similar to notification 18A important to the user. Lower priority notifications may represent notifications from one or more gaming applications because notification service module 22 may determine that users may not normally consider such notifications (e.g., notifications 18D and 18E) to be of high importance. Notification service module 22 may be preprogrammed to determine a priority level for the notification. In other examples, notification service module 22 may be configurable and allow input from a user to assign priority levels based on the source of the notification (e.g., the originating application and/or remote service).
Some of these techniques may provide better management of content associated with notifications 18 and may help ensure that a user can obtain sufficient information from notifications 18 when computing device 10 presents notification center 16. In addition, by making the presentation of higher priority notifications different from lower priority notifications, computing device 10 may present a more useful way for a user to interact with notifications 18 and manage notifications 18. Further, the configuration of presenting selectable options for notifications 18 and providing notifications 18 from these options may enable a user to tailor notifications 18 for particular functions of computing device 10. Better management and configuration of notifications 18 may result in less input from a user to perform functions with computing device 10. As a result, computing device 10 may perform fewer operations associated with the function and thereby consume less electrical power.
Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example computing device in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Computing device 10 of fig. 2 is described below in the context of fig. 1. Fig. 2 illustrates only one particular example of computing device 10, and in other cases many other examples of computing device 10 may be used and may include a subset of the components included in exemplary computing device 10 or may include additional components not shown in fig. 2.
As shown in the example of fig. 2, computing device 10 includes user interface device 12 ("UID 12"), one or more processors 40, one or more input devices 42, one or more communication units 44, one or more output devices 46, and one or more storage devices 48. Storage devices 48 of computing device 10 also include UI module 20, notification service module 22, applications 24, and gesture module 26. The communication channel 50 may interconnect each of the components 12, 13, 20, 22, 24, 26, 40, 42, 44, and 46 for inter-component communication (physically, communicatively, and/or operatively). In some examples, communication channel 50 may include a system bus, a network connection, an interprocess communication data structure, or any other method for communicating data.
One or more input devices 42 of computing device 10 may receive input. Examples of inputs are tactile, audio, and video inputs. In one example, input device 42 of computing device 10 includes a presence-sensitive screen, a touch-sensitive screen, a mouse, a keyboard, a voice response system, a video camera, a microphone, or any other type of device for detecting input from a human or machine.
One or more output devices 46 of computing device 10 may generate output. Examples of outputs are tactile, audio, and video outputs. In one example, output devices 46 of computing device 10 include a presence-sensitive screen, a sound card, a video image adapter card, a speaker, a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), or any other type of device for generating output to a human or machine.
One or more communication units 44 of computing device 10 may communicate with external devices via one or more networks by sending and/or receiving network signals over the one or more networks. For example, computing device 10 may use communication unit 44 to send and/or receive radio signals over a radio network, such as a cellular radio network. Likewise, the communication unit 44 may transmit and/or receive satellite signals over a satellite network, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) network. Examples of communication unit 44 include a network interface card (e.g., such as an ethernet card), an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, a GPS receiver, or any other type of device that can send and/or receive information. Other examples of communication unit 44 may include short wave radio, cellular data radio, wireless ethernet radio, and Universal Serial Bus (USB) controller.
In some examples, UID 12 of computing device 10 may include functionality of input device 42 and/or output device 46. In the example of fig. 2, UID 12 may be or may include a presence-sensitive screen. In some examples, a presence-sensitive screen may detect an object at and/or near the presence-sensitive screen. As one example range, a presence-sensitive screen may detect an object, such as a gesture or stylus within 2 inches or less of the presence-sensitive screen. The presence-sensitive screen may determine the location (e.g., (x, y) coordinates) of the presence-sensitive screen where the object was detected. In another exemplary range, the presence-sensitive screen may detect objects that are 6 inches or less from the presence-sensitive screen, and there may be other ranges as well. The presence-sensitive screen may determine the location of the screen selected by the user's finger using capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques. In some examples, presence-sensitive screens provide output to a user using tactile, audio, or video stimuli as described with respect to output device 46. In the example of fig. 2, UID 12 presents a user interface (such as user interface 14 of fig. 1).
While shown as internal components of computing device 10, UID 12 also represents external components that share a data path with computing device 10 in order to send and/or receive inputs and outputs. For example, in one example, UID 12 represents a built-in component of computing device 10 that is located within and physically connected to an external enclosure of computing device 10 (e.g., a screen on a mobile phone). In another example, UID 12 represents an external component of computing device 10 (e.g., a monitor, projector, etc., which shares a wired and/or wireless data path with a tablet computer) that is located outside of and physically separate from the packaging of computing device 10.
One or more storage devices 48 within computing device 10 may store information for processing during operation of computing device 10 (e.g., computing device 10 may store data that is used by one or more applications 24 during execution thereof at computing device 10). In some examples, storage device 48 is a temporary memory, meaning that the primary purpose of storage device 48 is not long-term storage. Storage devices 48 on computing device 10 may be configured for short-term storage of information as volatile memory, and thus do not retain stored content if powered off. Examples of volatile memory include Random Access Memory (RAM), Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), and other forms of volatile memory known in the art.
In certain examples, storage device 48 also includes one or more computer-readable storage media. The storage device 48 may be configured to store a larger amount of information than volatile memory. Storage devices 48 may also be configured for long-term storage of information as non-volatile memory space and retain information after power on/off cycles. Examples of non-volatile memory include magnetic hard disks, optical disks, floppy disks, flash memory, or forms of electrically programmable memory (EPROM) or Electrically Erasable and Programmable (EEPROM) memory. Storage devices 48 may store program instructions and/or data associated with UI module 20, notification service module 22, applications 24, and gesture module 26.
One or more processors 40 may implement functions and/or execute instructions within computing device 10. For example, processor 40 on computing device 10 may receive and execute instructions stored by storage device 48 that perform the functions of UI module 20, notification service module 22, applications 24, and gesture module 26. These instructions executed by processor 40 may cause computing device 10 to store information within storage device 48 during program execution. Processor 40 may execute instructions of modules 20, 22, and 26 and instructions of application 24 to cause UID 12 to present user interface 14 with notification center 16 and notifications 18 at UID 12. That is, modules 20, 22, and 26, and applications 24 may be operated by processors 40 to perform various actions or functions of computing device 10, such as causing UID 12 to present user interface 14 at UID 12.
According to aspects of the present disclosure, computing device 10 of FIG. 2 may output for display a graphical indication of the notification. In various instances, the notification may be associated with at least one application executing at computing device 10. In other cases, the notification may be associated with at least one application and/or service executing at one or more computing devices remote from computing device 10. The graphical indication of the notification may include one or more selectable graphical elements that indicate one or more respective selectable actions associated with the notification. For example, an email application may receive information about a new email message received over the communication channel 50. The email application may send information associated with the email as notification 18B to notification service module 22 over communication channel 50. The content of notification 18B may include a first content portion, such as an indication of the name of an email account associated with the new email message. The content of notification 18B may also include a second content portion, such as the name, subject, and first few words of the sender of the email message.
In response to receiving the input, computing device 10 may perform the optional action. In other words, notification service module 22 may cause computing device 10 to execute an email application that generates notification 18B, which may cause computing device 10 to present the body of the email at UID 12. For example, notification service module 22 may cause computing device 10 to execute a process for an email application that views emails associated with notification 18B. Processes of the email application may execute at one or more processors 40 and the execution may cause UI module 20 and UID 12 to present an email corresponding to notification 18B.
In other words, and in some cases, to save viewable area of UID 12, notification service module 22 may cause computing device 10 to present the graphical indication of the notification as an unexpanded graphical indication by including only the first content portion (e.g., the number of unread email messages received by an email application) rather than presenting the graphical indication as an expanded graphical indication having both the first content portion and the second content portion (e.g., the number of unread email messages and the body, sender, subject, etc. of the unread email messages).
For example, notification service module 22 may receive notifications 18B and 18F from an email application and send information to UI module 20 that causes UI module 20 to command UID 12 to present a graphical indication of both notifications 18B and 18F. The graphical indication of notification 18B (e.g., the first notification) may include both a first content portion of the email notification received by the email application (e.g., the name and email address of the sender of the email, the envelope email icon, etc.) and a second content portion of the email notification (e.g., the subject of the email, the first few words of the message, selectable graphical elements 19, etc.). The graphical indication of notification 18F (e.g., the second notification) may include only the first content portion of the email notification received by the email application (e.g., an indication of the number of unread email messages received by the email application, an email address associated with an email account that received the email message). Notification service module 22 may instruct UI module 20 to cause UID 12 to present graphical indications of notifications 18A and 18B.
In response to receiving the indication of the input, computing device 10 may refrain from outputting, for display, the corresponding graphical indication of the first notification, and may output, for display, the corresponding graphical indication of the second notification to include, in addition to the first content portion corresponding to the second notification, a second content portion corresponding to the second notification. For example, notification service module 22 may receive one or more touch events from UI module 20 and determine, based on the location and time components of the one or more touch events, that the one or more touch events represent a gesture input to remove notification 18B from display. Notification service module 22 may modify the graphical layout of notification center 16 to remove notification 18B and stop processing (e.g., clearing memory associated with notification service module 22) notification 18B.
In addition to removing the graphical indication of notification 18B from the graphical layout of notification center 16, notification service module 22 may modify the graphical indication of notification 18F to include a second portion of content corresponding to notification 18F in addition to the first portion of content corresponding to notification 18F. In other words, initially, notification service module 22 may show some graphical indications of notifications 18 having expanded content and show other notifications 18 having unexpanded content. When the expanded graphical indication corresponding to one of notifications 18 is cleared (e.g., removed from display), notification service module 22 may automatically expand the graphical indication of one of the other unexpanded graphical indications below the cleared graphical indication. In some examples, the unexpanded graphical indication directly after the cleared graphical indication is a graphical indication that notification service module 22 automatically expands.
For example, notification service module 22 may determine a priority level associated with one or more notifications 18. The priority level may indicate a measure of importance of the notification compared to other notifications 18. A high priority notification may represent a notification from a text messaging application because notification service module 22 may determine that the user may find a notification from the text messaging application that is important to the user. The lower priority notification may represent a notification from the gaming application because notification service module 22 may determine that the user may not normally consider the notification from the gaming application to be of high importance. Notification service module 22 may be preprogrammed to determine a priority level for a notification based on the source and/or context of the notification. In other examples, notification service module 22 may be configurable and allow input from a user to assign a priority level to notifications from a particular source.
Fig. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example computing device outputting graphical content for display at a remote device in accordance with one or more techniques of this disclosure. The graphical content may generally include any visual information that may be output for display, such as text, an image, a set of moving images, and so forth. The example shown in fig. 3 includes computing device 100, presence-sensitive display 101, communication unit 110, projector 120, projector screen 122, mobile device 126, and visual display device 130. Although shown in fig. 1 and 2 as a standalone computing device 10 for purposes of example, a computing device such as computing devices 10, 100 may generally be any component or system that includes a processor or other suitable computing environment for executing software instructions and, for example, need not include a presence-sensitive display.
As shown in the example of fig. 3, computing device 100 may be a processor including functionality as described with respect to processor 40 in fig. 2. In such examples, computing device 100 may be operatively coupled to presence-sensitive display 101 by a communication channel 102A, which communication channel 102A may be a system bus or other suitable connection. The computing device 100 may also be operatively coupled to a communication unit 110, described further below, by a communication channel 102B, which communication channel 102B may also be a system bus or other suitable connection. Although shown separately as an example in fig. 3, computing device 100 may be operatively coupled to presence-sensitive display 101 and communication unit 110 by any number of one or more communication channels.
In other examples, such as previously illustrated with computing device 10 in fig. 1-2, the computing device may refer to a portable or mobile device, such as a mobile phone (including a smartphone), a laptop computer, and so forth. In some examples, the computing device may be a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a smart television platform, a camera, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a server, a mainframe, and so forth.
Presence-sensitive display 101 may include a display device 103 and a presence-sensitive input device 105. Display device 103 may, for example, receive data from computing device 100 and display graphical content. In some examples, presence-sensitive input device 105 may use capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques to determine one or more inputs (e.g., continuous gestures, multi-touch gestures, single-touch gestures, etc.) at presence-sensitive display 101 and send an indication of such inputs to computing device 100 using communication channel 102A. In some examples, presence-sensitive input device 105 may be physically positioned on top of display device 103 such that when a user positions an input unit over a graphical element displayed by display device 103, the position of presence-sensitive input device 105 corresponds to the position of display device 103 displaying the graphical element. In other examples, presence-sensitive input device 105 may be physically located separate from display device 103, and the location of presence-sensitive input device 105 may correspond to the location at which stylus 103 is displayed, such that input may be made at presence-sensitive input device 105 to interact with graphical elements displayed at the respective location of display device 103.
As shown in fig. 3, computing device 100 may also include and/or be operatively coupled with a communication unit 110. The communication unit 110 may include the functionality of the communication unit 44 as described in fig. 2. Examples of communication unit 110 may include a network interface card, an ethernet card, an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, or any other type of device that may send and/or receive information. Other examples of such communication units may include bluetooth, 3G and Wi-Fi radios, Universal Serial Bus (USB) interfaces, and the like. Computing device 100 may also include and/or be operatively coupled to one or more other devices, such as input devices, output devices, memory, storage devices, etc., that are not illustrated in fig. 3 for purposes of brevity and illustration.
Fig. 3 also illustrates a projector 120 and a projector screen 122. Other such examples of projection devices may include electronic whiteboards, holographic display devices, and any other suitable device for displaying graphical content. Projector 120 and projection screen 122 may include one or more communication units that enable the respective devices to communicate with computing device 100. In some examples, the one or more communication units may enable communication between projector 120 and projector screen 122. Projector 120 may receive data from computing device 100 that includes graphical content. Projector 120, in response to receiving the data, may project graphical content onto projector screen 122. In some examples, projector 120 may use optical recognition or other suitable techniques to determine one or more inputs (e.g., continuous gestures, multi-touch gestures, single-touch gestures, etc.) at projector screen 122 and send indications of such inputs to communication device 100 using one or more communication units. In such examples, projector screen 122 may not be necessary, and projector 120 may project graphical content on any suitable medium and detect one or more user inputs using optical recognition or other such suitable techniques.
In some examples, projector screen 122 may include a presence-sensitive display 124. Presence-sensitive display 124 may include a subset of the functionality or all of the functionality of UI device 4 as described in this disclosure. In some examples, presence-sensitive display 124 may include additional functionality. Projector screen 122 (e.g., an electronic whiteboard) may receive data from computing device 100 and display graphical content. In some examples, presence-sensitive display 124 may use capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques to determine one or more inputs (e.g., continuous gestures, multi-touch gestures, single-touch gestures, etc.) at projector screen 122 and send an indication of such inputs to computing device 100 using one or more communication units.
Fig. 3 also illustrates a mobile device 126 and a visual display device 130. Mobile device 126 and visual display device 130 may each include computing and connectivity capabilities. Examples of mobile device 126 may include an electronic reader device, a convertible notebook device, a hybrid tablet device, and so forth. Examples of visual display device 130 may include other semi-stationary devices such as televisions, computer monitors, and the like. As shown in fig. 3, mobile device 126 may include a presence-sensitive display 128. Visual display device 130 may include a presence-sensitive display 132. Presence- sensitive displays 128, 132 may include a subset of the functionality or all of the functionality of UID 12 as described in this disclosure. In some examples, presence- sensitive displays 128, 132 may include additional functionality. In any case, presence-sensitive display 132 may receive data from computing device 100 and display graphical content, for example. In some examples, presence-sensitive display 132 may use capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques to determine one or more inputs (e.g., continuous gestures, multi-touch gestures, single-touch gestures, etc.) at the projector screen and send an indication of such inputs to computing device 100 using one or more communication units.
As described above, in some examples, computing device 100 may output graphical content for display at presence-sensitive display 101 coupled to computing device 100 via a system bus or other suitable communication channel. Computing device 100 may also output graphical content for display at one or more remote devices, such as projector 120, projector screen 122, mobile device 126, and visual display device 130. For example, in accordance with techniques of this disclosure, computing device 100 may execute one or more instructions to generate and/or modify graphical content. Computing device 100 may output data including graphical content to a communication unit of computing device 100, such as communication unit 110. Communication unit 110 may send data to one or more of the remote devices, such as projector 120, projector screen 122, mobile device 126, and/or visual display device 130. As such, the computing device 100 may output the graphical content for display at one or more of the remote devices. In some examples, one or more of the remote devices may output graphical content at a presence-sensitive display included in and/or operatively coupled with the respective remote device.
In some examples, computing device 100 may not output graphical content at presence-sensitive display 101 operatively coupled to computing device 100. In other examples, computing device 100 may output graphical content for display at presence-sensitive display 101 coupled to computing device 100 through communication channel 102A and at one or more remote devices. In such examples, the graphical content may be displayed at each respective device substantially simultaneously. For example, some delay may be introduced by the communication latency for transmitting data including graphical content to a remote device. In some examples, the graphical content generated by computing device 100 and output for display at presence-sensitive display 1001 may be displayed differently than the graphical content output for display at one or more remote devices.
In some examples, the computing device 100 may be operatively coupled to one or more of the remote devices included in fig. 3 using direct device communication 118. Direct device communication 118 may include communications by which computing device 100 sends and receives data directly with a remote device using wired or wireless communications. That is, in some examples of direct device communication 118, data sent by computing device 100 may not be forwarded by one or more additional devices before being received at a remote device, and vice versa. Examples of direct device communication 118 may include Bluetooth, near field communication, universal serial bus, Wi-Fi, infrared, and the like. One or more of the remote devices shown in fig. 3 may be operatively coupled to computing device 100 by communication links 116A-116D. In some examples, communication links 112A-112D may be connections using Bluetooth, near field communication, universal serial bus, infrared, and the like. Such connections may be wireless and/or wired connections.
In accordance with techniques of this disclosure, computing device 100 may be operatively coupled to visual display device 130 using external network 114. Computing device 100 may output, for display, a notification center graphical user interface at presence-sensitive display 132. For example, computing device 100 may send data to communication unit 110 that includes a representation of notification center 16, including an expanded graphical indication of notification 18B, including a first content portion and a second content portion corresponding to notification 18B. The first content portion may include an email icon and the second content portion may include a portion of the sender of the email, the subject or body of the email associated with notification 18B. Additionally, the second content portion may include one or more selectable graphical elements, such as selectable graphical element 19. Communication unit 110 may use external network 114 to send data including a representation of notification center 16 to visual display device 130. Visual display device 130, in response to receiving data using external network 114, may cause presence-sensitive display 132 to output notification center 16. In response to a user performing a gesture at presence-sensitive display 132 to select graphical element 19 within the graphical indication of notification 18B, visual display device 130 may send an indication of the gesture to computing device 100 using external network 114. The communication unit 110 may receive an indication of the gesture and may send the indication to the computing device 100.
The computing device 100 may determine that the gesture represents a selection of a graphical element 19. For example, in some cases, computing device 100 utilizes gesture module 26, UI module 20, and notification service module 22 to determine that selectable graphical element 19 of the graphical indication of notification 18B was selected. The computing device 100 may execute a selectable option associated with the graphical element 19 based on the gesture. For example, computing device 100 may execute a process of an email application that generates notification 18B to cause the email application to present the body of the relevant email within notification center 16. Computing device 100 may send data to communication unit 110 that includes modified notification center 16 that includes the body of the email within the graphical indication of notification 18B. The communication unit 110 may in turn send data to the visual display device 130 using the external network 114. Upon receiving this data, visual display device 130 may cause presence-sensitive display 132 to display the modified notification center 16. As such, processor 102 may output for display a graphical indication of notification 18 at presence-sensitive screen 132 in accordance with the techniques of this disclosure.
Fig. 4A and 4B are conceptual diagrams illustrating an example notification center graphical user interface according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. In the example of fig. 4A, computing device 201 is a mobile phone. Computing device 201 is one example of computing device 10 shown in fig. 1 and 2, and may include similar hardware and software components as included in computing device 10, such as UID 12, UI module 20, notification service module 22, and one or more applications 24.
In accordance with techniques of this disclosure, the computing device 201 may output for display an unexpanded graphical indication 200A that includes a first portion of content corresponding to a notification received from an application executing at the computing device 201. For example, computing device may present graphical indication 200A at UID 12. The first portion of content included within the presentation of the graphical indication 200A includes the sender, subject, and first few words of the email message notification.
In response to receiving the first input, the computing device 201 may modify the graphical indication 200A of the notification to include, in addition to the first portion of content, a second portion of content corresponding to the notification. The second content portion may include selectable graphical elements 204A, 204B, 204C that indicate respective selectable actions associated with the notification. In other words, notification service module 22 may receive information about gesture 202 from UI module 20 and determine that gesture 202 represents a command from the user to expand graphical indication 200A of the email notification. Notification service module 22 may cause UI module 200 to update the presentation of graphical indication 200A to be the presentation of graphical indication 200B as shown in fig. 4B. The graphical indication 200B includes selectable graphical elements 204A, 204B, 204C, each associated with a respective selectable action for viewing, deleting, and replying to an email corresponding to the email notification.
In response to receiving the second input, the computing device 201 may perform a selectable action associated with the selected graphical element 204C. For example, notification service module 22 may cause computing device 201 to invoke and execute a process of an email application to reply to an email message associated with the notification corresponding to graphical indication 200A.
In some examples, computing device 201 may output graphical indication 200B within the notification center graphical user interface. For example, the graphical indications 200A, 200B may be presented by the computing device 201 within a notification center graphical user interface, such as the notification center 16 of fig. 1. Notification service module 22 may control the presentation of graphical indications (e.g., graphical indications 200A, 200B) within the notification center graphical user interface.
In some examples, where computing device 201 includes a graphical indication of a notification within a notification center graphical user interface, computing device 201 may perform a selectable action within the notification center graphical user interface. For example, computing device 201 may present a user interface for replying to an email message within graphical indication 200B, and computing device 201 may allow a user to compose a reply to an email message within graphical indication 200B and without navigating to a different user interface.
In some examples, the computing device 201 may perform the selectable action by outputting an overlay to display to receive information for completing performance of the selectable action. For example, FIG. 4B illustrates an overlay 208 that includes a user interface for replying to email messages associated with notifications. This covering may be a window that appears below the graphical indication 200B and/or partially or completely covers the graphical indication 200B. Upon selection of graphical element 204B, notification service module 22 may cause computing device 201 to present overlay 208.
In some examples, notification service module 22 may determine a type of the notification, and based at least in part on the type of the notification, notification service module 22 may determine a selectable action and an associated selectable graphical element associated with the notification. For example, notification service module 22 may classify each notification into a type such as notifications related to text messages, email messages, calendar events, phone calls, game status, social media updates, and so forth. Notification service module 22 determines an appropriate action to take in response to selection of graphical element 204C based at least in part on the type. In this example, notification service module 22 may determine that the type of notification is an email notification in response to determining that the corresponding notification was received from an email application. Notification service module 22 may determine that gesture 206 represents a selection of graphical element 204C for replying to an email message associated with an email notification received from an email application. In a different example, notification service module 22 may determine that the type of notification is a text message notification and determine that the selectable action corresponds to a reply text message in response to selection of graphical element 204C.
In some examples, in response to performing the selectable action, the computing device 201 may output, for display, an unselected graphical element indicating performance of the selectable action, the unselected graphical element replacing the selectable graphical element. For example, after authoring a reply to an email message, notification service module 22 may cause computing device 201 to update the presentation of graphical indication 200B with the text "email sent" that includes the word within graphical indication 200B. The text may represent a "tombstone" that indicates that the computing device 201 has completed performance of the optional action. The computing device 201 may present text within the graphical indication 200B in place of the graphical element 204C.
In some examples, computing device 201 may receive an indication of an input detected at a presence-sensitive input device to collapse the graphical indication and may modify the graphical indication of the notification to replace the selectable graphical element with textual information corresponding to the notification. The second input may be a pinch gesture. For example, FIG. 4B illustrates an expanded graphical indication 200B of a user performing gesture 210 to collapse an email notification. Notification service module 22 may receive information from UI module 20 related to gesture 210 and determine that gesture 210 represents a gesture to minimize and/or collapse graphical indication 200B. For example, the user may wish to cause the graphical indication 200B to be presented as the graphical indication 200A of fig. 4A. Notification service module 22 may send information to UI module 20 to modify the presentation of graphical indication 200B to remove the second portion of content (e.g., graphical elements 204A, 204B, and 204C). UI module 20 may receive the information from notification service module 22 and update the presentation of graphical indication 200B to include only the first portion of content, including the textual information corresponding to the electronic notification, at UID 12 of computing device 201.
Fig. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating exemplary operations of a computing device according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The process of fig. 5 may be performed by one or more processors of a computing device, such as computing device 10 shown in fig. 1 and 2. For purposes of illustration only, fig. 5 is described below within the context of computing device 201 of fig. 4A and 4B.
In the example of fig. 5, the computing device may output for display a graphical indication of the notification that includes a selectable graphical element that indicates a selectable action associated with the notification (220). For example, computing device 201 may output graphical indication 200B at UID 12 for display. Graphical indication 200B represents a graphical indication of a notification generated by an email application. The graphical indication 200B includes selectable graphical elements 204A 204B and 204C.
The computing device may receive an indication of an input detected at a presence-sensitive input device that corresponds to a selection of a selectable graphical element (230). For example, computing device 201 may receive information regarding an indication of gesture 206 detected at a location of UID 12 corresponding to a location where UID 12 presents selectable graphical element 204C. Notification service module 22 may receive information about gesture 206 from UI module 20 and determine that gesture 206 represents a selection of graphical element 204C.
In response to receiving the indication of the input, the computing device of the example of fig. 5 may perform an optional action associated with the notification (240). For example, in response to determining selection of graphical element 204C, computing device 201 may perform a selectable action associated with graphical element 204C by causing UI module 20 to present overlay 208 at UID 12 (from which the user may reply to an email).
Fig. 6A and 6B are conceptual diagrams illustrating other example graphical indications of notifications according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Computing device 301 is one example of computing device 10 shown in fig. 1 and 2, and may include similar hardware and software components as included in computing device 10, such as UID 12, UI module 20, notification service module 22, and applications 24.
In accordance with techniques of this disclosure, computing device 301 may output for display a respective graphical indication of each of the plurality of notifications. The respective graphical indication of a first notification of the plurality of notifications may include both a first content portion and a second content portion corresponding to the first notification. The respective graphical indication of a second notification of the plurality of notifications may include only the first portion of content corresponding to the second notification.
For example, notification service module 22 may receive notifications from various applications 204 executing at computing device 301. Notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to present a notification center graphical user interface at UID 12 (e.g., a presence-sensitive screen) of computing device 301 that includes graphical indication 300A of the text message notification received from the text message application. The graphical indication 300A includes a first content portion corresponding to a text message notification (e.g., text of the last three correspondences in a text message chain) and a second content portion corresponding to a text message application (e.g., a selectable graphical element for replying to the text message notification). Notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to present graphical indication 302A of the social media notification received from the social media application at UID 12 of computing device 301. Graphical indication 302A includes only a first content portion corresponding to a social media notification (e.g., an icon related to a social media application and text indicating an update posted within a social media network). Notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to present graphical indications 303A and 304A of email notifications received from the email application and game play notifications received from the game application, respectively, at UID 12.
In some examples, graphical indications 300a 302A, 303A, and 304A are included within the notification center graphical user interface. In some examples, a respective graphical indication 300A of the first notification that includes both the first and second content portions is displayed within a top portion of the notification center graphical user interface, and a respective graphical indication (e.g., graphical indications 302A, 303A, and 304A) of each of the plurality of notifications other than the first notification is displayed below the respective graphical indication 300A of the first notification that includes only the first content portion. In other words, to maximize the number of graphical indications that computing device 301 may present at one time, notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to present a notification center graphical user interface at UID 12 of computing device 301, with a first (e.g., top) graphical indication in the notification in an expanded state and other graphical indications of the notification in an unexpanded state and below the first graphical indication.
In some examples, computing device 301 may output, for display, a graphical element corresponding to an option (e.g., a command) to remove (e.g., dismiss) the first notification from display. For example, graphical element 305 represents a graphical button for clearing a notification associated with graphical indication 300A. The computing device 301 may determine a selection of a graphical element based at least in part on the input. For example, notification service module 22 may determine that gesture 305 represents a selection of graphical element 305 and that gesture 305 represents a command from the user to clear the notification associated with graphical indication 300A.
As shown in fig. 6B, in response to the selection, computing device 301 may cease outputting, for display, the respective graphical indication of the first notification, and modify the respective graphical indication of the second notification to include, in addition to the first portion of content corresponding to the second notification, a second portion of content corresponding to the second notification. In other words, notification service module 22 may determine that gesture 305 represents a command from the user to clear the notification associated with graphical indication 300A. Notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to cease outputting (e.g., refrain from outputting) graphical indication 300A at UID 12.
To maximize the amount of notification content presented to the user after clearing the text message notification, notification service module 22 may also automatically cause UI module 20 to expand graphical indication 302A and present graphical indication 302B, which includes both a first content portion corresponding to the social media notification (e.g., an icon related to a social media application and text indicating updates posted within the social media network) and a second content portion corresponding to the social media notification (e.g., a graphical image posted to the social media network). In some examples, the second content portion of the second notification (e.g., the social media notification) includes one or more selectable graphical elements, each corresponding to an option (e.g., a command) to perform one or more functions associated with the second notification. For example, the graphical indication 302B in fig. 6B shows selectable graphical elements 306A, 306B, 306C that correspond to functions related to approval, comment, and disapproval, respectively, of social media updates associated with the social media notification.
In some examples, computing device 301 automatically outputs the modified graphical indication of the second notification within the top portion of the notification center graphical user interface for output such that the graphical indication of the second notification replaces the corresponding graphical indication of the first notification. In other words, computing device 301 may automatically present the top-most graphical indication in the expanded state and each other graphical indication (e.g., graphical indications 303B and 304B) within the notification center graphical user interface in the unexpanded state.
In some examples, as shown in fig. 6B, the modified graphical indication of the second notification includes more information corresponding to the second notification than the unmodified graphical indication of the second notification. In other words, by including a second content portion within the graphical indication 300B in addition to the first content portion, the graphical indication 300B, the modified graphical indication, includes more information about the social media notification than the graphical indication 300A, the original graphical indication.
In this way, the display area of the display device in which the computing device 301 presents the graphical indication of the notification may be maximized to present the maximum amount of the plurality of graphical indications. The top-most graphical indication may be more useful to the user because the top-most graphical indication automatically includes more information about the respective notification than other graphical indications.
Fig. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating further example operations of a computing device according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The process of fig. 7 may be performed by one or more processors of a computing device, such as computing device 10 illustrated in fig. 1 and 2. For purposes of illustration only, fig. 7 is described below within the context of computing device 301 of fig. 6.
In the example of fig. 7, the computing device may output for display a graphical indication of a first notification that includes both the first content portion and the second content portion of the first notification and a graphical indication of a second notification that includes only the first content portion of the second notification (310). For example, a notification service module executing at computing device 301 may cause UI module 20 to output graphical indications 300A and 302A at UID 12 for display. The graphical indication 300A is presented in an expanded state and includes both a first content portion and a second content portion corresponding to the text message notification. Graphical indication 302A is presented in an unexpanded state and includes only a first portion of content corresponding to a social media post notification. Computing device 301 may present expanded graphical indication 300A in the top of the notification center graphical user interface over unexpanded graphical indication 302A.
The computing device may receive an indication of an input detected at a presence-sensitive input device that corresponds to a command to remove the first notification from display (320). For example, a user of computing device 301 may provide gesture 305 at a portion of UID 12 corresponding to a location at which UID 12 presents graphical indication 300A. The gesture 305 may be a swipe gesture and/or a gesture to select the graphical element 305 to clear the graphical indication 300A.
In the example of fig. 7, the computing device may cease outputting the graphical indication of the first notification for display (330). For example, notification service module 22 may receive information from UI module 20 regarding gesture 305 and determine to clear the text notification associated with graphical indication 300A based on the location within the information. Notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to update the presentation of the notification center graphical user interface by removing or avoiding the output of graphical indication 300A at UID 12.
The computing device may output a graphical indication of the second notification such that the graphical indication of the second notification includes a second content portion of the second notification in addition to the first content portion of the second notification (340). For example, in addition to clearing graphical indication 300A from UID 12, notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to automatically present graphical indication 302B at UID 12 at the top of the notification center graphical user interface in place of graphical indication 302A. In other words, notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to expand graphical indication 302A and present graphical indication 302B having, in addition to the first content portion, a second content portion corresponding to the social media post notification.
Fig. 8A and 8B are conceptual diagrams illustrating other example graphical indications of notifications according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Computing device 351 is one example of computing device 10 shown in fig. 1 and 2, and may include similar hardware and software components as included in computing device 10, such as UID 12, UI module 20, notification service module 22, and applications 24.
In accordance with techniques of this disclosure, a computing device may receive an indication of a notification. For example, one or more applications 24 may be executed at computing device 351. Some of the applications 24 executing at the computing device 351 may include a calendar application, an email application, a social media application, and a gaming application. Each of these applications may send a respective indication of a notification and/or an alert to notification service module 22.
The computing device 351 may output for display a notification graphical indication that includes content corresponding to the notification. For example, fig. 8A shows that notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to present expanded graphical indication 350A of the calendar notification at UID 12 of computing device 351. The expanded graphical indication 350A includes both a first content portion (e.g., a clock icon and summary meeting information) and a second content portion (e.g., a plurality of selectable graphical elements for performing functions related to calendar notifications). Notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to present unexpanded graphical indications 352A, 353A, and 354A associated with notifications from an email application, a social media application, and a gaming application, respectively. The unexpanded graphical indications 352A, 353A, and 354A include only the first portion of the content corresponding to their respective notifications. In this way, computing device 351 outputs, for display, automatically and without user intervention, an expanded graphical indication of a high priority notification and an unexpanded graphical indication of a low priority notification.
In some examples, computing device 351 may output a graphical indication of the notification within a region of the notification centric graphical user interface. For example, graphical indications 350A, 352A, 353A, and 354A may represent graphical indications of a notification center graphical user interface (e.g., shown in fig. 1 as notification center 16). Computing device 351 may determine, based at least in part on the priority level, an area in which to display the graphical indication of the notification centric graphical user interface. For example, the area of the notification center graphical user interface in which higher priority notifications are displayed may be at the top of the notification center graphical user interface, and the area of the notification center graphical user interface in which lower priority notifications are displayed may be below and/or in the lower portion of the top of the notification center graphical user interface. In other words, the notification center graphical user interface may include multiple regions and computing device 351 may determine to display a graphical indication within one of the multiple regions based at least in part on the priority level of the notification. For example, computing device 351 may output a high priority notification in one region and a low priority notification in a different region of the notification center graphical user interface.
In some examples, computing device 351 may receive an indication of the second notification and determine a priority level for the first notification based at least in part on the second notification. For example, notification service module 22 may determine a priority level for the notifications with respect to the context and attributes of each notification. In other words, notification service module 22 may first receive the email notification and determine that the priority level of the email notification is high (e.g., a value of ten). The notification service module may then receive the calendar notification and determine that the calendar notification has a higher priority level than the email notification. Notification service module 22 may reduce the priority level of the email notification to a value of seven and assign a priority level of ten to the calendar notification such that the calendar notification has a priority level higher than the email application.
In some examples, computing device 351 may determine a priority level of the second notification and determine the ranking of the first and second notifications based on their respective priority levels. For example, notification service module 22 may determine a ranking of notifications from the calendar application and the email application based on the priority level of each of the respective notifications. Notification service module 22 may determine the ranking of the highest priority notification ranked first and the lowest priority notification ranked last. For example, the ranking of the two notifications may range from first to second, with calendar notifications ranked first and email notifications ranked second.
The computing device 351 may output, for display, within the notification centric graphical user interface, a graphical indication of the first notification and a graphical indication of the second notification, wherein the graphical indications of the first and second notifications are displayed within respective regions of the notification centric graphical user interface based at least in part on the ranking. In other words, fig. 8A shows notification service module 22 ranking graphical indications 350A, 352A in ranking order, with the graphical indication of the first ranked notification (e.g., graphical indication 350A) presented in the region of UID 12 above the region of UID 12 that includes the graphical indication of the next ranked notification (e.g., graphical indication 3502).
In some examples, where the content of the graphical indication includes only the first portion of content, computing device 351 may receive an indication of an input detected at a presence-sensitive input device and modify, based at least in part on the input, the graphical indication of the notification to include a second portion of content corresponding to the notification in addition to the first portion of content corresponding to the notification. For example, notification service module 22 may determine that the priority level of the email application does not satisfy the priority threshold and cause UI module 20 to present graphical indication 352A at UID 12. The graphical indication 352A includes only the first portion of content of the corresponding email notification (e.g., the number of new emails received by the electronic application). Although notification service module 22 does not automatically expand graphical indication 352A, the user may manually expand graphical indication 352A to include a second portion of content corresponding to the email notification by providing gesture 356.
In some examples, the notification is an abstract notification that includes a respective indication of each of the plurality of notifications. In response to determining that the priority level associated with the summary notification satisfies the priority threshold, the computing device 351 can determine that the content of the summary notification includes the respective first content portion associated with each of the plurality of notifications and modify the graphical indication of the summary notification to include the respective first content portion associated with each of the plurality of notifications.
For example, an email notification received by notification service module 22 may be an indication of a summary electronic statement notification that actually includes content indicating multiple indications of individual email notifications (e.g., notifications of four emails received by an email application that generated the notification). Each of the four separate email notifications within the summary email notification may include a respective first and/or second content portion that computing device 351 may present at UID 12. Fig. 8B shows that after expanding graphical indication 352A of fig. 8A corresponding to the first content portion of the summary email notification, notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to present graphical indication 352B at UID 12, which includes the first content portion of each of the respective four email notifications.
Fig. 9 is a flow diagram illustrating other example operations of a computing device according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The process of fig. 9 may be performed by one or more processors of a computing device, such as computing device 10 illustrated in fig. 1 and 2. For purposes of illustration only, fig. 9 is described below within the context of computing device 351 of fig. 8A-8B.
In the example of fig. 9, the computing device may receive an indication of a notification (360). For example, notification service module 22 of computing device 351 may receive a calendar notification or information indicative of such a notification (e.g., a message, flag, etc. indicating to notification service module 22 that the calendar application has generated a notification) from a calendar application executing at computing device 351.
In the example of fig. 9, the computing device may determine a priority level associated with the notification (370). For example, notification service module 22 of computing device 351 may determine that the notifications received from the calendar application generally represent high priority notifications. Notification service module 22 may determine that the priority level of the calendar notification is high (e.g., has a value of ten).
In the example of fig. 9, the computing device may determine content corresponding to the notification based at least in part on the priority level (380). For example, notification service module 22 of computing device 351 may determine that a priority level associated with the calendar notification satisfies a priority threshold. In response to determining that the priority level associated with the calendar notification satisfies the priority threshold, notification service module 22 may determine that the content corresponding to the calendar notification includes both a first content portion (e.g., a clock icon, text of the calendar notification, etc.) corresponding to the calendar notification and a second content portion (e.g., one or more selectable graphical elements for performing notification-related functions) corresponding to the calendar notification.
In the example of fig. 9, the computing device may output for display a notification graphical indication that includes content corresponding to the notification (390). For example, notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to present a notification center graphical user interface at UID 12. Notification service module 22 may cause UI module 20 to present graphical indication 352A that includes both the first and second content portions of the calendar notification within graphical indication 352A. In this way, computing device 351 may automatically present an expanded graphical indication of a high priority notification and collapse a graphical indication of a low priority notification.
In some examples, the operations may include receiving, by a computing device, an indication of a notification, determining, by the computing device, a priority level associated with the notification, and determining, by the computing device, content of the notification based at least in part on the priority level. In response to receiving the indication of the gesture detected at the input device, the operations may further include outputting, by the computing device and for display, a notification centric graphical user interface that includes a graphical indication of the notification, the graphical indication including content of the notification.
In response to determining that the priority level associated with the notification does not satisfy the priority threshold, the operations may further include determining, by the computing device, to output only the first content portion of the notification. In response to determining that the priority level associated with the notification satisfies the priority threshold, the operations may further include determining, by the computing device, to output both the first portion and the second portion of the content of the notification.
In some examples, the notification may be a summary notification that includes a respective indication of each of the plurality of notifications. In response to determining that the priority level associated with at least one of the plurality of notifications satisfies the priority threshold, the operations may include determining, by the computing device, that the content of the summary notification includes a respective first content portion associated with each of the plurality of notifications, and modifying, by the computing device, the graphical indication of the summary notification to include the respective first content portion associated with each of the plurality of notifications.
In some examples, in response to determining that the priority level associated with the notification satisfies the priority threshold, the operations may include outputting, by the computing device and for display, a graphical indication of the notification within an upper portion of the notification centric graphical user interface. In some examples, the operations may include outputting, by the computing device and for display at a presence-sensitive screen, a notification center graphical user interface, wherein the presence-sensitive screen includes an input device, and wherein the gesture is detected at the presence-sensitive screen.
In some examples, the operations may include receiving, by a computing device, an indication of a first notification and an indication of a second notification, determining, by the computing device, a respective priority level associated with each of the first and second notifications, and determining, by the computing device, respective content of each of the first and second notifications based on the respective priority levels of the first and second notifications. The operations may also include outputting, by the computing device and for display, a notification center graphical user interface including a respective graphical indication of each of the first and second notifications, the graphical indication of the first notification including content of the first notification and the graphical indication of the second notification including content of the second notification.
In some examples, in response to determining that the respective priority level of the first notification exceeds the respective priority level of the second notification, the operations may include outputting, by the computing device and for display within the notification center graphical user interface, a graphical indication of the second notification under the graphical indication of the first notification. In some examples, the graphical indication of the first notification may include both the first content portion and the second content portion of the first notification and the graphical indication of the second notification may include only the first content portion of the second notification.
In some examples, the operations may include receiving, by the computing device, an indication of an input detected at the input device, the input corresponding to a command to clear the first notification, and in response to receiving the input, ceasing to output, by the computing device and for display, the graphical indication of the first notification. The operations may also include modifying, by the computing device, the graphical indication of the second notification to include a second portion of content of the second notification in addition to the first portion of content.
