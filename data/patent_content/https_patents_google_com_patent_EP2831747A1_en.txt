Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to sending communications to contacts on a social networking service.
- internet-based social networks provide a digital medium for users to interact with one another and to share information.
- users are able to distribute electronic content (e.g., textual comments, digital images, digital videos, digital audio, hyperlinks to Web sites, etc.) to other users that they might be connected with in the social network.
- Electronic content that is distributed to a user can be displayed to the user in a content stream in a home (or "stream") page.
- This disclosure describes techniques for sending communications to contacts on a social networking service.
- An example technique includes receiving a target geographical location of a computing device, identifying a vicinity based on the target geographical location, using the vicinity to identify a set of contacts associated with an account on a social networking service, where the set of contacts are used to produce a contact list that excludes one or more contacts that are not associated with locations within the vicinity, and sending a communication to members of the contact list, where the communication relates to the target geographical location.
- the foregoing example technique may include one or more of the following features, taken either alone or in combination.
- identifying the set of contacts may include searching for words associated with the vicinity among contacts and selecting contacts who have the words associated with the vicinity.
- Receiving the target geographical location may include retrieving the target geographical location from an index that is accessible through the social networking service.
- Receiving the target geographical location may include obtaining a current location of the computing device from a geo-iocation service and correlating the current location to the target geographical location.
- Receiving the target geographical location may include consulting a database including check-in information, where the check-in information includes a current location of the computing device that corresponds to the target geographical location.
- the foregoing example technique may include refining membership of the contact list based, at least in part, on a social graph of a user associated with the computing device, identifying the vicinit may include identifying a subject matter of the communication, and searching a database for a vicinit that corresponds to the subject matter.
- the set of contacts may include members of the social networking service who are known to be in a vicinity of the target geographical location.
- Another example technique includes defining a group of contacts in a social networking service, where the group of contacts are defined based on geography; obtaining a target location of a computing device, where the target location is defined by a name associated with the target location; using the target location to obtain a set of contacts associated with an account on a social networking service, where the set of contacts are used to produce a contact list that includes the group of contacts; and sending a communication to the contact list, where the communication relates to the target location.
- the foregoing example technique may include one or more of the following features, taken either alone or in combination.
- Obtaining the target location may include retrieving the target location from a profile that is accessible through the social networking service.
- Obtaining the target location may include obtaining a current location of the computing device using a geo-location service and correlating the current location to the target location.
- the communication may relate to an event at the target location.
- Ail or part of the systems and techniques described herein may be implemented as a computer program product that includes instructions that are stored on one or more non-transitory machine-readable storage media, and that are executable on one or more processing devices. All or part of the systems and techniques described herein may be implemented as an apparatus, method, or electronic system that may include one or more processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to implement the stated functions. [0012] The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

- the system uses the target location to identify a list of social contacts associated with an account on the social networking service.
- the contact list excludes one or more contacts that are not within a predefined vicinity of the target location.
- the system sends an electronic communication to contacts on the contact list.
- the communication may relate to an event that is associated with the target location.
- identifying contacts by location name it is possible to identify contacts within a particular area that are actually able to participate, e.g., in an event.
- the communication may be limited to those contacts, thereby sparing other social contacts from receiving communications for events that they would not likely be able to attend, or other things in which they would not likely participate.

- information associated with the user's social graph may be indexed by generating and incorporating suitable data structures, e.g., social restricts, into an existing search index.
- the indexing engine may generate social restricts by mapping identified information to
- the system may access a relationship lookup table that includes relationship data describing a user's social graph to determine such social connections, in some examples, social restricts may be provided in the form of an information tag or other data associated with a referenced Web resource included in the search index.
- User-generated content may be included in a same index as other resources or in a separate index, as noted above, in this regard, with appropriate permission, crawling engine 319 may crawl user-generated content (of both a searcher and others, e.g., members of the searcher's social graph), and indexing engine 313 may incorporate that content into an appropriate search index.
- Resource locator engine 318 may identify that user-generated content, including user profiles and other user-specific information (where
- an author is not limited to one who created the content, but may include, e.g., anyone who interacted with the content, shared the content, endorsed the content, posted the content, and so forth.
- search engine 318 may access indexed cache 314 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query.
- Resource locator engine 316 may identify resources in the form of search results and return the search results to a requesting device in search results pages.
- a search result may include data generated by search system 312 that identifies a resource, and may include the resource itself or a link to the resource, along with images, video, or other appropriate content.
- the search results may include social information. For example, included with some of the search results may be, e.g., a member's location, comments, endorsements, or other information obtained about the member from a user's social graph.

- relevant social information e.g., a link to a content author's profile. Search results may be used in the manner described herein to target messages to contacts in a vicinity.
- a social graph is a way to represent sociai
- connections between two parties may, or may not, be on the same social network, and to represent connections between parties and content
- a party may be an individual or an entity, e.g., a company, organization, country, or the like.
- Types of connections in social graphs may include, but are not limited to, other users to which a user is in direct contact (e.g., user messaging or chat contact, direct contacts on social sites) and users to which the user is in indirect contact (e.g., contacts of contacts, connections of users that have a direct connection to the user).
- a direct connection may be unilateral or bilateral
- a social graph includes content generated by individuals (e.g., blog posts, reviews) as connections to the user.
- the sociai graph may include
- Distinct social graphs may be generated for different types of connections. For example, a user may be connected with chat contacts in one social graph, electronic message contacts in a second social graph, and connections from a particular sociai network in a third social graph.
- a sociai graph may include edges to additional parties at greater degrees of separation from the user.
- an electronic message contact may have its own electronic message contacts to others adding a degree of separation from the user (e.g.,
- Distinct social graphs may include edges connecting one or more social graph io one or more other social graphs.
- a social graph may include full social graph may include several different types of interconnected but distinct social graphs.
- users may designate content as endorsed, share or comment on content, quote URLs, or otherwise indicate an interest or liking of content, examples of which include, but are not limited to, a particular resource, Web page, or search result.
- an application, widget, or scripting may be provided in search results pages, Web pages, or within a browser application that allows a user to indicate liking, sharing, or other evaluation of an associated resource or search result.
- the user may mark the particular resource, Web site, or search results to indicate endorsement or other evaluation (e.g., through a browser control or user interface element presented with the associated content).
- Such relationships to information from others may be captured in a user's social graph.
- affinity may identify the closeness of a party to a user. For example, a contact of a contact who has five common middle contacts with the user has more of an affinity with the user (e.g., is considered closer to the user) than a contact of a contact who has only one common middle contact.
- Factors in determining affinity may include, e.g.: how a contact is connected to the user (e.g., a source of a connection), which social networking site the contact is a member of, whether contact or contact of contact, and how man paths to get to the contact of a contact (e.g., common middle contacts).
- Edges may be weighted, either in a database containing the social graph or elsewhere, to reflect a level of affinity between connections (e.g., parties) in the social graph.
- Affinity between parties may be content specific in some cases.
- social graph data may identify specific types of content associated with an edge between parties and specific affinities for that content.
- the social graph data may specify that, between two connected parties, the first party has a first level of affinity for the second party's videos and a second, different level of affinity for the second party's written work.
- the social graph may specify that the second party has a third, different level of affinity for the first party's biogs.
- the social graph data may specify that, between two connected parties, the first party has a first level of affinity for the second party's content about baseball and a second, different level of affinity for the second party's content about basketball.
- Affinity may also be based on the user's interactions with members of the social graph (e.g., the frequency of interaction, the type of interaction, and so forth). For example, a user that frequently clicks on posts by a particular contact may be considered to be closer to that contact than to other contacts where they click on respective posts less frequently. Likewise, if a user frequently "mouses- over" content by an author (e.g., a search result link), but does not select that content, the degree of affinity may be less than if the link were selected.
- an amount of time viewing content may be an indicator that one party likes content from another party. The amount of time viewing particular content may be an indication that one party likes that particular type of content from the other party, as opposed to other types of content from the other party.
- affinity may be defined b indirect interaction between users. For example, if two users interact with the same content regularly or frequently, those two users may be considered to have an affinity with one other, in stiil other examples, if two users interact with the same people regularly or frequently, those two users may be considered to have an affinity with one other.
- Fig. 4 is a conceptual view of an example social graph 400.
- Fig. 4 shows sources of information for a social graph.
- the user's social graph is a collection of connections (e.g., users, resources/content, etc.) identified as having a relationship to the user 402 ("ME") within some degree of separation.
- the user's social graph may include parties and particular content at different degrees of separation.
- the social graph of a user may include contacts, contacts of contacts (e.g., as defined by a user, social graphing site, or other metric), the user's social circle, people followed by the user (e.g., subscribed blogs, feeds, or Web sites), co-workers, and other specifically identified content of interest to the user (e.g., particular Web sites).
- contacts e.g., as defined by a user, social graphing site, or other metric
- the user's social circle e.g., people followed by the user (e.g., subscribed blogs, feeds, or Web sites), co-workers, and other specifically identified content of interest to the user (e.g., particular Web sites).
- Fig. 4 shows that it is possible to extend the user's social graph to people and content both within a single network and across one or more external networks.
- the user may have a profile or contacts list that includes a set of identified contacts, a set of interests, a set of links to external resources (e.g., Web pages), and subscriptions to content of a system (e.g., a system that provides various content and applications including electronic messages, chat, video, photo albums, feeds, or blogs).
- blogs that include links to a user's contacts may be part of the user's social graph.
- These groups may be connected to other users or resources at another degree of separation from the user.
- contacts of the user may have their own profiles that include connections to resources as well as contacts of the respective contacts, a set of interests, and so forth, in another example, a user may be connected to a social network account That social network account may reference an article in a newspaper, A social connection, therefore, may be established between the user and the author of the article.
- the connections to a user within a specified number of degrees of separation may be considered the bounds of the social graph of a user. Membership and degree of separation in the social graph may be based on other factors, including a frequency of interaction. For example, a frequency of interaction may be by the user (e.g., how often the user visits a particular social networking site) or it may be a type of interaction (e.g., endorsing, selecting, or not selecting items associated with contacts). As interactions change, the relationship of a particular contact in the social graph may also dynamically change. Thus, the social graph may be dynamic rather than static.
- Social signals may be layered over the social graph (e.g., using weighted edges or other weights between connections in the social graph). These signals, for example, frequency of interaction or type of interaction between the user and a particular connection, may be used to weight particular connections in the social graph or social graphs without modifying the actual social graph connections. These weights may change as the interaction with the user changes.
- Social graphs may be stored using suitable data structures (e.g., list or matrix type data structures).
- Information describing an aspect of a stored social graph may be considered relationship data.
- relationship data may include information describing how particular members of a user's social graph are connected to a user (e.g., through what social path is a particular entity connected to the user). Relationship data may also include information describing social signals incorporated in the user's social graph.
- relationship data may be stored in a relationship lookup table (e.g., a hash table).
- Suitable keys for locating values (e.g., relationship data) within the lookup table may include information describing the identities of both a user and a member of the user's social graph.
- a suitable key for locating relationship data within the lookup table may be (User X, User Y), where User Y is a member of User X's social graph.
- Social graph information may be indexed for use in information retrieval.
- the social graph information may be part of a search index in the indexed cache 314 of Fig. 3.
- the search index may be searched to identify relevant search results that are dependent upon social signals, e.g., that are associated with one or more aspects of a user's social graph, examples of which are provided above.
- a search system may receive a query and identify, e.g., general search results and user-generated content.
- the user-generated content may include, e.g., search results based on the indexed social graph information (e.g., content from electronic messages, posts, blogs, chats, etc. of members of the searcher's social graph).
- the indexed social graph information may be updated intermittently or periodically, for example, to include recently added information associated with the user's social graph (e.g., a user's current location, past location, future location, etc).
- the indexed social graph information may also be updated, e.g., on an on-going basis to reflect relationships determined in accordance with the processes described herein.
- a user may prevent addition of members to the user's social graph, e.g., using an option or by keeping contacts out of particular groups used to generate the social graph.
- privacy features provide a user with an option to allow or to prevent, respectively, being included (or remove the user if already included) as a member of another's social graph.
- users may have control over what personal information or connection information, if existing, is included in their social graphs and, consequently, that is included in the content streams and search results described herein.
- mobile device 1 10 is located in Boston, Massachusetts.
- a global positioning system (GPS) incorporated into, and used with, mobile device 1 10 identifies the current location of mobile device 1 10 using geographic coordinates.
- the GPS may also provide the place name of the current location of mobile device 1 10, in this example, Boston.
- a system other than the GPS may correlate the geographic coordinates to the place name.
- assisted GPS such as Cell Trianguiation
- the IP address of a device may be used to determine approximated geographical location, using IPGeo services.
- identifiers may be used to augment the place names. For example, ZIP codes or area codes may be used to augment an actual name. In some implementations, such identifiers may be used instead of actual place names.
- a name associated with the mobile device's current location (e.g., Boston) is used to identify contacts or other contacts in a user's social network that may be at, or within the vicinity of, that location.
- the identity of the user and the name of the device's current geographic locations may be input as one or more search queries to search engine 318.
- Search engine 318 in particular, resource locator engine 318, may search index 314 to identify (i) sociai contacts of the user, and (ii) information about those social contacts, including their geographic location by name.
- search engine 318 determines that the name of a contact's geographic location matches the name of the user's current location, then the user and the contact(s) are deemed to be at the same location and, as described be!ow, a message can be sent to that contact.
- place names may not match even though two places are close geographically. For example, Boston and Cambridge are close geographically. However, a simple name search may not produce a match for Boston and Cambridge. Accordingly, a data engine 322 in server system 1 12 may resolve a location name into its geographic coordinates or other geographic identifier(s) (e.g., area code, ZIP code, or the like). Those geographic coordinates may be used to identify other areas (e.g., towns, cities, neighborhoods, ZIP codes, etc.) that are within a specified distance of the location name.
- geographic coordinates e.g., area code, ZIP code, or the like.
- index 314 may be searched to identify contacts of the user who are at, or live at, locations whose names match any names within that group.
- members' current locations may be identified (with permission) through geo-location of the members' mobile devices or by referencing a service that allows mobile device users to check-in to locations at particular times. Members may be given the opportunity to enable or disable these services.
- a vicinity's boundaries may be set by the mobile device user (e.g., in their sociai network profile) or they may be set automatically b the social networking service, in some implementations, the boundary of a vicinity may be keyed to the subject of a message.
- a message regarding an event in Boston such as a Boston city council meeting
- search engine 318 may identify the subject of the message, and limit the boundary of the vicinity to Boston only.
- a Red Sox game may be of interest to ail social contacts within the Boston area, including, e.g., Boston, Cambridge, Somervii!e, the North Short, Cape Cod, etc.
- data engine 322 and search engine 318 may identify the subject of the message and expand the boundary of the vicinity to include ail place names that are in eastern Massachusetts or beyond, depending upon the settings.
- data engine 322 may identify the subject matter of a message by parsing the message to identify key words for use in searching.
- the parsing may be performed using appropriate techniques. Words obtained through the parsing may be compared to subjects stored in a database, either inside or, or outside of, the social network 123, to thereby determine if the message relates to those subjects. The comparison may be made by keyword or other appropriate techniques.
- the database may correlate events or other occurrences to appropriate vicinities.
- the database may specify that some events, such as a Red Sox game, have a vicinity of one size (e.g., all towns to the east of Springfield, MA), whereas other events, such as Boston-specific meetings, have a vicinity of another size (e.g., only the cit of Boston proper).
- some events such as a Red Sox game
- other events such as Boston-specific meetings
- have a vicinity of another size e.g., only the cit of Boston proper.
- the database may be populated, e.g., based on past actions of the user or based on past actions of other members of the social network. For example, the system may identify a threshold number of previous messaging requests relating to the "Red Sox", and determine an appropriate vicinity based on vicinities specified in prior messages by other members of the social network. The database may similarly be populated based on actions of the user himself or herself (e.g., based on past messaging operations relating to the topic "Red Sox").
- the system may identify a threshold number of previous messaging requests relating to the "Red Sox" by the user, and determine an appropriate vicinity based on vicinities specified in prior messages by the user, in other implementations, the user may specify, directly, the vicinities to which a message subject is to be sent, in some implementations, the target vicinity may be based on the user's current location. For example if it is determined that the user's current location is Boston, then the target vicinity may be eastern Massachusetts. On the other hand, if it is determined that the user's location is Seattle, and there is a Red Sox game in Seattle that evening, then the target location may be towns, cities, areas, and so forth proximate to Seattle. The vicinity, in this case, may be determined by identifying the current location as "Seattle", and referencing a database for towns, cities, and other areas that are predefined for that user as being within the vicinity of Seattle.
- the user of mobile device 1 10 may send a message, e.g., through social network 123, only to contacts who are determined to be within the vicinity of the user at present. So, for example, user 130 may be in Boston and plan to attend a Red Sox game that evening. User 130 may use the processes described herein to identify social contacts who are in or around Boston or appropriate other towns of Massachusetts. A message inviting social contacts to that particular Red Sox game may thus be directed only to those contacts who are in or around Boston or appropriate other towns of Massachusetts. In some cases, the member ma establish a social circle that includes contacts who are in or around Boston or appropriate other towns of Massachusetts, and send messages only to the contacts in that social circle. In either case, contacts or other users who have no connection to Boston or its vicinity, will not be sent the message since, presumably, they would not be in a position to attend the Red Sox game that evening,
- the amount of message traffic in the social networking service may be reduced. Furthermore, the user's contacts who have no connection to Boston are spared receiving messages that may not be relevant to them (e.g., a message to attend a sporting event in a city that they could not possibly reach in time).
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing a process 500, such as that described conceptually with respect to Fig. 1 , which may be performed by search engine 318 and data engine 322 in the network environment shown in Figs. 1 and 3.
- a message is received (501 ), e.g., from mobile device 1 10.
- data engine 322 may receive the message. That message is directed to contacts in the mobile device user's social network.
- the message may include, e.g., one or more fields indicating to which contacts the message is directed.
- the message may indicate that it is to be directed to contacts in the same city, neighborhood, or area as the user.
- the message may specify one or more place names, e.g., Boston, Cambridge, Newton, etc.
- the message ma contain no such information, and process 500 ma determine to which contacts to direct the message based on the subject of the message, as described herein.
- the location of mobile device 1 10 is obtained (502). This operation need not be performed if the message states that the mobile device users wants to send a message to contacts in the vicinity of a particular location, e.g. , Boston. If, however, the message simply requests that that a message be sent to users in a vicinity of the mobile device user or does not specify a recipient(s), process 500 may obtain (502) a location of the mobile device user, !n this regard, the mobile device may be equipped with software to communicate with a GPS (or other) system, thereby enabling the GPS (or other) system to determine the location of the mobile device. Process 500 may receive the coordinates periodically or with the received (501 ) message, or process 500 may have access to a database containing the coordinates.
- process 500 may have access to check-in information, which may identify the current location of the mobile device by geographic coordinates or place name.
- process 500 e.g., data engine 322
- process 500 may correlate those geographic coordinates to one or more place names.
- Process 500 may perform the correlation using a local database or a remote sei'vice available on network 1 1 1.
- the locations of contacts of the mobile device user on social network 123 are obtained (503).
- This information may be obtained, e.g., by searching the user's social graph in search index 314.
- the information may be available in social contact profiles.
- any appropriate content from the user's social graph may be searched, provided the owners of such content have provided appropriate permission.
- the information may include, e.g., the residence address of each contact, the current location of each contact, and other similar information. If the current locations of contacts are not available from their profiles, process 500 may use other location information from the profiles. Also, to the extent thai process 500 has access to current geo-location information or check-in information for those contacts, process 500 may identify the place names of the current location of those contacts in the manner described above.
- Contacts who are in a target location are identified (504).
- search engine 318 may output a list of contacts who are, e.g., currently in a specified vicinity of the current location of the mobile device user or who live within that specified vicinity (as determined, e.g., by searching index 314).
- data engine 322 may consult a database based, e.g., on the content of the initial message. That database may specify the extent of the vicinity in which to search for contacts.
- Information from that database may be incorporated into the search query and used to identify social contacts of the user who are in a specified vicinity.
- information from the user's social graph may be used to refine the list of contacts who are identified (504). For example, comments, endorsements, connections, affinities, and so forth that relate to the subject matter of (e.g., key words from) the message may be searched to identify members of the user's social graph in the predefined vicinity who have an interest in the subject of the message. For example, the user's social graph ma be searched to identify contacts within the vicinity who have a particular affinity (e.g., within one or two nodes of the social graph) and who comment on, post, or are otherwise interested in the Red Sox.
- a particular affinity e.g., within one or two nodes of the social graph
- a message is sent (505) to contacts in the contact iist only, and not to other contacts, for whom the message wili not likely be relevant.
- identities of contacts in the contact list are provided to a messaging service by the search engine (either directly or through interaction with the user), and appropriate messages are formatted, and sent.
- At least some of the foregoing operations may be performed automatically (e.g., without user interaction).
- a user may send a message, such as "Meet me at the Red Sox game tonight", without specifying a target vicinity or recipients of the message.
- Process 500 may identify the subject of the message, identify members of the user's social graph in the vicinity of Boston who have an interest in sports, the Red Sox, baseball, etc., and automatically format and send a message to those users.
- the message may be a predefined type of message (e.g., a content stream post, an e-mail, an instant message, etc.), or the system may identify preferred method of communication for each person on the contact list and send the appropriate type of message. This information may be obtained, e.g., by searching the members' social graphs, profiles, or other database(s) available to the social network.
- process 500 may be configured to identify the name of an event, to identify contacts within a vicinity of that event based on the name of the event, and to message onl those contacts within the vicinity of the event.
- the processing described above may be used in this case, with event names (e.g., the Rolling Stones at Fenway Park) substituted for place names (e.g., Boston). However, the processing is substantially similar to that described above.
- the system described herein may also include obtaining the location of many computing devices linked to many social networking users. For example, if a user is going to a Red Sox game, and the system finds that the user is on
- Lansdowne Street (a street near Fenway Park)
- the system will look for other users who have most recently been geo-located in the area of Lansdowne Street, or whose most recent check-in to a social network was in that area.
- the system may then send messages to those users in the manner described herein.
