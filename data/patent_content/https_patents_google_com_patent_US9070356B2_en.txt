- a i and b i are a set of respective weighting coefficients for iteration i.
- the effect of coefficients a i and b i can be to produce a weighted sum of the inverse and backward filtered target vectors, which can then form the set of pre-quantizer candidate vectors.
- Embodiments of the present disclosure can allow various coefficient functions to be incorporated into the weighting of the normalized vectors in Eq. 23.

- U.S. Pat. No. 5,754,976 to Adoul and U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,960 to Peng disclose coding methods that use unit magnitude pulse codebooks that are algebraic in nature. That is, the codebooks are generated on the fly, as opposed to being stored in memory, searching various pulse position and amplitude combinations, finding a low error pulse combination, and then coding the positions and amplitudes using combinatorial techniques to form a codeword k that is subsequently used by a decoder to regenerate c k and further generate an approximation of the input signal s(n).
- the codebook disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,960 can be used to quantify the weighted signal into a form that can be utilized by the particular FCB coding process.
- the i-th pre-quantizer candidate c k [i] may be obtained from Eq. 22 by iteratively adjusting a gain term g Q as:
- This expression describes a process of selecting g Q such that the total number of unit amplitude pulses in c k [i] equals M.
- a median search based quantization method may be employed. This can be an iterative process involving finding an optimum pulse configuration satisfying the pulse sum constraint for a given gain and then finding an optimum gain for the optimum pulse configuration.
- a practical example of such a median search based quantization is given in ITU-T Recommendation G.718 entitled “Frame error robust narrow-band and wideband embedded variable bit-rate coding of speech and audio from 8-32 kbit/s”, section 6.11.6.2.4, pp. 153, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
- the N different pre-quantizer candidates may then be evaluated according to the following expression (which is based on Eq. 17):
- i * arg ⁇ ⁇ max 0 ⁇ i ⁇ N ⁇ ⁇ ( d 2 T ⁇ c k [ i ] ) 2 c k [ i ] ⁇ T ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ c k [ i ] ⁇ , ( 29 ) where c k [i] can be substituted for c k , and the best candidate i* out of N candidates can be selected. Alternatively, i* may be determined through brute force computation:
- y 2 [i] Hc k [i] and can be the i-th pre-quantizer candidate filtered though the zero state weighted synthesis filter 105 .
- the latter method may be used for complexity reasons, especially when the number of non-zero positions in the pre-quantizer candidate, c k [i] , is relatively high or when the different pre-quantizer candidates have very different pulse locations. In those cases, the efficient search techniques described in the prior art do not necessarily hold.
- a post-search may be conducted to refine the pulse positions, and/or the signs, so that the overall weighted error is reduced further.
- the post-search may be one described by Eq. 29.
- the remaining pulses can be placed by the post search.
- the pre-quantizer stage may place more pulses than allowed by the FCB configuration.
- the post search may remove pulses in a way that attempts to minimize the weighted error.
- the number of pulses can be high enough where a post search is not needed since the pre-quantizer candidates can provide adequate quality for a particular application. In one embodiment, however, the number of pulses in the pre-quantizer vector can be generally equal to the number of pulses allowed by a particular FCB configuration.
- the post search may involve removing a unit magnitude pulse from one position and placing the pulse at a different location that results in a lower weighted error. This process may be repeated until the codebook converges or until a predetermined maximum number of iterations is reached.
- the candidate codebook for generating c k [i] may be different than the codebook for generating c k . That is, the best candidate c k [i*] may generally be used to reduce complexity or improve overall performance of the resulting code-vector c k , by using c k [i*] as a means for determining the best inverse function ⁇ (x 2 ,i*), and then proceeding to use ⁇ (x 2 ,i*) as a means for searching a second codebook c′ k .
- Such an example may include using a Factorial Pulse Coded (FPC) codebook for generating c k [i*] , and then using a traditional ACELP codebook to generate c′ k , wherein the inverse function ⁇ (x 2 ,i*) is used in the secondary codebook search c′ k , and the candidate code-vectors c k [i] are discarded.
- FPC Factorial Pulse Coded
- a traditional ACELP codebook to generate c′ k
- the pre-selection of pulse signs for the secondary codebook c′ k may be based on a plurality of inverse functions ⁇ (x 2 ,i), and not directly on the candidate code-vectors c k [i] .
- This embodiment may allow performance improvement to existing codecs that use a specific codebook design, while maintaining interoperability and backward compatibility.
- the ACB/FCB parameters may be jointly optimized.
- the joint optimization can also be used for evaluation of N pre-quantizer candidates.
- Eq. 29 can become:
- y 2 [i] Hc k [i] can be the i-th pre-quantizer candidate filtered though the zero state weighted synthesis filter 105 and y T c k [i] can be a correlation between the i-th pre-quantizer candidate and the scaled backward filtered ACB excitation.

Abstract
Description
E(z)=W(z)(S(z)−{circumflex over (S)}(z)). (1)
E(z)=S w(z)−H(z)(βC τ(z)+γC k(z)). (3)
e=s w −H(βc τ +γc k)−h zir, (4)
-
- H is the L×L zero-state weighted synthesis convolution matrix formed from an impulse response of a weighted synthesis filter h(n), such as
synthesis filters 815 and 805, and corresponding to a transfer function Hzs(z) or H(z), which matrix can be represented as:
- H is the L×L zero-state weighted synthesis convolution matrix formed from an impulse response of a weighted synthesis filter h(n), such as
-
- hzir is a L×1 zero-input response of H(z) that is due to a state from a previous speech input subframe,
- sw is the L×1 perceptually weighted input signal,
- β is the scalar adaptive codebook (ACB) gain,
- cτ is the L×1 ACB code-vector indicated by index τ,
- γ is the scalar fixed codebook (FCB) gain, and
- ck is the L×1 FCB code-vector indicated by index k.
e=x w −βHc τ −γHc k. (6)
ε=∥e∥ 2 =∥x w −βHc τ −γHc k∥2. (7)
Note that ∥e∥2 may also be written as ∥e∥2=Σn=0 L-1e2(n) or ∥e∥2=eTe, where eT is the vector transpose of e, and is presumed to be a column vector.
ε=∥x w −βHc τ∥2 =x w T x w−2βx w T Hc τ+β2 c τ T H T Hc τ. (8)
where τ* is an optimal ACB index parameter, that is, an ACB index parameter that minimizes the bracketed expression. Typically, τ is a parameter related to a range of expected values of the pitch lag (or fundamental frequency) of the input signal, and is constrained to a limited set of values that can be represented by a relatively small number of bits. Since xw is not dependent on τ, Equation 11 can be rewritten as follows:
and likewise, Equation 10 can be simplified to:
ε=∥x 2 −γHc k∥2. (15)
where γHck is a filtered and weighted version of FCB code-vector ck, that is, FCB code-vector ck filtered by zero state weighted synthesis filter Hzs(z) 805 and then weighted based on FCB
where k* is an optimal FCB index parameter, that is, an FCB index parameter that maximizes the bracketed expression. By grouping terms that are not dependent on k, that is, by letting d2 T=x2 TH and Φ=HTH, Equation 16 can be simplified to:
in which the optimal FCB gain γ is given as:
described below, or can be other inverse weighting functions described below. Additionally, the
ε=∥x 2 −γHc k∥2, (15)(19)
if the FCB code-vector is given as:
then the error ε can tend to zero and the input signal s(n) and a corresponding coded output signal ŝ(n) can be identical. Since this is not practical for low rate speech coding systems, only a crude approximation of Eq. 20 is typically generated. U.S. Pat. No. 5,754,976 to Adoul, hereby incorporated by reference, discloses one example of the usage of the inverse filtered target signal r=H−1x2 as a method for low bit rate pre-selection of the pulse amplitudes of the code-vector ck.
where QP{ } is a P-bit quantization operator, does not generally lead to the global minimum weighted error since the error due to QP{ } is a residual domain error. In order to achieve the lowest possible error in the weighted domain, many iterations of ck may be necessary to minimize the error ε of Eq. 19. Various embodiments of the present disclosure described below can address this problem by reducing the iterations and by reducing the residual domain error.
c k [i] =Q P{ƒ(x 2 ,i)}, 0≦i<N, (22)
where ƒ(x2,i) can be some function of the target vector, and N can be the number of pre-quantizer candidates. This expression can be a generalized form for generating a plurality of pre-quantizer candidates that can be assessed for error in the weighted domain. An example of such a function is given as:
a i=1−i/(N−1),
b i =i/(N−1), 0≦i<N, (24)
where N is the total number of pre-quantizer candidates, can have a linear distribution of values. As an example, if N=4, the sets of coefficients can be: ai ε{1.0, 0.667, 0.333, 0.0}, and bi ε{0.0, 0.333, 0.667, 1.0}. Another example may incorporate the results of a training algorithm, such as the Linde-Buzo-Gray (or LBG) algorithm, where many values of a and b can be evaluated offline using a training database, and then choosing ai and bi based on the statistical distributions. Such methods for training are well known in the art. Other functions can also be possible. For example, the following function may be found to be beneficial for certain classes of signals:
ƒ(x 2 ,i)=a i r+b i r lpf, (25)
where rlpf can be a low pass filtered version of r. Alternatively, the LPF characteristic may be altered as a function of i:
ƒ(x 2 ,i)=B i r, (26)
where Bi may be a class of linear phase filtering characteristics intended to shape the residual domain quantization error in a way that more closely resembles that of the error in the weighted domain. Yet another method may involve specifying a family of inverse perceptual weighting functions that may also shape the error in a way that is beneficial in shaping the residual domain error:
ƒ(x 2 ,i)=H i −1 x 2, (27)
where the round( ) operator rounds the respective vector elements of gQƒ(x2,i) to the nearest integer value, where n represents the n-th element of vector ck [i], and M is the total number of unit magnitude pulses. This expression describes a process of selecting gQ such that the total number of unit amplitude pulses in ck [i] equals M.
where ck [i] can be substituted for ck, and the best candidate i* out of N candidates can be selected. Alternatively, i* may be determined through brute force computation:
where y2 [i]=Hck [i] and can be the i-th pre-quantizer candidate filtered though the zero state
where Φ′=Φ−yyT and where y can be a scaled backward filtered ACB excitation. Now i* may be determined through brute force computation:
where y2 [i]=Hck [i] can be the i-th pre-quantizer candidate filtered though the zero state
or other weighting described above.
