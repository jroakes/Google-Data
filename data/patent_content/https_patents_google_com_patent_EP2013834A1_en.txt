- one or more advertisement messages are selected. As discussed
- the advertising server may maintain a database of available advertisement messages, or simply a database of advertisers with one or more fields describing their product or service and identifying them by name and/or with contact information.
- the server may first determine which advertisers are available, that is not excluded based on price, exclusions, or relevancy, and then conduct an auction or other price matching process to maximize advertising revenue. In various embodiments, advertisers are not charged at this point in the process.
- an online replica website containing ad messages for the selected advertisers is created.
- the online replica website is specific to the requesting offline media source.
- the online replica website may include information identical to the actual ad copy appearing in the offline media source.
- the online replica website may include information that is merely similar to that in the actual ad copy to the extent that the same advertisers are represented.
- the actual ad copy may be created by the advertising server based on the advertisers selected and the information included in the request.
- a copy of the ad copy may be stored in a database at the server. The ad copy will preferably include the URL of the online replica website.
- the ad copy may be transferred from the advertising server to the requesting offline media source.

- the ad copy may be created either automatically, manually or through a combination of those techniques at the advertising server side.
- -13- ad copy may be created by the offline media source based on information supplied to the offline media source, such as the advertiser name, brief produc ⁇ service description and any corresponding graphics, logos, etc. as well as the URL of the online replica site for that offline media source.
- the ad copy or relevant information may be transferred to the offline media source by electronic means such as electronic mail, file transfer protocol or telnet, or may be transferred through conventional means such as by courier on an electronic storage media or even as a paper print out.
- the process ends in block 350.
- FIG. 4 a flow chart of an exemplary method for selecting particular advertisement messages to appear in the offline media in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention is depicted.
- the process is initiated at block 310, where, as in block 310 of FIG. 3, a request for advertisements is received from an offline media source by the advertising server.
- the process may begin in block 311 by determining which advertisers or ad messages are not excluded - conversely, which are available to satisfy the request.
- this may comprise filtering the set of advertisers or advertising messages stored on the server based on the kind of publication for which the ads are intended, pricing constraints imposed by either the offline media source or the advertiser, or other advertiser and/or media source preferences.
- this may result in a subset of potential advertisers or messages that is less than equal to the total number stored on the server. Then, in block 312, based at least in part on pricing conditions, the server determines which ads from those that are relevant and not excluded, are available for publication in the offline media source. In various embodiments, an algorithm, routine or criteria may be applied that maximizes potential advertisement revenue.
- This may comprise a price auction whereby advertisers have previously specified a range or maximum amount they are willing to pay for advertising and the advertisers that will maximize potential revenue may be selected.
- revenue maximization may be only one of several factors influencing the selection process.
- the actual ad copy to appear in the offline media source may be created. In various embodiments, this may be based on the amount and/or dimensions of available advertising space in the offline media source. However, as discussed above, in various embodiments, the actual ad copy may be created at the server side of the system so that the offline media source merely "inserts" the ad copy into the available space. In various embodiments, the ad copy may be created at the offline media source side based on information received from the advertising server regarding the advertisements selected to appear. Furthermore, in block 313, an online replica website may also be created. The online replica website may contain an online version of the offline ad copy that appears in the offline media source.
- the online replica site may also contain additional information such as graphics, more detailed descriptions and hyperlinks to each of the represented advertisers' respective websites.
- the ad copy appearing in the offline media source may preferably contain the URL of the online replica website so that customers seeking additional information on the products and/or services being advertised can be directed to the respective advertisers' websites through a central website associated with the particular offline media source, and the advertisers may
- an outbound message may be sent to the requesting offline media source.
- the message may contain either the ad copy selected by the server or information on the one or more selected advertisers, including the URL for the online replica site.
- processing returns to the process of FIG. 3
- FIG. 5 a flow chart of an exemplary method for realizing revenue through an online pricing and usage model for print advertisements according to at least one embodiment of the invention is depicted. Operation begins in block 400.
- the advertisement may be published in the offline media. As discussed herein, this may be a newspaper, journal, magazine, or even on television.
- the ad copy may include the URL of the online replica website so that the user can contact advertisers through a channel that allows the recovery of ad revenue.
- the user may navigate to the online replica website by entering the
- the website may contain individual advertisements from each of the advertisers that were selected in the process of FIGS. 3 and 4.
- the online replica site may appear the same as that in the offline media source.
- the online replica site may merely be similar to that appearing in the offline media source.
- each represented advertiser may include a clickable hyperlink allowing viewers to navigate automatically to the individual websites associated with each advertiser.
- the ad appearing in the offline media source may not contain a URL or telephone number for the individual advertisers.
- viewers wishing to contact the advertisers may go to the online replica site to obtain the necessary information to contact the advertiser. This may be particularly effective for advertisers that are not well known and/or do not have well known and/or easily discernable website addresses.
- Internet search sites such as Google and Yahoo, various embodiments, may provide an incentive for viewers to contact the advertisers through the online replica site rather than searching for it on their own.
- viewers may be provided with an incentive such as free shipping, a percentage discount, or other financial incentive as a reward for contacting the advertiser through the online replica site.
- an incentive such as free shipping, a percentage discount, or other financial incentive as a reward for contacting the advertiser through the online replica site.
- ad revenue may only be generated when users click through from the replica site to the advertiser's site, free riding is a problem. Free riding occurs when the system is used to place an ad in offline media source and the viewer contact the advertiser because of the ad but without using the online replica site. In such cases the advertiser essentially receives free advertising. Thus, by excluding contact information and providing the viewer with an incentive only available by going to the online replica site, free riding may be reduced.
- a real time auction may be conducted to determine exactly which advertisements appear on the online replica site. That is more, less or different ads may appear than those that appeared in the offline media source.
- this may be transparent to the person visiting the online replica site.
- the user after navigating to the online replica site, clicks on a hyperlink that takes him/her to the corresponding advertiser's website.
- a data record may be created acknowledging the fact that a user was directed to advertiser A's website through the online replica site.
- the advertiser has a pricing contract specifying a fixed price per click-through or referral-based sale with the advertising server system, the advertiser may be charged accordingly. Therefore, accordingly to the various systems and methods of the embodiments of the invention, traditional online retailers may benefit from web-based referrals that are initiated through offline media advertising.
- offline media sources may be able to sell incremental unallocated space to a market not previously available to them on a "last minute" basis. It is envisioned that the entity maintaining the advertising server may contract for payment from the advertisers and may pay a percentage of revenue realized to the offline media source running its ads, although this type of arrangement is not required. The offline publisher may maintain its own advertising server for contracting directly with advertisers. Operation terminates in block 450.
- the sample advertisement copy 200 may include ad messages intended for the sports section of a fictitious newspaper called the LA
- the ad copy 200 may include a header section 205 identifying the offline media source and a plurality of ad messages 210A, 210B, 210C and 210D. Because the ad may appear in the sports section of the paper, in this example, ad messages that were either designated by the advertiser or determined by the ad server to be relevant to the sports page reader demographic have been selected. In this example, there are ad messages for sporting events tickets, sports memorabilia and other sports related merchandise. It should be appreciated, however, that other categories of ads may also be selected.
- the ad copy 200 includes a URL 220 for an online replica website corresponding to the publication, i.e., LA post.
- viewers of this newspaper ad 200 may be directed to navigate to the URL "www.onlineadsite.com/LApost" to obtain additional information on the advertisers.

- the ads 200, 250 respectively may contain a written incentive to entice viewers to visit the online replica site to avoid free riding.
- an interface e.g., a browser window
- an online replica website 500 created by the system for allocating available advertising space in an offline media using an online usage and pricing model including links to a plurality of online retailers according to at least one embodiment of the invention.
- the URL for the online replica website 500 in this example is "www.onlineadsite.coni/computennag/rnarch06."
- the online replica site was created to replicate ads created for the March 2006 edition of a fictitious PC magazine entitled “Computer Mag.”
- the webpage 500 includes links to four different advertisers: ink drop 510A, Biohazard 510B, Silver Platter 510C and Plasma Outlet 510D.
- the respective ads 510A-510D include descriptions of each of the advertisers including graphics and a hyperlink to their respective websites.
- users may click on any of the hyperlinked descriptions and be automatically routed to the corresponding website.
- the advertising server may collect revenue for advertising from the respective advertisers. Revenue may be based on simple click through or may be based on sales generated by customers accessing through the online replica site.
- the particular pricing model used with the advertiser is not critical to the various embodiments of the invention. Rather, the various embodiments of the invention provide a way for variety of different Internet-type advertising pricing and usage models to be used to purchase ad space in offline media sources.
- the various systems and methods for allocated unused offline media source advertising space to online advertisers using online pricing and usage models may benefit both advertisers and media publishers. Furthermore, because an infinite number of websites may be created with relative ease, the system is not subject to the constraints of conventional systems that use a dedicated telephone number. Also, offline publishers can obtain incremental advertising revenue on a short notice basis reaching a demographic that may not otherwise be willing to pay for offline ad space. Furthermore, free riding may be reduced by providing only the web address of the online replica site and/or through other incentives.
- server, processors, and modules described herein may perform their functions (e.g., reading optical information or determining rating information) automatically or via an automated system.
- automated refers to an action being performed by any machine-executable process, e.g., a process that does not require human intervention or input.
