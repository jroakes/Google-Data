Abstract
Provided are methods and systems for updating a sound field in response to user movement. The methods and systems are less computationally expensive than existing approaches for updating a sound field, and are also suitable for use with arbitrary loudspeaker configurations. The methods and systems provide a dynamic binaural sound field rendering realized with the use of "virtual loudspeakers." Rather than loudspeaker signals being fed into the physical loudspeakers, the signals are instead filtered with left and right HRIRs (Head Related Input Response) corresponding to the spatial locations of these loudspeakers. The sums of the left and right ear signals are then fed into the audio output device of the user.

Specific embodiment
Now by description disclosed method and various examples and the embodiment of system.Offer detail is described below to pass through
These examples are understood thoroughly and realize the description of these examples.However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, can there is no many
One or more embodiments as herein described are put into practice in the case of these details.Equally, those skilled in the art will also reason
One or more embodiments of the solution disclosure can be comprising the further feature not described in detail herein.Additionally, can not below
In illustrate or describe structure or function known to some, to avoid unnecessarily obscuring associated description.
Outside avoiding possible negative user experience (for example negative user experience, discussed herein above), stable sound
The maintenance of field causes the more effective alienation (externalization) of sound field, or in other words, relatively efficiently produces at sound source
Outside the head of listener or sensation of the sound field comprising the source at the in check position.Hence it is evident that needing to change institute
The sound field of generation, to compensate user movement, (for example, user's head (is represented when using coordinate systems around x, y and/or z-axis
During space) rotation or movement).
This problem can be solved in the following way：Head orientation is detected using head-tracking device
(orientation) change；Once and detect change, just calculate new position of the virtual source relative to user；And weight
The 3-dimensional sound field of new virtual source location is calculated newly.However, this way calculating cost is huge.Because, great majority application (for example calculates
Machine game scene) it is related to multiple virtual sources, so the high cost that calculates causes this way infeasible.Additionally, this way caused must
Will be with access to the primary signal produced by each virtual source and the current spatial location of each virtual source, this volume of may also lead to
Outer computation burden.
(rotating) is rotated according to user movement or moves the existing solution bag of the problem of (panning) sound field
Containing the sound source moved using Jing amplitudes.However, these existing ways cause the sound field containing impaired distance cuess, this is because
These existing ways ignore signal of interest characteristic, for example, go directly echo reverberation ratio, slight head movement and have incorrect wavefront
The acoustics parallax of curve.Additionally, these existing solutions give impaired direction positioning precision, this is because these are existing
Solution must (5.1 or 7.1 surround sounds for for example, not yet designing for games system be raised with sub-optimal speaker placement
Sound device system) contend with.
Maintain stable sound field strengthen sensation of the audio-source outside the head of listener.The effect of this process is in technology
It is upper challenging.One key factor of identified is, even if before and after less unconscious head movement can also help solve
It is chaotic.In ears are listened to, this problem is most frequently occurred when using not personalized head related transfer functions (HRTF).
Then, it is generally difficult to distinguish between the anterior and virtual sound source at rear portion of head.
Therefore, embodiment of the disclosure is related to update the method and system of sound field in response to user movement.Following article is more
Describe in detail, the existing way that disclosed method and system-computed cost ratio are used for updating sound field is low, and also is applied to
Any speaker configurations.
According to one or more embodiments as herein described, described method and system is provided by using " virtually raising one's voice
Device " and realize dynamic binaural sound field render.It is not that loudspeaker signal is fed in physical loudspeaker, signal is changed to pass through
Respond (HRIR) to filter corresponding to the left and right head-related impulse of the locus of these speakers.Left ear signal and auris dextra
The summation of signal is then fed in the audio output device (such as earphone) of user.For example, using following formula to obtain a left side
Ear earphone feeds：
Wherein * represents convolution, and hLiCorrespond to the left ear HRIR of the i-th speaker positioning, and qiIt is that its signal feeds.
The process is similar for right ear signals feeding.
In the virtual speaker way according to one or more embodiments of the disclosure, at so-called " sweet spot "
(for example, will typically ensure that the physical points of the center of the loudspeaker array of best located precision) place measures HRIR, therefore alleviates
The common restriction of such as stereophonic sound system.
Figure 1A and Figure 1B diagrams are from the ITU 5.0 of speaker (it should be noted that 0.1 sound channel can be excluded, because 0.1 sound channel is not
Pass on spatial information) array formed virtual speaker example.
Specifically, Figure 1A and Figure 1B illustrate example virtual loudspeaker reproduction system and method (100,150), whereby, survey
Which is simultaneously combined (example by the HRIR (Figure 1A) of the locus of all speakers in measuring corresponding to given setting with loudspeaker signal
Such as, 2 sound channel ears streams are formed, as described further below) to play (Figure 1B) to user.
In practice, sound field stable (stabilization) refers to that virtual speaker needs the " weight in 3-dimensional (3-D) sound field
Position " to offset the head movement of user.However, it should be understood that this process is equal to will move function (panning
Function) it is applied to virtual speaker feeding.According to one or more embodiments of the disclosure, there is provided a kind of stabilisation systemss
With apply can be used on sound field using head-tracking it is stabilized during optimal and most cost-effective move scheme.
Whir field computation causes the new speaker gain coefficient for being applied to loudspeaker signal.These modified gains
It is to derive as the weighted sum of all original ones gains：
Or be abbreviated as,
G '=G (ΦH)g. (3)
Wherein [L, R, C, Ls, Rs]T[L', R', C', Ls', Rs']TIt is 5.0 original speaker feeds and because of head
Rotation is up to angle, φHCaused 5.0 transformed speaker feeds.This operation can be considered to be equal to and will move function
It is applied to each discrete speaker feeds.Provided hereinafter with regard to the one or more embodiments according to the disclosure based on
Calculate matrix G (ΦH) process additional detail.
In order that virtual speaker is applied to rotating signal, each speaker gain for recalculating needs corresponding with this
HRIR (for example, is combined) to convolution.Fig. 2 be for by loudspeaker signal with corresponding to one group of speaker locus HRIR
Measured value combines to form 2 sound channel ears stream (LOUT250 and ROUT260) block diagram of instance system 200.According at least one
Embodiment, instance system and process (200) can be used for 5 speaker volume arrays, and can rotate (210) comprising sound field, this
Head-tracking data (220) and low-frequency effect (LFE) 230 is considered during ears output is formed to present to user.
The sound field carried out by direct gain optimization is stable
It is described below and calculates the matrix G (Φ being used in the system of the disclosureH) gain coefficient process.Though it should be noted that
So it is described below based on 5.0 surround sound loudspeaker layouts of ITU (wherein " 0.1 " sound channel is excluded), but the method that provided and is
System is expansible and is applied to various other loudspeaker arrangements and layout, comprising such as 7.1,9.1 and Else Rule and irregular cloth
Put and layout.
Disclosed method and system are based on and utilize energy and velocity vector positioning, and this has been demonstrated many suitable for predicting
High and low frequency positioning in speaker system, and be widely used as designing the instrument of such as audio decoder.Vector side
To the good predictive factorses of the perception angle for being low frequency source and medium-high frequency source, and the length of each vector is positioning " quality "
Or the good predictive factorses of " good degree ".Energy and velocity vector be for multi-channel audio system in one group given raise one's voice
Device gain and calculate.The component of vector respectively in the x, y and z directions can be distinguished.However, for simplicity, and in order to
The correlated characteristic of the disclosure of avoiding confusion, below in example, only illustrates level reproduction, so that energy vectors can be defined
For：
E=[ex ey] (4)
Wherein exAnd eyIt is component of a vector respectively in the x and y direction, N is the sum of the speaker in array, and gi
It is positioned at horizontal angle ΦiThe real gain of i-th speaker at place.The physical meaning of Pe can be considered the gross energy of system.Can be determined
Justice is measuring for the energy concentration that the value of the energy vectors of following formula or norm can be considered on specific direction：
The direction of ceiling capacity concentration can be given by：
Similarly, velocity vector can be defined as：
V=[vx vy] (10)
The value or norm that the velocity vector of following formula can be defined as can be considered from simulationSound source on direction
The ratio of the speed that the net acoustic velocity of N number of speaker is caused from the single sound source that this side up with script：
It is important to note that, although the sign of the gain for carrying out in energy vectors square is positive sign all the time, but
In velocity vector, sign is retained and can also be negative sign.The actual connotation of this fact is that the norm of velocity vector can be led to
Cross using the out-phase speaker of pressure " is pulled " from diametrically contrary direction to adjust.For physical resource, the amount of velocity vector
Value is 1 all the time, but is directed to virtual source, and due to possible out-phase component, the value of velocity vector can be more than 1.
The velocity vector direction that following formula can be defined as simply indicates the net direction of air particles vibration：
According to one or more embodiments of the disclosure, described system and method were using with for example once
The look-up table of the gain coefficient that the azimuth resolution of (1 °) is calculated.The use of look-up table is that head-tracking is implemented into ITU 5.0
To the simple and inexpensive mode of ears downmix.For all deviation anglesGain in psychoacousticss optimization look-up table, makes

The gain function of indivedual speakers that the migration process stated causes
In order to minimize function f (g), the process can for example by MATLAB routines fminuncFor performing some initial guesses
The extensive search of neighbouring functional minimum value.In an example of MATLAB scripts route, script expection is by 5 × 360
Matrix is used as input.In each column, exist be used to by sound localization given angle 5 speaker gains.
It should be noted that during optimization, selecting initial guess so that some in such as parameter are pre-optimized logical
It is often good practice.In this case, (PCPP) gain letter is moved with the paired firm power of once (1 °) incremental computations
Number is used as the example of the good candidate of the starting point for further optimizing.PCPP gain functions are used as into initial estimation, the mistake
Journey can be converged in result after (average) as little as 7 times iteration.

The example of the absolute number of degrees poor (Fig. 5 C) 5B) and between energy vectors direction and velocity vector direction.
The result for being obtained confirms the epistasis energy especially in the offset function for being obtained of the front portion of array, also demonstrates that surplus
The performance suitable with way best so far at remaining region.The fluctuation of total emitted energy is crossed over and entirely moves domain actually
Do not exist, this causes the method suitable with PCPP in this regard.Speed-energy vectors direction mismatch at the front portion of array is surrounded
50 ° of rub significantly reduces (Fig. 5 A to figure C) and also less at other regions of array.
It will be appreciated that optimization as herein described is the target prediction factor (mentioned above) for being calculated based on positioning precision,
Rather than the improvement of the quantitative aspects based on action required/MAC.However, it is emphasized that gain optimization can by off-line execution,
And as a result it is subsequently stored in look-up table.Application for the precalculated gain of head-tracking device is to introduce concern
Way, this is because, it is considered to the head orientation of new user only make it necessary to as obtained by reading from look-up table gain because
Son is scaling multi-channel signal.Furthermore, it is not necessary that other process of sound channel.
In terms of the improvement of expected positioning, experimental result confirms, the disclosure moves method and system especially in front side
