Embodiment
1. system survey
With reference to figure 1, the business listing search system 100 that exemplary speech enables comprises the voice-enabled user interface 102 mutual with caller 104.Caller 104 can use terminal 114 (for example, phone or computing machine) to be connected to system 100 by network 116 (for example, PSTN (PSTN) or internet protocol voice (VoIP) network).Inquiry and the utilization information relevant with this specific enterprise about specific enterprise that user interface 102 receives from caller 104 respond.
Voice-enabled user interface 102 can use the mutual script between system of specifying in 100 and the caller 104.User interface 102 can comprise the text-voice module (not shown) that text sentence is converted to speech output.For example, this script can comprise instruction, its command user interface 102 (is for example play hello messages to caller 104, " national enterprise content "), prompting caller 104 provides the geographic position (for example, " Hezhou, city ") of specific enterprise, prompting caller 104 (for example provide the type of business of specific enterprise or classification, " type of business or classification "), and prompting caller 104 provides the identifier or the title (for example, " enterprise name ") of specific enterprise.By inquire the types of business to caller 104 except the geographic position of specific enterprise, system 100 can be more exactly to user's delivery of relevant information.
For example, the big city such as the New York may have thousands of enterprises.Be difficult to based on the language identification specific enterprise from any caller 104, wherein any one enterprise in the thousands of enterprises can be represented in language, and some enterprise has identical title.By to the caller 104 inquiry types of business, system 100 can make speech recognition be partial to language model relevant with the type of business or syntactic units, the number of the enterprise name candidate that the feasible language that can reduce with the caller may mate.This permission system 100 uses the computational resource of specified rate to discern the enterprise name of language more exactly in the time of specified rate.
In this description, term " type of enterprise ", " type of business " have similar meaning and can exchange use with " enterprise sort ".
The form of language model can comprise for example N unit (N-grams), phrase-list grammar and mixing grammer.In N unit, estimate the probability of this speech in the vocabulary by the inferior counting number that any speech is in the end occurred in the context of N speech.In phrase-list grammar, estimate the probability of complete phrase (for example, each complete enterprise name) independently by the inferior counting number that whole phrase is occurred.In mixing grammer, use N unit and phrase-list grammar.
Language model in the database 106 can be organized as different groups.For example, first, second, third of language model and the 4th group of title, the title in state, the title of the type of business and title of specific enterprise that can be respectively applied for the identification city.
May there be many variants in the title of specific enterprise, and the number of language model that therefore is used to discern the title of specific enterprise is possible very big.In order to help to find suitable language model to use during speech recognition, system 100 sets up the hierarchical tree 150 of the classification node of cluster, and wherein each node is associated with language model.Each node comprises the information about the type of business of one or more titles of specific enterprise and correspondence thereof.In an implementation, the language model that is used for specific node comprises the information that can be used for discerning the enterprise name that joins with this particular sections spot correlation.
In an implementation, hierarchical tree 150 comprises root node 152, and this root node 152 is associated with the language model that is used to discern the specific enterprise title, but not is partial to any specific enterprise type or classification.Each node under the root node is associated with the subclass of all types of business and specific enterprise.Each language model that is associated with node under the root node can be partial to discern the subclass of the type of business.
In hierarchical tree 150, each child node (for example, 156) comprises the specific enterprise in the father node (for example, 154) of this child node and the subclass of the type of business.Each language model that is associated with this child node can be partial to the narrower type of business of scope than the language model that is associated with father node.Therefore, for example, father node can be associated with all restaurants, comprises Italian restaurant and Japanese restaurant.First child node can be associated with Italian restaurant, and second child node can be associated with Japanese restaurant.The first language model that is associated with father node can be used for discerning all restaurants, the second language model that is associated with first child node can be used for discerning all Italian restaurant, and the 3rd language model that is associated with second child node can be used for discerning all Japanese restaurants.
In identification and specific enterprise title that the specific enterprise type is associated, the language model that is associated with child node is common more accurate than the language model that is associated with father node.In the above example, the second and the 3rd language model is more accurate than first language model respectively usually in identification Italy and Japanese restaurant.
The tree 150 of second type is based on about the information of all specific enterprises in geographic area (for example New York City) and sets up.The tree 150 of second type will be called as position particular hierarchical tree.The language model that is associated with the node of position certain tree will be called as the position particular language model, promptly can be used for the language model of discrimination bit in the specific enterprise in specific geographic position.
When caller 104 and user interface 102 were mutual, caller 104 may not be entirely accurate and geographic position that coarse specific enterprise can for example be provided (for example, in fact this specific enterprise is positioned near another geographic position).Therefore, usefully, when identification specific enterprise title, use general language model and position particular language model.Speech recognition engine 104 can be assigned to different weights general language model and position particular language model, for example, provides the weight bigger than general language model to the position particular language model.For example, when caller 104 inquiry during about information in the Italian restaurant of San Jose, the final language model that is used for speech recognition can be to be used to discern the general language model of Italian restaurant and (for example to be used to discern the city identified, San Jose) and near other (for example, adjacent) position is (for example, be respectively Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and Mountain View) in the combination of (for example, four) position particular language model of Italian restaurant.
Can make the weight of determining to be assigned to multiple position particular language model in many ways.For example, be used to discern the language model of the enterprise in the geographic position of approaching the specific geographic position that caller 104 provides, than with away from the language model that is associated of geographic position, can be presented higher weight.
After mapping block 108 determined that specific node is more relevant, the language model identification that speech recognition engine 104 is used and this particular sections spot correlation joins was from the title of the specific enterprise in caller 104 the speech input.When with user interface 102 when mutual, caller 104 can out of true ground or is described the type of business exactly.For example, caller 104 we can say that when in fact he is seeking the locksmith " hard ware store " is as the type of business.Therefore, usefully, in the title of identification specific enterprise, use the language model that joins with the particular sections spot correlation (it is associated with the narrower type of business of scope) and the combination of the language model (it is associated with the type of business of wider range) that is associated with ancestor node.With the language model of particular sections spot correlation connection in the title of the specific enterprise that identification is associated with the type of business that caller 104 provides more accurately, and when the specific enterprise of caller 104 request was not included into the type of business that caller 104 provides, the language model that is associated with ancestor node provided retracted position.
The number of the language model that is associated with ancestor node that uses in the combination in some examples, can be set to predefined number.In some examples, can use with until the language model that all ancestor nodes of root node are associated.In the above example, the node that is associated with " hard ware store " and " locksmith " type of business will have at least one public ancestor node---root node 152, therefore use until all ancestor nodes of root node 152 can be provided to the retracted position of the every other type of business.
The different language model that uses in the combination can be given different weights.Can make and determine weighted value in many ways.For example, can give the highest weight to language model with particular sections spot correlation connection, and than with the ancestor node that approaches specific node (for example, father node) language model that is associated, can to away from the language model that is associated of ancestor node (for example, grandfather's node) give less weight.Can based on mapping block 108 determine the type of business which node and caller 104 provide more relevant or more approaching in the similarity measurement of use, determine weighted value.
After speech recognition engine 104 call identifying persons' 104 the title of language with definite specific enterprise, the database 112 that search engine 110 searching enterprises are included is to find the information about this specific enterprise.This information can be the telephone number of this specific enterprise for example.
When search database 112, search engine 110 can use the information of geographic position, the type of business and the specific enterprise title discerned about speech recognition engine 104 to find the one or more couplings in the database 112.In some cases, caller's language may be coarse, and perhaps the identification of the specific enterprise in the language may be coarse.For example, speech recognition engine 104 can identify a specific enterprise title with caller's language coupling, but may exist in database 112 and the enterprise name that is identified similar a plurality of business listings equally.In some cases, speech recognition engine 104 can be returned a plurality of candidates of expression about the potential coupling of the specific enterprise in the language.From each candidate of speech recognition engine 104 a plurality of business listings in the matching database 112 potentially.By except geographic position and the specific enterprise discerned, using information about the type of business, the specific enterprise that search engine 110 can identify in the database 112 is more exactly included, and perhaps reduces the number from the candidate of the business listing of database 112 will present to caller 104.
Describe below and be used to use the illustrative methods of coming search database 112 from the recognition result of speech recognition engine 104.Search engine 110 can be carried out two search.First search is based on the information about geographic position and the type of business or classification.Second search is based on geographic position and specific enterprise.First searches for all business listings in this type of business of returning in this geographic position.All business listings that mate with the specific enterprise of being discerned in this geographic position are returned in second search.Each can return and have the possibility weight that is associated or search score value the tabulation of the possible enterprise name of (based on such as the correlativity of the expection of the importance of the estimation of the correctness of speech coupling, each speech and enterprise etc.) these two search.These two tabulations are merged, and make the enterprise that indicates in two tabulations be reduced to a result with new score value, this new score value be from the score value of each tabulation and.To turn back to caller 104 about information (for example, telephone number) from for example first three candidate who merges tabulation.
In some cases, speech recognition engine 104 can determine to be higher than with probability more than one specific enterprise predetermined threshold and caller's language coupling.Speech recognition engine 104 can provide the tabulation of specific enterprise title to search engine 110, and search engine 110 search are about the information of this specific enterprise.Search engine 110 is to user interface 102 transmission information, and the tabulation and the prompting user of user interface 102 notice enterprise names therefrom select an enterprise name.In an implementation, at the language of the person's that receives the indicating call selection (perhaps, for example, the Dual Tone Multifrequency signal) time, user interface 102 notify the telephone number of selected specific enterprise and inquiry user 104 he whether wish to be directly connected to this enterprise, listen to more details, perhaps receive the short-text message that comprises about the information of this specific enterprise about this specific enterprise.
Fig. 2 is used to receive provide process flow diagram about the example process 120 of the information of this specific enterprise from caller 104 about the inquiry of specific enterprise and to caller 104.Receiving 122 from caller 104 calls out.The geographic position of pointing out 124 callers 104 that specific enterprise is provided is such as Hezhou, city.Receive the language in 126 expression Hezhou, city from caller 104.Identification 128 these Hezhou, city.The type of business (or classification) of pointing out 130 users that this specific enterprise is provided.Receive the language of the 132 expression types of business from caller 104.Identification 134 these types of business.Point out 136 users that the title of specific enterprise is provided.Receive the language of the title of expression specific enterprise from caller 104.
Discern 140 specific enterprise titles based on for example being partial to the speech recognition language model of this city, state and the type of business.Other biasing examples are possible, comprise other combinations (for example, only based on the state and the type of business) of factor.Carry out 142 search to find data (for example, telephone number) corresponding to the specific enterprise title of being discerned.If identify 144 enterprise names only, then notify the data (for example, telephone number) of 146 these specific enterprises, and provide the option that is directly connected to this specific enterprise to caller 104.If identify enterprise name, then notify the tabulation of 148 enterprise names, and provide the option that directly is connected or obtains more information (such as the telephone number of specific enterprise) with specific enterprise to caller 104 more than one.
In process 120, point out caller 104 and receive language and can carry out by for example voice-enabled user interface 102 from caller 104.By using for example database 106 of speech recognition engine 104, mapping block 108, hierarchical tree 150 and language model, can carry out identification from caller 104 language.By using for example database 112 of search engine 110 and business listing, can carry out search to the telephone number of specific enterprise.
Be the mutual example between system 100 and caller 104 below according to process 120:
System 100: national business listing search.Hezhou, city please be provided.
Caller 104:Palo Alto, California.
Is system 100: what the type of business or classification?
The caller 104: Italian restaurant.
Is system 100: what specific enterprise?
Caller 104:I1 Fornaio
System 100: Search Results, I1 Fornaio is positioned at Cowper Street, Palo Alto.(650)853-3888。Do you wish directly to connect?
The caller 104: connect.
Be another mutual example between system 100 and caller 104 below according to process 120:
System 100: national business listing search.What is the specific enterprise that you seek?
Caller 104:I1 Fornaio
Is system 100: what the type of business?
The caller 104: Italian restaurant
System 100: where be positioned at?
Caller 104:Palo Alto, California.
System 100: Search Results, I1 Fornaio is positioned at Cowper Street, Palo Alto.(650)853-3888。Do you wish directly to connect?
The caller 104: connect.
When the identification of specific enterprise was unsuccessful, system 100 can return back to and use only classification search.Can not discern in the situation of specific enterprise in speech recognition engine 104, by inquiring the type of business or classification to the caller, the specific enterprise (perhaps enough approaching useful business listing) that system 100 can only use the type of business or classification information to find caller 104 to seek.
Be the mutual example between system 100 and caller 104 that return back to only classification search below:
System 100: national business listing search.May I ask any Hezhou, city.
Caller 104:Palo Alto, California.
Is system 100: what the type of business?
The caller 104: Japanese restaurant.
Is system 100: what enterprise name?
Caller 104:fuki sushi
System 100: we can not discern, and this is the result about the Japanese restaurant of Palo Alto, please select one:
Numbering 1:Sushitomi
Numbering 2:Fuki Sushi
Numbering 3:...
For example, geographic position and specific enterprise can be inquired by system 100 in same voice suggestion, inquire the type of business then.The geographic position and the type of business can be inquired by system 100 in same voice suggestion, inquire specific enterprise then.The specific enterprise and the type of business can be inquired by system in same voice suggestion, inquire the geographic position then.The type of business can be inquired by system 100, then inquiry geographic position and specific enterprise in same voice suggestion.Specific enterprise can be inquired by system, subsequently the inquiry geographic position and the type of business in same voice suggestion.The geographic position can be inquired by system, subsequently the inquiry specific enterprise and the type of business in same voice suggestion.All geographic position, the type of business and specific enterprise can be inquired by system in same voice suggestion.
Before the user interface 102 inquiry geography information or the type of business, inquire in the implementation of specific enterprises to caller 104, system 100 can store the language record about the caller of specific enterprise, and uses then and be partial to the type of business discerned or the language that is write down discerned again in the grammer of classification.
2. construct and use hierarchical tree
The classification of enterprise and the structure of hierarchical tree are described below.
By comparing, the enterprise classifying that traditional directory service (for example, Yellow Page) is used is fixed basically.If the user is not knowing that specific enterprise is found in hope under the situation of enterprise name, then the user must know what classification this specific enterprise is included in the classification that traditional directory service provides.For example, if the user wishes to find near the specific enterprise of the sale garden tool set of assigned address, but do not know enterprise name, then the user may inquire about traditional directory service and inquire near the enterprise that lists under " hard ware store " classification the assigned address.The tradition directory service can respond with near the tabulation of all enterprises of the being included into assigned address " hard ware store " classification.If the specific enterprise that the user is seeking is not categorized as hard ware store by traditional directory service, but be sorted under " garden centre " classification, then the response from traditional directory service will not comprise the specific enterprise that the user is seeking.When specific enterprise in fact is put into different following times of classification in traditional catalogue, the user may expect that this specific enterprise excludes traditional catalogue.
Fig. 3 be can be used for setting up and upgrade cluster the classification node hierarchical tree 150 and be used for the block diagram of module example of system 100 of database 106 of the language model of speech recognition.Identical among user interface 102, speech recognition engine 104 and mapping block 108 and Fig. 1, and be used to discern the voiceband user input.System 100 comprises search engine 162 (it is different from the search engine 110 of Fig. 1), and it is used to carry out keyword search and returns the lists of links of pointing to the webpage or the document that comprise particular keywords.System 100 comprises automatic classification cluster module 164, and it uses from the data foundation of for example call log 152 and search daily record 154 collections and upgrades hierarchical tree 150.
Call log 152 comprises from the data of call record in the past, comprises the data how caller 104 about the past makes specific enterprise be associated with specific enterprise type or classification.For example, when the process 120 of execution graph 2, user interface 102 is followed the tracks of dialogue states, allows the title of geographic position, the type of business and the specific enterprise that will be discerned to be recorded in the call log 152.Classification cluster module 164 is used title right of the type of business discerned and specific enterprise in upgrading hierarchical tree 150.
Term " classification-enterprise to " will be used in reference to the right of the type of business and specific enterprise (perhaps enterprise sort and specific enterprise).
Search daily record 154 comprises the data from the past searching record.For example, user 156 can use terminal 158 (for example, computing machine) to send the inquiry with keyword to search engine 162 on internet 160.Search engine 162 search information database (not shown) and turn back to the document that comprises this keyword or the lists of links of webpage.When user 156 selected a link subsequently, indication user 156 made this keyword be associated with the selected document or the webpage that point to of linking.If this document or webpage are associated with specific enterprise, then the keyword that uses in this search can be used to define the type of business or the classification about this specific enterprise potentially.
In one example, user 156 sends the inquiry with keyword " Italian restaurant " to search engine 162, and search engine 162 returns the lists of links of the webpage that points to Italian restaurant.User 156 selects to point to certain restaurant, for example link of the webpage of I1 Fornaio, and be directed to the webpage in I1 Fornaio restaurant.By submitting to keyword " Italian restaurant " to select to point to the link of I1 Fornaio afterwards, the user indicates him that I1 Fornaio is associated with the type of business " Italian restaurant ".Therefore, specific enterprise I1 Fornaio can be placed in the node of the hierarchical tree 150 that is associated with the type of business " Italian restaurant ".
The inquiry that search engine 162 receives from many users.If hierarchical tree 150 does not have the node that is associated with " Italian restaurant ", and many users use keyword " Italian restaurant " to submit to inquiry and selection subsequently to point to the link of I1 Fornaio, then keyword " Italian restaurant " is used in and sets up new node in the hierarchical tree 150, and specific enterprise " I1 Fornaio " is the member of this new node.
Similarly, if user 156 submits the link that has the inquiry of keyword " restaurant " and select to point to I1 Fornaio subsequently to, then the I1 of enterprise Fornaio can be placed in the node of the hierarchical tree 150 that is associated with the type of business " restaurant ".Because different people may be according to the different types of business to identical enterprise classifying, so specific enterprise may be the member of several the different nodes in the hierarchical tree 150.
As another example, user 156 sends the inquiry with keyword " sushi " to search engine 162, and search engine 162 returns the webpage that points to professor and how to make " sushi ", sushi supplier's webpage and the lists of links of webpage in the restaurant of sushi is provided.User 156 selects the link of webpage of the certain restaurant of orientation such as Sushitomi, and is directed to the webpage in Sushitomi restaurant.By submitting to keyword " sushi " to select to point to the link of Sushitomi afterwards, the user indicates him that Sushitomi is associated with the type of business or classification " sushi ".Therefore, specific enterprise Sushitomi can be placed in the node of the hierarchical tree 150 that is associated with the type of business or classification " sushi ".
If hierarchical tree 150 does not have the node that is associated with " sushi ", and many users use keyword " sushi " to submit to inquiry and selection subsequently to point to the link of Sushitomi, then keyword " sushi " can be with acting on the type of business or the classification of setting up new node in hierarchical tree 150, and specific enterprise Sushitomi is the member of this new node.
The pairing of keyword and specific enterprise, such as " Italian restaurant " pairing, " restaurant " and the pairing of " I1 Fornaio " and the pairing of " sushi " and " Sushitomi " etc. with " I1 Fornaio ", be recorded in the search daily record 154, classification cluster module 164 is used this search daily record 154 in setting up hierarchical tree 150.
The data of collecting from call log for example 152 and search daily record 154 can comprise the information about user's user's response when puzzled to the classification of specific enterprise.For example, call log 152 may illustrate the user answers " I do not know " about the problem of the type of business of specific enterprise in response example.Call log 152 and search daily record 154 can comprise about the user as unconventional method how, for example is different from the method for the classification that traditional directory service uses, to the information of enterprise classifying.For example, call log 152 and search daily record 154 may illustrate the example of saying or import keyword " hard ware store " when user wherein seeks cellular dealer actually.By catching the response from caller 104 and/or user's 156 wide region, system 100 can reflect the hierarchical tree 150 of enterprise classifying more exactly according to the average user structure, is different from the strict enterprise classifying that uses in traditional directory service.
Term " user 156 " will be used in reference to the user who carries out keyword search, and the term " user " that does not have a reference number 156 will be generally used for referring to user 156 and caller 104 both.
164 combinations of classification cluster module are right from the classification-enterprise of call log 152 and search daily record 154, and set up general hierarchical tree 150.For geography information wherein also is available situation, classification cluster module 164 according to the geographic position with this to sorting out and setting up position particular hierarchical tree 150 about each geographic position.For example, all categories-enterprise relevant with enterprise in the New York City be to can be used for generating position particular hierarchical tree 150, and all categories-enterprise relevant with enterprise in the San Jose city sets 150 or the like to can be used for generating the position particular hierarchical.
After classification cluster module 164 is upgraded general hierarchical tree and position particular hierarchical tree 150, use module 166 to come speech recognition language model in the new database 106 more.Each node in the hierarchical tree 150 is associated with language model in the database 106, therefore add or remove the node of hierarchical tree 150 when classification cluster module 164, perhaps add or when removing the type of business of node or specific enterprise, the language model of the correspondence in the database 106 also is updated.The language model of each renewal is partial to discern the specific enterprise that is associated with each node.
Because hierarchical tree 150 can have many nodes, so the number of language model may be huge.May need a large amount of resource (for example, dish drives storage space) to keep this language model.The method that a kind of minimizing is stored in the sum of the language model in system's (for example, dish drives) is to set up the language model (being called as high-level language model) that is associated with father node from the language model (being called as the low level language model) that is associated with child node.For example, the first language model that is used for the father node that is associated with " restaurant " type of business can be to be used for the second language model of the child node that is associated with " Italian restaurant " type of business and the combination of the 3rd language model of the child node that is used for being associated with " Japanese restaurant " type of business.Second can have weight or the influence different with the first language model with the 3rd language model.In an implementation, system 100 can store about the weight coefficient of the second and the 3rd language model with expression first language model, has saved considerable disk space.
With reference to figure 4A, in shown example, each node of hierarchical tree 150 comprises having classification-enterprise to 172 and the form 170 of the tabulation of separately counting 174.Counting 174 expression classification-enterprises are to 172 number of times that occur in call log 152 and search daily record 154.For example, to having counting 110, (restaurant, Shanghai Garden) counts 100 to having (restaurant, I1 Fornaio), and (sushi Sushitomi) counts 10 to having, and (I do not know, Home Depot) is to having counting 3.This indication user in the past makes I1 Fornaio be associated 110 times with " restaurant " type of business or classification, makes Sushitomi 10 speech that are associated with " sushi " type of business or classification, or the like.
With reference to figure 4B, each node comprises the index 176 of the type of business and stored counts thereof.For example, " restaurant " type of business has counting 200, and " Italian restaurant " type of business has counting 65, or the like.
With reference to figure 4C, each node also comprises the index 178 of specific enterprise and stored counts thereof.For example, specific enterprise " I1 Fornaio " have the counting 175, and " Ace Hardware " have the counting 23, or the like.
By the right type cluster of classification-enterprise is set up the node of hierarchical tree 150 based on its counting.In one example, the root of tree 150 comprises that all categories-enterprise is right.First node under the root is initialized to have with to have classification-enterprise that the classification of high counting is associated right.
With reference to figure 5A, tree 150 only has root node 180 at first, and it is right that it has all categories-enterprise.Because " restaurant " type of business has the highest counting (it equals 200, referring to Fig. 4 B), therefore set up child node 182 and it is associated with " restaurant " type of business.Wherein classification is that all categories-enterprise pair in " restaurant " is associated with new node 182.Therefore, node 182 comprise (restaurant, I1Fornaio), (restaurant, Shanghai Garden) and (restaurant, Sushitomi) right.
Then, calculate each classification-enterprise to and set similarity between each node in two nodes 180,182 in 150.A plurality of similarity measurements can be used for determining that classification-enterprise pair with root node 180 still is and node 182 more similar (or relevant).In some instances, about particular category-enterprise to the similarity measurement with specific node be in this node given classification and about such other word frequency (term frequency) (TF1) and given specific enterprise and about the word frequency (TF2) of this specific enterprise and.Word frequency about classification with word (for example, speech) equals to count divided by all categories in this node about the classification counting of this word.Equal specific enterprise counting about this word divided by all specific enterprises countings in this node about the word frequency of specific enterprise with word (for example, speech).
In some instances, word frequency (TF 1+TF2) is by reverse document frequency weighting, and this reverse document frequency is interstitial content comprises the interstitial content of this word divided by (in the type of business or specific enterprise) a logarithm.If specific classification-enterprise is to having the higher similarity with new " restaurant " node 182, then this classification-enterprise is to being assigned to new node 182, and upgrades the counting about the node of new cluster.
Use above-described similarity measurement, can determine that classification-enterprise is to (Italian restaurant, I1 Fornaio), (Chinese restaurant, Shanghai Garden), (Japanese restaurant, Sushitomi) and (sushi, Sushitomi) be associated with new node 182, and (five metals, Home Depot), (five metals, Ace Hardware), (hard ware store, Orchard Supply Hardware), (hard ware store, Orchard Supply Hardware) and (I do not know, Home Depot) be associated with root node 180.
Have the newest classification of high counting that has in the maximum node that changes by identification, as " restaurant " node 182, the next new node in can initialization tree 150.To a measurement of this variation is the right entropy of classification-enterprise in each node, entropy be defined in that in the node all are got the last logarithm that each right probability be multiply by each right probability and negative value.For example, the entropy of node 182 is-(110/480*log (110/480)+100/480*log (100/480)+90/480*log (90/480)+65/480*log (65/480)+55/480*log (55/480)+50/480*log (50/480)+10/480*log (10/480)).The entropy of node 180 can be determined by similar mode.
With reference to figure 5B, the new node 184 that is associated with " five metals " type of business in 180 times initialization of root node, and use above-described similarity measurement with classification-enterprise to being assigned to node 180,182,184 again.
With reference to figure 5C, use above-described method additional node can be added to tree 150.For example, node 186,188,190,192,194 and 196 can be respectively be associated with the type of business or classification " Italian restaurant ", " Chinese restaurant ", " Japanese restaurant ", " sushi ", " hard ware store " and " I do not know ".
In some instances, the process of adding child node continues until the upper limit that reaches about the node sum, and perhaps the variable quantity in any endpoint node in tree 150 node of child node (promptly without any) is less than predefined threshold value.
After finishing hierarchical tree 150, module 166 is the speech recognition language model in the new database 106 more, makes that each node (for example, 180 to 196) in the tree 150 is associated with language model in the database 106.The language model that is associated with node provides the information about the probability of language and specific enterprise coupling.This probability can be based on count value.For example, if caller's 104 indication types of business are " restaurants ", and caller's language arrives identical degree with the waveform of " I1 Fornaio " and the Waveform Matching of " Sushitomi ", and then the language model that is associated with node 182 can indicating call person 104 say that " I1 Fornaio " probability is higher than the probability that the caller says " Sushitomi ".
When can upgrading hierarchical tree 150 when call log 152 and search daily record 154 obtain the right additional example of classification-enterprises.In some instances, can be termly cluster and rebulid complete hierarchical tree 150 again, all categories-enterprise is to beginning in root node, and describes as mentioned and carry out cluster.In some instances, existing hierarchical tree keep intact and with new classification-enterprise to being assigned to node with highest similarity score value with describing as mentioned.In an implementation, if both do not found specific enterprise not find the type of business in 150 in tree yet, then with this classification-enterprise to the default root node 180 that is assigned to.
Fig. 6 is the process flow diagram that is used to generate the example process 200 of hierarchical tree 150.It is right to receive 202 classifications-enterprise.All categories-enterprise is to being assigned to the root node of 204 trees 150 at first.Find 206 type of business T1 of high counting that have that have in the node of High variation.Type of business T1 is set up 208 new nodes.Classification-the enterprise that is associated with type of business T1 is to being assigned to this new node.Remaining classification-enterprise is assigned to node to quilt cluster 210 again and based on similarity measurement.Determine the entropy of 212 all nodes.If there is any endpoint node, then repeats to find 206, set up 208 and cluster 210 again with the entropy that is higher than threshold value.When all endpoint nodes have entropy less than threshold value, finish hierarchical tree 150, and upgrade 214 language models that are used for node.
For example, in process 200, can be right from call log 152 and search daily record 154 (Fig. 3) reception classification-enterprise.Can carry out by classification cluster module 164 and assign 204, find 206, set up 208, cluster 210 and determine 212 entropy again.Can be by being used to upgrade the module 166 execution renewals 214 of speech recognition language model.
Fig. 7 is used for the type of business is mapped to the node of hierarchical tree 150 to determine using which language model to discern the process flow diagram of the example process 220 of specific enterprise.Receive 222 type of business T1.Determine the similarity score value between 224 type of business T1 and the node.Each similarity score value indication type of business T1 and with the type of business that node is associated between similarity.Find 226 nodes with highest similarity score value.Use the specific enterprise in the 228 language model identification speech inputs that are associated with this node.
For example, in process 220, can determine type of business T1 from the speech recognition engine 104 of the type of business in caller 104 the speech input by identification.Can carry out by mapping block 108 (Fig. 1) and should determine 224 and find 226.Speech recognition engine 104 can use the 228 language model identifications of being found by mapping block 108 from the specific enterprise in caller 104 the speech input.
Be not to calculate the similarity score value when which node is system 100 need to determine corresponding to the type of business that provided by caller 104, system can calculate the similarity score value about the type of business commonly used in advance.For example, based on historical data, system can determine that " Japanese restaurant " is the type of business that often receives request.Hierarchical tree 150 among use Fig. 5 C is as example, and system 100 can calculate the similarity score value between " Japanese restaurant " and the node 180 to 196 in advance, and definite node 190,182 is relevant with the Japanese restaurant of identification with 180.System 100 calculates weight c1, c2 and the c3 that will be assigned to the language model that is associated with node 190,182 and 180 respectively subsequently in advance.In some instances, this weight can be the similarity score value.Weight c1, c2 and c3 can be stored in the table.
When caller 104 inquiry about the information of specific enterprise and when " Japanese restaurant " is provided as the type of business, mapping block 108 searches this table and definite interdependent node is 190,182 and 180, and is respectively c1, c2 and c3 about the weight of the language model of correspondence.The language model that is associated with node 190,182 and 180 is provided for the title of speech recognition engine 104 with the identification specific enterprise together with its weight c1, c2 and c3 separately.
3. multi-server system
The example of the voice-enabled business listing search system that uses a plurality of Realization by Machine is described below.
The system 100 of Fig. 1 can use several servers that link together via network to realize.Server can be for example workstation, personal computer or processing unit arbitrarily.Each module among Fig. 1 can be carried out by discrete server.For example, a server can be carried out the function of user interface 102, and another server can be carried out the function of mapping block 108.A plurality of servers that can have the function of carrying out search engine 110.
During the dish that database 106 among Fig. 1 can be stored in the different server of diverse location drives.The a plurality of speech recognition engine 104 that operate on the different server that is positioned at diverse location can be arranged, the specific enterprise that each speech recognition engine 104 one or more language model database 106 of visit and responsible identification are associated with specific enterprise type and/or geographic position.
Some servers can be responsible for the node of general hierarchical tree, and some servers can be responsible for the node of position particular hierarchical tree.Recognition result from various servers can be sent to the central server of determining final recognition result.
4. additional example
Although some examples above have been discussed, other implementation and application are also within the scope of the appended claims.For example, user interface 102 (Fig. 1) can be by the different company that specializes in voice-enabled user interface (for example, TellMe Network, Inc.) operation.System 100 can be used for discerning name or the title such as the entity of nonprofit organization except enterprise.
For example, system 100 can provide the personal directory service.User interface 102 can point out caller 104 that the information of geographic position, classification and name about the individual is provided.This geographic position can be Hezhou, city for example.This classification can be for example " graduate of Stanford University " or " Google employee of company ".Speech recognition engine 104 can be based on geographic position and classification information identification individual's name.System 100 can be subsequently provide related data (for example, individual's telephone number) to caller 104, and provides the caller is connected to this individual option.
For example, system 100 can provide the commodity positioning service.User interface 102 can point out caller 104 that the information of geographic position, classification and title about commodity item is provided.The geographic position can be Hezhou, city for example.Classification can be for example " flat panel TV " or " automobile ".Title can be " Sharp for example
