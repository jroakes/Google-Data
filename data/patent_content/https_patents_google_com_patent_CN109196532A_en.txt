Description
Cross reference to related applications
This application claims entitled " the ASYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING OF DIGITAL submitted on June 27th, 2016
The priority of the U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 15/193,929 of ASSISTANT REQUESTS ", entire contents pass through reference
It is hereby incorporated by.
Background technique
Some phones and other equipment, which provide, allows user to submit the digital assistants function of inquiring and make other requests.Example
Such as, user can say speech polling to equipment, and equipment can obtain in response to the inquiry and search result is presented.Number
Assistant's function can be related to for example executing the processing of speech recognition by server system.Therefore, digital assistants function sets user
The variation of the standby radio communication channel between server system is sensitive, and when on channel there are the waiting time, temporarilly reduce
When data rate or channel interruption, function may be affected.This may be as caused by radio channel condition, such as by doing
The problem of disturbing or being derived from network is caused.In the case where the part that the equipment to user executes request is handled, the skill of equipment
The use of art limitation or device resource on other tasks may interfere with the operation of digital assistants function.
Summary of the invention
In some implementations, at least some users request made to digital assistants (for example, session proxy) can be with
Request with user asynchronously executes.User can submit various types of requests to digital assistants, and some of them may be not required to
It executes with immediately or synchronous with the request of user.Server system can identify the user's request for being suitable for asynchronous execution, and
And the timing for being used to execute those requests is separated with user with the dialogue of digital assistants.As a result, system can be to avoid possible resistance
Only user issues other delays requested to digital assistants.For example, user usually requires to wait straight in the case where synchronous execute
After completing to most recently requested movement, user could issue new request.However, it is possible to avoid these from prolonging by asynchronous process
Late, because concurrently can receive and handle new request with the movement for handling or planning to execute of previous Request.As showing
Example, when the movement of selection first is for asynchronous execution, digital assistants can provide the confirmation that will execute the first movement, and
First movement receives and processes further request from the user before completing.
The technology that server system is used to carry out selection between the synchronization and asynchronous behavior that user requests can also be by one
A or multiple client equipment executes, or is executed by the combination of server system and one or more client devices.For example,
Client device can assess user and request to determine whether either synchronously or asynchronously to execute specific request for request.Following institute
It states, this can make client device be capable of handling casual network interruption and other connection interference.
In order to enhance reliability and trustability, asynchronous execution can be made by certain time restrictions.By asynchronous execution,
It does not need to execute movement sequentially or after request with request, therefore can be shifted in the dialogue of user and digital assistants
It is executed after to other themes.But server system can monitor the execution of movement, and implement measures to ensure that when reasonable
Interior execution.For example, timeout period can be set to execute movement.It is executed if do not completed in timeout period, server
System can retry the movement or user is notified to postpone or fail.These constraints can be implemented as " soft " real-time constraint, so as to
To execute movement with some admissible retardations, but guarantee to occur such that fast enough with the difference of synchronous execution for
User is negligible.
As an example, user can request that calendar appointment is arranged in second day some time.Digital assistant can be with
Determine that the movement of setting appointment can be with asynchronous execution, for example, because movement is not needed to immediately treat or be exported to user.However,
Time-constrain can be set in digital assistant, such as 5 minutes or 15 minutes from the time that user requests, for user's
Execution movement and synchrodata between various equipment.The constraint allows digital assistant to postpone the flexibility executed, for example, with
In the delay of load balance or management third-party server system, while the potential inconvenience of user is also limited, user may want to
Upcoming appointment is shortly checked after a request is made.

Advantageous embodiments may include one or more of following characteristics.For example, technology disclosed in this document can be with
Delay is reduced, reliability is improved and improves efficiency of the processing such as to user's request of the request of digital assistants.In some numbers
In assistance system, the processing of user's request, which may cause, prevents user from making prolonging for additional request before completion first is requested
Late.Some digital assistants are inputted using voice is handled based on client and based on the combination of the process of server, are caused in visitor
The delay repeatedly communicated to and fro between family end equipment and server.Client device may need first network back and forth with by language
Sound data are sent to server then to receive the transcription of voice data for speech recognition.Once client device processing turns
The text of record may then need the second network round-trip, so that the locally applied of client device communicates with back end application server
And it receives and confirms from application server.Delay may be very serious, especially when third-party server response is slow or temporarily can not
Used time.These network operations may cause voice request and requested movement plus the time needed for each phase process
Undesirable delay between completion.These delays may prevent user from being performed simultaneously other tasks, because with digital assistants
Dialogue generally can not continue, the processing until completing current request.
Asynchronous process technology discussed below can reduce or eliminate user's delay experienced, and can permit user
Continue the dialogue with digital assistants before having executed the requested movement of current request.It can be from requesting asynchronous hold accordingly
Action is made, this separates the execution time of movement with the dialogue carried out with assistant.The period that movement can also be applied, make
It obtains and asynchronous execution reliably occurs without making troubles to user.
For at server the disclosed technology of asynchronous process voice command can also increase the reliability of digital assistants
And flexibility.Some digital assistants manage or initiate the movement of user's request dependent on client device.Certain movements may
Need to install specific application on a client device to execute movement.But if client device lacks processing appropriate
Ability, do not install application appropriate or it is not appropriately configured acted with execution, then possibly can not execute the movement of request.It is taking
Reliability can be improved in execution movement on business device, because executing the function independent of client device.This allow digital assistants with
The platform required with lower hardware and software (may be answered including such as wearable device or suitably without what is acted for processing
Embedded device) it is used together.
For example, user can say the received order " bread is added to shopping list " of wrist-watch by user.Wrist-watch is not
It needs to include list management application to execute operation, acts because one or more servers can execute and also make new list
Information is synchronous with the user equipment with list management application.As a result, using the asynchronous execution based on server of movement, it can
It is full but regardless of client device to make any request that server may be implemented to digital assistants at any client device
The ability requested enough.
Disclosed technology can also improve the efficiency of response user's request.Server, which can create, will represent many users
The movement queue of asynchronous execution.Due to movement be asynchronous execution, execute delay may according to user request amount and
Difference, without will affect user experience.Processing delay to user be it is hiding, allow server to pass through and act over time
It executes to handle the request of bigger peak volume.Although allowing some delays, the retardation of each movement may be restricted.It can
Occurred within the period of such as 5 minutes or 15 minutes or another period with requiring to act, with offer " soft " or approximate real time
It executes.
The technology also improves the treatment effeciency at user equipment.Due to the execution of server process voice command,
User equipment needs to carry out less processing.It reduce power consumption and extend battery life, at the same enhance digital assistants with
The ability that the equipment of such as wrist-watch or other wearable devices with limited processing capacity is used together.
In addition, the asynchronous nature of processing can permit device cache interaction or the low connectivity of processing.It can be in equipment
Creation command queue of place, is then sent to for executing later.Lacking still can connect with the equipment of server connectivity
It receives and orders and store them, server is then sent them to after restoring connectivity for handling.Equally, if the first clothes
Business device is attempted to execute movement using not available third-party server, then first server can postpone or retry the movement, directly
To acting successfully or need to notify user's failure.

Movement etc..
Network 106 may include public and/or dedicated network, and may include internet.
Technology disclosed in this document can reduce delay, improve reliability and improve the efficiency of processing user's request, all
Such as to the request of digital assistants.In some digital assistants, the processing of user's request, which may cause, prevents user from completing
The delay of additional request is made before first request.Some digital assistants use the processing based on client and based on server
Combination inputs to handle voice, leads to the delay repeatedly communicated to and fro between client device and server.Client is set
It is standby to need first network back and forth to send speech data to server then to receive voice data for speech recognition
Transcription.Once the text of client device processing transcription, then may need the second network round-trip, so that the sheet of client device
Ground, which is applied to communicate with back end application server and receive from application server, to be confirmed.Delay may be very serious, especially works as third
When square server responds slow or temporarily unavailable.These network operations may be led plus the time needed for each phase process
Cause the undesirable delay between voice request and the completion of requested movement.These delays may prevent user from being performed simultaneously
Other tasks, the processing because dialogue with digital assistants generally can not continue, until completing current request.
Asynchronous process technology discussed below can reduce or eliminate the delay of user's experience, and can permit user and exist
Continue the dialogue with digital assistants before having executed the requested movement of current request.It can be from corresponding request asynchronous execution
Movement, this separates the execution time of movement with the dialogue carried out with assistant.The period of movement can also be applied, so as to
Asynchronous execution reliably occurs without making troubles to user.
For at server the disclosed technology of asynchronous process voice command can also increase the reliability of digital assistants
And flexibility.Some digital assistants manage or initiate the movement of user's request dependent on client device.Certain movements may
Need to install specific application on a client device to execute movement.But if client device lacks processing appropriate
Ability, do not install application appropriate or it is not appropriately configured acted with execution, then possibly can not execute the movement of request.It is taking
Execution movement improves reliability on business device, because executing the function independent of client device.This allows digital assistants and tool
There is the platform of lower hardware and software requirement (including such as wearable device or the appropriate application that may be acted without being used for processing
Embedded device) be used together.
For example, user can say the received order " bread is added to shopping list " of wrist-watch by user.Wrist-watch is not
It needs to include list management application to execute movement, because one or more servers can execute the movement and also make newly to arrange
Table information is synchronous with the user equipment with list management application.As a result, using the asynchronous execution based on server of movement,
Any request that server may be implemented can be made to digital assistants at any client device, but regardless of client device
How is the ability of satisfaction request.
Disclosed technology can also improve the efficiency of response user's request.Server, which can create, will represent many users
The movement queue of asynchronous execution.Since movement is asynchronous execution, the delay executed may be according to the amount of user's request
And change, without will affect user experience.Processing delay be to user it is hiding, allow server by operating over time
Execution handle the request of bigger peak volume.Although allowing some delays, the retardation of each movement may be restricted.
It can require to act and occur within the period of such as 5 minutes or 15 minutes or another period, with offer " soft " or approximate real
Shi Zhihang.
The technology also improves the treatment effeciency at user equipment.Due to the execution of server process voice command,
User equipment needs to carry out less processing.It reduce power consumption and extend battery life, at the same enhance digital assistants with
The ability that the equipment of such as wrist-watch or other wearable devices with limited processing capacity is used together.
In addition, the asynchronous nature of processing can permit device cache interaction or the low connectivity of processing.It can be in equipment
Creation command queue of place, is then sent to for executing later.Lacking still can connect with the equipment of server connectivity
It receives and orders and store them, server is then sent them to after restoring connectivity for handling.Equally, if First
Server is attempted to execute movement using not available third-party server, then first server can postpone or retry the movement,
User's failure is notified until acting successfully or needing.
In the example of fig. 1, user 102 is issued to digital assistants using user equipment 104 and is requested.The request is provided to
Server system 110, server system 110 determine that the movement that user 102 requests can asynchronously be executed with request.As a result,
Before executing requested movement, server system 110, which sends instruction to user equipment 104, will execute requested movement really
Recognize.This allows user while server system 110 concurrently manages the execution for the movement having requested that do to digital assistants
Further request out.Although movement is asynchronous execution, the timing of 110 pairs of server system execution applies constraint, makes
It must act and occur in reasonable time amount (such as in maximum time period).
In more detail, in stage (A), user equipment 104 receives user's request from user 102.User 102 can make
To the request by the digital assistants function that user equipment 104 accesses or is provided by user equipment 104.User 102 can be to appoint
What various ways call number assistant, such as says popular word, presses onscreen button, press and hold the Home button, hold
Row gesture.User can input (input such as keyed in or voice input) by the user of any appropriate type and ask to make
It asks.In the example shown, user 102 says voice command 108, " the prompting of setting 4:00 tomorrow afternoon." inspection of user equipment 102
Voice is surveyed to input and record the audio data for indicating voice command 108.
In stage (B), the data for indicating user's request 115 are sent server system 110 by user equipment 104.Example
Such as, when making the request as voice input, user equipment 104 can provide audio data for the language of user.Audio number
It exports or mentions according to the audio-frequency information that can be the audio volume control, compressed format that are recorded by user equipment 102 or from the audio of record
The information taken such as indicates the data of such as phonetic feature of mel-frequency coefficient.
In stage (C), server system 110 explains user's request 115 to determine that user 102 has requested that is executed
Movement.Server system 110 can also be determined about the other details that how should execute movement.Server system 110 includes
The request interpreter module 120 of analysis request.In some implementations, request interpreter module 120, which obtains, indicates that user asks
The text asked.For voice request, request interpreter module 120 that can obtain the reception audio from automatic speech recognizer
Transcription can be provided by server system 110 or another system.
Then, request interpreter module 120 extracts information from request to determine the parameter of request.For example, can identify
The type or classification of requested movement.Request interpreter module 120 can parse the request of user and identify that instruction is different dynamic
Term, phrase or the mode of work.For example, the mapping between accessible term and type of action, and module 120 can be used
It maps to search the appropriate type of action of the item of user's request.As another example, known language can be used in the text of request
Method indicates the request to certain form of movement.When user's request is with a syntactic match, can choose corresponding to grammer
Type of action.As another example, classifier or machine learning system can analyze the request to determine that user 102 has asked
Anything has been asked to act.
In the example of fig. 1, the transcribed text " prompting of setting 4:00 tomorrow afternoon " of voice command 108 is analyzed.Request
Interpreter module 120 determines that the request is the type of action for " prompting ".The type of action is from including calling, electronics postal
It is selected in the set of multiple predetermined action types of part, prompting, search, calendar, text message etc., wherein each type of action
It is associated with one or more keywords or grammer.Also other kinds of movement can be used.For example, system 110 can be matched
It is set to reception and handles the request about home automation, such as opening and closing lamp or electric appliance or locking, unlock, opening
Or close door.Determine that the certain types of movement of the interaction request of user and digital assistants can assist in how to handle this later
Request.
In some implementations, request interpreter module 120 determines the other parameters of the requested movement of user 102.
For example, the text requested by analytic representation user, determines how instruction executes the data of the details of movement.In showing for Fig. 1
In example, request interpreter module 120 for example determines in the general category that " prompting " acts that movement is related to setting based on item " setting "
Set new prompting.This help to define requested specific action and by its with also belong to " to remind " type of action other are dynamic
It distinguishes.For example, reminder application can permit some set of actions, such as setting is new to be reminded, changes the time reminded, changes
Prompting is cancelled in the description of prompting.The field for requesting interpreter module 120 that can for example provide by Application Programming Interface (API)
Or it inputs and determines what information is reminder application use, and determine corresponding value based on the analysis requested user.As another
Example, request interpreter module 120 can determine that requested prompting is for date " tomorrow " and time " 4:00 in afternoon ".Often
A type of action can have the associated data type of the characteristic for specifying the movement of the type of action or the collection of field
It closes.The data of the accessible storage of interpreter module 120 are requested to determine which parameter is related to type of action, and are also determined
Which parameter is indicated by the text that user requests.
In some implementations, specific application, application type or the service of requested movement will be executed by identifying.Example
Such as, specific action type can be associated with one or more application or service.In some implementations, type of action is corresponding
In single application or service.For example, can identify the respective application for being able to carry out the movement when user's request is reserved at the restaurant
Or service.Similarly, for the request of setting calendar appointment, request can be identified as corresponding to " calendar " type of action.?
Before request, " calendar " type of action can be associated with calendar application or service, so that it is dynamic to execute calendar when a request is received
Data type appropriate, the data format etc. for making to need are available.
In stage (D), server system 110 is it is determined that the request synchronization relative to user still asynchronously executes use
The movement of family request.Server system 110 can select execution type appropriate based on the characteristic of requested movement.Example
Such as, server system 110 can be determined based on other of type of action or movement characteristic movement whether be classified as will with
The movement of family request asynchronous execution.
It is generally desirable to some movements (such as making a phone call or obtain search result) to execute without delay by user.Other movements
(such as setting calendar appointment) does not need to be immediately performed.The moderate retardation that calendar appointment is arranged will not usually make troubles to user,
As long as the movement executes before the time of plan and before the appointment on the day of user opens calendar to check.For synchronize
Or when asynchronous execution distribution movement, it is also contemplated that other are required, such as requirement for the third party system of execution movement.Example
Such as, for needs, (such as in air ticket, film seat or dining room, reservation is freed for before other people purchases with having of short duration time-out
Most two minutes) the movement that is communicated of third-party server, it may be necessary to it is synchronous to execute.Before receiving user's request,
These and other factors can be used and preassign which movement or type of action should use asynchronous execution.Additionally or as replacing
In generation, can carry out Consideration in response to receiving user's request.
Come as an example, execution selector module 122 can be used in server system 110 in the movement for executing user's request
Different mode between selected.Execute the accessible distribution data 130 of selector module 122, the distribution data 130 instruction
Which type of action is specified for synchronization process and which type of action is specified for asynchronous process.For example, in Fig. 1
Distribution data 130 each type of action be mapped to synchronous execute (" S ") or asynchronous execution (" A ").The information can with
It predefines and stores before the request of family, but also can according to need and be updated and change.In the example shown, data are distributed
The movement of 130 instruction " prompting " type of action is specified for asynchronous execution, therefore executes selector module 122 and determine that user asks
The asynchronous execution asked is appropriate.
Whether execution selector module 122 can execute extra process suitable to verify asynchronous execution.For example, even if request
Movement belong to the type for generally being suitable for asynchronous execution, the specific detail of request is it is also possible that it is less suitable.For example, being next
Week setting calendar appointment may not be time-critical, but appointment close after request is arranged in may will increase using different
Step processing may not execute the risk of the movement fast enough.It is contemplated that the timing demands of user's request, and select when needed
Synchronization process is to ensure to execute in time.
For everything type or it can be separately provided predetermined time window for specific action type, so that needing
The movement occurred in time window is synchronous execution, even if they are suitble to asynchronous executions to be also such.It can be according to execution
Time quantum needed for asynchronous behavior is arranged the time window, for example, indicate the execution of the prior actions for asynchronous execution
The average or worst case time.It can specify specific time, such as requested 1 hour away from user or requested 4 hours away from user.
As another example, needs be can choose and acting the requested movement executed on the same day to execute for synchronous.Asynchronous place
Managing reasonable time window can be identical for everything type, or can be different for each type of action
, or specific action can be arranged.
In the example of fig. 1, once executing selector module 122 determines that " prompting " type of action is specified for asynchronous place
Reason, module 120 is also by the period (for example, same day) of the time (for example, tomorrow afternoon 4:00) of prompting and time range limitation
It is compared.Due to acting the execution on the same day not needed in request, executing the confirmation of selector module 122 should be using dynamic
The asynchronous execution of work.If reminding prompting of the action request in (for example, on the same day) the limitation period, selection is executed
The possible alternative synchronization process of device module 122, to minimize user because using the possibility of asynchronous process to postpone without convenient
Risk.
The other modes for determining and asynchronously or synchronously executing can also be used.As an example, classifier or a system can be used
Column rule determines that asynchronous execution is appropriate for requested movement.As another example, executing selector module 120 can be with
One or more scores are generated, reflects the time sensitivity of for example requested movement, dived by postponing to execute to user
A possibility that estimation retardation inconvenient, may being occurred by asynchronous execution, asynchronous execution are made troubles to user, etc..
Then score can be compared with one or more threshold values, to determine asynchronously or synchronously to execute whether be best suited for being requested
Movement.
In stage (E), server system 110 generates the confirmation message that instruction will execute requested movement.Instead of true
Recognize and have been carried out the movement, confirmation message acknowledges receipt of request and/or promises to undertake executes the movement in the future.As a result, can be not
The execution of waiting movement provides confirmation in the case where completing.The content of confirmation message can be generated based on requested movement.Example
Such as, the movement reminded for setting, can be generated Message-text 132, and such as " good, I reminds setting." can be with such as
Any form appropriate of text data, audio data or both provides message.Text can be used to language in server system 110
Sound module 124 come generate including Message-text synthesis language audio data 134.
In some cases, indicate that the initial confirmation for acting execution is used as the main confirmation to user 102, and most
Additional confirmation is not automatically provided later according to promise execution movement eventually.It in other cases, can holding in response to movement later
Row is requested in response to the user of the state about movement, provides the additional confirmation that execution acts to user 102.
In stage (F), server system 110 will confirm that message 136 is sent to user equipment 104.Then, user equipment
104 will confirm that and be output to user 102.In the example shown, confirmation message 136 includes audio data 134, and user equipment
" good, I reminds setting to audio of 104 outputs with synthesis voice." confirmation message 136 may include Message-text 130,
And user equipment 104 can additionally or alternatively show Message-text 130, to provide confirmation to user 102.
Because server system 110 asynchronously handles the execution of requested movement, the execution of movement will not be prevented
Input or processing to additional customer's request of digital assistants.User 102 can be before or while executing requested movement
Continue the dialogue with digital assistants.In addition, being executed due to acting by server system 110, execution does not consume user equipment
Process resource or power supply on 104, and execute any specific hardware or software requirement for not requiring user equipment 104.This increases
The operation of the strong user equipment limited with limited processing capacity and/or battery electric power.It can also improve the flexible of system
Property, because executing the configuration and function independently of user equipment.The equipment of any appropriate type can be used in request asynchronous execution
Movement, regardless of whether user equipment is mounted with that the locally applied of requested movement can be executed.
In stage (G), server system 110 corresponds to what user requested by being written in data-storage system 142
Action data 140 starts to execute the process of requested movement, and data-storage system 142 can be database, table, file
System or other data-storage systems appropriate.Action data 140 may include the record of the specified specific action to be executed,
For example, the information determined by request interpreter module 120.Action data 140 can also include the identity or use of instruction user 102
The user identifier of family account.In general, action data 140 may include with the execution of specific user 102 institute for request action
The data acquisition system of adequate information needed for the movement of request.The information for the request action that can will be used for many different users is interim
It is stored in data-storage system 142, until the asynchronous process of execution.
In some implementations, the action data 140 of movement is appointed as corresponding to specific dynamic by data-storage system 142
Make type.Can by by action data 140 it is associated with corresponding type of action in a manner of store action data 140.For example, can
Think the code or label of the distribution instruction type of action of action data 140.As another example, action data 140 can store
In the region of data-storage system 142 corresponding with type of action.Data-storage system 142 may include that each correspondence is different
Multiple data storage areas of type of action, shown in column as shown in figure 1.Action data 140 for movement is stored in for phase
It answers in the data storage areas of type of action.For example, the action data 140 for " prompting " movement is stored in as " prompting " movement
In specified region.
The stored write request of action data 140 is allowed to trigger other processes of the execution of promotion movement.As above
Described, each type of action can be associated with the application or service of the movement for executing the type.Different applies kimonos
Different types of input data or different data formats can be used in business.Each type of action can have specific software mould
Block 146a-146d or " plug-in unit ", for promoting and executing the application of the movement of the type or the communication of service.Different are moved
Make type allows server system 110 various dynamic using different applications or service execution using individual module 146a-146d
Make type.Module 146a-146d is separated also to make it easier to identify and correct problem and update the processing of each type of action.?
In some implementations, module 146a-146d can be the magnitude of about 100 line codes.Each module 146a-146d can be by
It is configured to turning to the data format about movement into request appropriate, and the remote procedure call with format data is sent
To server appropriate to execute movement.As a result, server system 110 can be by running module corresponding with type of action
146a-146d is come the execution for each movement for instructing user 102 and other users to request.
In order to dispatch the asynchronous execution of many movements by different user request, buffering is can be used in server system 110
Device or queue carry out priority ranking to execution.In Fig. 1, server system 110 uses fifo queue 148, squadron
Each of column 148 indicate the movement for being selected as asynchronous execution but having not carried out.When the movement for requested movement
When data 140 are written into data-storage system 142, the token 150 for movement is added to queue 148.The token 150 can be with
Including the reference to corresponding action data 140.Server system 110 is by the item in the sequential processes queue 148 of add-ins.Example
Such as, processing token 150 can be related to executing the module 146c for the type of action for corresponding to action data 140.As a result, in processing team
After delay when other in column 148, calling module 146c is to use the action data 140 to generate remote procedure call
API Calls or other requests for executing the movement that user 102 requests.In this example, module 146c is configurable to generate correspondence
The request of prompting is set or adjusted with server 112.
In stage (H), server system 110 is arranged for carrying out the time-constrain of the movement of user's request.By applying
Retardation caused by server 112 can be alterable height, especially for third-party application server.In order to ensure being asked
The movement asked occurs in required time quantum, server system 110 be request setting the period 152, for example, timeout period or
Maximum allowable time amount.As an example, server system 110 can permit most two minutes or five minutes or some other have
The time of limitation carrys out execution.Can be for the length of everything type overall situation setting period 152, or can be directed to
The length of period 152 is separately provided in specific action type or specific application servers.
In stage (I), the request 160 generated by module 146c is sent application server by server system 110
112, and application server 112 executes the movement of user's request.In some instances, application server 112 is for third
The back-end server of Fang Yingyong.Once application server 112 is for example, execute user by being arranged to remind for the user 102 in Fig. 1
The movement of request, the data for prompting movement are stored in such as cloud storage by application server 112.Application server
112 can be with user equipment 104 and other users equipment synchrodata associated with the user account of user 102.As a result,
The movements for such as making list, setting calendar appointment, setting prompting or alarm and other movements can be taken by one or more
Business device executes, and result is synchronous with any appropriate equipment of user 102, therefore any shape needed for equipment local memory device
State or configuration information.In some implementations, other than the synchronization of application server 112 or instead of application server
112 synchronization, server system 110 can be to receive the data that go to user equipment when the confirmation of the completion to movement same
Step.
Confirmation 162 also is sent to server system 110 using 112, to indicate when to complete the execution of requested movement.
The state of the monitoring of server system 110 request 160 executes confirmation to ensure to receive within the period 152 for movement setting.
When receiving confirmation within the period 152, server system 110 can be confirmed with log recording and terminate tracking movement.If
Confirmation is not received within the period 152 of setting, then server 110 can retry request 160.Additionally or alternatively, it takes
Device system 110 of being engaged in can send message to user equipment 104, to indicate that request has been delayed by user 102.For example since first
Begin request 115 or request 160 is sent to after the certain time amount from the time of application server 112, server system
110 can notify user that requested movement has failed, and the movement will not carry out as previously described.
System 100 can track the state of each user's request, and be configured as providing if request to user 102
Status information.For example, user 102 can inquire digital assistants " my prompting has been set? " server system 110 can be examined
Log or record are looked into determine the movement of user's request, identifies the movement (for example, request that nearest setting is reminded) being involved,
And determine the state of request.Then, server system 110 can provide the message of such as text, Composite tone or both, instruction
Whether movement has been performed.
In some implementations, in addition to or instead of using the data storage 142 of server system 110 and queue 148 it is slow
Except the request of punching, the request of 104 interruptible customer of user equipment.For example, the buffering of user's request can extend in user equipment
The session proxy realized on 102.When user equipment 102 needs to act using server execution but when dialogue in user does not have
When internet connects, the buffer in equipment is can be used in client device 102.For example, after user 102 says order,
User equipment 104, which can be confirmed, receives input, and indicates to handle in the future.User equipment 104 can continue to receive volume
Outer order and storing data, until available with suitably connecting for server system 110.Once establishing connection, user equipment 104
It can be communicated with server system 110 with for explaining and handle request, or can directly and application server communication.
In some implementations, user equipment 104 executes some or institute for being described as being executed by server system 110
It is functional.For example, client device 104 may include speech recognition module, Text To Speech module and explain that user requests
And determine the whether suitable software of asynchronous execution.As another example, server system 110 can be used in client device 104
Speech recognition is carried out to be transcribed, but explains user's request and the execution of management action.As a result, in some implementations
In, user equipment 104 can explain that user requests and provides a user confirmation message independently of server system.Then, user
Equipment 104 can manage the execution of the Asynchronous Request of buffering, including monitoring the request to server and verifying in timeout period
It completes, while digital assistants concurrently receive other requests from the user.Client device 104 may include that local data is deposited
Storage and queue or other buffers, to manage the movement for the asynchronous execution for being related to one or more application server.In some realities
In existing mode, client device 104 manages network connectivity interruption and the delay of application server 112 using buffer requests
Or it is unavailable.For example, although requested movement can be appointed as being best suited for synchronous execution, it should with execution determining
When the connectivity of application server needed for movement is unavailable, client device 104, which can store, causes the movement to execute later
Data.For example, can be placed on task in the buffer of being completed for task with scheduler task, it is set as in response to restoring
Connectivity and occur, and/or be set as retrying in special time period.Multithreading or multi-process can be used in client device 104
Technology is come while receiving and meeting other users request.
Fig. 2 is another exemplary figure for showing the system 100 of the asynchronous process for user's request.In the figure 2 example,
User 102 requests the movement for being not classified as wanting the movement of asynchronous execution.As a result, although server system 110 can be asynchronously
Movement is executed, but alternatively synchronously processing acts the selection of server system 110.Fig. 2 also shows data flow, such as stage
Shown in (A) to (G), data flow is indicated.Stage, (A) to (G) can be occurred in the order shown, or with different from shown sequence
Sequence occurs.For example, some stages can concurrently occur.
In stage (A), user 102 says voice command 208, " calling Joe ", refer to user contact person it
One.At stage (B), user equipment 104 will include being used to the request 215 of the audio data of voice command 208 be sent to server
System 110.At stage (C), server system 110 executes speech recognition to received audio data, then explains request.Service
Device system 110 determines that request 215 corresponds to " calling " type of action, and recipient is " Joe ".
In stage (D), the access of server system 110 distribution data 130 simultaneously determine that " calling " type of action is designated to use
In synchronization process.User does not welcome the delay for initiating to call usually, therefore synchronization process is most suitable.
In stage (E), server system 110 determines the confirmation message with text 232 " Calling Joe ".Text
It is used to generate the audio data 234 of the synthesis language including confirmation message to voice module 124.In stage (F), server system
System 110 sends confirmation message 236, may include text 232 and/or audio data 234, at user equipment 104
Output.
Server system 110 also generates and sends action command 238, and action command 238 includes true by analysis request 215
Fixed action message 240.Action message 240 can indicate the other parameters of type of action and institute's request action.For example, movement refers to
Enabling 238 can indicate that request 215 is to initiate the request of call, and recipient is " Joe ".In some implementations,
Action command 238 can indicate that user equipment 104 should call to execute the specific application of the movement or service.For example, movement
Instruction may include application identifier or server address, to indicate how user equipment 104 should execute movement.
Then, user equipment 104 to execute requested movement.For example, being used in response to receiving action command 238
Family equipment 104 can open phone application, for example, being confirmed as associated with " calling " type of action or by action command 238
Specified phone application, the contact person record of the telephone number of access instruction contact person " Joe ", and initiate to call.User sets
Standby 104 also export confirmation from server system 110, for example, audio is shown and/or played from confirmation message 236.Additionally or as
Substitution, user equipment 104 can export the confirmation to the phone application for initiating calling.It is opposite with process shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 2
Process execute movement dependent on user equipment 104, therefore it is required that user equipment 104 have for execute installation with it is appropriately configured
Movement correct application.Therefore, it is executed for synchronous, user equipment 104 is by generating request to back-end server and same
Step data carrys out the execution of management action.
When the requested movement of synchronous execution, data initially can be locally saved in user equipment by user equipment 104
104, rather than data are initially updated and stored at server system 110 or application server 112.Then, user equipment
104 initiations are synchronous with the other equipment of user 102.For example, if the prompting that user 102 please look for novelty or the change to list,
Then the application on user equipment 104 can update or generate the prompting or table data that are stored at user equipment.It therefore, can be with
The local list at user equipment 104 is updated before instruction server changes.In some instances, user equipment 104 can be with
It generates and sends request to back end application server 112 appropriate to execute requested movement.
In the figure 2 example, user equipment 104 rather than server system 110 are responsible for executing movement, including take with application
Any communication of business device 112, and if user equipment 104 encounters mistake or is fitted without application appropriate, execute row
It is dynamic to will fail.In addition, in general, usually preventing digital assistants function from receiving new request when executing current request.As a result,
The delay that execution is acted or communicated with application server 112 may make user 102 input the energy force delay newly requested.However, because
For synchronously trial acts with request, so can notify any mistake encountered to user 102 before entering request later
Accidentally.
Once user equipment 104 performs requested movement, user equipment 104 is just initiated and server system 110
Data are synchronous.For example, the application of user equipment 104 can send the data of prompting or annotation that instruction updates, and instruction is together
Step occurs.Then, server system 110 sends other users equipment for new data to complete synchronizing process.However, because should
Process needs the communication between user equipment 104 and server system 110, so if user equipment 104 it is not appropriately configured or
Network access is lost, then synchronizing may failure.It answers the local of unreliably execution movement or synchrodata on user equipment 104
With the change that may finally can not carry out user's request.In contrast, in the example of fig. 1, the management of server system 110 is asked
The execution for the movement asked.As a result, server system 110 and/or application server 112 obtain the data for indicating any update, and
And it can be unrelated with the configuration of user equipment 104 or ability with the data of other users equipment synchronized update.
In the figure 2 example, user equipment 104 is responsible for executing requested movement.In general, once call it is locally applied,
It may seldom or be at all completed without monitoring operation.Some applications may be not configured as when executing and simultaneously operating to number
Assistant's confirmation.As a result, if locally applied be not appropriately performed the movement, or if application server 112 causes to postpone
Or mistake, then the movement may not occur.In the example of fig. 1, because server system 110 monitors application server
112 request, so server system 110 for example can receive confirmation by verifying, request application server when needed
112 retry actions and if baulk to user 102 send notify, assist in ensuring that application server 112 execution asked
The movement asked.Therefore, do not depend only on it is locally applied and associated 112 be it is fault-tolerant, but the asynchronous process of Fig. 1 increase
The additional monitoring rank for the reliability for having added the movement for improving user's request to execute.
In some implementations, for the example of any one of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 or both, server system 110 is used
Additional information is come it is determined that synchronization still asynchronously executes requested movement.For example, user equipment 104 can send instruction
The contextual information of its current context.The contextual information may include that such as instruction is visible on the display of user equipment 104
The data of item, instruction installation or the data of application run, etc. on user equipment 104.Server system 110 can be assessed
Contextual information simultaneously determines whether current context will change the predetermined distribution of the execution pattern of institute's request action.For example, item is added
Request to list is not usually time-critical, therefore " list " can be acted and be appointed as being suitable for asynchronous execution.However,
When user keeps list visible, user is it is generally desirable to see that new item is added in list, rather than potential delay.As a result,
In order to provide a user better experience, when request " list " movement and contextual information instruction " list " application is currently running
When, server system 110 can choose synchronous execution rather than asynchronous execution.This will most rapidly send the explanation of request to
User equipment 104 allows user equipment 104 to update potentially visible list without delay.
Fig. 3 is the flow chart for showing the process 300 of the asynchronous process for user's request.Process 300 can by one or
Multiple processing equipment executes.One or more processing equipments may include client device, server system or client device
With the combination of both server systems.In some implementations, the movement of process 300 can be by client device or server
System specially executes.As additional examples, processing equipment can be mobile phone, smart phone, personal digital assistant (PDA),
Music player, E-book reader, tablet computer, wearable computing devices (such as wrist-watch, glasses or necklace), meter on knee
Calculation machine, desktop computer or other portable or fixed calculating equipment.As additional examples, processing equipment can be equipment
Particular procedure core, etc. in central processing unit (CPU), CPU.As described above, these technologies can be by Fig. 1's and Fig. 2
Server system 110 executes, and helps the movement that user's request is executed at user equipment 104.
Receive the data (302) of user request of the instruction to digital assistants.Exist for example, server system can receive instruction
The data for the user's request made at client device.When digital assistants receive voice input, received data may include
The audio data of user speech is described.When digital assistants receive text input, text can receive.
Determine movement (304) corresponding with user's request.For example, voice can be executed to the audio data that voice inputs
Identification, to determine the text of user's request.Text be can analyze to determine the movement of request.For example, system can determine it is multiple
Which of predetermined classification or type of action are suitable for the request.It can be for example, by by the one of text movement different from being used for
A or multiple modes or grammer are compared, parse the word or expression or other technologies of text and identification corresponding to specific action
To determine from the text of request and act.
Determine that movement is classified as that the movement (306) of asynchronous execution can be requested with user.For example, can suitably distribute
Certain movements or type of action are for either synchronously or asynchronously executing.In some implementations, system determines that movement corresponds to spy
Determine type of action.Access distribution data, indicate whether to be assigned with the different operation type either synchronously or asynchronously executed with request.Base
In distribution data, system can determine specific action type be designated as can with request asynchronous execution.As another example, may be used
To specify certain applications or service for asynchronously or synchronously handling.System can determine which application or service execution operation, and
It is asynchronously or synchronously executed based on corresponding application or services selection.
Other factors can be considered when determination is synchronous or asynchronously execution movement.For example, equipment can determine quilt
It is classified as being suitable for the movement of synchronous execution.However, equipment can determine that the movement is related to the communication with server, and the net
Network connectivity temporarily disconnects or server currently respond it is slow or unavailable.As a result, alternatively, equipment can for example pass through by
Task is placed in buffer or queue or execution later is arranged asynchronously to execute movement to determine.In this way it is possible to
Asynchronous execution is selected to be not classified as being suitable for the movement of synchronous execution, such as first time trial execution movement or first
Beginning synchronizing process fails to retry after execution movement.
Similarly, factor the movement for being classified as be suitable for asynchronous execution can synchronously be executed based on one or more.
In some implementations, it can analyze the parameter of requested movement to determine whether being asynchronous hold by the classification of motion
Row.For example, it may be determined that time corresponding with requested movement, such as time of plan generation event or output.It can be with
The time is compared with another time or period, corresponds to whether the time of requested movement is away from current to determine
At least minimum amount of time of time (for example, time of request).If corresponding to the time of requested movement in threshold time
Before, then the movement can be classified as synchronizing execution rather than the movement of asynchronous execution.
In some implementations, indicate the information of the situation of client device for dividing requested movement
Class.For example, if user requests to determine that the movement of operation or visible application on a client device, the movement can be divided
Class is for synchronizing execution rather than the movement of asynchronous execution.
Confirmation message is sent at client device for exporting (308).For example, being based on it is determined that asynchronous execution is dynamic
Make, system can provide the confirmation message that instruction will execute request in the future.This confirmation can be provided before the operation is performed.At certain
In a little situations, server system provides true before request is by another server system (such as application server) execution movement
Recognize.
In order to provide confirmation, the text of confirmation message can be determined.It includes closing that text-to-speech system, which can be used for generating,
At the audio data of voice, and audio data for example can be supplied to client device by network.
So that movement asynchronously executes (310) with user's request.It can be by the execution of movement and user and digital assistants
Dialogue separation allows other requests to digital assistants independently and concurrently to receive and handle with the first request.Therefore, exist
Before executing the requested movement of the first user request, it can receive one or more other users from user to digital assistants
Request.Similarly, it can be executed before executing the first user and requesting requested movement and one from user to digital assistants
A or multiple other users request corresponding movement.
In some implementations, first server system can indicate the record of requested movement by storage to make
It must act and be performed.Based on the record stored, first server system can be generated later and be sent out to second server system
Send request to request second server system to execute movement.
In some implementations, server system storage will be in the data-storage system with multiple data storage areas
The record of the movement of middle execution.Each of data storage areas can have associated software module, deposit for handling data
Record in storage area domain.For example, the region of data-storage system can be selected based on the identified action.It can send and be used for
Store the write request of the data about the movement in selected region.In response to write request, remote process can be issued
It calls to execute software corresponding with the selected region of data-storage system.Using the software of execution, can be generated pair
The request of application server execution movement.
In some implementations, the super of completion is acted by sending request, setting that execution acts to server system
When the period, determine movement before timeout period terminates complete and store instruction execute the movement data, execute movement.
In some implementations, the number of second user request of the instruction to digital assistants is received at client device
According to.Determine the second movement for corresponding to second user request.It is asynchronous to determine that the second movement is not classified as requesting with second user
The movement of execution.Based on determining that second acts the movement for being not classified as requesting asynchronous execution with second user, can make
Second movement is synchronously executed with user's request.After the completion of synchronous execute, confirmation can be provided to client device.
In some implementations, the number of second user request of the instruction to digital assistants is received at client device
According to.Determine the second movement for corresponding to second user request.It is asynchronous to determine that the second movement is classified as to request with second user
The movement of execution.Based on determining that second acts the movement for being classified as request asynchronous execution with second user, it is dynamic to initiate second
The execution of work.Determination is not carried out the second movement in timeout period.As a result, for the output of client device, to provide instruction second dynamic
The execution of work failure news.In some implementations, it can repeatedly be tasted before instruction acts and failed
Examination attempts have corresponding timeout period every time to execute movement.
