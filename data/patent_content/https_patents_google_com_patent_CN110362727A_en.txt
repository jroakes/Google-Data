For example, user interface 200 may include selection icon 220, which indicates that third party it is expected that use is looked into when being selected
Ask context parameters.Certainly, the other of such as drop-down list, multiple radio buttons or some other selection methods can be used
Selection method.For the parameter from inquiry, user interface 200 allows the parameter of third party's input such as title and type
Attribute.Therefore, user interface 200 may include 230 attribute of 225 attribute of parameter name and parameter type.Parameter name 225 and inquiry
The variable part of template 215 is corresponding.Preferably, third party is that each variable part 217 in query template provides title 225
With type 230.Title 225 and type 230 can define parameter so that it can make in the operation part that third party searches for application
Be involved.In some embodiments, parameter name 225 is matched with the corresponding variable part in query template 215.Example
Such as, variable part 217 is " $ destination ", is matched with title 225 " destination ".Parameter can have string, number or real
The type 230 of body.
Substance parameter is parameter corresponding with the entity in such as datagram (datagram 124 of such as Fig. 1).Work as third party
When selecting to have the parameter of entity type, user interface 200, which can provide, allows third party to specify parameter corresponding to what kind of
The parameter attribute of entity.For example, it is people, place, event, film etc. that user interface 200, which allows third party's designated entities,.So
And since third-party application is by sandboxed, so third-party application can not directly access datagram.Therefore, search system can mention
For allowing third party to search for the function or processing of application request entity identifier corresponding with special parameter.The identifier returned
It can be used as the keyword for entering data storage.(such as it is available from www.Freebase.com's when datagram is based on common source
Freebase datagram) when this is particularly effective.
User interface 200 may also allow for third party to provide one or more data storages.Data store (also referred to as data

In positioning or some other files for the entity identifier for determining the parameter obtained from inquiry.Third party can recognize one or more
Parameter, and search system can be associated by the identifier that the parameter and third party are searched for application and in search system
Place stores the parameter to register the parameter.
Application, the also registrable one or more tables of data (515) of search system are searched in order to assemble third party.Tables of data can
It include electrical form for generating the data of inquiry response to be.Tables of data can also be separate text file, XML file,
Or any other method for search system being supplied to from third-party data.In electrical form or separate text file
In, the first row of tables of data can be used for definition column.As an alternative, search system can for example be come using the user interface for collecting the information
The part that column are defined as location registration process is obtained from third party.Third party can be via the user interface (user interface of such as Fig. 2
200) information about tables of data is provided.Search system can be by related to the identifier that the third party searches for application by tables of data
Join and stores the tables of data at search system to register the tables of data.In some embodiments, tables of data can be stored
In the addressable memory of search system.
Application, the also registrable instruction that inquiry response is generated using parameter of search system are searched in order to assemble third party
(520).Described instruction be may include the calculating executed using parameter, access the instruction of tables of data and format inquiry response
Instruction.In some embodiments, third party can provide instruction via user interface (for example, user interface 200 of Fig. 2).
In some embodiments, search system can limit the type to the available instruction of third party.For example, third party can be limited to pair
The column execution character string and numerical operation of the parameter or the tables of data.In some embodiments, search system can provide
So that third party searches for application can obtain the function of data from another data source (such as datagram 124).In some embodiment party
In formula, third party is searched for using before query engine is used, can verified by the operator of search system by third party
The instruction of offer.
In some embodiments, described instruction can be default instruction provided by search system.For example, described instruction
It can be such instruction, assume that incoming parameter is key value, by the first row of the parameter and indicated tables of data
Match and generate the response of the value including inquiry and the secondary series in the tables of data.The response can be "<inquiry>
<secondary series>" format.For example, it may include query template " the mac keyboard shortcut of $ cmd " sum number that third party, which searches for application,
According to table, which is the value of $ cmd in first row, is corresponding shortcut key in secondary series.This third party search is answered
With inquiry " the mac keyboard shortcut of compulsory withdrawal " may make third party to search for application and generate response " the mac key of compulsory withdrawal
Disk shortcut key is command-option-esc ".
Described instruction, which may also include, to search for the instruction that the provided inquiry response of application formats by third party.Inquiry is answered
Answer the natural language querying response that can be direct response inquiry.The response may include sentence, paragraph or string, term list,
Or dictionary including natural language response, the Anchor Text that links and link deeply with the depth that response is display together.The response
It may include the text for indicating the parameter value for generating the response.In some embodiments, deep link may include from inquiry or
Inquire the parameter that context extracts.Deep link can be parsed to traditionally unavailable in the case where no third-party data collection
Third-party website in the page.Search system can by will instruct with third party search for application identifier it is associated and
Store instruction carrys out register instruction at search system.
In some embodiments, search system can be tested before making third party's search application can be used for generating inquiry response
Third party is demonstrate,proved to search for using (525).For example, search system can be opposite for the associated query template of application is searched for third party
The query generation search result answered.If searching for the website of association with third party in search result or URL being unsatisfactory for arranging
Name threshold value, then search system can disable the third party and search for application or third party search application may make to be not useable for this and look into
It askes in engine.For example, search system can disable query template so that query engine never calls the third party to search for application.
As another example, search system can execute third party in sandbox environment and search for application to determine that third party searches for
Using which resource of consumption.In sandbox environment, search system firmly controls third party and searches for which money application is able to access that
Source.For example, search system can ensure that third-party application is only able to access that parameter information, searches for third party and apply associated number
According to table and specific function.Even if executed in sandbox environment, if third party searches for application consumption excess resource, search
Cable system can also disable the third party and search for application.As another example, if third party, which searches for application, spends overlong time,
That is, not providing inquiry response in predetermined time amount, then search system can disable the third party and search for application.Verify third party
Search application may include these and other measurement to ensure that third party searches for using the response of high quality is provided, and search without will affect
Cable system or user experience.In some embodiments, each third party searches for when application makes a change third party and can hold
The row verifying.Then assemble and have authenticated the end of processing 500 that third party searches for application.
Fig. 4 is returned to, in the case where at least one third party searches for application in place, search system be can then respond in inquiry
Query calls third party provided by requestor, which searches for, applies (410).It is stored according to provided parameter and third party's data
In value, the third party that is called, which searches for application and can provide for the inquiry or not provide the inquiry of third party's formatting, to be answered
It answers.When the more than one query template of querying triggering, search system can also call more than one third party to search for application.Search
The response that system can format third party includes in the search result for being supplied to inquiry request person, as above for Fig. 3 institute
It discusses.
Fig. 6, which is illustrated, to be looked into consistent searched in query time using third party of disclosed embodiment using to provide
Ask the flow chart of the example process 600 of response.The executable processing 600 of search system (search system 100 of such as Fig. 1), as
A part of the step 410 of Fig. 4.For example, in addition to search index document and being directed to search result of the query generation based on segment
Processing other than or replace the processing, search system can be received from inquiry request person inquires and executable processing 600.Processing
Whether 600 can trigger third party by determining inquiry is searched for application to start (605).In order to determine whether inquiry triggers third party
Search application, the query template that search system can search for application for third party assess inquiry.For example, search system can determine
In second part situation corresponding with the variable part of the query template (if present), whether the first part of the inquiry
Match the immutable part of the query template.In some embodiments, if the immutable part phase of inquiry and query template
Matching is corresponding, then inquires and can trigger third party's search application.As another example, search system may include to the inquiry
Natural language processing and sentiment analysis consider the context of prior queries to determine whether the inquiry triggers third party's search and answer
With.For example, if the prior queries of requestor are " how is the weather in New York " and current queries are that " have therefrom to London
How far ", then before determining whether inquiry is corresponding with query template, prior queries are can be used which city determined in search system
City replaces " there " to substitute into inquiry for pronoun " there " and with " New York ".As another example, if inquiry is " tomorrow
Go to the cinema ", then search system can substitute into date " tomorrow " in inquiry.
In some embodiments, optionally, search system can execute additional inspection before triggering third party searches for application
It looks into.For example, search system can verify that the website for searching for association with third party in appearing in response to inquiring from index document
Search generate search result.This can ensure that the theme of third party's search application and inquiry is closely related.In some embodiment party
In formula, this only can just be executed in the case where the ranking signal that website or third party search for application is lower than threshold value.If website
It does not appear in search result, then querying triggering third party searches for application.In some such embodiments, inquiry is not triggered
Third party searches for application, unless website has minimum ranking signal in search result.
If inquiry searches for without triggering third party and applies (605, no), then handling 600 terminates, without providing third grid
The inquiry response of formula.But search for if inquiry triggers third party really and apply (605, yes), then search system can be from looking into
It askes and extracts relevant parameter (610).The variable part of query template can be used to extract for the parameter.For example, with query template
The second part of the corresponding inquiry of variable part can be extracted and be used as the parameter identified in the variable part of query template
Value.Search system can also extract relevant parameter (615) from the context of inquiry.If third party indicates that expectation is searched in third party
These parameters are used in, then can extract these parameters, as the item 220 above for Fig. 2 discusses.Search system then can
It calls third party's search system and any extracted parameter is passed into third party and search for using (620).Search system can
Third party is executed in sandbox environment searches for application to limit third party's search available resource of application and ensure that third party searches
Suo Yingyong will not bring adverse effect to search system.Third party's search is applied the trustship at search system and is executed, to make
Obtaining need not be with the server or site communication hosted by third party.It reduce inquiry time delay and allow search system more firmly
Ground controls third party and searches for using performed movement.
Search system can determine that third party searches for whether application provides response (625).For example, third party, which searches for application, to be returned
Make the return trip empty character string, so that instruction is without generating response.In addition, being answered if third party's search application fails to provide in time period
It answers, then search system can be no longer waiting for, and be can determine and be will not provide response.If third party searches for application and provides response
(625, yes), then search system can be supplied to inquiry request person (630) for response as a part of search result.Institute as above
It states, which is that natural language response that is application formatted and providing is searched for by third party.
If search system determines that third party searches for application without providing response (625, no), then handling 600 terminates, and
The inquiry response not formatted to search result addition third party.Certainly, search system can search for application for multiple third parties
Simultaneously or sequentially reprocess 600.In other words, if the more than one third party of querying triggering searches for application, search system
Application can be searched for from multiple third parties, and the more than one third party inquiry response formatted is provided.It can simultaneously, one by one
Ground or various third parties is called to search for application according to these combination.
Fig. 4 is returned to, in some embodiments, search system can also monitor inquiry request person and third party's search using institute
The interaction of the response of offer, to remove unwelcome response or low quality response (415).For example, search system can determine
Whether inquiry request person selects position to search for not as good as third party significantly responds using provided response.Search system is traceable
The number that this case occurs, and if the number meets threshold value, it can reduce and be answered provided by third party's search application
The ranking, reduction and the third party that answer search for the ranking of the website of association, disabling third party searches for application or these group
It closes.In some embodiments, search system can to by third party search for using provided response be supplied to link or its
Its control is to allow inquiry request person's instruction not agree with the response.Search system can be traced ad hoc inquiry requestor and select the chain
It connects or the number of control.If particular requester selection meets threshold value for the link of third-party application or the number of control,
Search system can disable the third party and search for application or reduce the row of the response or website of searching for association with the third party
Name.Therefore, if third direction third party, which searches for application, provides low-quality response, search system be may be selected by from rope
The ranking that the website for searching for association with the third party is reduced in the search result that the corpus of quotation shelves generates punishes the
Tripartite.
In query time and third party is called to search for application simultaneously and with it independently, also receivable pair of search system
The update (420) of tables of data.Search system can provide the third party way of desired such often more new data table to third party
Through, such as use the feeding or continuous updating agreement of such as pubsubhubbub.Which ensure that for generating natural language response
Data be it is new, without to search system bring check update burden.
In addition, search system allows third party to update query template, parameter and searches for application for its third party
Instruction.When search system, which responds, inquires, processing 400 can continue to execute step 410-420.Certainly, one as step 405
Point, search system can be assembled to application is searched for from various third-party many third parties.In some embodiments, it searches
Cable system can assemble ten hundreds of such applications, to provide to ten hundreds of third parties in response to target query
Generate the chance of natural language response.
Although discussed above is the search result of enhancing is provided about for the corpus based on document, third party is searched
Suo Yingyong can also be used for other collections, other collection images or video search, map search, social media search etc..Cause
