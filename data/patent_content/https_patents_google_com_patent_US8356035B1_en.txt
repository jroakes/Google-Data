Definitions
- This specification relates to image annotation.
- Image search engines have become a popular tool on the Internet. These search engines help users find images that match their criteria. Some of these search engines index images by keywords or labels. Such image search engines retrieve images by matching users' search queries against these keywords or labels.
- the keywords or labels for indexing an image can be drawn from text surrounding the image in a webpage or other text associated with the image (e.g., the filename of the image), for example.
- the keywords or labels can provide some indication of the content of an image. For example, an image of a horse can be associated with the keyword “horse.”
- the keywords for an image that are extracted from the text may not be informative or useful. For example, words such as “cool” and “wow” generally are not very informative about the content of an image. Poorly labeled images can degrade the quality of an image search result.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a plurality of images, where one or more of the images are associated with one or more terms; determining degrees of similarity between a plurality of pairs of images in the plurality of images; assigning to one or more of the terms a respective weight with respect to a first image of the plurality of images based at least on the degrees of similarity; and selecting one or more of the terms based on the respective weights of the terms with respect to the first image and associating the selected terms with the respective image.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a plurality of images, where one or more terms are associated with one or more of the images; determining degrees of similarity between a plurality of pairs of images in the plurality of images; generating a weighted graph data structure, where the weighted graph data structure has nodes corresponding to the images and an edge connecting a first node and a second node of the weighted graph data structure has a weight based on a degree of similarity between an image corresponding to the first node and an image corresponding to the second node; propagating the terms to the nodes of the weighted graph data structure based on the weighted edges; and selecting one or more terms for a respective image of the plurality of images based on the propagating and associating the selected terms with the respective image.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying similarities between features of images in a set of images, where the images are associated with one or more terms; representing the similarities in a similarity graph; and using the similarity graph to identify a set of terms for an image search query that will produce a search result that includes similar images.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Images can be associated with one or more terms based on the associations between the terms and similar images.
- the most relevant term for an image can be identified.
- Uninformative or unrelated terms for an image can be identified and disassociated from the image.
- Respective weights can be assigned to terms with respect to an image. The weights assigned to terms can be used to find the best match between search query terms and images.

- the image search engine 104 can determine which terms should be associated with an image based on user testing. For example, the image search engine 104 can show a population of users an image and ask the users to specify terms that come to mind when they see the image and optionally order them. The terms entered by the users provide an indication of what users believe the topics, concepts, or subject matter of the image are. The image search engine 104 can select the most popular of the user-specified terms to associate with the image.

- the image features module 204 identifies features of the images.
- the image features module 204 can determine, for an image, one or more features.
- the image similarity module 206 determines a degree of similarity for pairs of images.
- the image similarity module 206 compares, for any pair of images within a repository or set of images, the features of the images in the pair, as identified by the image features module 204 , and determines a value representing a degree of similarity between the two images in the pair. Further details regarding the identification of features and the determination of the degree of similarity are described below.
- the image similarity graph and term propagation module 208 generates a similarity graph of the images and propagates terms associated with images using the graph.
- a similarity graph as described in this application, is a weighted graph where each node corresponds to an image, and edges between nodes are weighted by the degree of similarity between the images corresponding to the connected nodes. Terms associated with images can be propagated to other images using a similarity graph, further details of which are described below in reference to FIGS. 3-6 .

- Image repository 214 Information regarding the images crawled by the image crawling module 202 , and optionally copies of the crawled images, can be stored in an image repository 214 .
- the image repository 214 is a database (e.g., a MySQL® database) of images and image information.
- the image repository 214 also stores an index of images that have been crawled or received by the image search engine 200 . A copy of an image does not have to be stored at the image repository 214 to be in the index.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process 300 for associating terms with an image.
- the process 300 will be described with reference to a system (e.g., image search engine 200 ) that performs the process.
- images are received ( 302 ).
- the images can be received as part of a crawl of content providers hosting the images.
- the images can be received from an upload of images to the system.
- content associated with the images e.g., webpages in which the images are located
- These received images are eventually indexed by the image indexing module 210 .
- a received image can be associated with one or more terms.
- the image search engine can read the metadata of the image (e.g., filename, Exif data, etc.) for an image and extract any title, description, category, keyword, or other terms from the metadata and associate the terms with the image.
- terms that can be associated with the image can be determined from other content associated with the image (e.g., webpage in which the image is located, anchor text of hyperlink to the image, etc.). Any number of the images can be associated with a particular term, and an image can be associated with multiple terms.
- the terms can be extracted from the metadata or other content associated with the image, without any discrimination as to whether a term is useful.
- an importance or relevance metric can be determined for terms, and terms with values for the metric that are above a threshold or satisfy some criterion are selected and associated with the image.
- the importance or relevance metric is the well-known term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) of the term. For example, say that an image is included in a webpage that includes terms X and Y.
- term X has a TF-IDF with respect to the webpage that is above a predefined threshold and the TF-IDF for term Y is not above the threshold, then term X, and not term Y, is associated with the image.
- TF-IDF as an importance or relevance metric can be useful for removing relatively uninformative terms (e.g., “a,” “the,” prepositions, etc.) from consideration.
- degrees of similarity are determined for pairs of images ( 304 ). That is, an image can be paired with one or more of the other images, and for each pair, a degree of similarity between the image pair can be determined.
- FIG. 4 illustrates block 304 in further detail.
- FIG. 4 will be described with respect to a pair of images “Image A” and “Image B.”
- the described process can be performed on any pairing of images, and thus degrees of similarities can be determined for any number of pairs of images in the received set of images.
- One or more global and/or local features of Image A and one or more global and/or local features of Image B are identified ( 402 ).
- image features include image features based on, for example, intensity, color, edges, texture, wavelet based techniques, or other aspects of the image.
- intensity each image may be divided into small patches (e.g., rectangles, circles, etc.) and an intensity histogram computed for each patch.
- Each intensity histogram may be used as a feature for the image.
- a color histogram may be computed for each patch (or for different patches) within each image.
- a color histogram can be similarly computed to obtain a color-based histogram.
- the color histogram may be calculated using any color space, e.g., the RGB (red, green, blue) color space, YIQ (luma and chrominance), or another color space.
- Histograms can also be used to represent edge and texture information. For example, histograms can be computed based on patches of edge information or texture information in an image. For wavelet based techniques, a wavelet transform may be computed for each patch and used as an image feature.
- the features discussed above represent an exemplary list of possible image features that may be used for determining similarities between images. Other image features may be used.
- the features are identified using the known scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT).
- SIFT scale-invariant feature transform
- An examples of the SIFT technique is described in Lowe, “Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints,” International Journal of Computer Vision , Vol. 60, Issue 2 (2004), pp. 91-110, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- a global feature is a feature that is identified for the image as a whole. For example, a color or intensity histogram of the entire image is a global feature.
- a local feature is a feature that is identified for a portion of the image. For example, a color or intensity histogram of a patch in the image is a local feature.
- features may be computed only for certain areas within images. For example, “objects of interest” within an image may be determined and image features may only be computed for the objects of interest. For example, if the image feature being used is a color histogram, a histogram may be computed for each patch in the image that includes an object of interest.
- Objects of interest within an image can be determined in a number of ways. For example, for color, objects of interest may be defined as points where there is high variation in color (i.e., areas where color changes significantly). Objects of interest can be determined mathematically in a variety of ways and can be based on determining discontinuities or differences from surrounding points.
- the objects of interest are determined based on points of interest (or “keypoints”) identified in the image.
- the SIFT technique is an example of one technique for locating keypoints and objects of interest and features for these keypoints.
- the computed image features are local features local to the keypoints or objects of interest.
- a feature identified for a keypoint include a position (e.g., X-Y coordinates of the image, orientation, and scale (e.g., radius of a patch centered on the keypoint).
- a position e.g., X-Y coordinates of the image, orientation, and scale (e.g., radius of a patch centered on the keypoint).
- Image A is an image of the Eiffel Tower, where the Eiffel Tower takes up a large portion of the image
- Image B is an image of a tourist with the Eiffel Tower in the background, where the Eiffel Tower takes up a small portion of the image.
- keypoint identification points on the Eiffel Tower in Image A and on the Eiffel Tower in Image B can be identified as keypoints. The comparison of these features may indicate that Image B contains an object (Eiffel Tower) that is in Image A, and vice versa.
- the various features described above may be computed using different image scales. For example, an image can be examined and features computed in its original scale and then features may be successively examined at smaller scales. Additionally or alternatively, features may be selected as features that are scale invariant or invariant to affine transformations.
- the SIFT techniques for example, can be used to extract distinctive invariant objects from images. The extracted objects are invariant to image scale and rotation.
- the identified features are compared; the features of Image A are compared to the corresponding features of Image B ( 404 ).
- a degree of similarity (or a “similarity score”) between Image A and Image B is determined based on the comparison ( 406 ).
- a comparison function may be selected.
- a number of different comparison functions may be used to compare images.
- the particular comparison function to use may be decided ahead of time or offline by an administrator.
- the output of the comparison function can be used to determine the similarity.
- the similarity can be a linear combination of the outputs of the comparison functions.
- a comparison function may operate to generate a value defining a similarity between a particular feature computed for two images.
- a simple histogram comparison function which is described in pseudo-code in Table I, below. As shown in Table I, the histogram comparison function returns a value that is the sum of the absolute values of the differences between corresponding bins in the input histograms. Smaller values returned from this function indicate greater similarity between the input histograms.
- the histogram comparison function of Table I is exemplary. It can be appreciated that other comparison functions can be used to compare histograms. For example, squared differences may be used rather than absolute differences, bin correlations may be taken into account instead of absolute differences, or percent differences may be used instead of absolute differences. Additionally, for image features other than those based on histograms, different comparison functions may be used.
- image features module 204 and image similarity module 206 may function in a realtime mode to determine pairwise degrees of similarity for a set of input images, such as images received from a crawl by image crawling module 202 .
- the similarity between Image A and Image B is a linear combination of scores from comparisons between corresponding features of Image A and Image B.
- An example implementation is shown in pseudo-code in Table II, below.
- each feature F A of Image A is compared with every feature F B of Image B that is the same feature type.
- F A is a color histogram then the comparison is performed with the color histogram features of Image B, if F A is an edge histogram then the edge histogram features of Image B are compared, etc.
- each image feature is weighted equally.
- different features may be weighted differently. For example, color-based features may be less important than intensity or edge-based features. Accordingly, a features similarity score may be multiplied by a weight that reflects the importance of the particular feature.
- the degree of similarity between two images is calculated as the number of shared keypoints (i.e., keypoints whose feature(s) match) divided by the total number of keypoints.
- Table II can be relatively computationally expensive if repeated for many images, as it requires N 2 comparisons for a set of N images, and for each comparison, M i *M j feature comparisons, for M i and M j local features in each image.
- Techniques are known that may potentially accelerate this type of operation. For example, one such technique is described in Grauman et al., “The Pyramid Match Kernel: Discriminative Classification with Sets of Image Features,” Tenth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (October 2005), Vol. 2, pp. 1458-1465.
- FIG. 4 was described with respect to a single pair of images, Image A and Image B.
- the process described can be repeated for any number of unique pairs of images amongst a set of multiple images, where each image in the set can be paired with each other image in the set.
- a degree of similarity can be determined for each unique pair of images among the set.
- degrees of similarity can be calculated for a subset of all of the unique pairs of images in the set of images.
- the image pairs for which a degree of similarity is to be calculated can be a random sample of all of the unique pairs of images in the set; the degrees of similarity for the rest of the pairs can be approximated by other less computationally expensive metrics (e.g., a shortest path between two nodes, in an image similarity graph (e.g., similarity graph 600 (FIG. 6 )), corresponding to the respective images in a pair, etc.).
- a shortest path between two nodes e.g., similarity graph 600 (FIG. 6 )
- weights with respect to an image of the image set are assigned to the terms ( 306 ).
- the weights are assigned based at least on the degrees of similarity as described in reference to block 304 .
- FIG. 5 illustrates block 306 in further detail.
- FIG. 5 is described with respect to an exemplary Image A in a set of exemplary Images A-E, as described in reference to FIG. 6 .
- An image similarity graph data structure is generated ( 502 ).
- the image similarity graph includes a node for each image in a set of images (e.g., the images received by the image search engine 200 ).
- the image similarity graph is weighted; an edge in the graph is associated with a weight.
- An edge connecting two nodes in the similarity graph is weighted based on the degree of similarity between the images corresponding to the connected nodes.
- the edge weight is the degree of similarity (or similarity score) as determined in block 304 .
- the edge weight is a function of the degree of similarity.
- the graph includes “injector” nodes which act as the term nodes; the terms initially associated with the images are initially associated with the injector nodes in the graph rather than the image nodes.
- the graph can be generated by the system to include image nodes and injector nodes.
- the corresponding node is associated with the terms.
- a term associated with a node can have a weight with respect to the node.
- the similarity graph 600 includes nodes A, B, C, D, and E, corresponding to images A, B, C, D, and E, respectively.
- the graph also includes injector nodes 602 , 604 , 606 , and 608 .
- the graph includes edges between some pairs of the nodes. For example, the edge connecting A and B has a weight of 0.1; the degree of similarity between Image A and Image B is 0.1. As another example, the edge connecting B and D has a weight of 0.9; the degree of similarity between Image D and Image B is 0.9.
- Terms are propagated through the similarity graph ( 504 ).
- a term associated with one node is propagated to another node in the similarity graph.
- a term weight is adjusted by the weight of the edge through which the term is propagated. For example, in the graph 600 , an edge of weight 0.5 connects node C and node A.
- Node C is associated with the terms “france” and “arc de triomphe” with some weight for each (e.g., 1).
- the terms “france” and “arc de triomphe” are propagated from node C to node A through the edge connecting C to A, and the weights of the term propagated from node C to node A are adjusted by the weight of 0.5.
- a term's weight at node C is multiplied by the weight of the edge from C to A to get a weight for the term at A.
- a term is assigned a weight with respect to Image A based on weights of edges connected to the node corresponding to the initial image ( 506 ). As described above, as a term is propagated through the graph, its weight is multiplied by the weight of an edge it is propagated through. With respect to Image A, the weight of a term propagated to node A is multiplied by the weight of an edge connected to the node A.
- one or more terms are associated with node A, with each term having a weight that is calculated based in part on the weights of one or more of the edges connected to the initial image node (e.g., based on the sum or product of the edge weights, which can be normalized). In other words, the weights of the terms are affected by the degrees of similarity between Image A and other images. Further details regarding the term weights are described below in reference to FIG. 6 .
- one or more terms are selected for an image based on the term weights with respect to the image, and the selected terms are associated with the image ( 308 ).
- an image can be associated with one or more terms. A subset of these terms can be selected and associated with the image.
- the top X highest weighted terms with respect to the image is selected, where X is any predefined integer of 1 or larger.
- any term with a weight with respect to the image that is higher than a predefined threshold is selected and associated with the image. It should be appreciated that the image can be associated with a term with which it was not originally associated before the propagation process.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example image similarity graph 600 .
- the image similarity graph 600 includes image nodes 612 , 614 , 616 , 618 , 620 , corresponding to images A, B, C, D, and E, respectively.
- the image nodes 612 , 614 , 616 , 618 , 620 are referenced below as nodes A, B, C, D, or E, respectively.
- Nodes A, B, C, D, and E are connected by edges. Each edge in the graph can be weighted by the degree of similarity between the images corresponding to the nodes connected by the edge.
- the graph 600 is fully connected, i.e., each image node is connected to each other image node by a weighted edge.
- the graph need not be fully connected; some edges can be omitted or elided.
- an edge is elided if its weight (i.e., the degree of similarity or a value that is a function of the degree of similarity) is not above a specified threshold.
- the similarity graph includes edges for image pairs that meet some minimum level of similarity.
- the edges in the similarity graph can be a random subset of all of the possible edges in the graph.
- the edges in the graph 600 correspond to the subset of unique image pairs for which degrees of similarity were determined, as described above in reference to FIG.
- an edge connects two nodes corresponding to a pair of images for which a degree of similarity was determined.
- the similarity graph is a maximum spanning tree.
- the dotted lines in graph 600 represent the edges that are elided.
- the edges in graph 600 have respective weights.
- the edge connecting A and B has a weight of 0.1
- the edge connecting A and C has a weight of 0.5
- the edge connecting B and E has a weight of 0.3
- the edge connecting B and D has a weight of 0.9
- the edge connecting C and E has a weight of 0.1.
- the edges between image nodes are undirected (i.e., bi-directional). In some other implementations, the edges between the image nodes are directed (i.e., unidirectional). Images can be compared based on how much of one image is in the other, and an edge can be directed based on the comparison. For example, an edge between Image A and Image B can be directed from Image A to Image B if an object that takes up a large portion of Image A is also in Image B and takes up a small portion of Image B. In graph 600 , the directed edges have an arrow end indicating the direction, while the edges without arrow ends are undirected.
- the graph 600 includes one or more injector nodes 602 , 604 , 606 , 608 .
- An injector node is connected to an image node by a directed edge of weight 1, directed from the injector node to the image node.
- An injector node can inject term weights into an image node.
- the terms at an injector node connected to an image are the terms initially associated with the image and which are derived from the image metadata or from other content associated with the image, as described in reference to block 302 ( FIG. 3 ).
- injector node 602 injects weights for terms “paris,” “france,” and “eiffel tower” into node A; the image corresponding to node A is associated with the terms “paris,” “france,” and “eiffel tower.”
- injector node 604 injects weights for terms “paris” and “uncle leo” into node E.
- Injector node 606 injects weights for terms “paris” and “arc de triomphe” into node D.
- Injector node 608 injects weights for terms “france” and “arc de triomphe” into node C.
- Node B is not connected to an injector node; image B is not initially associated with a term.
- the graph does not include injector nodes; the terms associated with an image are directly associated with the corresponding image node.
- a term weight at an injector node can be 1 for each of the terms at the injector node. In some other implementations, some terms at an injector node may be more heavily weighted than other terms at the injector node, to reflect the importance of certain terms. For example, at injector node 602 , the term “paris” may have weight 1, term “france” may have weight 1.5, and term “eiffel tower” may have weight 2.
- the weights at an injector nodes are normalized so that the sum of the term weights is equal to 1.
- weight normalization can be performed by dividing a term weight at a node by the sum of the term weights at the node.
- other functions for normalization can be used.
- the injector node is a source of constant weight to an image node for the terms with which the corresponding image is initially associated.
- Each injector node is connected to an image node by a directed edge of weight 1. The directed edge goes from the injector node to the image node but not the other way around.
- terms are propagated through the graph and weights assigned to the terms in accordance with an algorithm described in pseudocode below in Table III.
- the algorithm then proceeds to an iterative loop.
- the iterative loop can iterate indefinitely, for a specified number of times, or until each term weight at all of the nodes change by less than a predefined difference threshold. In some implementations, the loop iterates for 1000 times, as shown in Table III.
- weights at the injector nodes remain the same throughout the iterative loop. This is indicated by the initialization, at each iteration t, of the term weight at t+1 to be equal to the term weight at t for terms at the injection nodes. Further, the term weights at the injector nodes are not affected by term weights at the image nodes because the edge between an injector node and an image node is unidirectional; a term can propagate from an injector node to an image node, but not the other way around. Optionally, the term weights at the injector nodes are normalized before the beginning of the iteration loop.
- the weight (n l,t+1 ) for each term at each image node for the next iteration of propagation is initialized to 0.
- the terms at a node are propagated to other nodes and weights are assigned.
- the weight of a term for use in the next iteration (t+1) is the sum of the products of w mn and m l,t for all nodes m connected to node n, where w mn is the weight of the edge connecting m to n, and m l,t is the weight for term l at t.
- node n for this operation cannot be an injector node because there are no nodes connected to an injector node (due to the directed edge from the injector node to an image node but no edge in the other direction).
- the term weights at the image nodes are normalized.
- weights at the image nodes are initialized and, optionally, the term weights at the injector nodes are normalized.
- the term weights at each node after the initialization and normalization are as follows:
- a B C D E 602 604 606 608 paris 0 0 0 0 0 0.333 0.5 0.5 0 france 0 0 0 0 0 0.333 0 0 0.5 eiffel tower 0 0 0 0 0 0.333 0 0 0 uncle leo 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.5 0 0 arc de 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.5 0.5 triomphe

- weights for term “france” for the next iteration is initialized to 0. Then, weights for term “france” from nodes connected to node A is added to the weight. Note that the weights from the nodes connected to node A are adjusted by the weights of the respective edges to node A. For example, the weight from node C is adjusted by multiplying it by 0.5, which is the weight of the edge connecting node A to node C (i.e., the degree of similarity between the image corresponding to node A and the image corresponding to node C).
- this weight and other term weights in the graph 600 are normalized.
- the normalized term weights are the following:

- the iteration loop can iterate indefinitely, until the specified amount of iterations has run, or until each respective term weight changes between iterations by less than a predefined difference threshold.
- the predefined difference threshold e is 0.00000001.
- the loop can stop when the absolute value of the difference between the term weights for a term at a node for iterations t+1 and t is less than or equal to ⁇ for all nodes and all terms in the graph.
- the algorithm in Table III propagates terms to the image nodes of graph 600 and assigns weights. Even for a node that was not associated with any term before the algorithm, the algorithm can propagate terms to that node. After the loop has stopped, for a node, each term has a weight. After the iterations have run, the image search engine can select, for a node, a subset of the terms to associate with the node. In some implementations, the search engine can select the top Y highest weighted terms with respect to the node, where Y is an integer 1 or greater.
- the terms “paris” and “france” would be selected and associated with the image corresponding to node A because these two terms are the 2 highest weighted with respect to node A.
- all terms whose weights with respect to the node meet or exceed a predefined minimum weight threshold are selected and associated with the node.
- the terms associated with a node, and thus associated with the image corresponding to the node can be used as keywords for the image in an image search engine or as targeting keywords for advertisements.
- the image search engine can use the a priori terms or the terms selected as a result of the term propagation algorithm. It should be appreciated that the set of a priori terms and the set of terms selected from the term propagation algorithm are not necessarily the same.
- a similarity graph can be generated for a subset of the images in the image search engine and the term propagation algorithm can be performed for the graph of the subset of images.
- the subset of images can be the images from a particular domain or website, images that have a particular characteristic, images from a website that are associated with a particular term, and so forth.
- the similarity graph can include dummy nodes.
- a dummy node behaves like an injector node; the dummy node is associated with a dummy term, which is associated with a weight, and the dummy node injects into the graph the weight of the dummy term.
- the dummy term and its weight is propagated through the graph in the same manner as the other terms and their weights are propagated.
- the additional weight can be used to dilute (by increasing the total pre-normalization weight at an image node) term weights that are propagated from distant nodes, and thus reduce the influence, on the term weights at an image node, of term weights from distant nodes.
- the graph can include a dummy node for each image node or only for the image nodes that do not have a corresponding injector node (e.g., node B in graph 600 ).
- the weights of a term across all injector nodes can be normalized. For example, the weights of the term “paris” at nodes 602 , 604 , and 606 can be normalized so that these weights sum to 1.
- an algorithm for selecting terms for a node using a similarity graph can be used.
- An example is an algorithm based on random walks.
- the algorithm begins by generating the similarity graph 600 , but reversing the direction of any directed edge.
- the edge connecting node A to node 602 is directed from node A to node 602 , rather than the other way around.
- a bi-directional edge is left as is.
- the algorithm proceeds by performing random walks from an image node of interest, i.e., a node for which one or more terms are desired. At each node starting from the node of interest, the edge leading out to the next node is randomly selected.
- the out edge can be selected using the (optionally normalized) edge weights as probabilities. If a walk reaches an image node, the walk is continued until the walk reaches an injector node. When a walk reaches an injector node, a count is incremented for each term that is associated with the injector node, and the algorithm proceeds to perform a new walk starting from the node of interest. A random walk is performed multiple times (e.g., 1000 times, 100000 times, etc.) for each node of interest. The term weights for a node of interest is derived from the proportions of the counts for the terms maintained for the random walks from the node of interest.
