Definitions
- This specification relates to image annotation.
- Text-based image annotation continues to be an important practical as well as fundamental problem in the computer vision and information retrieval communities. From the practical perspective, current image search solutions fail to use image content effectively for image search. This often leads to search results of limited applicability.
- Keywords can be assigned to (or associated with) an image by storing the keywords as metadata in any of a variety of ways, for example, in a digital file that includes the image, in a database with links or references from the keywords to the image, in an XML file with data linking the keywords and the image, or otherwise.
- a data processing apparatus that includes receiving an input image in the data processing apparatus, identifying one or more nearest neighbor images of the input image from among a collection of digital images stored on computer-readable media by operation of the data processing apparatus, in which each of the one or more nearest neighbor images is associated with a respective one or more image labels, assigning a plurality of image labels to the input image, in which the plurality of image labels are selected by the data processing apparatus from the image labels associated with the one or more nearest neighbor images, and storing in a data repository the input image and an association of the input image with the assigned plurality of image labels.
- a computer-implemented method includes receiving an input image, identifying multiple ranked nearest neighbor images of the input image from among a collection of images, in which each of the ranked nearest neighbor images is associated with a respective one or more image labels, assigning a single image label to the input image, in which the single image label is selected from the image labels associated with the multiple ranked nearest neighbor images, and storing in a data repository the input image having the assigned single image label.
- Other embodiments of the foregoing aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- a system in another aspect, includes means for determining that one or more reference images are nearest neighbor images of an input image, the one or more reference images collectively being associated with multiple image labels, and means for assigning two or more image labels to the input image, the two or more image labels being selected from among the multiple image labels associated with one or more reference images.
- Each of the one or more images can be associated with a plurality of image labels.
- the plurality of images can be selected from a single nearest neighbor image.
- Assigning a plurality of image labels can include sorting the multiple nearest neighbor images according to a respective whole -image distance associated with each nearest neighbor image. Each whole-image distance may represent a degree of difference between the input image and a corresponding nearest neighbor image.
- Assigning the plurality of image labels can further include ranking one or more first image labels according to a respective frequency of occurrence in the collection of digital images, in which each of the one or more first image labels is associated with a first nearest neighbor; and assigning at least one of the first image labels to the input image based on the ranking of the one or more first image labels. Assigning the plurality of image labels also can include ranking one or more second image labels, in which each of the second image labels is associated with one or more remaining nearest neighbor image, and assigning at least one of the second image labels to the input image based on the ranking of the one or more second image labels.
- the ranking of the one or more second image labels can include sorting the one or more second image labels according to a co-occurrence of each of the second image labels with each first image label in the collection of digital images.
- the ranking of the one or more second image labels can include sorting the one or more second image labels according to a local frequency of each of the second image labels in the one or more remaining nearest neighbor images.
- the whole-image distance can include a combination of feature distances, each feature distance representing a degree of difference between an image feature associated with the input image and a respective image feature associated with the reference image.
- the image feature associated with the input image and the respective image feature associated with the reference image each can comprise a global image feature.
- the image feature associated with the input image and the respective image feature associated with the reference image each can include a local image feature.
- the whole-image distance can be derived as an average of the feature distances.
- the average can be based on a substantially equal contribution from each of the feature distances.
- the average can based on a weighted contribution from each of the feature distances.
- the weighting for each of the feature distances can be calculated based on the collection of digital images, in which the collection of digital images is a group of training images comprising pairs of similar and dissimilar images.
- At least one of the feature distances can be calculated as a difference between a texture feature of the input image and a corresponding texture feature of the reference image.
- At least one of the feature distances can be calculated as a difference between a color feature of the input image and a corresponding color feature of the reference image.
- image annotation techniques are characterized by a minimal training requirement.
- treating image annotation as a retrieval problem simplifies the annotation process.

- FIG. 2 A is a flow chart providing a general overview of determining the nearest neighbors of an input image.
- FIG. 2B is a flow chart providing an overview of deriving the composite distance.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart providing a general overview of transferring keywords from the nearest neighbors of an input image to the input image.

- FIG. 5 shows an example of image pairs that have zero keywords in common.
- FIGS. 6 and 7 show example images from separate image datasets.
- FIG. 8 shows examples of annotated images.
- FIG. 9 shows examples of annotated images.
- FIGS. 10, 11 and 12 show examples of a first few images retrieved for a number of different keywords in three different image datasets, respectively.
- Image annotation is a difficult task for two main reasons: First, there is a pixel-to- predicate or semantic gap problem, in which extraction of semantically meaningful entities using just low level image features, e.g., color and texture, is difficult. Doing explicit recognition of thousands of objects or classes reliably is currently an unsolved problem. The second difficulty arises due to the lack of correspondence between the keywords and image regions in training data. For each image, one has access to the keywords assigned to the entire image, and it is not known which regions of the image correspond to these keywords. This can preclude direct learning of classifiers in which each keyword is considered to be a separate class.
- This specification describes techniques that are characterized by a minimal training requirement.
- the techniques outperform complex state-of-the art image annotation methods on several standard datasets, as well as a large Web dataset.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example of annotating a test image with keywords.
- a test image 2 Given a test image 2, one can find its nearest neighbor(s) (e.g., first nearest neighbor 10, second nearest neighbor 20, and third nearest neighbor 30, defined in some feature space with a pre-specified distance measure) from a training set 4 of images, and assign some or all of the keywords associated with the nearest neighbor image(s) to the input test image 2.
- nearest neighbor(s) e.g., first nearest neighbor 10, second nearest neighbor 20, and third nearest neighbor 30, defined in some feature space with a pre-specified distance measure
- K-nearest neighbors are used to assign the keywords instead of just the nearest one.
- the appropriate keywords can be assigned to the input image using a greedy approach, further enhancing the annotation performance.
- the K-nearest neighbor approach can be extended to incorporate multiple distance measures, which can be defined over distinct feature spaces. Combining different distances or kernels can yield good performance in object recognition tasks.
- Two different ways of combining different distances to create the annotation methods will be described. The first one computes the average of different distances after scaling each distance appropriately. The second one is based on selecting relevant distances using a sparse logistic regression method known as Lasso. For the regression method, a training set containing similar and dissimilar images can be used. A typical training set provided for the annotation task does not contain such information directly.
- Lasso is trained by creating a labeled set from the annotation training data. Even such a weakly trained Lasso provides good performance.
- image annotation is includes a process of transferring keywords from nearest neighbors.
- the neighborhood structure is constructed using image features, resulting in a rudimentary model that depends on the notion of distances between respective features in an input image and a corresponding reference image.
- FIG. 2 A is a flow chart providing a general overview of determining the nearest neighbors of an input image.
- a server implemented on one or more computers is operable to receive (200) a digital input image. The server may also receive a collection of digital images of which one or more reference images are selected.
- the digital images can be stored in a data repository of the server or on other computer-readable media.
- the server then derives (202) a whole-image distance between the input image and the reference image that is selected from the collection of digital images.
- the whole-image distance represents a degree of difference between the input image as a whole and the reference image as a whole with reference to a plurality of image features.
- the whole- image distance then is stored (204) in a digital data repository of the server.
- Image features can be either global (generated from the entire image), or local (generated from interest points). Examples of global image features include color and texture. Color and texture are two low-level visual cues for image representation. Common color descriptors are based on coarse histograms of pixel color values. These color features can be utilized within image matching and indexing schemes, primarily due to their effectiveness and simplicity of computation. Texture is another low-level visual feature that can be a component of image representation. Image texture can be captured with Wavelet features. In particular, Gabor and Haar wavelets are quite effective in creating sparse yet discriminative image features. To limit the influence and biases of individual features, and to maximize the amount of information extracted, a number of simple and easy to compute color and texture features are employed.
- RGB Red-Green-Blue
- HSV Hue- Saturation- Value
- LAB CIE 1976 L, a*, b* (LAB) color space.
- RGB is the default color space for image capturing and display
- HSV and LAB isolate important appearance characteristics not captured by RGB.
- the HSV color space encodes the amount of light illuminating a color in the Value channel
- the Luminance channel of LAB is intended to reflect the human perception of brightness.
- the RGB feature is computed as a normalized 3D histogram of RGB pixel values, with 16 bins in each channel.
- the HSV (and LAB) feature is a 16-bin-per-channel histogram in HSV (and LAB) color space.
- three distance measures, used for histograms and distributions (AX-divergence, Z;-distance, and ⁇ -distance), were evaluated on the human-labeled training data from the Corel5K dataset.
- the AX-divergence is a non- commutative measure of the difference between two probability distributions. If the two distributions of a discrete random variable are Pl and P2, then the KL divergence is computed as sum i (P 1 [i] * log(Pl[i] / P2[i])).
- L 1 performed the best for RGB and HSV, while AX-divergence was found suitable for LAB distances.
- RGB and HSV distances imply the L ⁇ (Manhattan) measure, and the LAB distance implies AX-divergence.
- Other distance measures can be used as well. For example, in some cases, a cosine distance measure or earth mover's distance (EMD) can be used.
- the texture of an image can be represented with Gabor and Haar Wavelets.
- each image is filtered with Gabor wavelets at three scales and four orientations.
- the twelve response images are divided into non-overlapping regions, and the mean response magnitudes from each region are concatenated into a feature vector (throughout the text this feature is referred to as 'Gabor').
- the second feature captures the quantized Gabor phase.
- the phase angle at each response pixel is averaged over 16 x 16 blocks in each of the twelve Gabor response images.
- These mean phase angles are quantized to 3 bits (eight values), and are concatenated into a feature vector (referred to throughout the text as 'GaborQ').
- the L ⁇ distance is used for the Gabor and GaborQ features.
- the Haar filter is a 2x2 edge filter.
- Haar Wavelet responses are generated by block-convolution of an image with Haar filters at three different orientations (horizontal, diagonal, and vertical). Responses at different scales were obtained by performing the convolution with a suitably subsampled image.
- a Haar feature is generated by concatenating the Haar response magnitudes (this feature is referred to as just 'Haar').
- a quantized version was also considered, where the sign of the Haar responses are quantized to three values (either 0, 1, or -1 if the response is zero, positive, or negative, respectively). Throughout the remainder of this disclosure, this quantized feature is referred to as ⁇ aarQ.'
- the L ⁇ distance is used for the Haar and HaarQ features, as with the Gabor features.
- global image features include: 1) "Tiny Images,” which are images shrunk down to a very small size (e.g., thumbnails) and compared pixel-by-pixel; 2) Gist transforms, which are similar to wavelet transforms and capture responses to steerable filters; 3) distributions of geometric features, such as the statistics of lines or other contours; and 4) histograms of gradient orientations for entire images.
- Other global image features can be used as well.
- the distance measures for the foregoing global image features can include, for example, Ll, L2, KL divergence, cosine and EMD.
- interest point detection in which the location of points or regions in an image which will be useful for matching or comparing between images are identified. For example, corners are common interest points.
- interest point detection techniques include, but are not limited to, edge detection, blob detection, ridge detection and affine-invariant detection.
- feature extraction in which descriptive feature vectors are generated from the interest points. For example, a feature vector can describe the color distribution in the neighborhood of a corner, or the feature vector can describe the angle of the corner.
- other local descriptive features include, but are not limited to, scale-invariant (e.g., SIFT descriptor), rotation-invariant, gradient magnitude, gradient orientation and speeded up robust features (e.g., SURF descriptor).
- each image in the present implementation is represented with seven image features (e.g., 3 color histograms, and 4 texture features).
- the distance between corresponding image features in different images is a "basic distance.”
- composite distance is a distance measure between images that incorporates some or all of the seven features.
- the composite distance can include additional features.
- FIG. 2B is a flow chart providing an overview of deriving the composite distance.
- a server implemented on one or more computers receives (210) an input image and a reference image.
- seven whole-image features are extracted (212) from each of the input and reference images.
- the extracted features include three color features and four texture features.
- the color features include a histogram of image colors in RGB color space, a histogram of image colors in HSV color space and a histogram of image colors in LAB color space.
- the texture features include a vector of the magnitude of the Gabor response, a vector of the quantized phase of the Gabor response, a vector of the magnitude of the Haar response, and a vector of the sign of the Haar response.
- Basic distances then are derived (214) based on the features extracted from the input and reference image.
- the basic distance is the L 1 distance between each of the RGB feature vectors.
- the L] distance is sometimes referred to as the Manhattan or city block distance.
- the basic distance for the HSV color space is the L] distance between the HSV feature vectors.
- the basic distance for the LAB color space is the AX-divergence between the LAB feature vectors.
- the basic distances between the Gabor, GaborQ, Haar and HaarQ features of the input and reference image are determined using the Li distance measurement.
- the distance measures used for each feature were determined by evaluating each feature's performance on a small training set for a few different distance measures, and selecting the best for each feature.
- Distance measures other than Li and AZ-divergence also can be used to compute the basic distances. For example, any Lp distance could have been used, a histogram intersection, or earth mover's distance (EMD), which is a mathematical measure of the difference between two distributions over some region.
- EMD earth mover's distance
- the distances are scaled (216). For each of the seven feature types, the scaling terms are determined from training data that will ensure the basic distances are bounded between 0 and 1, i.e., the basic distances are normalized.
- a simple baseline method includes, for example, a linear combination of basic distances to yield the composite distance measure. That is, the composite distance between the input image and the reference image is the averaged sum of the seven basic distances. Although seven features are used, the algorithm can work easily with any number of features (including one).
- the linear combination is obtained by allowing each basic distance to contribute equally to the total combined distance. This method is called Joint Equal Contribution (JEC).
- JEC Joint Equal Contribution
- the basic distances are combined non- uniformly, giving preference to those features which are more relevant for capturing image similarity, i.e., weighting the basic distances.
- the weights for combining basic distances can be obtained using the sparse logistic regression technique, Lasso.
- the linear combination is based on a max-margin approach as described in Frame et al., "Learning Globally-Consistent Local Distance Functions for Shape-Based Image Retrieval and Classification," International Conference on Computer Vision 2007. If labeled training data is unavailable, or if the labels are extremely noisy, a simple way to combine distances from different features is to use the JEC method, in which each individual basic distance contributes equally to the total combined cost or distance.
- the basic distance, d* hj) is computed between corresponding features f* and / ⁇ in two images I 1 and / 7 .
- JEC where each basic distance is scaled to fall between 0 and 1, each scaled basic distance contributes equally.
- the scaling terms can be determined empirically from the training
- the image annotation scenario should be transformed into something that can be used for Lasso training.
- a new set X is defined, and each data point x; ⁇ Jis a pair of images (I 1 , I j ).
- Lasso
- Equation (a) Given the training data ⁇ (x ⁇ , yi) ⁇ , equation (a) can be solved by converting this into a constrained optimization problem. A linear combination of basic distances using the weights computed in (1) provides a measure of image similarity, so the result is negated to yield the corresponding distance.
- a challenge in applying the foregoing scheme to image annotation lies in creating a training set containing pairs of similar and dissimilar images.
- the typical image annotation datasets do not have this information since each image contains just a few text keywords, and there is no notion of similarity (or dissimilarity) between images.
- any pair of images that share enough keywords are a positive training example, and any pair with no keywords in common are a negative example.
- the quality of such a training set will depend on the number of keywords required to match before an image pair can be called 'similar.' A higher threshold will ensure a cleaner training set but reduce the number of positive pairs. On the contrary, a lower threshold will generate enough positive pairs for training at the cost of the quality of these pairs.
- training samples were obtained from the designated training set of the Corel5K benchmark. Images that had at least four keywords in common were treated as positive samples for training.
- FIG. 4 shows an example of images pairs that have at least 4 keywords, and
- FIG. 5 shows an example of image pairs that have zero keywords in common. Note that a larger overlap in keywords does not always translate into better image similarity, implying that the training set is inherently noisy.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart providing a general overview of transferring keywords from the nearest neighbors of an input image to the input image.
- a server implemented on one or more computers receives (300) an input image and, in some implementations, a collection of reference images. The server then identifies (302) one or more nearest neighbor images of the input image from among a collection of images, in which each of the one or more nearest neighbor images is associated with a respective one or more image labels. The server then assigns (304) a plurality of image labels to the input image, in which the plurality of image labels are selected from the image labels associated with one or more of the nearest neighbor images. The input image having the assigned plurality of image labels then is stored (306) in a digital data repository of the server.
- Metadata containing the labels can be stored with the input image in the repository or elsewhere.
- a simple method to transfer n keywords to a query image / from the query's K nearest neighbors in the training set is disclosed as follows. Let I 1 J G ⁇ ,...,K be the K nearest neighbors of/ in the training set, ordered according to increasing distance ⁇ i.e. Ii is the most similar image). The number of keywords associated with I 1 is denoted by ⁇ I ⁇ .
- the steps of the greedy label transfer algorithm include:
- the label transfer scheme applies all keywords of the first nearest neighbor. If more keywords are needed, then they are selected from neighbors 2 through N (based on two factors: co-occurrence and frequency).
- FIGS. 6 and 7 show example images from two separate image datasets: the Corel5K set and the ESP set.
- the images in FIG. 6 are from the Corel5K dataset which has become the de facto evaluation benchmark in the image annotation community.
- On the left are 25 randomly selected images from the dataset.
- On the right are two sample images and their associated annotations.
- the set contains 5000 images collected from the larger Corel CD set.
- the set is annotated from a dictionary of 374 keywords, with each image having been annotated with between one and five keywords, and on average 3.5 keywords. Out of 374 keywords, only 260 appear in the test set.
- the images in FIG. 7 are from the ESP image dataset. On the left are 25 randomly selected images from the dataset. On the right are two images and their associated annotations.
- the ESP set consists of 21844 images collected from an ESP collaborative image labeling game.
- the ESP game is a two-player game, where both players, without the ability to communicate with each other, are asked to assign labels to the same image. As soon as they have one label in common, they are given credit for successfully labeling the image and are presented with the next image. Thus, at most one label is obtained each time an image is shown to a pair of players. As each image is shown to more players, a list of taboo words is generated. Subsequent players of the game are not allowed to assign taboo words when shown the same image.
- the set used contains a wide variety of images of natural scenes, man-made scenes, and objects annotated by 269 keywords. Each image is annotated with at least one keyword, at most 15 keywords, and on average 4.6 keywords.
- FIG. 8 shows examples of annotated images, i.e., a comparison of predicted keywords against the ground-truth (e.g., human- assigned) keywords for a number of sample images. Since the human-annotations often contain less than five keywords, in some cases JEC predicts keywords that are not in the ground-truth set but correctly describe the image content nonetheless. For example, the first image in the figure is predicted to have the keyword formation. Arguably, this is a correct description of the planes in the image even though it is not one of the human- assigned keywords.
- FIG. 9 shows examples of annotated images.
- the images were annotated using the JEC scheme with the ESP image dataset.
- the predicted keywords using the JEC annotation method do not overlap perfectly with the human annotation, in many cases the "incorrect" predicted keywords correctly describe the image.
- the JEC-assigned keywords arguably describe the image as (or more) accurately than those generated through the ESP game.
- a challenge in the image annotation task is knowing how many keywords are necessary to describe the content of an image. Assigning only 5 keywords during the label transfer stage artificially limits the number keywords that can be recalled correctly for many of the images.
- FIGS. 10, 11 and 12 show examples of a first few images retrieved for a number of different keywords in three different image datasets, respectively. Even for particularly challenging keywords (e.g. cyclist, skull, diagram and tie), many of the top retrieved images are correct. Also, many keywords have multiple meanings, commonly referred to as "word sense". In some such cases, the retrieved images span numerous meanings of the word. For example, the retrieved images for keyword ring in FIG. 12 represent a few different meanings of the word 'ring'.
