- This process is managed by a computer-implemented method, program or application herein called a personal assistant 200 .
- the personal assistant 200 uses information from the user profile 202 and existing calendar events 206 to infer one or more tasks 203 .
- the set of events 206 accessible to the personal assistant 200 may include the set of all existing calendar events, or a subset thereof. As explained below, a respective calendar event may trigger the personal assistant 200 .
- the personal assistant 200 may also use result data from previously inferred tasks or subtasks 211 .
- the personal assistant 200 includes an inference engine that can infer tasks, locations, availability, user preferences and the like according to a customizable set of rules.
- the personal assistant 200 infers a task (i.e., infers that a task should be executed) by evaluating historical data, such as the user profile 202 , the existing calendar events 206 and result data 211 according to a set of customizable inference rules. Based on the user profile 202 , existing calendar events 206 and result data 211 or other user information the inference rules may be customized.
- the inferred tasks 203 may invoke a travel application 208 for making travel arrangements, a contact management system 210 for identifying and communicating with user contacts, or any online or web-based application 212 capable of transmitting and receiving data. These applications are invoked in order to perform the inferred task 203 or a subtask thereof. In addition, the inferred tasks 203 may require invoking multiple instances of the same application to complete all of the subtasks of an inferred task 203 .
- the applications 208 , 210 and 212 may be invoked automatically by the personal assistant 200 or upon user confirmation of the personal assistant's inference.
- the personal assistant 200 may compare data and metadata from a respective calendar event submitted by the user, such as event location and time, with other existing calendar events 206 and/or the user's profile 202 to infer a task 203 and/or to compute whether additional subtasks are needed to complete the inferred task 203 . For example, if a user profile 202 includes a default location in California and the user submits a calendar event 206 having an event location in New York, the personal assistant 200 may infer a travel task 203 by comparing the user default location with the event location.
- the customizable inference rules may include, for example, requiring that a travel application 208 be invoked when the user default location and the event location differ according to predefined criteria. Alternatively, according to one set of rules, the personal assistant 200 may offer to invoke the contact management system 210 to communication with a contact located near the event.
- the personal assistant 200 also can invoke a mapping application 214 .
- the mapping application 214 may be invoked to determine the geocoding (e.g., geocode(s)) specifying an event location or locations identified only by general textual information, such as a place name, street address or the like and to determine the distance between locations. The geocoding may then be added to the event location.
- the mapping application 214 may also be invoked to display results associated with the inferred tasks 203 . For example, if the inferred task 203 requires invoking a travel application 208 to book a rental car for travel between a default location and an event location, the mapping application 214 may display a preferred route and/or driving directions.
- the personal assistant 200 also can access a user contact list 216 .
- Contacts in the contact list may be associated with contact locations.
- the set of customizable rules may require accessing the contact list 216 when the user default location and the event location differ according to predefined criteria.
- the contact list 216 may be accessed to identify contacts located near the event location.
- the contact list 216 may also be accessed to determine event invitees, or potential event invitees.
- the customizable rules may require that when scheduling a remote event, contacts having a contact location near the remote event may be invited to the event, or that such contacts be identified as potential event invitees.
- a list of potential invitees, having contact locations near the remote event may be presented to the user for editing prior to transmission of invitations to the event.
- the events added to the user calendar 201 by the personal assistant 200 can be called task defined events 204 since event parameters, such as event type, time, duration, attendees, invitees or location can be defined by the inferred tasks.

For instance, a set of communication rules associated with a user may set the user's preferred communication time to immediately follow the entry of a new calendar event. However, if the user frequently delays communication about a new calendar event, the confidence rating may approach 0%.
- the default location 310 , travel preferences 312 , and communications preferences 316 may be entered into the system 100 manually by the user or inferred based on available information and a customizable set of rules associated with the user.

Abstract
A computer-implemented method invokes a task when a respective event in a respective user's calendar meets predefined criteria. The method furthermore includes receiving from the task information identifying a second event related to the respective event, and adding the second event to the respective user's calendar. For example, invoking the task may include accessing an application for making travel arrangements, and adding the second event to the user's calendar may includes adding a travel event to the user's calendar. In another example, invoking the task may include invoking a contact application for managing a set of contacts of the respective user. In this example, at least some of the contacts in the respective user's contact list have contact locations.
Description
- The disclosed embodiments relate generally to electronic calendar systems. More particularly, the disclosed embodiments relate to methods, systems, user interfaces and data structures for generating, transmitting and rendering event, presence and location information on an electronic calendar, contact list or map within an integrated time and place management system using time and place information and extensible personalized rules.
- While electronic calendars, including online calendars, are highly useful applications, the event information in a user's electronic calendar is often duplicative of event information the user has entered or generated using one or more other applications (e.g., an application for making travel arrangements or an application for buying tickets to an event). It would be highly desirable if the event information generated by other applications could be automatically added to a user's calendar, thereby relieving the user of the need to manually re-enter the event information into the calendar. In addition, it would be desirable for other applications to be able to use the information in a user's calendar to assist with the planning of related events. Furthermore, it would be desirable for the sharing of information between a calendar application and other applications to be personalized in accordance with user selections or actions made in the past. For a better understanding of the aforementioned aspects of the invention as well as additional aspects and embodiments thereof, reference should be made to the Detailed Description of Embodiments below, in conjunction with the following drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the figures.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of asystem 100 for implementing some embodiments disclosed herein. Thesystem 100 may include aserver system 101 connected, via acommunications network 111, to various devices, including one or more client devices or computers 112 (hereinafter “clients”), and anapplication server 116. - The
server system 101 may include various databases 102-106,applications 108 and anetwork communication module 110. The databases may include auser information database 102, acalendar database 104, and optionally,other databases 106 as well. Theuser information database 102 may store user information associated with each user of the system.User information database 102 can include user profiles, user contact lists, user identifiers (hereinafter “user IDs”) and rules associated with the users. A respective user profile can include a default location, travel preferences, history, communication preferences, inferred availability (e.g., availability of the user to receive telephone calls), and inferred locations (e.g., locations of the user at various points in time). Thecalendar database 104 may store calendar information associated with one or more user calendars. Calendar information can include data associated with a particular event in a user's calendar, such as event time, event date, event location, event description, event attendees and event invitees. Calendar information can also include geographical location information (sometimes herein called geocoding), such as one or more geocodes, to supplement the event location information for an event.Other databases 106 could include, for example, a location database, a contact database, or a database used by any of theapplications 108. - The
server system 101 may also includevarious applications 108 on the server. Theserver applications 108 may read and write data to and from the databases 102-106. Theapplications 108 may include a calendar application; a location inference program; mapping applications; a user preference inference program; a user information processing module; a contact management application; electronic communication applications, such as e-mail, chat, pager, instant messaging, and/or voice communication applications, or any subset or superset of such applications, as needed for a particular embodiment. - The
server system 101 may also have anetwork communication module 110 connecting it to thecommunication network 111 and facilitating communication between theserver system 101 and thecommunication network 111. Thenetwork communication module 110 allows for the transfer of information between theserver system 101 and thecommunication network 111. The transferred information may be displayed on theclient application 114 of theclient 112. Theapplications 108 may be connected to thenetwork communication module 110. Thenetwork communication module 110 may allow the databases 102-106 and theapplications 108 to transmit and receive information via thecommunication network 111. - The
communication network 111 may be a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network, a wide area network (WAN), such as an intranet, an extranet, or the Internet, or any combination of such networks. It is sufficient that thecommunication network 111 provides communication capability between theclient 112 and theserver system 101. In some embodiments, thecommunication network 111 uses HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) to transport information using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). The HTTP permits aclient 112 to access various resources available via thecommunication network 111. The various embodiments of the invention, however, are not limited to the use of any particular protocol. The term “resource” as used throughout this specification refers to any document, object, information item, set of information, web-based application or service that is accessible via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and can be, for example, a web page, a text or word processing document, an email message, a voice message, a database, an image, or a computational object. - At least one
client 112 may also be connected to thecommunication network 111. Theclient 112 may be any of a number of devices (for example, a computer, an internet kiosk, a personal digital assistant, a cell phone, a desktop computer, or a laptop computer) and can include aclient application 114 that permits a user to view various resources. Theclient application 114 may be a software application that permits a user to interact with theclient 112 and/or network resources to perform one or more tasks. For example, theclient application 114 may be a web browser (for example, the computer programs available under the trademarks Firefox®, Internet Explorer® or Safari™) or other application that permits a user to search for, browse, and/or use resources, such as one or more web pages, on theclient 112 and/or accessible via thecommunication network 111. - Various other applications and databases may also reside on the client, including some or all of those listed above as
applications 108 and databases 102-106. In some embodiments for example, rather than be included in theuser information database 102 ofserver system 101, a user profile may reside, in whole or in part, on the user'sclient 112. - In addition, at least one
application server 116 may be connected to thecommunication network 111. Theapplication server 116 may host at least one online application 118 (sometimes called a “web-based application”). The online or web-basedapplication 118 may be any application that performs services forclients 112 and communicates with theclients 112 via acommunication network 111. For example, the online or web-basedapplication 118 may be a travel application for searching, scheduling or booking travel arrangements such as airline flights, hotels, rental cars or the like. - The
system 100 allows user information and calendar data to be exchanged between various applications, such as an electronic calendar and a travel application. In particular, as shown inFIG. 2 , information from auser profile 202 can be combined with historical data, such as existingcalendar events 206 and result data from previously inferred tasks orsubtasks 211, to infer and invoketasks 203 and addevents 204 to the user's calendar 201 based on the results of those inferred tasks. This process is managed by a computer-implemented method, program or application herein called apersonal assistant 200. - The
personal assistant 200 uses information from theuser profile 202 and existingcalendar events 206 to infer one ormore tasks 203. The set ofevents 206 accessible to thepersonal assistant 200 may include the set of all existing calendar events, or a subset thereof. As explained below, a respective calendar event may trigger thepersonal assistant 200. In some embodiments, thepersonal assistant 200 may also use result data from previously inferred tasks orsubtasks 211. Thepersonal assistant 200 includes an inference engine that can infer tasks, locations, availability, user preferences and the like according to a customizable set of rules. Thepersonal assistant 200 infers a task (i.e., infers that a task should be executed) by evaluating historical data, such as theuser profile 202, the existingcalendar events 206 and resultdata 211 according to a set of customizable inference rules. Based on theuser profile 202, existingcalendar events 206 and resultdata 211 or other user information the inference rules may be customized. - The
inferred tasks 203 may invoke atravel application 208 for making travel arrangements, acontact management system 210 for identifying and communicating with user contacts, or any online or web-basedapplication 212 capable of transmitting and receiving data. These applications are invoked in order to perform theinferred task 203 or a subtask thereof. In addition, theinferred tasks 203 may require invoking multiple instances of the same application to complete all of the subtasks of aninferred task 203. Theapplications personal assistant 200 or upon user confirmation of the personal assistant's inference. - The
personal assistant 200 may compare data and metadata from a respective calendar event submitted by the user, such as event location and time, with other existingcalendar events 206 and/or the user'sprofile 202 to infer atask 203 and/or to compute whether additional subtasks are needed to complete theinferred task 203. For example, if auser profile 202 includes a default location in California and the user submits acalendar event 206 having an event location in New York, thepersonal assistant 200 may infer atravel task 203 by comparing the user default location with the event location. The customizable inference rules may include, for example, requiring that atravel application 208 be invoked when the user default location and the event location differ according to predefined criteria. Alternatively, according to one set of rules, thepersonal assistant 200 may offer to invoke thecontact management system 210 to communication with a contact located near the event. - The
personal assistant 200 also can invoke amapping application 214. For example, themapping application 214 may be invoked to determine the geocoding (e.g., geocode(s)) specifying an event location or locations identified only by general textual information, such as a place name, street address or the like and to determine the distance between locations. The geocoding may then be added to the event location. Themapping application 214 may also be invoked to display results associated with theinferred tasks 203. For example, if theinferred task 203 requires invoking atravel application 208 to book a rental car for travel between a default location and an event location, themapping application 214 may display a preferred route and/or driving directions. - The
personal assistant 200 also can access auser contact list 216. Contacts in the contact list may be associated with contact locations. In one embodiment, the set of customizable rules may require accessing thecontact list 216 when the user default location and the event location differ according to predefined criteria. For example, thecontact list 216 may be accessed to identify contacts located near the event location. Thecontact list 216 may also be accessed to determine event invitees, or potential event invitees. The customizable rules may require that when scheduling a remote event, contacts having a contact location near the remote event may be invited to the event, or that such contacts be identified as potential event invitees. For example, a list of potential invitees, having contact locations near the remote event, may be presented to the user for editing prior to transmission of invitations to the event. - The events added to the user calendar 201 by the
personal assistant 200 can be called task definedevents 204 since event parameters, such as event type, time, duration, attendees, invitees or location can be defined by the inferred tasks. -
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplaryuser information database 300 having exemplary user records 302-1, 302-2 through 302-y according to some embodiments of the present invention.User information database 300 may represent, at least conceptually, theuser information database 102 of theserver system 101. However, in other embodiments,database 300 may also represent a local database at a client.User information database 300stores user records 302, for example records for user 1 (302-1) through user y (302-y), where y may represent the number of users in the database. - A user record, for example user record 302-y, may include the following data or a subset or superset thereof:
-
- a
user ID 304 that uniquely identifies a particular user (for example, an n-bit binary number, where n is a whole number); - a
contact list 306 that contains contact information for the user (contact information may include information about other system users or persons known to the user and take the form of a buddy list, address book or the like); alternatively,field 306 may contain a link to the user's contact list; and - a
user profile 308 that provides additional information about the user.
- a
- The
user profile 308 may contain the user'sdefault location 310,travel preferences 312,history 314,communication preferences 316,inferred user availability 318, andinferred locations 320. In some embodiments some or all of data 310-320 may be stored in locations outside of theuser profile 308, such as elsewhere in theuser record 302 or in other databases or database partitions. In another embodiment, some or all of the information contained in theuser record 302 may be maintained separately for each user at the user's client. - The
user default location 310 may contain location information including geocoding specifying a particular geographic location and/or more general textual information, such as a place name, street address or the like.User travel preferences 312 may include preferred travel applications, preferred travel providers, preferred travel mode and the like. In some embodiments,travel preferences 312 include a set of rules associated with the user, which may be weighted according to a confidence rating based on user history. For instance, a set of travel rules associated with a user may set the user's preferred mode of travel to automobile when the distance to be traveled is less than 100 miles. If this preferred travel mode has been ratified by the user, the confidence rating may approach 100%. -
User history 314 may include information associated with prior tasks invoked on behalf of the user, prior user actions using a mapping application, calendar or contact management application, or other archival information available to the system and associated with the user.User communication preferences 316 may include links or references to preferred communication applications, preferred communication times, preferred contacts, preferred communication mode, and the like. In some embodiments,communication preferences 316 include a set of rules associated with the user, which may be weighted according to confidence values, which in turn are based on user history. For instance, a set of communication rules associated with a user may set the user's preferred communication time to immediately follow the entry of a new calendar event. However, if the user frequently delays communication about a new calendar event, the confidence rating may approach 0%. Thedefault location 310,travel preferences 312, andcommunications preferences 316 may be entered into thesystem 100 manually by the user or inferred based on available information and a customizable set of rules associated with the user. -
Inferred user availability 318 may include times when the user may be in the office, at home, available by telephone, available by instant messaging, and the like.Inferred locations 320 may include geocoding for locations specified by the user by imprecise methods and user locations during times when a location is not specified by the user, such as between calendar events and the like.Inferred user availability 318 andinferred locations 320 may be determined by an inference engine according to a customizable set of inference rules as discussed herein. -
FIGS. 4A , 4B and 4C are flowcharts representing computer implemented methods according to various embodiments.FIGS. 4A , 4B and 4C show processes performed by thesystem 100.FIGS. 4A and 4C show processes performed in response to a user'sactions 400 in a calendar.User actions 400 may include viewing a calendar event, adding an event to the user's calendar, changing a calendar event, or the like. This triggers the computer implemented method according to some embodiments. -
FIG. 4A is a flow chart representing a computer implementedmethod 402 according to some embodiments.FIG. 4A shows that the computer implementedmethod 402 is triggered by the user'sactions 400; however, in some embodiments the computer implementedmethod 402 may be initiated by the user. The computer implementedmethod 402 may be executed any number of times. - The computer implemented
method 402 evaluates an event in the user's calendar with respect topredefined criteria 404. The event evaluated may be the event the user last acted upon or an event identified by the user. As discussed above, the predefined criteria may include a set of weighted rules customized for the user. The rules may be weighted by a confidence ratings, which in turn are based on history information or other user information. Evaluating the predefined criteria may include evaluating one or more existing events in the user's calendar. Evaluating the predefined criteria may include analyzing the user profile, the user location, the event location, and locations of at least some of the user's contacts. The user profile may include inferred user preferences based upon prior invocations of a task and/or prior iterations of the computer implementedmethod 402. In some embodiments the analysis of the user location and the event location may include a comparison of the user location and the event location. Evaluating the predefined criteria may also include evaluating history information. The history information may include task results from prior invocations of the task and method results from prior iterations of the computer implementedmethod 402. In some embodiments, evaluating the predetermined criteria may include defining a set of steps for invoking the task. - If the event meets the predefined criteria, the computer implemented method invokes a
task 406. The computer implementedmethod 402 may also determine one or more parameters to supply to an application invoked by the task. For example, based on analyzing the user location and the event location, the computer implemented method may determine departure and arrival airports. This analysis may be based upon an analysis of geocodes associated with each location. As discussed above, invoking thetask 406 may require invoking one or more applications, such as an application for making travel arrangements. In some embodiments, invoking thetask 406 may require invoking a contact application for managing a set of contacts. The task may also require communicating with one or more of a user's contacts, so invoking thetask 406 may also require invoking a communication application for communicating with at least some of the user contacts. In some embodiments, these functions may be performed by a contact management system. The task may also require displaying the location of one or more of a user's contacts, so invoking thetask 406 may also require invoking a mapping application in order to map contact locations. Once the task has been invoked, the user may or may not interact with the applications to complete the task. For example, the user may confirm information supplied by the task to the application within an application form, which may in turn affect the confidence rating of the rule. - Upon completion of the task, the computer implemented
method 402 may receive from the task information identifying a second event related to the evaluatedevent 408. The second event may be, for example a travel event, such as a flight, a meeting event or any other event associated with the first event. The computer implementedmethod 402 then adds the second event to the user'scalendar 410. -
FIG. 4B is a flow chart representing a computer implementedmethod 412 according to some embodiments. The computer implementedmethod 412 may be executed any number of times. The computer-implementedmethod 412 displays a user calendar, including acalendar event 414. The computer implementedmethod 412 then triggers a task with respect to thecalendar event 416. The task may include simultaneously displaying an event location and contact location 418 for one or more contacts, where event location includes information associated with the respective calendar event and contact location includes information associated with a contact in the user's contact list. In some embodiments of the computer implementedmethod 412 the task derives the contact location from information in the contact's calendar. The task may also include using a mapping application to simultaneously display the event location and the contact location. In some embodiments the task may include displaying information about contacts in the user's contact list that meet location criteria related to the calendar event. - In other embodiments, a computer implemented method displays a user calendar, including a calendar event, triggers a task with respect to the calendar event, using a mapping application to simultaneously display event location and contact location, and adding a meeting event to the calendar for a meeting with at least one of the contacts in the set of contacts. The task may include notifying a number of the contacts in the contact list according to predetermined criteria. In some embodiments, the task includes rescheduling a conflicting calendar event according to predetermined criteria, or suggesting to the user the rescheduling of a conflicting calendar event according to predetermined criteria.

FIG. 4C is a flow chart representing a computer implementedmethod 420 according to some embodiments.FIG. 4C shows that the computer implementedmethod 420 is triggered by the user'sactions 400; however, in some embodiments the computer implementedmethod 420 may be initiated directly by the user. The computer implementedmethod 420 may be executed any number of times. - The computer-implemented
method 420 includes receiving an electroniccalendar event form 422. Thecalendar event form 422 is associated with a user's calendar. Then computer-implementedmethod 420 analyzes the calendar, calendar event, anduser profile 424. Based on that analysis, the computer-implementedmethod 420 identifies at least onetask 426 and determines a task parameter for thetask 428. Once the task is identified 426, the computer implementedmethod 420 accesses an online or web-based application to perform thetask 430. The computer implementedmethod 420 also provides the online or web-based application with thetask parameter 432. - Optionally, the computer implemented
method 420 may determine event parameters based on the results obtained from the web basedapplication 434. The computer implementedmethod 420 sends a second electronic calendar entry form to the calendar 436. The second electronic calendar entry form may have multiple fields containing the event parameters. - In accordance with some embodiments, a system for integrated time and place management includes memory, one or more processors, and one or more programs stored in the memory and configured for execution by the processors. The system may include the
client 112, theserver system 101, or both. The programs include instructions for evaluating an event associated with a calendar, invoking a task if the event meets predefined criteria, receiving, from the task, information identifying a second event related to the first event, and adding the second event to the calendar. -
