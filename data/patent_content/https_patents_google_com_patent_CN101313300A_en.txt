Map supplier data
To Chinese address information, can there be two kinds of data: map datum and Yellow Page data.Map supplier data 400 can comprise multiple information.For example, in one implementation, third party's map supplier can provide POI collection (for example enterprise and interested other positions, such as museum, park, hospital, school or the like), and their addresses in Chinese city.Can there be the POI id information that is associated to each POI.Because legal restrictions, the map supplier can not provide latitude and longitude information to each POI.Yet they can be divided into map grid (for example 300 meters grids that multiply by 300 meters), and can provide grid index and program with the distance between computing grid to each POI.Termly (for example every day, weekly, every month or the like) upgrade map supplier data 400, and, can change POI ID at each reproducting periods.
In another is realized, map supplier data 400 can comprise following information: (1) can comprise the standard P OI of enterprise name, address, telephone number and grid index, (2) can comprise the road POI of grid index at the center in street name and street, and/or (3) can comprise the postcode POI of grid index of the approximate center of postcode and postcode.
In another is realized, may there be the problem of relevant map supplier data 400.For example, map supplier data 400 can comprise the part of address but may lose another part of address.For example, because the restriction (for example POI only has 20-30% may have the street Taoist monastic name) of China, map supplier data 400 may be lost the street Taoist monastic name.Therefore, map supplier data 400 may only comprise street name or some the senior summaries of POI.In addition, or or, some POI to map supplier data 400 may lose telephone number.In addition, or or, incorrect by the address possibility form that map supplier data 400 provide.
The Yellow Page data
Yellow Page data 405 can comprise multiple information, and can receive from multiple source (for example third party supplier).For example, in one implementation, Yellow Page data 405 can comprise the address (for example country, city, province) that is used for POI and/or telephone number information, enterprise name, e-mail address, Fax number, station address, CEO name, enterprise's explanation, SIC formula catalogue, type of business or the like.In another was realized, Yellow Page data 405 can not comprise any latitude and longitude information.Therefore, can from map supplier data 400 and Yellow Page data 405, derive the information (for example address, telephone number and map location information) of relevant POI complete (or complete substantially).
The Web document data
Address/POI id information
Address/POI id information 420 can comprise multiple information.For example, POI ID that in one implementation, address/POI id information 420 can comprise from the address that map supplier data 400 are extracted, extracted from map supplier data 400 or the like.In another was realized, address POIID information 420 can include the following information of closing Chinese address: the address date (for example address of POI, center, street) that is provided by map supplier data 400; POI (for example school, park, buildings, hospital or the like), postcode center (i.e. the center in the zone that covers by postcode); Other city in the tabulation that is provided by map supplier data 400 or the like may be provided.
Address FP and POI ID map information
Address FP and POI id information 425 can comprise multiple information.For example, in one implementation, address FP/POI id information 425 can comprise mapping between address fingerprint (FP) and the corresponding POIID or the like.Mapping between address FP and the corresponding POI ID can be used by front-end server 440 and think that each local search results searches POI ID, as hereinafter in detail as described in.In another is realized, can directly derive POI ID, and not need the mapping between address FP and the corresponding POI ID.In this replacement scheme, information 425 can comprise the POI ID of direct derivation.
Although described the exemplary information that is included in map supplier data 400, Yellow Page data 405, Web document data 410, address/POI id information 420 and the address FP/POI ID map information 425 above, but in other were realized, the relevant other or different information that can be used for discerning the address of local search results can be included in the exemplary information.

Index/document library
Can in independent memory device (for example primary memory 330, ROM340 and/or memory device 350), provide index/document library 415.Index/document library 415, as shown in Figure 5, can storage the multiple information relevant with document, Yellow Page data 405 and/or map supplier data 400.For example, in one implementation, index/document library 415 can store the following information of closing Chinese address: the address date (for example address of POI, center, street) that is provided by map supplier data 400; POI (for example school, park, buildings, hospital or the like), postcode center (i.e. the center in the zone that covers by postcode); Other city in the tabulation that is provided by map supplier data 400 or the like may be provided.
In another was realized, as shown in Figure 5, index/document library 415 can comprise [province] field 500, [city] field 510, [district] field 520 and [street] field 530 (can comprise in addition or replace and comprise address field and/or POI file-name field).Following example can be corresponding to the Chinese address information of storage in index/document library 415.
[Beijing] [Xicheng District] [northern gift dirt road]
[Beijing] [Haidian District] [No. 5, Summer Palace road]
[Beijing] [Haidian District] [Peking University] and
[Jiangsu Province] [Nanjing] [Gulou District] [Han Zhonglu]
In another was realized, index/document library 415 can comprise address fingerprint (FP) field 540 and the accurate field 550 of FP.Geocoder 430 can be with each address process for having the point of address FP and FP precision (for example mansion can have the FP precision higher than street center).Address FP can be based on the address and the fingerprint (for example hashed value that can generate based on the address) that generates, and wherein this address can be used for searching POI ID to show correct map.For example, FP maker 570 can receiver address (for example [province] field 500, [city] field 510, [district] field 520 and [street] field 530 or the like), and can be based on the address, calculated address FP (for example [FP] field 540) and FP precision (for example [FP] precision field 550).Address FP and FP precision can be made by POI ID look-up table 580 and be used for searching POI ID, to show correct map (for example having local search results).FP maker 570 and/or POI ID look-up table 580 can be provided in geocoder 430, index 435 or front-end server 440.
In another was realized, index/document library 415 can comprise [zcode] field 560 relevant with the address.Relevant zcode can comprise the coding of similar postcode, under the situation of China, can be calculated by 6 that are used for CHINESE REGION administrative codings.The position such as Jiangsu Province, Beijing, Xicheng District, Beijing, can be calculated as by geocoder 430 and comprise the scope that there is a position its inside.
Also can determine the variation of address and it is stored in index/document library 415 so that increase recall ratio.For example, can discern monocase synonym (for example, the Shanghai City → Shanghai that is used for province and city; Hebei province → Ji).In addition, or or, a part (Shanghai City → Shanghai for example of address can be omitted; Haidian District → Haidian; Road in the Huaihua → Huaihua road).In addition, or or, to famous place, can comprise synonym (mausoleum → Town God's Temple, Shanghai City for example; The Temple of Six Banyan Tree → six Rong Ta).
Although Fig. 5 has represented to be included in the exemplary information in index/document library 415, in other were realized, index/document library 415 can comprise any information that can be used to discern local search results.
Geocoder
Be index Yellow Page data 405, index 435 may need by checking that Chinese address determines map location.This may relate to various problems.For example, be not easy to obtain the exact position and the better address information of Chinese most of address.Chinese address does not have the form and the level of good definition.The possible composition of Chinese address can comprise city, district, town, village, road, street, street Taoist monastic name and buildings.Yellow Page data 405 can be free-format (that is, not meeting any particular form or form), particularly in grass roots, and to some POI, do not have corresponding address element to use.Exemplary Chinese address can comprise:
Good village, Zhenan County, Hegang, the Shenzhen No. 172 absolute sincerity mansions in road of pacifying the good
Wise name of Shenzhen's Longhua Zhen and comprehensive office building
Building 17, Building A, the World Trade Center plaza, Fu Hong road, Shenzhen, and
Haidian District, Beijing City Chinese holly Xiao Fu
Address list maker 600 can receive map supplier data 400 and Yellow Page data 405, and can be based on province, city, district, street name, address, POI name or its combination, with calculated address tabulation (being also referred to as mark) from map supplier data 400 and/or Yellow Page data 405.To each address, resolver 610 can be attempted beginning to resolve the city from the address.For example, can go out " Shenzhen " from address resolution by resolver 610.Resolver 610 also can be attempted by the address resolution district.For example, owing to lack the district in the above-mentioned exemplary address, resolver 610 can not go out the district by this address resolution.
The longest matching prefix steady arm 620 of geocoder 430 can be used for the other part of positioning address.For example, longest matching prefix steady arm 620 can attempt locating longest matching prefix (for example mark) from address list.If there is not specific markers (for example " Hegang town " be not in address list) in address list, this just may fail.If it is present in the address list, then longest matching prefix steady arm 620 may be advanced to the end in speech " town ".If whole mark (for example " Zhenan County, Hegang pacify the good in good village road ") is present in the address list, then longest matching prefix steady arm 620 can be identified as mark matched well (for example " Hegang town " can be identified as matched well).If failure, longest matching prefix steady arm 620 can attempt locating longest matching prefix (for example mark) once more from address list.If there be (for example " village pacifies the good ") in it, longest matching prefix steady arm 620 may be advanced to the end in speech " village " so.Longest matching prefix steady arm 620 can repeat this process once more and locate longest matching prefix (for example mark) from address list.At this moment, longest matching prefix steady arm 620 can be attempted street match name (for example " road " or " street ").If there be (for example " road of pacifying the good ") in they, longest matching prefix steady arm 620 may be advanced to the end in speech " road " or " street ".If there are (for example " No. 172 ") in it, longest matching prefix steady arm 620 also may be advanced to speech " number " the end.At last, longest matching prefix steady arm 620 can attempt locating longest matching prefix (for example mark) from the POI name.This can provide the coupling of the title in buildings, school, park or the like (for example absolute sincerity mansion).
City+district+POI name;
City+district+by the address (for example " road " or " street ") of longest matching prefix steady arm 620 location;
City+district+by the address (for example " village ") of longest matching prefix steady arm 620 location;
City+district+by the address (for example " town ") of longest matching prefix steady arm 620 location;
City+district; And/or

When the user imports local search queries, the position part of search inquiry can be sent to by all map servers of map supplier.If position enquiring comprises Chinese, Japanese or Korean (CJK) character, map server can send it to inquiry geocoding unit 640, to carry out geocoding.If by the position of user input is ambiguous (for example when from first result's of geocoder score value less than second result's score value twice time), inquires about geocoding unit 640 and can offer suggestions to the user.For example,, then inquire about geocoding unit 640 and can provide the suggestion which follows: " you want to search Tianjin Hedong District History Museum, or Shanghai, Pudong district, Shanghai City History Museum? " to the user if position enquiring is " History Museum "
Although Fig. 6 shows by the performed example tasks of geocoder 430, in other were realized, geocoder 430 also can be carried out the other or different task that can be used to discern local search results.In addition, although Fig. 6 shows the parts of the geocoder 430 of interconnection, in other were realized, the parts of geocoder 430 also can be parts independent, that do not interconnect.
Index
Yellow Page data pre-processor 710 can receive Yellow Page data 405 from different suppliers, and can be general format with 405 pre-service of Yellow Page data.During index, this formative data can be provided for geocoder 430, and geocoder 430 can attempt geocoding is carried out in this address.If with this address can be mansion or street rank by geocoding, this address can be used as standard entries and comes index so.If with this address can be city or district's rank by geocoding, this address can be used as the clauses and subclauses that have apparent position and comes index so.During marking, the entry process achievement can be resembled at least two ten kilometers of decenterings (promptly reducing its score value in essence).If can not carry out geocoding to the address, so can be with address process for not having the clauses and subclauses of position.During index, if do not have the position clauses and subclauses can with another clauses and subclauses (for example using its telephone number) cluster, can keep these clauses and subclauses so.Otherwise, can delete these clauses and subclauses.
Company information extraction apparatus 720 can use multiple technologies, extracts company information (for example address and application number) from Web document data 410.Based on Chinese and the address of Japanese and the different-format of telephone number, can revise these technology.
For example, in first technology, company information extraction apparatus 720 can comprise sorter, and it can analyze the document with address, to determine the company information relevant with the address based on statistical model.Document by the sorter analysis can comprise the document with address, and wherein the document does not have corresponding Yellow Page data 405; And/or have the document of address, wherein the Yellow Page data 405 of the document may be incorrect.The function of being carried out by sorter can be corresponding to enterprise's name (title) information or different corresponding to telephone number information based on company information.When company information comprises information except that enterprise's name or telephone number information, can carry out other function.Can pass through to analyze near the word in address, and determine that each word is the probability of the part of title, discern enterprise's name (title).Degree of confidence can be distributed to each candidate's title of being discerned.
Candidate phone number collection by in the identification document can get up telephone number and address correlation.Based on statistical model, given prediction about previous candidate phone number, and the term window around the given candidate phone number (for example checking predetermined a plurality of words on the left side and/or the right), can determine the probability that each candidate phone number is associated with the address.Based on determined probability, degree of confidence can be distributed to candidate phone number.Alternatively, can determine telephone number to address the best.Then, telephone number can be associated with the address to form or additional Enterprise Lists.
In second example technique, company information extraction apparatus 720 can comprise the position extraction apparatus, and it can be used as the part of search engine.The position extraction apparatus can receive search inquiry, and whether definite search inquiry comprises Geographic Reference.When search inquiry comprised Geographic Reference, the position extraction apparatus can separate Geographic Reference and the search terms in the inquiry, and they are sent to local search engine.When search inquiry did not comprise Geographic Reference, the position extraction apparatus can be transmitted to search terms the Web search engine, and this Web search engine can comprise traditional Web search engine that can return with search inquiry document associated collection.Local search engine can comprise special-purpose search engine, such as the Enterprise Lists search engine.In operation, local search engine can receive the search terms and the Geographic Reference of search inquiry from the position extraction apparatus.Local search engine can be by comparing the document in search terms and the corpus of documents, discern and search inquiry document matching collection (document that promptly comprises this search terms collection of search inquiry), wherein the document corpus is relevant with the geographic area, and this geographic area is associated with this Geographic Reference.Local search engine can be marked to the document of being discerned, and based on their score value they is sorted, and they are output as the tabulation of Search Results.
The position extraction apparatus can be by being arranged to 1 with variable i, and search to city name is carried out in each city (i) in the city list, determines the ambiguous address (for example city) in the search inquiry.Can with the number count of the Search Results of this search city's counting (countcity).Also can carry out search to the city name of the title that has corresponding province.Number count to the Search Results of this search is city/province's counting (countcity/province).
Then, can determine whether city/province's counting (countcity/province) is the X% (wherein, X is the number greater than zero) of city's counting (countcity) at least.When the city/when province's counting (countcity/province) was the X% of city's counting (countcity) at least, so, this city was considered as the city of " clearly "." clear and definite city " can refer in search inquiry, the city that its name can be used separately, and it will be understood that the city that the user means, rather than other.When city/province's counting (countcity/province) is not when being at least the X% of city's counting (countcity), can determine in tabulation, whether have more city so.If in tabulation, there are more cities, can make variable i increase by 1 so, and can estimate next city in the city list.
Can analyze the document of Search Results and discern any postcode that they comprise.Use mode-matching technique, can discern postcode, and compare by tabulation and to verify them and postcode.Then, can determine postcode whether corresponding to the relevant postcode in city (i).It is postal service counting (countpostal) that the quantity that comprises the document of the postcode relevant with city (i) can be counted.Can determine that whether postal counting (countpostal) is the X% at least (for example 5%) of city's counting (countcity).When postal service counting (countpostal) is the X% at least of city's counting (countcity), so this city is considered as clear and definite city.
In the 3rd exemplary embodiment, company information extraction apparatus 720 can be discerned geographic relevant document.As used in this, geographic relevant document refers generally in some modes, has determined any document that has particular associative with the geographic position.Enterprise Lists (for example those in yellow pages listings) can be regarded as and the related geographic relevant document in geographic area that is limited by the enterprise address.Other documents also can have specific geographical association such as the Web document.For example, can there be homepage in enterprise, can be the theme that enterprise is carried out the document of note or comment, or can be mentioned by the webpage that is associated with enterprise in some other mode.Can such as from postal address or by other geographic signal, determine the specific geographic position of associated document in many ways.
The geographic area that is associated with geographic relevant document can be mapped to corresponding location identifier.To the document, can determine other location identifier.Especially, also can determine with preset range in the corresponding location identifier in surrounding area.Can each geographic relevant document of index, it is relevant with the zone of the document to just look like that the document comprises, and the location identifier relevant with the peripheral region of being discerned.
Although Fig. 7 is expressed as the part of index 435 with company information extraction apparatus 720, in other were realized, company information extraction apparatus 720 can separate with index 435.For guaranteeing that when the index, the compound document collection is available, can in company information storehouse 750, provide the information of extracting by company information extraction apparatus 720.Company information storehouse 750 can comprise multiple information, for example by company information extraction apparatus 720 from wherein extracting the document of company information.The company information that can in index 435, company information storehouse 750 is provided and be extracted.Although Fig. 7 is expressed as the part of index 435 with company information storehouse 750, in other were realized, company information storehouse 750 can separate with index 435.
Can search radius or distance be set to local search queries apart from tension leveling device 730.For example, in one implementation, each local search queries can be by geocoder 430 geocodings to ad-hoc location.Each position can be a position (for example buildings, famous tourist attraction, school, center, street or the like), or range position (for example district, city, provincial capital or the like).To a position, search radius can be arranged to preset distance (for example this point is about 5 kilometers) on every side apart from tension leveling device 730.To range position, search radius can be arranged to be similar to from the center of this position to the ultimate range of corner apart from tension leveling device 730.The score value of the Search Results of the postcode collection that can upgrade relevant (the postcode collection of promptly forming this position, zcode set) with the position.In this way, when user search during near realm name, optimum can be in that area.
Cluster device 740 can be in the same place map supplier data 400 and Yellow Page data 405 clusters.Most of map supplier data 400 can comprise accurate positional information, so that can accurately on map, show, but may not comprise detailed address or telephone number information (for example, may comprise the address that does not have the street Taoist monastic name and/or may lack telephone number).On the other hand, Yellow Page data 405 can comprise detailed address and telephone number information, but can not comprise accurate positional information.For example, map supplier data 400 can comprise source (for example map supplier), title (for example " Peking University "), address (for example " Summer Palace Road, Haidian District, Beijing City " and/or POI ID (being used for map shows) (for example " A1234567 ").Yet Yellow Page data 405 can comprise source (for example Yellow Page data set provider), title (for example " Peking University "), address (for example " No. 5, Summer Palace Road, Haidian District, Beijing City ") and/or telephone number (for example " 010-62752114).If these clauses and subclauses by cluster device 740 clusters together, front-end server 440 just can be for the user provides detailed address and telephone number information so, and the accurate position on the map.
From may being similar to carry out the position that geocoding (for example by geocoder 430) obtains from the address of Yellow Page data 405, and may be away from the exact position that provides by map supplier data 400.In this case, may be arranged in the neighborhood that differs widely from two suppliers' same enterprise, thus can not be together by cluster device 740 clusters.Solution to this can comprise address geocoding (for example by geocoder 430) the one-tenth cluster position from map supplier data 400.The cluster position can be used for neighborhood and generate, and also can be used for by cluster device 740 clusters.Then, the exact position that is provided by map supplier data 400 can be used for the map demonstration.
The segment of segment high brightness indicator 760 in can highlighted display document (for example Web document).Usually can realize the highlighted demonstration of Web document segment by the skew of the word in the document.Because can having the word that counting is different from other language, the CJK document (for example replaces the space as delimiter, may need the long paragraph of text cut apart and obtain word), so for highlighted demonstration particular words, entire document can be cut apart so that obtain corresponding word, and this will be a poor efficiency.Yet segment high brightness indicator 760 can the store byte side-play amount, rather than the word skew, so that during index, and address or telephone number (or some other company informations) in the identification Web document.Segment high brightness indicator 760 can use byte offsets to carry out highlighted demonstration, and does not need to cut apart.Although Fig. 7 is shown as the part of index 435 with segment high brightness indicator 760, in other were realized, segment high brightness indicator 760 can separate with index, and/or be included in another parts (for example at front-end server 440).
Although Fig. 7 represents the example tasks by index 435 execution, in other were realized, index 435 can be carried out the other or different task that can be used to discern local search results.In addition, although Fig. 7 is shown as interconnection with the parts of index 435, in other are realized, the parts of index 435 can be parts that separate, non-interconnection.
Front-end server
Front-end server 440 as shown in Figure 8, can be carried out multiple-task and help discern local search results.In one implementation, for example, front-end server 440 can comprise query rewrite device 800, local search maker 810, diagram generator 820, geography information maker 830 or the like.Although Fig. 8 has represented the example tasks by front-end server 440 execution, in other were realized, front-end server 440 can be carried out the other or different task that can be used to help to discern local search results.
In one implementation, query rewrite device 800 can be carried out multiple-task.For example, owing to compare, be much smaller for the quantity of the Web clustering documents of Chinese data, so can use the coupling of title or classification to return effective result with the English data.Simultaneously, in Chinese, there are a plurality of synonyms that are called identical word.For example, word " restaurant " can have several general synonyms in Chinese.In addition, the different suppliers of Yellow Page data 400 can use different titles to represent identical classification.For the search inquiry to user's input provides maximum recall ratio, query rewrite device 800 can generate a synon tabulation to each kind.Query rewrite device 800 also can rewrite each local search queries can be by a pair of search terms of " OR " operational symbol connection so that query expansion is arrived.
Local search maker 810 can generate local search results 450.For example, based on the address information that is obtained and handled by local search system 225, local search maker 810 can generate the result corresponding to the Enterprise Lists in related web page and/or the specific geographical area.Local search results 450 can show that (for example to importing the user of local search queries) is on display (for example output device 370).
Ground diagram generator 820 can generate the map relevant with local search results 450.For example, for to displayed map as a result, ground diagram generator 820 can make up ifrmae (promptly inserting the unsteady frame in the webpage) on search results pages, and can carry out to the URL that is provided by the map supplier and send action.Parameter in the transmission can be to comprising of each Search Results of following field: title; The address; Telephone number; POI ID (being used for the point on the displayed map); And precision.Ground diagram generator 820 can be that other position of buildings level is labeled as on map accurately with geocoding.Ground diagram generator 820 can be that the position of street rank (or higher abstract level) is labeled as estimation with geocoding on map.Fig. 9 example explanation is based on local search results 910 and on the map that generates, how these two levels of precision are distinguished.For example, exact position 920 can be discerned by a marker color (for example green), and estimated position 930 can be discerned by another marker color (for example red).Although figure 9 illustrates two levels of precision (accurate and estimation), in other realizations consistent, also can use other levels of precision with principle of the present invention.
During by index 435 index, the fingerprint of address (for example address FP540) can relative precision (for example the FP precision 550) be stored together.Mapping between address fingerprint and the POI ID (for example address FP/POI ID map information 425) can be used so that each Search Results is searched POI ID by ground diagram generator 820.Ground diagram generator 820 can use POI ID to discern position on the map (for example map 900) as the map supplier, so that display position on the map that the map supplier can provide in result page.
For demonstration is used for Chinese local advertising, geography information maker 830 can provide geography information to Advertisement Server 840 in many ways.For example, in one implementation, each province or municipality directly under the Central Government can have two codes, and this code can be the second portion by the definite area code of ISO-3166-2.Geocoder 430 can be to this code of each allocation index (for example " CN-dd "), and to each address of successfully carrying out geocoding, it is delivered to front-end server 440.Geography information maker 830 can send to code Advertisement Server 840, as geographical area code.
In another is realized, keyword can be sought by advertiser right＜keyword, position 〉, replace using geo-location, because for the Web search, geo-location is equally possible in the U.S. not as it in Asian countries.To these keywords concerning the total amount of advertisement may be more.Therefore, geography information maker 830 can couple together keyword and the position of being imported by search inquiry, and can use these to connect as the keyword that sends to Advertisement Server 840.For example, when " restaurant " near the user search " Beijing ", the keyword that sends to Advertisement Server 840 by geography information maker 830 can be " Beijing, restaurant ".Can provide this arrangement to Japan and China.
In another was realized, geography information maker 830 can determine whether search inquiry comprises Geographic Reference.If search inquiry does not comprise Geographic Reference, can present conventional advertisement by Advertisement Server 840 so.Yet, can determine the indicator of customer location, such as user's IP address, whether available.But, can present local advertising based on user's position so when the indicator time spent of customer location.
On the other hand, if search inquiry comprises Geographic Reference, geography information maker 830 can determine that whether Geographic Reference is corresponding to independent city name (that is, without any other geography information, such as not economizing information) so.If search inquiry comprises the Geographic Reference except that independent city name, can provide local advertising so.
If search inquiry comprises that geography information maker 830 can determine that whether the city is corresponding to clear and definite city so corresponding to the Geographic Reference of independent city name.If this city does not correspond to clear and definite city, can provide conventional advertisement so.If the city is corresponding to clear and definite city, whether geography information maker 830 city name that can determine to have one or more other search terms of inquiry appears in the blacklist so.When clear and definite city name combines with one or more speech, expression be except that they information the city separately, then can keep a blacklist for these clear and definite city names.Appear in the blacklist if having the city name of one or more other search terms of inquiry, can provide conventional advertisement so.Do not appear in the blacklist if having the city name of one or more other search terms of inquiry, can present local advertising based on the Geographic Reference of this inquiry so.
If present this locality (" have target ") advertisement, can use the information (for example IP address) of relevant customer location to determine whether that position is in the preset distance corresponding to the position of Geographic Reference by geography information maker 830.If user's position in preset distance, can present local advertising so.Yet, if customer location outside preset distance, can provide conventional advertisement so.
Front-end server 440 (or parts of front-end server 440) can be carried out some tasks that are exclusively used in China.For example, front-end server 440 can be hidden travel direction, and the unit of display (kilometer, mile) is provided, and this unit can be based on the situation of various countries, as user during in China, execution provides the specific formatization of Chinese address and telephone number to the filtration of responsive keyword, so that show, in the position of the top of map demonstration through geocoding, and/or will be apart from being rounded up to 0.5 kilometer, rather than 0.1 kilometer, and remove direction.
Example process
Figure 10 A-10D is the process flow diagram that is used to discern local search results and the example process that the map relevant with the position of being discerned is provided.
Exemplary local search results and map generative process
Shown in Figure 10 A, being used to discern local search results can be from receiving Yellow Page, map supplier and document data (piece 1005) with the process 1000 that the map relevant with the position of being discerned is provided.For example, in described a kind of realization in conjunction with Fig. 4, map supplier data 400, Yellow Page data 405 and Web document data 410 can offer index 435, and map supplier data 400 can further be used to derive address/POI id information 420 and address FP/POI ID map information 425.
As among Figure 10 A further shown in, process 1000 can be on data execution index (piece 1015).For example, in a kind of realization above in conjunction with Fig. 7, the map datum index 700 of index 435 can be from the map supplier data 400 that can comprise map location information the index address data.The Yellow Page data pre-processor 710 of index 435 can receive Yellow Page data 405 from different suppliers, and 405 pre-service of Yellow Page data are become general format.The company information extraction apparatus 720 of index 435 can use multiple technologies, extracts company information (for example address and telephone number) from Web document data 410.Can revise these technology based on China and the address of Japan and the different-format of telephone number.Can in company information storehouse 750, provide the company information that is extracted.Index 435 can be provided for the search radius of local search queries apart from tension leveling device 730.The cluster device 740 of index 435 can be in the same place map supplier data 400 and Yellow Page data 405 clusters.The segment of the segment high brightness indicator 760 of index 435 in can highlighted display document (for example Web document).
Exemplary geographical cataloged procedure
The procedure block 1010 of process 1000 (Figure 10 A) can comprise the piece shown in Figure 10 B.Therefore, procedure block 1010 can calculated address tabulation (piece 1025).For example, in described a kind of realization in conjunction with Fig. 6, the address list maker 600 of geocoder 430 can receive map supplier data 400 and Yellow Page data 405, and can generate address list (mark) based on province, city, district, street name, address, POI name or its combination from map supplier data 400 and/or Yellow Page data 405.Procedure block 1010 can parse addresses each address (piece 1030) in the tabulation.For example, in conjunction with Fig. 6 in described a kind of realization, to each address, the resolver 610 of geocoder 430 can attempt resolving city and district from this address above.
As among Figure 10 B further shown in, each address that procedure block 1010 can be from address list, location longest matching prefix (piece 1035).For example, in conjunction with Fig. 6 in described a kind of realization, the longest matching prefix steady arm 620 of geocoder 430 can be used for the other part (for example town, village, road or street, number, POI name or the like) of positioning address above.If longest matching prefix is not arranged in address (piece 1040-is not), procedure block 1010 can continue the other part (piece 1035) of positioning address so.
If longest matching prefix is arranged in this address (piece 1040-is), procedure block 1010 can be located the combination (piece 1045) in each address so.For example, in conjunction with Fig. 6 in described a kind of realization, the groupings setters 630 of geocoder 430 can be located particular combinations above, so that at first locate the POI name, and each rank of positioning address then, and last, can positioning area or city.This positioning arrangement can guarantee or verify by groupings setters 630 and can obtain the most concrete possible address.
Exemplary index process
The procedure block 1015 of process 1000 (Figure 10 A) can comprise the piece shown in Figure 10 C.Therefore, procedure block 1015 can pre-service Yellow Page data (piece 1050).For example, in conjunction with Fig. 7 in described a kind of realization, the Yellow Page data pre-processor 710 of index 435 can receive Yellow Page data 405 from different suppliers above-mentioned, and 405 pre-service of Yellow Page data can be become general (or predetermined) form.During index, this formatted data can be offered geocoder 430, and geocoder 430 can attempt geocoding is carried out in this address.If with this address geocoding is buildings or street rank, so can be with this address as standard entries and index.If with this address geocoding is city or district's rank, so can be with this address as the clauses and subclauses that have apparent position and index.
The address date (piece 1065) that procedure block 1015 can index receives from the map supplier.For example, above in conjunction with Fig. 7 in described a kind of realization, the map datum index 700 of index 435 can index from the address date of map supplier data 400, this map supplier data 400 can comprise map location information.Geocoder 430 can attempt once more coming this address of geocoding based on the address date of institute's index, if and the cluster position is different from assigned address, cluster device 740 can be provided with the cluster position, but the cluster position cannot be arranged to greater than predetermined distance threshold (for example, in three kilometers).
As among Figure 10 C further shown in, procedure block 1015 can cluster Yellow Page data and map supplier data (piece 1070).For example, above in conjunction with Fig. 7 in described a kind of realization, the cluster device 740 of index 435 can be in the same place map supplier data 400 and Yellow Page data 405 clusters, if with these clauses and subclauses clusters together by cluster device 740, front-end server 440 just can be for the user provides detailed address and telephone number information so, and the accurate position on the map.
The segment (piece 1075) that provides in the document can highlightedly be provided procedure block 1015.For example, above in conjunction with Fig. 7 in described a kind of realization, the segment of the segment high brightness indicator 760 of index 435 in can highlighted display document (for example Web document).Segment high brightness indicator 760 can the store byte side-play amount, rather than the word skew, so that during index, and address in the identification Web document or telephone number (or some other company information).Segment high brightness indicator 760 can use byte offsets to carry out highlighted demonstration and do not need to cut apart.
As among Figure 10 C further shown in, procedure block 1015 can be provided with detection range (piece 1080).For example, above in conjunction with Fig. 7 in described a kind of realization, index 435 can be apart from tension leveling device 730 to carrying out the local search queries of geocoding and search radius is set to ad-hoc location by geocoder 430.Each position can be a position (for example buildings, famous tourist attraction, school, center, street or the like) or range position (for example district, city, province or the like).For a position, search radius can be set to preset distance (for example this point is about 5 kilometers) on every side apart from tension leveling device 730.For range position, search radius can be set to apart from tension leveling device 730 and be approximately from the center of this position to the ultimate range of corner.
The exemplary headend server process
The procedure block 1020 of process 1000 (Figure 10 A) can comprise the piece shown in Figure 10 D.Therefore, procedure block 1020 can rewrite search inquiry (piece 1085).For example, above in described a kind of realization, in Chinese, can there be a plurality of synonyms that mean identical word in conjunction with Fig. 8.In addition, Yellow Page data 400 (405?) different suppliers can use different titles to represent identical kind.For providing maximum recall ratio to the search inquiry by user's input, the query rewrite device 800 of front-end server 440 can generate synon tabulation to each kind.Query rewrite device 800 also can rewrite each local search queries, and this local search can arrive query expansion can be by a pair of search terms of " or (OR) " operational character connection.
###
As among Figure 10 D further shown in, procedure block 1020 can generate geography information (piece 1095) for Advertisement Server.For example, in conjunction with Fig. 8 in described a kind of realization, for demonstration is used for the local advertising of China, the geography information maker 830 of front-end server 440 can provide geography information to Advertisement Server 840 above.For example, geography information maker 830 can send to Advertisement Server 840 as geographical area code with area code.In another example, geography information maker 830 can couple together keyword and the position of being imported by the inquiry of user's inputted search, and these can be connected as the keyword that sends to Advertisement Server 840.
