The combination of two or more in appropriate data processing equipment.In some instances, computing device is included as motor-driven
A part for car (such as automobile, ambulance vehicles (such as fire fighting truck, ambulance) or bus).
The user interacted with computing device 102,104,106,108,110 can be arrived by uploading and downloading electronic content items
Social networks participates in for example by the social networks 123 of 112 trustship of server system.As it is indicated above, digital content can
With including such as text comments (such as renewal, bulletin and reply), digital picture, video, audio file and/or other are appropriate
Information.In some instances, use is represented by the system outside social networks 123 or server system 112 and/or service
Family releases news.For example, user can issue the comment of film to film comment Web site, and the Web site can utilize
Correctly license represents user and issues the comment to the intersection of social networks 123.In another example, permitted using correct,
The software application performed in mobile equipment can determine the position of user and use using global positioning system (GPS) ability
User position (such as " staying at home ", " working ", " in Boston, MA ") automatically update social networks 123.In general, with
The user that computing device 102,104,106,108,110 interacts can also use social networks 123 to organize and classify with participating in
The customer relationship of the other users of social networks.
The electronic content items that author provides can be distributed to the selected contact person in social networks 123 so that so
Content can be checked by selected contact person and (in some instances, usually can also use social networking service come in distributing
Rong Xiang so that be not that the user of the contact person of author can access content).In exemplary operations, the user of social networks 123 can
Its individual social networking contacts of one or more are distributed to the content for generating content and pointing out for example to be generated.
During the content write time, from the client computing device (such as computing device 102 of Fig. 1) of user to distribution hub (example
Such as content distribution engine 125) transmitting content data collection, distribution hub can be arranged on server (such as the server system of Fig. 1
Place on system 112 or network elsewhere).In some instances, it is (such as text, interior to include content-data for content data set
Hold the identity, universal resource locator (URI), time stamp data (such as timestamp of the time of instruction generation content) of author),
Distribution data (such as data of ID association people and/or one or more social circle) and identify (ID) data and (such as generating
The ID distributed during content to content data set).
In some instances, content data set is attached with other data.Other data of example can include soft post data.
In some instances, soft post data can include interest level threshold value.As described in more detail below, interest level threshold value
Reflection with the minimum acceptable level of the interest of the content item association of soft model can quantization parameter.
In some instances, distribution data are handled to provide accesses control list (ACL), which specifies social activity
Which of network contact person is authorized to content.For example, distribution data can indicate content by specific user may have access to and/
Or distribute to specific user.In some instances, can be based on it is described herein it is soft put up technology, to change or update
ACL associates the access of content item to control.
In general, distribution hub determines to distribute the endpoint of content data set to it based on such as ACL.For example, it is based on
ACL come the set of contact person that determines to interact with content and/or the set for the contact person for being allowed access to content, and
The ID of content is written into each user/check index at distribution hub.When extracting content to distribute to user, access and use
Family/check indexes and determines that user is allowed to the ID of each content checked.From data storage device (such as the data of Fig. 1
Storehouse 118) retrieval content data set, and to the associated client device transmitting content data collection of request user.At some
In example, distribute content to the homepage to contain the user in content stream.It may also respond to the use on result of page searching
Family is inquired about to provide the content of distribution.
Fig. 2 shows example homepage 200 associated with user account on social networks.For example, the page 200 can be provided
For the Web page in the Web site of social networks 123, and the page 200 can be shown to the user associated with the page 200
201 distribution or and the user 201 associated with the page 200 share digital content.In the example shown in the series of figures, example user
For " Jane McDavies ", and the page 200 shows the project (such as digital content) that other users have been shared with Jane.
As shown, the page 200 includes social networks menu 202 and content stream 204, and substantial item is presented in content stream 204.
The example content item 206 of warp-wise user distribution is displayed in content stream 204.In general, item 206 shown in content stream 204
The digital content distributed including the contact person out of social networks or other participating users to user.Can also be in the page 200
Upper offer content shared interface 208.User can activate (such as click) content shared interface 208 to share digital content.Though
Describe 12 content items in right Fig. 2, it should be understood that, the page 200 can be shown to user more or less than 12
Content item.Search field 210 can also be provided on the page 200 to search for content on social networks 123.
User can be interior by the way that content is appointed as annotation (endorse), shared (share) and/or comment (comment)
Hold, quote URL or indicate that the interest of content or chain are fetched and interacted with the content distributed.For example, can be in search result
Application, window member or script, the browser application are either provided in browser application in the page, Web page allows to use
Family specifies the linking of particular dispensed content item, resource or search result, shares or other evaluations.Such as in this example,
Each content item 206 is shown in content stream 204 with associated interactive elements 212.Can be by user (such as clicking on element)
Carry out active element 212 to interact with the content item 206 with distribution.
The user for the author for being connected to soft model socially can be identified using socialgram.Socialgram be it is a kind of graphically
Represent may or in the social connection between two sides on identical social networks and may not represent in many ways and content
Between connection mode.One side can be personal or entity, such as company, tissue, country etc..Connection in socialgram
Type can include but is not limited to directly to contact with user (such as direct in user message or chat contact, social site
Contact person) other users and (such as the contact person of contact person, have the user of direct relation with user with user's indirect association
Contact person) user.In some instances, it can be unilateral or bilateral to be directly connected to.In some implementations,
Socialgram includes the content (blog post, comment) by individual's generation as the connection to user.Socialgram can include single
Network is interior or crosses over multiple internetwork connections.
Different types of connection can be directed to and generate different socialgrams.For example, user can with a socialgram
Chat contact connects, and is connected with the electronic information contact person in the second socialgram, and with coming from spy in the 3rd socialgram
Determine contact person's connection of social networks.Socialgram can include with the edge to additional party of the larger separating degree with user.Example
Such as, electronic information contact person can have to increase and the electronic information of the their own of other contact persons of the separating degree of user and join
It is people.These contact persons can have with the additional contacts of another separating degree with user again.Similarly, with specific social network
Someone side connection in network can be used for identifying additional connection based on the connection of the people.Different socialgrams can include
One or more socialgrams are connected to the edge of other one or more socialgrams.Therefore socialgram can include single social activity
Figure or the socialgram of multiple interconnection.
The affinity between the entity of socialgram can be represented by the above-indicated edge in the socialgram of user.As institute
Point out, affinity can identify the tight ness rating of a side and user.For example, with the connection with 5 common middle contact persons of user
Be people contact person and user than only with 1 it is common among the contact person of contact person of contact person have the bigger with user close
With degree (for example, being considered closer with user).Determining the factor of affinity can be included for example：How contact person connects with user
(such as source of connection) is connect, contact person is the member of which social network sites, is the contact person of contact person or contact person, Yi Jiyou
How many paths can reach the contact person (such as common middle contact person) of contact person.Can be in the database comprising socialgram
Or edge is weighted elsewhere, to reflect the level of the affinity between the connection in socialgram (such as multi-party).
Affinity between multi-party can be the content specified in some cases.For example, social graph data can identify
With it is multi-party between the associated certain types of content in edge and the specific affinity of the content.In this example, socialgram number
According to can specify：Between the both sides of two connections, first party has the first affinity level for the video of second party, and
Write-in work for second party has different the second affinity levels.Similarly, socialgram can specify second party for
The blog of first party has different the 3rd affinity levels.It is same for content topic.For example, social graph data
It can specify：Between the both sides of connection, first party is horizontal with the first affinity for the second party content on baseball, and
And for having different the second affinity levels on the second party content of basketball.
Affinity is also based on interacting (such as frequency of interaction, type of interaction etc.) for user and the member of socialgram.Example
Such as, compared with user less often clicks on other contact persons of its corresponding model, it is believed that for frequentlying click on its note with user
The particular contact of son is closer.Equally, if content (such as the search result chain of user continually " mouse moves past " author
Connect) but do not select the content, then the degree of affinity, which can be less than, links selected situation.Similarly, content is checked
Plenty of time can be the designator that a side likes the content from the opposing party.The plenty of time for checking certain content can be one
The instruction of the certain types of contents of the Fang Xihuan from the opposing party (compared with the other kinds of content from the opposing party).
In other examples, affinity can be defined by the indirect interaction between user.If for example, two user's rule
Then or continually interacted with identical content, it may be considered that the two users have affinity each other.In other examples,
If two user policies or continually interacted with same people, it may be considered that the two users have affinity each other.
Realization in the present disclosure be related to for promote by the soft process puted up of user of participation social networks, system and
Computer-readable medium.For example, some implementations include receiving the soft model created by the user of participation social networks.Soft note
Son can include such as content item, distribution data and interest level threshold value.As it is indicated above, can provide text comments,
The content item of the form of digital picture, digital video or digital audio file.Instruction content item can be included by distributing data
The original distribution data of intended recipinent or the processed distribution data in the form of ACL.
Interest level threshold value is reflection and the parameter value of the minimum acceptable interest level of the content item association of soft model
(such as percentage or raw score).In some instances, the interest level threshold value of soft model can be by for specific use
The default setting that family profile is established automatically defines or author's manual definition by soft model.Some implementations further include really
The level of the fixed relevant interest of content item with soft model.The level of interest or " interest level " be measurable amount (such as
Score or other kinds of social signal), other selected social network user groups of measurable amount reflection (such as make
The recipient of the content item identified in the member of the socialgram of person and/or distribution data) how perceived content item.It is in short, emerging
It is interesting horizontal provide on selected user group content item is considered as it is inessential (such as junk information) or important general pre-
Phase.Relatively access of the recipient to content item is controlled by interest level and interest level threshold value comparison, and based on this.Example
Such as, in specific implementation, if interest level is more than or equal to interest level threshold value, each recipient is authorized to soft model
Content item access.It can also realize other appropriate control programs.
Fig. 3 is the diagram 300 that diagram is interacted by the social networks of user group.In this example, user 302 " Dave " with
User 304-308 --- " Bob ", " Ed " and " James " are connected socially.Dave author content item 310 --- statements
“Anybody up for breakfast this morning at Sun Café" text comments.Content item 310 is soft
A part for model, soft model further include some other users of mark Bob, Ed, James and the recipient as content item
Distribute data.Soft model further comprises interest level threshold value, which provides must be in content item to the pre- of it
Determine the minimum level that recipient can use (such as visible or addressable) the predetermined interest realized before.
In some instances, can be based on the content that the selected user group for by social being connected to Dave is created come really
The fixed interest level associated with soft model content item 310.Selected user group can be included in the distribution data of soft model
The recipient of middle mark and/or the other users selected from the socialgram of Dave.In some instances, selected user group
Including the social network members not being connected with Dave socially.In this particular example, selected user group by
Bob, Ed and James are formed.Therefore, the content item 312-316 of Bob, Ed and James creation is analyzed with definite and soft model content
The associated interest levels of item 310.More particularly, it is associated to determine whether it is expected to check each content item 312-316
User it is interested in soft model content item 310.
, can be with the text of scope of examination item 312-316, to determine whether it is expected associated user couple as the first example
Soft model content item 310 is interested.For example if any content item in content item 312-316 refers to having in its text
The common physical (such as specific names, place, date, time etc.) of soft model content item 310, then have reason to speculate what is be associated
User can have found content item 310 highly significant.With reference to present exemplary, the content item 312 created respectively by Bob and James
(" Starved, headed to Sun Caf é for breakfast. ") and 316 (" So tired ... coffee and
Breakfast at Sun Caf é is my only hope. ") in each content item include word " Sun Caf é ", and
" Sun Caf é " are also included in the soft model content item 310 of Dave.Therefore it is reasonable to speculate that Bob and James will can come from
Dave with being considered as critically important model in Sun Caf é relevant models of having breakfast.On the other hand, the content item created by Ed
314 (" Feeling great.Ready for a great day at work. ") do not include common physical " Sun Caf é ".
Therefore it is reasonable to speculate that Ed will not be interested in the content item 310 of Dave.It is also possible to using text similarity technology (such as
Vector space models and latent semantic analysis) proper method as content analysis.For example, it can have reason to speculate that text is similar
The author of content item can be interested in specific soft model content item.
As the second example, can check with the associated label identifiers of content item 312-316, to determine whether it is expected phase
Associated user is interested in content item 310.Label identifier can be included in the metadata with content item association and/or
It is embedded in the text (such as theme label (hashtag)) of content item.In some instances, content item can include related mark
Sign the set (" label-cloud ") of identifier.In some instances, label identifier is distributed automatically to content item without user
Input.In some instances, can be by the free label identifier of author's generation form.If specific content item includes and soft note
The common label identifier of sub- content item, then can speculate the associated user (i.e. author) of specific content item can find soft model
Content item is important model.With reference to present exemplary, it is contemplated that the profit of content item 312 and 316 created respectively by Bob and James
It is marked with the word " breakfast " of mark, and is marked by the content item 314 of Ed creation using the word " work " of mark.
It can have reason to speculate the soft model that Bob and James can have found Dave (it is similarly marked with mark term " breakfast ")
For important model, and can have reason to speculate that Ed is not necessarily to find that the model is critically important or very interesting.
Example described above, which provides, to be used to determine user to soft model content based on the author content of user oneself
Expectation interest suitable technology.It would however also be possible to employ for determine user to the expectation interest of soft model content its
His suitable technology.For example in the above examples, check the content item of Bob, Ed and/or James creation, to determine to Dave
Soft model content expectation interest or its shortage.In some instances, the content item created by Bob, Ed and/or James
Dave can be included in the content item being distributed after soft model is provided.However, it is contemplated that in before being created by these users
It can also be appropriate to hold item.If refer to that " Sun Caf é " are marked with commenting for word " breakfast " for example, being puted up before Ed
By then having reason supposition Ed can find that the soft model content item of Dave is important model.
In addition, in some instances, the analysis to other social networking activities can be checked to determine to soft model content
The expectation interest of item.For example social event (such as annotate, comment on or share) can be divided to determine it is expected interest.With reference to figure 3
Example, it is contemplated that Ed with extra high ratio (such as 50% or higher ratio) interacted with the model of Dave.In such case
Under, though by Ed creation content item to and Dave soft model content item it is similar topic it is uncorrelated, still have reason to speculate
The content item created by Dave can be considered as critically important by Ed.Other information source can also be checked for such analysis.Such as
The content of maintenance can be maintained on profile page of the consideration in user when determining the interest to specific content item.Referring again to
Present exemplary, it is contemplated that Ed has indicated the interest to breakfast on his personal profiles.Have reason speculate Ed can find on
The soft model content item for the Dave having breakfast at Sun Caf é is important model.
In some instances, interest level is calculated as accumulative interest level score, wherein being expected to soft model content
Item each user interested distributes the counting of (attribute) one.Such as in this particular example, it has been determined that it is expected to use
(Bob and James) is interested in soft model content item 310 at family 304 and 308, and undesirable Ed is interested in it.Therefore, working as
In preceding example, it is two to add up interest level score.In some instances, can be to selected particular group of users to interest level
The contribution of score is weighted.For example, it can be distributed to the user with the author of soft model with of a relatively high affinity maximum
Weight (such as 1), it can be applied to determine accumulative interest level score.On the other hand, can in definite interest level score
With the weight to user's distribution with the author of soft model with relatively low affinity less than weight limit.In some examples
In, weight can be in the range of weight limit (such as 1) arrives minimal weight (such as 0).
With reference to present exemplary, it is contemplated that Bob has of a relatively high affinity in social networks with Dave, and
James and Dave has relatively low affinity.In some instances, pass will can mutually be offered with tributes of the Bob to interest level
The weight of connection is arranged to 1, to provide one interest level score, and can be arranged to the associated weight of contribution with James
0.5, to provide 0.5 interest level score.In this example, it may be determined that with the associated interest level scores of Ed can be 0.
Therefore, can be and for this example, accumulative interest level score one and half (such as 1.5).
In some implementations, interest level can be averaging with minimum value (such as 0) and maximum (such as 1)
Between change.In some instances, percentage of the interest level as selected user group can be calculated.That is, example
Such as, interest level can be averaging as accumulative interest level score with contributing to accumulative the definite of interest level score
Contact person number ratio.In wherein the above example of affinity is not accounted for, interest level can be arranged to
0.66 (such as the ratio between 2 and 3).In wherein the above example of affinity is considered, interest level can be arranged to 0.50 (example
Such as the ratio between 1.5 and 3).As it is indicated above, the user that interest level can reflect in selected user group can be soft to checking
Model possibility interested.Therefore, and in the above examples, can propose exist with soft model it is associated distribution (such as
User Bob, Ed and James) understand corresponding 66% and 50% possibility jointly interested in checking soft model.
Optionally provided to soft model content item based on the interest level and the comparison of interest level threshold value that calculate
310 access.That is, if the interest level calculated exceedes interest level threshold value, to associated with soft model
Distribution in the user that sets distribute access to soft model item.Such as with reference to present exemplary, can be soft to being created by Dave
The interest level threshold value of model distribution 0.5.In this example, interest level score 0.75 exceedes interest level threshold value.Therefore,
The content item 310 of Dave is available for its intended recipinent (including Bob, Ed and James).In some instances, Ke Yixiang
Dave provides notice, which shows that soft model content item 310 has accumulated enough interest to distribute to intended recipinent.
If do not meet or more than interest level threshold for the measured interest level of specific soft model content item
Value, then can suppress from the recipient distributed defined in data.For example, it can cause soft model content item in recipient
It is invisible in appearance stream, or be maintained in the queue not delivered to recipient.In some instances, in special time period
In (such as X minutes, hour or day, wherein X are any arithmetic numbers), refresh or recalculate with predetermined time interval and surveyed
The interest level of amount.By the interest level refreshed of soft model content item and interest level threshold value comparison, and such as above institute
Description ground is performed by access of the recipient to content item.If section expires at the appointed time, the interest of soft model content item
Level either can then abandon its (such as being deleted from computer storage) or send more than interest level threshold value without satisfaction
Return its author.In some instances, when section expires at the appointed time, notice, notice instruction are provided to the author of soft model
Not yet enable content item is used for all recipients.
Other appropriate schemes for controlling the access to soft model content item can also be utilized.For example show at some
In example, automatically so that soft model content item with reception user of the author of soft model with of a relatively high affinity for that can visit
Ask, but suppress from other recipients with relatively low affinity, unless meeting interest level threshold value.With reference to figure 3
Example, it is contemplated that Ed and Bob and Dave have an of a relatively high affinity, and James and Dave is with relatively low affine
Degree.In such a case, it is possible at once so that the soft model content item of Dave is used for Ed and Bob and (is not accounting for
In the case of interest level threshold value), and James is conditionally suppressed based on measured interest level.In this scene,
It is appropriate to consider or ignore contributions of the Ed and Bob to soft model interest level.In addition, in some instances, if it is determined that
Soft model not yet accumulates the enough interest for global distribution, then only can find that soft model content item is critically important to by supposition
User distributes soft model.
In some instances, if for example from each associated user (such as the user being connected to each other in social networks)
Multiple models (such as mixing of multiple soft models or soft model and hard model) include the content related with similar topic, then
These models can be linked or merged.As described above, the model of link can be emerging with calculating for combination
Interesting horizontal (such as equal to the sum of its individual interest level), the interest level calculated of the combination can be used for control to model
Access.For example, when combination interest level exceedes interest level threshold value, model (when their " reaching the standard grade " or can be become
When may have access to for other users) link together.
Fig. 4 show for implement it is soft put up technology when the example homepage 200 of Fig. 2 that uses.In this example, user
" Jane McDavies " can utilize content shared interface 208 to create soft model content item.Shared interface 208 includes being used for
Generate the content element 214 of content item, recipient's element 216 of intended recipinent for defining content item and put up button
218a and 218b.In the particular example, selection puts up button 218a and indicates to intended recipinent unconditionally to distribute to give birth to
Into content item.On the other hand, button 218b instructions are puted up in selection conditionally to distribute content based on interest level threshold value
.Button 218b is puted up in response to selection, can be presented to user for defining the interest level threshold value distributed to soft model
Add ons 220.
