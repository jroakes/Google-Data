Definitions
- the present invention relates to broadcasting and online media, and more particularly to systems for estimating bids for media plays.
- advertisers are willing to pay more money for advertising slots that allow them to deliver their message to the most members of their target audience. Because advertisers have a limited budget and limited time to manage campaigns, they are eager to identify which campaigns are effective and, perhaps more importantly, which are not.
- broadcasters rely on advertising revenues from selling advertising air time to cover operational expenses.
- a significant portion of the available advertising air time is not sold due market demand factors, poor ratings, station inefficiencies, trafficking logistics, programming logistics, and other factors.
- radio stations for example, often operate with daily unsold advertising inventory that accounts, on average, for up to 30% of the total advertising air time. This unpaid air time has traditionally been filled with public service advertisements, bonus advertisements, remnant advertisements and/or low-priority advertisements.
- One embodiment is directed to providing estimates for bidding in auctions of media plays (e.g., advertising slots) for media feeds, such as radio.
- media plays e.g., advertising slots
- Criteria for media play placement in a media feed are received from a subscriber as part of an ad campaign. The criteria are compared to historical information related to past media placement in the media feed and to demographic information related to listeners of the media feed. Bids are generated for the media plays in response to the historical information meeting the criteria.
- the criteria are used to select stations and dayparts.
- a recursion is run on the ad campaign's combination of market areas, stations and dayparts, breaking it down to individual station/dayparts to allocate a budget based on the criteria among the stations and dayparts to simulate the auctions and associated bids for the media plays according to stations and dayparts.

- a system and method estimate bids for auctions of media play according to specified criteria from an advertiser.
- FIG. 1 shows an exemplary architecture of a communication system 100 according to an aspect of the present invention.
- Communication system 100 may include a network 110 to communicatively couple third-party data sources 120 , at least one subscriber 130 , at least one regional broadcast studio 140 , and a broadcasting hub 150 .
- at least one regional studio 140 may be further communicatively coupled to at least one radio transmitter 160 .
- the term “media play” refers to the audio, visual or computerized output transmitted in a media feed.
- the term “media feed” includes any transmission of any media to one or more receivers of the media, including but not limited to terrestrial or satellite radio broadcasts; voice over IP; internet streaming; podcasts, webpages; video games with a communication connection, such as console, online and handheld video games; and video players with a communication connection; and mobile phones.
- the terms “radio content” and “broadcast” or “broadcast content” include any type of media that may be presented via audio, visual, or computerized output to one or more receivers of the output, and that is presently programmed or preprogrammed for media play.
- nonradio content or “nonbroadcast” or “broadcast nonspecific content” include any media that may be presented via audio, visual, or computerized output to one or more receivers of the content, for example via a media feed, and that is not presently programmed or preprogrammed for media play.
- the network 110 is the Internet.
- the network 110 can be any network, such as a LAN, a MAN, a WAN, a wired or wireless network, a private network, or a virtual private network.
- third-party data sources can be any database, data mart, or other data source that provides data of interest to a subscriber 130 relevant to the scheduling of their advertisement.
- the third-party data may be Arbitron ratings and demographic breakdowns for each station in a broadcast network.
- information or data is received or collected directly by the broadcasting hub 150 rather than from third-party sources. Regardless of the source, the broadcasting hub 150 uses the information in evaluating whether criteria are met for the play of an advertisement.
- a subscriber 130 is also communicatively coupled to the broadcasting hub 150 . This allows the subscriber 130 to purchase, schedule, and upload an advertising spot using a user interface of the broadcasting hub 150 that is describe in detail below.
- Subscriber 130 may access hub 150 via a connection to internet 110 .
- the connection to internet 110 may be any conventional connection that allows access to hub 150 .
- subscriber 130 may access hub 150 using TCP/IP and a conventional dial-up connection over a modem, or a dedicated connection that provides constant access.
- Hub 150 may have a unique HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) address, a unique FTP address, or any other addressing scheme that allows subscriber 130 to identify hub 150 .
- HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol
- Subscribers 130 can be advertisers, agencies, stations, or any other entity that interacts with the broadcasting hub 150 .
- subscribers 150 have an account with the broadcasting hub 150 and are charged a fee for use of the broadcasting hub 150 .
- subscribers can access the broadcasting hub 150 free of charge.
- a regional broadcast studio 140 is also communicatively coupled to the broadcasting hub 150 , such that the broadcasting hub 150 is capable of forwarding an advertisement to the regional broadcast studio 140 for play.
- a subscriber 130 is capable of submitting to the broadcasting hub 150 an advertisement for play along with specific criteria for the play of that advertisement, and the broadcasting hub 150 will forward the advertisement to a regional broadcasting studio 140 for play as appropriate.
- stations may desire and may be able to isolate themselves from the internet for a myriad of reasons.
- stations may isolate mission critical on-air work stations from the public internet
- the present system may enable on-air workstations to connect securely to a data center over the internet without the on-air workstation being connected directly to the internet
- Such a configuration may be achieved by using encryption and secure protocols, including, but not limited to outbound-originating protocols.
- Subscriber 130 may conduct one or more advertising campaigns by purchasing audio advertisements across several local and regional radio stations, for example. Subscriber 130 may distribute audio commercials to the radio stations for scheduling by the regional broadcast studio 140 . Subscriber 130 may select the advertising campaign based on local markets, type of radio station, demographics of users, day and time of airing the ads, duration of the campaign, and length of the ads. Subscriber 130 may also select a budget for a predetermined time period, such as a weekly budget. Subscriber 130 may select a campaign that is local, national or network specific. In one embodiment, the user provides the campaign information through a web browser. A traffic estimator 220 ( FIG. 2 ) provides bidding guidance to the subscriber for media play bids.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing elements in scalable IMS (Inventory Management System) 200 used to schedule advertisements in a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the system 200 places radio ads on select radio stations, matching advertiser campaigns and creatives with available advertising spots on radio stations.
- the IMS 200 supports three models for buying available advertising slots: Guaranteed, reserved based on urgency, and Open (also called Auction).
- Guaranteed campaigns are promised specific spots on a specified station, date, and daypart. In one embodiment, once the campaign books the spots, it will lose the spot only via play failure or if the forecasted inventory is not published by the station, not through preemption from another campaign booked through the system. Guaranteed campaigns can range in length anywhere up to several months in length, and can be booked up to several months in advance. At times, advertisers place value on knowing that a particular spot will run at a particular time.
- Guaranteed campaigns are not simply an inventory reservation, however, because of the way that the advertisers specify their campaigns. For example, they may not specify which stations and times to play on, instead they provide targeting criteria, such as number of listeners, listener demographics, the times of day to run, the markets play in, and so forth. Audio Ads then compares those criteria against the available inventory and presents a proposal for meeting those criteria.
- guaranteed campaigns specify a maximum CPM to pay. Each guaranteed campaign takes as much inventory as it needs to satisfy its campaign goals while keeping within its spending limits and other user-specified criteria. If the advertiser is happy with the station and time mix then they approve the campaign and Audio Ads books it. Specifying campaign goals, viewing the proposal, and finalizing or booking the campaign are all done online through the Audio Ads front end.
- the system should take no more than a few seconds (say, 10 seconds) to prepare a proposal once the criteria have been specified.
- the user must review the proposal and can book it within a few minutes. If the user waits too long to book the proposal, in one implementation, a new proposal will be generated to prevent staleness of the proposal in light of inventory changes.
- campaigns can reserve inventory as in the guaranteed model. However, campaigns with a higher urgency take precedence over campaigns with lower urgency.
- spots are presented to the campaign with the highest “urgency”. Each spot is auctioned off in turn.
- urgency is defined as being first in time to book, with one approach simply assigning earlier-booked campaigns the highest urgency.
- Open campaigns play on inventory that has not been filled by guaranteed campaigns and can be preempted by guaranteed campaigns. Open campaigns are booked according to desired demographics and market criteria and the maximum CPM the advertiser is willing to pay. In one implementation, inventory spots not filled by guaranteed campaigns are filled with open campaigns at the last moment. In one embodiment, a system administrator can set a percentage inventory to set aside for open campaigns that will not be sold to guaranteed campaigns. Open campaigns compete among themselves for spots, with the “highest bidder” winning. The “bid” from an open campaign can be based on how well a spot meets the campaign goals in addition to the CPM. Every campaign determines what the spot is worth in terms of the campaign's goals.
- each campaign evaluates each spot according to the relevant target demographic information for the campaign and adjusts the bid according to the campaign goals based on other criteria, such as time of day, market, etc.
- the auction process for open campaigns can be run at various intervals, for example, hourly, several times a day, once a day, or at other intervals.
- the traffic estimator 220 assists the subscriber 130 for making bids for spots in the auctions for the open campaign.
- Audio Ads often only receives the precise schedule, for example, one day in advance but spots can be sold months in advance, it is possible that spots will be sold to a guaranteed campaign that ends up not being made available. Ads also may fail to play because of play failures. Audio Ads addresses the first issue by forecast inventory, though the forecasting may not be precise. The second issue is addressed after the fact. Since it is a goal of the system to meet 100% of the guaranteed campaign requirements, Audio Ads monitors guaranteed campaigns in progress and adds additional “make good” spots whenever spots are lost or fail to play. In one embodiment the user can enable or disable make goods.
- the Audio Ads Inventory Management System (IMS) 200 is responsible for matching advertising campaigns to available advertising spots on the radio stations or other broadcast technologies serviced.
- Campaigns are usually specified as a set of constraints or criteria that the campaign must meet, such as markets the ad will play in, demographics it should reach, the number of listeners who should hear it, and the times of the day (dayparts) during which it should run.
- Radio stations typically publish the available spots one day in advance. In one embodiment, this inventory is then matched to the campaigns to satisfy the maximum number of campaigns. Since spots will be more valuable to some campaigns than to others (for example, the demographics of a certain spot may match one campaign but not another), it is desirable to optimize the allocation of spots across multiple campaigns.
- inventory is known just one day in advance, but campaigns generally are booked days, weeks, or months in advance. Campaigns are frequently timed to match external events such as sales or movie releases, so predictability can be important.
- the Audio Ads system 200 deals with these competing factors by forecasting inventory. Currently, a simple exponential smoothing method is used to forecast inventory many months in advance. In other embodiments, the method accounts for trends or seasonality. Alternatively, different forecasting models are applied on a station by station basis.
- the External Interface 204 provides external access to the system 200 through a UI 202 .
- UI 202 interacts with the rest of system 200 to create and manage campaigns and for reporting.
- a Station Inventory Manager (SIM) 214 manages all inventory for a single station. It maintains information about each spot such as whether it is an actual available spot or a forecast spot; whether it is available, reserved, or booked; the priority of the campaign that booked it; when it was booked; who booked it; and so forth.
- a Forecaster 216 is responsible for updating the inventory based on the radio station schedule. It can provide exact information for upcoming spots or may forecast future spots based on past history.
- a Campaign Manager (CM) 212 manages a single campaign, buying inventory on behalf of the campaign to meet campaign goals, and buying new inventory if its existing inventory is lost or fails to play.
- SIMs 214 record their current allocations to persistent storage.
- a Creative Assigner 217 then assigns creatives to spots (using the allocations produced by the SIMs 214 ) and produces the final play list.
- Each of the components in the diagram can be implemented as a separate process and could be allocated to its own machine. In other embodiments, however, for efficiency purposes, multiple SIMs will be grouped together in one task, multiple CMs will be grouped together in one task, and the Forecaster will be implemented as classes and run within the SIM's JVM. (If the SIM is implemented in Java)
- the External Interface provides methods for creating and managing campaigns and for examining inventory. Methods for creating and managing campaigns will be used by the Audio Ads front-end to provide the advertiser user interface. Methods for examining inventory will be used primarily by reporting tools.
- the Station Inventory Manager (SIM) 214 manages all inventory for a single station. It maintains a list of all known spots for that station and automatically allocates spots to particular campaigns. Since spots are forecasted, it is possible for a campaign to book a spot that later disappears from inventory. Whenever a booked spot is removed from inventory, the Campaign Manager that owns that spot will try to make up the loss.
- SIM Station Inventory Manager
- Each spot in the inventory has a priority which matches the priority of the campaign that allocated the spot.
- the SIM can allocate unassigned spots or spots with a lower priority than the requesting campaign.
- each campaign has a different view of available inventory that depends on the campaign priority. This feature is intended to allow different campaign types, such as guaranteed campaigns (where specific spots are sold in advance) and open campaigns (where spots can be taken by someone willing to pay more). It also allows urgent, high priority campaigns to take inventory from less important campaigns. If necessary to reduce memory requirements, inventory older than one day may be discarded.
- Spots in the inventory have, among other attributes, a unique identifier, a play date, a play time, a length, an accuracy (actual or forecast), a booking status (available, reserved, or booked), a priority (taken from the priority of the booking campaign), a booking date, and a booking campaign.
- attributes are merely examples. In other embodiments, spots in inventory may have a greater or lesser number of attributes.
- Spots can be reserved on a temporary basis by a campaign so that a potential buy can be displayed to a user for approval. If the spots are not booked within the timeout period they will be returned to inventory in the same state they were in before the reservation. A campaign may only book spots that it has previously reserved. In one implementation, reserved spots cannot be reserved or booked by campaigns at the same or lower priority than the owning campaign.
- Campaigns do not query inventory but instead request to reserve or book inventory. This avoids concurrency issues that would arise if a campaign requests a view of inventory but that inventory is taken by another campaign before the first campaign can reserve it. All reservations and bookings are automatic so that a campaign can be guaranteed that spots that it has booked actually belong to it. Of course, campaigns with a higher priority can still take that inventory from the booking campaign, which will need to book alternate spots to make up for the loss.
- the SIM 214 will support general queries of existing inventory, but such queries should be infrequent.
- the SIM 214 When a campaign requests spots, it should make a request such as “reserve N spots of this length on this day and in this daypart”.
- the SIM 214 will search its inventory and do the best it can to honor the request while taking into account station rules such as maximum number of spots assigned to a single campaign, no back-to-back spots assigned to a single campaign, and so forth.
- the SIM 214 manages stitching issues by coalescing adjacent shorter spots when possible and by preferentially fulfilling requests with stitched spots. For example, if a SIM 214 has a 60-second spot available, it may assign half of it to a 30-second campaign and then assign the second half to the very next 30-second campaign.
- the Campaign Manager manages a single campaign, buying inventory on behalf of the campaign to meet campaign goals, and buying new inventory if its existing inventory is lost or fails to play.
- a Campaign Manager When a campaign is booked, a Campaign Manager is created for that campaign which then attempts to reserve (and subsequently book) the inventory that will fill the campaign goals. It queries the Metrics Manager 208 to learn of radio stations, AQH, CPM, etc., and determine which stations it should attempt to buy from. There will be an Inventory Snapshot available to the Campaign Manager that holds a slightly stale view of inventory. This snapshot can be used to refine the initial inventory request. For example, a campaign may wish to spread its purchases equally across markets and may need to know its chances of getting inventory in specific markets before finalizing the purchases. If any of its purchases are unsuccessful, the Campaign Manager will attempt to buy alternate spots until its goals are met.
- the Campaign Manager will learn of these changes. When inventory is lost the Campaign Manager must attempt to “make good” by buying alternate spots. The Campaign Manager will attempt to buy a spot that is roughly equivalent to the spot that was lost. No other considerations will be taken when buying a “make-good” spot.
- the Campaign Manager does not know the precise state of the inventory when it determines what buys to attempt. It should request N spots from the radio stations in its market within the days and dayparts that meet its criteria, while in one embodiment making a small number of large requests rather than a large number of small requests. Some of those requests will succeed and others will fail or will be only partially fulfilled.
- the Campaign Manager knows the status of all its requests, it will determine if additional buy attempts are needed to meet its goals. It may be possible that, to meet proper market or daypart distribution, a Campaign Manager will want to return spots to inventory. This is allowed if the spots have been reserved but not yet booked, and the returned spots will revert to their prior status. However, this mechanism is expected to be a small fraction of total buys.
- a campaign can be paused, in which case no spots for that campaign will be actually played (unless they have already been queued to the station). The spots will not be returned to inventory unless the campaign is cancelled. If spots from a paused campaign need to be filled, they will be auctioned off by the Auctioneer. When a campaign is resumed it should not lose any of its inventory, except what was auctioned off because its play time has passed. The primary purpose for pausing a campaign would be to temporarily block a campaign because the account holder has not paid its bills. If the account is cancelled, all campaigns for that account should be cancelled; if the account is reactivated, all paused campaigns should be resumed.
- the SIM provides functionality for releasing all inventory belonging to a specific campaign over a range of dates.
- campaign manager 1313 can bid in accordance with a criterion, including an external criterion.
- campaign pricing is currently determined on a campaign-by-campaign basis through negotiation with the advertiser booking the campaign. This is especially true of nationwide campaigns that buy guaranteed spots. In other embodiments, however, pricing is more dynamic and able to be set online or automatically while booking the campaign.
- the Campaign Manager 213 uses a Pricing Engine 207 to determine the price of spots it buys. The price from the Pricing Engine 207 is passed to the SIM, which uses it to determine which campaigns to prefer when allocating inventory.
- the Pricing Engine associates each spot with a price at which a Campaign Manager can reserve it as part of a guaranteed campaign.
- the pricing set by the engine may vary based on buy type, buyer, and/or other factors.
- the Pricing Engine is part of the Campaign Manager. In other embodiments, the Pricing Engine is a component separate from the CM 213 .
- the Metrics Manager has the job of maintaining and providing station metrics for all stations supported by IMS.
- the Campaign Manager can learn all relevant information about potential inventory from the Metrics Manager.
- Metrics System 200 also contains a business layer that determines, for example, which stations are online, what is a station's format, and what is a station's market. In other embodiments, these functions are also performed by the Metrics Manager.
- Metrics Manager also tells the Campaign Manager what demographics a station caters to, and what their listener numbers are.
- the Campaign Manager 213 access the Metrics Manager 208 and business layer 209 to receive information. For example, the Campaign Manager can request the average listeners as reported by Arbitron for certain dayparts on certain stations. Alternatively, data from other survey or research companies can be used.
- the Campaign Manager can further request from the Metrics Manager 208 data corresponding only to a specific demographic at which the campaign is targeted.
- the Metrics Manager 208 holds all its data in a database
- the Metrics Manager supports various metrics for calculating the value of spots for particular campaigns on alternate research besides Arbitron.data.
- the Campaign Manager can indicate which research or metric type to use, and the Metrics Manager finds and normalizes the data before returning the values.
- the Forecaster's primary responsibility is to predict and adjust inventory for a station.
- the Forecaster may run in the same process as the SIM 214 .
- the Forecaster should recalculate both known and expected inventory for the coming days or periods. This forecast will add new spots to inventory, remove existing spots from inventory, or adjust the play time of existing spots. If inventory is lost, the owning campaign is notified so that it can buy additional, “make-good” inventory. Note that in one embodiment, when determining which spot to eliminate, the spot within the daypart with the lowest priority should be removed.
- Inventory for the immediate future should be known precisely, while inventory further in the future is be predicted.
- the accuracy of the prediction should be marked in the inventory and adjusted as the data becomes more precise. For example, spots for “tomorrow” might be accurate to the minute, while spots for “next month” might be accurate only to a daypart.
- the forecaster also predicts the reliability of the inventory, based on an analysis of prior station performance and the accuracy of the forecast. If a station frequently schedules inventory but then fails to play it, this will be reflected in the reliability. Spot reliability may be used by the campaign buyer to evaluate the quality of the campaign.
- forecaster 206 uses a Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method, which takes into account both trends and seasonality.
- the architecture supports applying different forecasting models on a station by station basis.
- the Forecaster While the actual computation of the forecast is very fast, especially with exponential smoothing methods which can complete their computation with the addition of just a single new number, updating the inventory can be computationally expensive. The reason for this is that the Forecaster must update existing inventory by adding new spots, removing lost spots, or adjusting the play time of existing spots. Therefore, in one embodiment, the Forecaster either maintains its own copy of all existing inventory, or it queries the SIM to learn its inventory. It then calculates deltas from existing inventory to new inventory and applies the changes. For these reasons it is expected that the Forecaster will best be implemented in the same process as the SIM so that expensive, large-payload process-to-process communication is avoided.
- the Play Verifier 219 examines the play history for each station and determine if spots that were allocated failed to play. The owning Campaign Manager is notified for each failure. In one embodiment, Campaign Managers attempt to make good any play failures.
- Creative Assigner When the final play list needs to be generated for a station, the Creative Assigner will read the persistent allocations written by the SIM(s), assign creatives to specific spots (allocations), and make the play list available to the Audio Server.
- Creative assigner 1317 can perform copysplitting in accordance with a criterion, such as an external criterion or a criterion based on effectiveness of previous plays.
- the Auctioneer 206 performs an auction on a regular basis when there are spots to be sold to open campaigns that have not be sold to guaranteed campaigns.
- the number of campaigns competing for the spots can potentially be quite large.
- the method for performing the auction are as follows:
- the auction is run on a scheduled basis. Bidding will remain open for a number of minutes determined via configuration, for example about 10 minutes. Open Campaign Managers must examine the schedule and place bids in a timely manner. However, not all campaigns bid at the same time. In one embodiment, Open Campaign Managers will randomize the times at which they will place bids, to reduce peak bandwidth requirements.
- the auction Since the auction is only taking place for unallocated spots within, for example, one single day, the auction is expected to execute quickly.
- Open Campaigns While the above architecture will handle campaigns of all types and requirements, the special requirements of Open Campaigns can cause a rather large flood of inventory grabs and subsequent losses as higher priority campaigns take those spots. Open Campaigns have market and demographics requirements, but they are designed to take only inventory not allocated to guaranteed campaigns.
- an Open Campaign would grab all available inventory in its desired markets, up to its price cap. This can be a large number of spots. Further, current business requirements demand that all Open Campaigns compete fairly for inventory, so as new Open Campaigns book inventory, they must, on a random basis, bump other Open Campaigns from their spots. Finally, Open Campaigns have the lowest priority of all campaigns, so as higher priority campaigns are booked, it is possible that the majority of spots they take will already be owned by an Open Campaign. Therefore, in these cases, a Campaign Manager should be notified.
- Open Campaigns will instead compete in an auction for unallocated spots just prior to the spots being published to the allocation list. It will typically cover all unsold inventory for one single day, but the timeframe can be more or less than one day.
- system 200 sends more than one ad in the stream to the target (such as a radio station or podcast target). Both ads are initially sent and at a later time, but before either of the ads is played, the system sends an indication of which ad should be played. In another embodiment, both ads are played, but the system 200 sends an indication of their relative percentage of play time.

In another embodiment, both ads are played, but the system 200 sends an indication of their relative percentage of play time.
- the trafficking system 210 may schedule the play of a particular ad in three slots at three assigned times each day during the weekdays of Monday through Friday. Obviously, once advertising inventory builds, conflicts arise between advertising requests, particularly during rush hour or high desirability playtimes.
- Subscriber 130 may select a maximum cost per thousand (CPM) bid and a budget for an advertising campaign, and select the campaign specifics which may include markets, desired demographics, and dayparts.
- the traffic estimator 220 generates recommended bids and expected results of the auction based on the bids.
- the expected results may include, for example, expected average CPM, expected weekly spend, expected weekly impressions (equal to expected weekly spend/CPM), and expected weekly unique listeners.
- the traffic estimator 220 may also generate campaign predictions that include a summary of CPM, listeners and raw cost by market segment, and summary of trends and volatility in same.
- subscriber 130 does not provide a maximum CPM.
- the traffic estimator 200 also provides a recommended maximum CPM bid for meeting the budget, based on a numerical solver.
- the solver is a bisection method.
- the solver is based on a doctors falsi method.
- the solver is based on combination of a bisection method and a ceremonies falsi method.
- the subscriber 130 may create an ad campaign with heterogeneous segments with a recommended single CPM bid, even though it will be too high for some segments and too low for others (e.g., if his campaign includes Fresno and Los Angeles metro areas, generally subscriber 130 should bid more for Los Angeles on a CPM basis.)
- the user may define different CPM bids in his campaign, such as on a market segment basis.
- the traffic estimator 220 bases the winning bid as the bid of the runner-up plus one cent.
- the traffic estimator 220 may be executed in a Spring framework container running in Java programming language.
- the traffic estimator 220 may estimate the bid using probability density functions (PDFs) built with historical data of bids and sales of media plays for radio stations and dayparts.
- PDFs may be non-normal PDFs of random variables, and may include seasonality of the random variable (e.g. spot availability increases in sweeps week, monthly and annual cycles), and trends of the random variable (because the number of spots will likely increase over time).

- the data retrieval may be done in a batch for the PDF manager to update the PDF map 402 .
- the demographic data is grouped by station/daypart combinations.
- the data cache manager 406 retrieves an estimate of the number of listeners: For a given station, the estimated number of Average Query Hour (AQH) listeners, is broken down by gender and age groups (e.g. male 12-17, male 18-20, and so forth.), for example, for all 6 standard dayparts.
- the requested demographics for example:

- the advertiser assistant service manager 404 generates an estimate of a weekly spending of a campaign, and if requested by a subscriber 130 , generates a recommended CPM bid based on the weekly budget. Although budgets are described herein in terms of weekly budgets, budgets for other time intervals may be used.
- the advertiser assistant service manager 404 analyzes a campaign and estimates weekly spending and an average CPM of the campaign based on a maximum CPM bid. On the other hand, if no maximum CPM bid is selected, the advertiser assistant service manager 404 analyzes a campaign and recommends to the advertiser a maximum CPM bid of the campaign that meets the budget, by using a solver.
- the advertiser assistant service manager 404 estimates the budget by a recursion, breaking the campaign into its constituent station daypart combinations and then estimating auction results using the PDFs for each of the constituent station dayparts.
- the advertiser assistant service manager 404 uses a bisection solver as described below in conjunction with FIG. 6 .
- a tricycle manager 410 executes a seasonal analysis of the media play slots based on time cycles.
- the tricycle manager 410 uses a Holt Winters model of seasonality.
- the tricycle manager 410 uses an Arthur Weinberger model that analyzes monthly cycles or weekly cycles.
- radio ad spot availability exhibits 3 seasonal patterns. Within a month, there is more availability in the middle weeks than in the first and fourth weeks. Similarly there are more spots in the middle months of a year, and there are also patterns in the 7 days of a week. Consequently, the tricycle manager 410 estimates the rates of spot availability for a station for various time intervals.
- the advertiser assistant service manager 404 uses the tricycle manger 410 to adjust the non seasonal estimates produced using the PDFs, thus creating seasonally adjusted budget estimates.
- the tricycle manager 410 adjusts the spots per time for a given station and daypart based on Weinberger's formula:
- the tricycle manager 410 may adjust the spots per week for a station and daypart between two dates by partitioning the spots into constituent day parts, and then summing the results of the adjust spots per time with each specific daypart.
- the tricycle manager 410 converts the spot count to an annualized rate.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing a method used by the traffic estimator 200 .

- the traffic estimator 220 may use the process described below in conjunction with FIG. 7 to allocate budgets.
- the traffic estimator 220 divides 504 the campaign into sub-campaigns, corresponding to the DMA metro areas, stations and day parts, for a recursive analysis to determine the bids for various media plays.
- the traffic estimator 220 determines 506 stations and ad spots available for the sub-campaigns, and retrieves 508 the historical PDFs and seasonal objects for the stations.
- the traffic estimator 220 may determine 506 the stations and ad spots using the process of FIGS. 3A and 3B .
- the traffic estimator 220 calculates 512 an expected CPM and weekly spending for each sub-campaign, unadjusted for seasonality or trend, using the PDF map 402 .
- the traffic estimator 220 adjusts 514 the sub campaign results for seasonality using the seasonal map 403 .
- the traffic estimator 220 aggregates 519 the sub-campaigns, and generates 520 the recommended bids for the various media plays in the recommended dayparts for the recommended stations.
- the traffic estimator 220 executes 515 a solver procedure as described in FIG. 6 .
- the solver procedure selects a maximum CPM guess that is expected to be above the estimated CPM, and then iteratively determines a CPM and a weekly budget.
- the solver is a hybrid of bisection and regula falsi solvers. The hybrid technique may provide faster convergence for monotone increasing, discontinuous sample distributions functions.
- the traffic estimator 220 aggregates 519 the sub-campaigns, and generates 520 the recommended bids for the various media plays in the recommended dayparts for the recommended stations.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart showing the execute solver 515 of the method of FIG. 5 .
- the traffic estimator 220 estimates 601 an overspending CPM (e.g., a CPM that exceeds the expected CPM for the ad) and an underspending CPM (e.g., zero dollars). This defines an interval including the expected CPM, and for a monotone PDF, the solver converges.
- an overspending CPM e.g., a CPM that exceeds the expected CPM for the ad
- an underspending CPM e.g., zero dollars
- the traffic estimator 220 executes 602 a pregnant falsi process. Reguli falsi uses secants to update the interval endpoints. If the process is converging 604 , the traffic estimator determines 608 whether the convergence meets a threshold. If not 608 , the traffic estimator 220 continues executing 602 the ses falsi process. If the convergence meets the threshold, the traffic estimator 220 generates a bid. Otherwise if the process is not converging 604 , the traffic estimator 220 executes 606 a bisection process until a timeout occurs and then continues executing 602 the ceremonies falsi process. The converging 604 allows the ceremonies falsi process to execute as long as it converges. The bisection process always converges, but is typically slower than a ceremonies falsi process. As noted above, in alternative embodiments, one of the bisection and the ceremonies falsi processes is performed.
- FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating the dividing into sub-campaigns 504 .

Abstract
Description
-
- matching spots are removed from inventory
- the reservation is timed so that spots can be restored after the timeout
-
- the spots are allocated to the booking campaign
-
- if the spot is currently booked: the spot is marked as available
- if the spot is currently reserved: the spot is returned to its pre-reservation state
Campaign Manager 213
-
- The Auctioneer opens bidding for unsold spots.
- Open Campaign Managers that are interested in the station examine the Inventory Snapshot to determine what spots may potentially be bid upon.
- Each Open Campaign Manager sends its bids to the Auctioneer.
- The Auctioneer waits a reasonable amount of time for all bids to come in. This interval should be short enough to ensure timely completion of the auction but lengthy enough that normal latency is accounted for.
- The Auctioneer picks the winning bid and books the spot with the SIM.
- The Auctioneer notifies all winning Campaign Managers so that they can update their campaign status.
