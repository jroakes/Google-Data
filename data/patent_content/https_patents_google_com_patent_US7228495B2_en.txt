Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to assistive technology for using information on a display and particularly to using information displayed on a web page for individuals that have visual disabilities.
- Rapid identification of links is also very useful when looking at pages that consist primarily of images where the links are embedded buttons or graphics on the page.
- the ability to scan web pages and rapidly identify links to associated material allows the typical reader to quickly jump to other relevant sites and thereby allows them to efficiently sift through the large volume of data available on the Internet until they find a page that contains exactly what they were looking for.
- a method and system for providing an index to linked sites to a web page comprises parsing the HTML code of the web page to identify all anchor tag pairs and image map tag pairs in the page.
- the method further includes storing all HREF attribute values defined within each of the anchor tag pairs and image map tag pairs to an index file and determining the source of each respective HREF attribute.
- the method and system comprises determining if there is a plain English link text string associated with that HREF attribute value and storing the link text string in the index file with its associated HREF attribute. If no plain English link text string is found associated with a given HREF attribute, the method and system further comprises linking to the page defined by the URL specified in the HREF attribute value and parsing the code of that page for the value of its ⁇ TITLE> tag (which by HTML convention, is a very short plain-English description of the contents of the page) and then storing that title value in the index file with its corresponding HREF attribute. The method and system further includes using the original HREF attribute value as a placeholder in the index file if no plain English link text string or title value can be discovered.
- the method and system comprises determining if there is an ALT attribute associated with that HREF attribute value and storing the value of the ALT attribute (which by HTML convention, is “plain-English” text that describes the image) in the index file with its corresponding HREF attribute value.
- the method and system further includes linking to the page defined by the URL specified in the HREF attribute value and parsing the code of that page for the value of its ⁇ TITLE> tag if there is no ALT attribute originally associated with that HREF, in which case the value of the title tag is stored in the index file with its corresponding HREF attribute value.
- the method and system further includes using the original HREF attribute value as a placeholder in the index file if no ALT attribute value or title value can be discovered.
- the method and system further includes creating a second web page based upon the contents of the index file.
- This second web page which is an index of the links contained on the original page, is structured such that the plain-English descriptive text for each of the links on the original page can be presented to the user in two ways: an aural (voiced) presentation method in which the index page is served to a screen reader application for voicing, or a visual presentation method in which the plain-English descriptions are superimposed in large, high-contrast text above the hotspot zones of each corresponding HREF attribute value. See U.S. Pat. No.
- a system and method in accordance with the present invention allows blind and vision impaired users to quickly identify links to relevant material when “viewing” web pages that consist primarily of either plain text or images.

- a user is capable of inputting data and control selections to the system through the keyboard 24 , trackball 32 , mouse 26 or microphone 29 and of receiving output information from the system via display 38 or speaker 28 .
- FIG. 2 A generalized diagram of a portion of an internet, which the computer controlled display terminal 57 used for Web page or other document display of the present invention, is connected as shown in FIG. 2 .
- Computer controlled display terminal 57 is the computer system shown in FIG. 1 and connection 58 ( FIG. 2 ) is the network connection shown in FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 2 The system embodiment of FIG. 2 is typically known as a high-speed connection. Such high-speed connections are utilized extensively through network access servers 53 which are linked 51 to the net 50 .
- the servers 53 are maintained by a service provider to the client's display terminal 57 .
- the host's server 53 is accessed by the client terminal 57 through a high-speed linkage 58 such as DSL or a T1 line.
- the HTML files representative of the Web pages are downloaded to display terminal 57 via the line linkages from server 53 which may have accessed them from the internet 50 via linkage 51 .
- a system and method in accordance with the present invention is utilized in the environment described in FIGS. 1 and 2 to help visually impaired users to more readily use information on the web.
- the system and method in accordance with the present invention provides a substantial advantage over other link index methods (such as the one provided in Microsoft Internet Explorer) in that it intelligently generates a meaningful and easily understandable “plain-English” index of the links on any given page.
- This index can be aurally presented (voiced) and/or, when combined with a hotspot zone identification method (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,537, entitled “Ease of Use Interface to Hotspots in Hypertext Document Pages in Network Display Stations,” and assigned to the assignee of the present application) can also be visually presented.
- a system and method in accordance with the present invention dynamically generates a “plain English” index of the links on any given web page. This index page is then served to the screen reader application on the user's workstation for voicing.
- the system and method in accordance with the present invention operates in accordance with the following steps.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of the system and method which illustrates processing of a web page in accordance with the present invention.
- the underlying HTML code of the page currently being viewed is parsed to identify all anchor tag pairs and image map tag pairs, via step 102 .
- the values for all HREF attributes defined within the tag pairs are stored within an index file via step 104 .
- the source of the HREF attribute value is determined via step 106 . If the source is an anchor tag pair, it is determined if there is a “plain English” link text string associated with that HREF attribute, via step 108 . If there is a link text string associated with the HREF attribute, then the link text string is stored in the index file with its corresponding HREF attribute value, via step 110 .
- step 108 If there is no link text string associated with the HREF attribute value (step 108 ), then a link is made to the page URL defined by the HREF attribute and the underlying code of that page is parsed for a title tag, via step 114 . Thereafter, the value of the title tag with its corresponding HREF value is stored in the index file, via step 116 . If the source of the HREF attribute (step 106 ) is an image map tag pair, it is determined whether an ALT attribute is associated with the HREF attribute in the original code, via step 118 . If the answer is yes, then the value of the ALT attribute is stored in the index file with its corresponding HREF attribute value, via step 120 ,.
- steps 114 and 116 are executed to capture and store the value of the title tag in the page defined by the HREF attribute. Then, a plain-English web page of links is created from the contents of the index file, via step 112 .
- the HREF attribute value is used as a placeholder if no link text string or title value can be discovered.
- the plain-English web page is created, it is presented to the user. Therefore, next the method of presentation preferred by the user is determined, via step 122 . If the method is aural, then the web page is served to a screen reader application for voicing, via step 124 .
- the raw HREF is voiced as a placeholder. If, on the other hand, the presentation is visual, then hotspot zones are identified, via step 126 . Thereafter, the plain-English entry is superimposed from the index file over a zone corresponding to its HREF attribute value, via step 128 .
- Raw HREF is used as a placeholder if no plain-English entry could be found by algorithm.
- the algorithm described in the present invention would parse the code and for each ⁇ A> ⁇ /A> anchor tag pair found, it would store two items in the links index file that it generates.
- One of the items stored is the value of the HREF attribute contained within the ⁇ A> ⁇ /A> anchor tag pair, which in this example is “http://www.ibm.com”. This is the page that the web browser would link to if you clicked on this link.
- the other item stored in the index file is the descriptive “plain-English” link text string (if any such text has been defined) that is associated with this HREF attribute.
- the “plain-English” text string is “IBM Corporation Home Page”.
- the index page When the index page is served to a screen reader application for browsing, it is the link text string that is voiced instead of the mostly meaningless value of the HREF attribute.
- the link text string is also what is superimposed above the hotspot zone if a visual index presentation style is preferred by the user. If a link text string is not defined for an HREF attribute within any given ⁇ A> ⁇ /A> anchor tag pair, the algorithm will link to the page defined by the HREF, parse that page for the value of the ⁇ TITLE> tag, and store that value (which by HTML convention, is a very short plain-English description of the contents of the page), with its corresponding HREF for voicing or visual output. If no TITLE value is present, the algorithm will use the raw HREF value in the index file for voicing or visual output.
- HTML code used to generate it is as follows:
- the algorithm described in the present invention would parse the code underlying this page. For each ⁇ MAP> ⁇ /MAP> image map tag pair found, it would store two items in the links index file that it generates. One of the items stored is the value of the HREF attribute contained within the ⁇ MAP> ⁇ /MAP> image map tag pair, which in this example is “http://www.ibm.com”. This is the page that the web browser would link to if you clicked on this image.
- the other item stored in the index file is the descriptive “plain-English” text that is associated through the ⁇ ALT> attribute with this HREF. In this example, the “plain-English” text string defined by the ⁇ ALT> attribute is “IBM Corporation Home Page”.
- the index page When the index page is served to a screen reader application for browsing, it is the ⁇ ALT> attribute value that is voiced instead of the mostly meaningless value of the HREF attribute.
- the ⁇ ALT> attribute text string is also what is superimposed above the hotspot zone if a visual index presentation style is preferred by the user. If no ⁇ ALT> attribute is associated with an HREF within any given ⁇ MAP> ⁇ /MAP> image map tag pair, the algorithm will link to the page defined by the HREF and parse that page for the value of the ⁇ TITLE> tag and store it with the corresponding HREF for voicing or visual output. If no TITLE value is present, the algorithm will use the raw HREF value in the index file for voicing or visual output.
- the index web page generated by the algorithm described in the present invention would be served to the active screen reader application so that the index can be voiced to the user.
- a beep or the phrase “Index ready” could be voiced so that the user knows when the index is available.
- This index page could be prefaced with the following: “This page contains links to the following web sites. Select the number of the page you want to go to.” If the user has some form of speech recognition/control system available on their workstation, they could speak the number of the page. Other input methods such as mouse or keyboard selection would also be supportable via this system. This method provides an aural index to linked sites.
- the index page can be used to define plain-English labels for each link that is present on the page. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,537, entitled “Ease of Use Interface to Hotspots in Hypertext Document Pages in Network Display Stations,” and assigned to the assignee of the present application, which provides a detailed description of a method for identifying hotspot zones on a page.
- the plain-English label is superimposed over each zone that corresponds to the link contained within it in large, high-contrast text. A vision-impaired user is allowed to more easily read the link information on the current page.
- This URL points to a web page entitled “Going Global” shown in FIG. 4 .
- the underlying HTML code for this page is shown in FIGS. 5A–5C .
- the list shown in FIG. 6 is generated directly from the HREF attributes in the HTML code-highlighted in bold text in FIGS. 5 A through 5 C—that defines the Going Global home page. Obviously, this list is not meaningful to the typical user. It is not in plain-English. The URLs in their raw form tell the user very little, if anything, about the actual contents of the page that they link to. In addition, imagine how tedious and frustrating it would be to listen to this entire links page being read aloud to you.
- a system and method in accordance with the present invention provides an advantage by going one step further. It intelligently links to each of these URLs in the background when appropriate (that is, when a plain-English link text string label or ALT attribute is not originally defined for an HREF in the page being viewed), captures the plain-English titles of the linked target pages, and then displays that title (or the originally defined descriptive string) in the index page it generates instead of the raw (meaningless) URL.
- This plain-English index shown in FIG. 7 as generated by a system and method in accordance with the present invention is very easy to understand when voiced by a screen reader application when compared to the voiced output of a standard link index (as shown in FIG. 6 ).
- FIG. 8 Another example from a page that consists primarily of text is shown in FIG. 8 . It is taken from the Related Links section of the IBM Going Global site at:
- FIGS. 9A–9E The underlying code for the web page shown in FIG. 8 is illustrated in FIGS. 9A–9E .
- FIG. 10 A portion of the standard browser generated index of links on this page is shown in FIG. 10 . Again, note the many raw URLs that are difficult to understand. Conventional browsers are typically smart enough to at least use any defined plain-English text labels within the HREFs, but they do not intelligently link to other pages as necessary to capture title values nor do they use ALT values when present (note that although they are present in the HTML code for this page, they are ignored, thereby making the content of those images difficult to use for blind and visually impaired users). The relevant sections of the HTML code that acted as source material for this index page are highlighted in bold text within the code sample shown in FIGS. 9A–9E .
- a method and system in accordance with the present invention generates significantly more usable output using the same HTML page as input.
- a portion of the links index page that is output after utilizing the system and method in accordance with the present invention is shown in FIG. 11 .
- FIG. 11 The information in FIG. 11 as generated by a system and method in accordance with the present invention is much easier to understand when voiced than the standard index generated by a browser as shown in FIG. 10 .
- each zone corresponding to these links would be superimposed with its corresponding text in large, high-contrast text (typically, light text on a dark background provides optimal contrast for visually impaired users).
- FIG. 12 is an example of what this page might look like when a visually enhanced index based on this algorithm is superimposed above the hotspot zones identified by the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,537. It is now easy to see meaningful link information with the new presentation compared to trying to read the smaller original text.
- a system and method in accordance with the present invention allows blind and visually impaired users to quickly identify links to relevant material when “viewing” web pages that consist primarily of either plain text or images.
