Abstract
The application relates to virtual assistant generation of group recommendations. In one example, a method comprises: in response to receiving a request to make a recommendation for a group of users, and based on first privacy level data for the users of the group, an original recommendation list for the group is generated. In this example, the method further comprises: evaluating, by respective computing assistants associated with the group of users, recommendations from the original list of recommendations for inclusion in the condensed list of recommendations for the group based on respective second privacy level data for the group of users, wherein the second privacy level is more restrictive than the first privacy level. In this example, the method further includes outputting the condensed list of recommendations for presentation to the users of the group in response to the condensed list of recommendations including at least one recommendation.
Description
Technical Field
The application relates to virtual assistant generation of group recommendations.
Background
Some computing devices may provide a user interface from which a user may chat, speak, or otherwise communicate with a virtual computing assistant (e.g., also referred to as a "smart assistant" or simply "assistant") to cause the assistant to output useful information in response to the user's needs, or otherwise perform certain operations to assist the user in completing various real-world or virtual tasks. Some assistants may perform operations to help a group of users at the same time, for example, providing recommendations to the group of users based on the preferences of the group members.
Disclosure of Invention
In general, techniques of this disclosure may enable a virtual computing assistant (e.g., also referred to as a "smart assistant" or simply "assistant") associated with a user of a group to provide recommendations for the group based on the user's private information without disclosing the individual user's private information to other users of the group. For example, the computing assistant may generate the original recommendation list based on information available to the user (e.g., public information of the user or information that the user has agreed to be available for recommendation generation). While the original list of recommendations may be of general interest to the group of users, one or more individual users of the group may have a personal preference for agreeing or disapproving certain recommendations. Thus, if the assistant can access private information of the user indicating private preferences when generating recommendations, the original list of recommendations may be more meaningful to the group. However, it may not be desirable for an assistant associated with a particular user to access another private information and the private preferences of another user.
In accordance with one or more techniques of this disclosure, each respective assistant may evaluate recommendations from the original list for inclusion in the condensed recommendation list based on the private information of its associated user. Each respective assistant may determine not to include (i.e., knock out) a recommendation in the condensed list if the respective private information of its associated user indicates that the associated user has a negative preference for the recommendation. The assistant may then present (i.e., display or otherwise output) the condensed list to the user. In this way, the respective assistant may provide higher quality group recommendations that take into account the personal preferences of each user in the group while still protecting the privacy of the private information of their associated users.
In one example, a method comprises: in response to receiving a request to make a recommendation for a group of users, and based on first privacy level data for the users of the group, an original recommendation list for the group is generated. In this example, the method further comprises: evaluating, by respective computing assistants associated with the group of users, recommendations from the original list of recommendations for inclusion in the condensed list of recommendations for the group based on respective second privacy level data for the group of users, wherein the second privacy level is more restrictive than the first privacy level. In this example, the method further includes outputting the condensed list of recommendations for presentation to the users of the group in response to the condensed list of recommendations including at least one recommendation.
In another example, a computing device includes: at least one processor; and at least one memory including instructions that, when executed, cause the at least one processor to provide an assistant configured to: generating an original recommendation list for a group of users in response to receiving a request to recommend for the group and based on first privacy level data for the users of the group; outputting the original list of recommendations to respective computing assistants associated with the users of the group; receiving, from respective computing assistants associated with users of the group and based on respective second privacy level data of the users of the group, an indication of whether recommendations from the original recommendation list should be included in the condensed recommendation list for the group, wherein the second privacy level is more restrictive than the first privacy level; and outputting the condensed list of recommendations for presentation to the group of users in response to the condensed list of recommendations including at least one recommendation.
In another example, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed, cause one or more processors of a computing device to: generating an original recommendation list for a group of users in response to receiving a request to recommend for the group and based on first privacy level data for the users of the group; outputting the original list of recommendations to respective computing assistants associated with the users of the group; receiving, from respective computing assistants associated with users of the group and based on respective second privacy level data of the users of the group, an indication of whether recommendations from the original recommendation list should be included in the condensed recommendation list for the group, wherein the second privacy level is more restrictive than the first privacy level; and outputting the condensed list of recommendations for presentation to the group of users in response to the condensed list of recommendations including at least one recommendation.
The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

Detailed Description
Fig. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example system executing an example virtual assistant in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The system 100 of FIG. 1 includes an assistant server system 160 that communicates with a search server system 180 and computing devices 110A-110N (collectively, "computing devices 110") via a network 130. Although system 100 is shown as being distributed among assistant server system 160, search server system 180, and computing device 110, in other examples, features and techniques attributed to system 100 may be performed internally by components local to computing device 110. Similarly, assistant server system 160 may include certain components and perform various techniques that may be attributed to search server system 180 and/or computing device 110 in the following description.
Network 130 represents any public or private communication network, such as a cellular, Wi-Fi, and/or other type of network, for transmitting data between computing systems, servers, and computing devices. Assistant server system 160 may exchange data with computing devices of computing device 110 via network 130 to provide virtual assistant services that are accessible to computing device 110 when computing device 110 is connected to network 130. Assistant server system 160 may exchange data with search server system 180 via network 130 to access search services provided by search server system 180. Computing device 110 may exchange data with search server system 180 via network 130 to access search services provided by search server system 180.
Network 130 may include one or more network hubs, network switches, network routers, or any other network devices operatively coupled to each other to provide for the exchange of information between server systems 160 and 180 and computing device 110. Computing devices 110, assistant server system 160, and search server system 180 may send and receive data across network 130 using any suitable communication technology. Computing device 110, assistant server system 160, and search server system 180 may each be operatively coupled to network 130 using respective network links. The links coupling computing device 110, assistant server system 160, and search server system 180 to network 130 may be ethernet or other types of network connections, and such connections may be wireless and/or wired connections.
Each of the computing devices 110 represents a separate mobile or non-mobile computing device. Examples of computing device 110 include a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a server, a mainframe, a set-top box, a television, a wearable device (e.g., a computerized watch, computerized eyewear, computerized gloves, etc.), a home automation device or system (e.g., a smart thermostat or home assistant device), a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a gaming system, a media player, an electronic book reader, a mobile television platform, a car navigation or infotainment system, or any other type of mobile, non-mobile, wearable, and non-wearable computing device configured to execute or access a virtual assistant and receive information via a network, such as network 130.
Computing device 110A includes User Interface Device (UID)112, User Interface (UI) module 120, local assistant module 122A, and user information data store 124A. Local assistant module 122A can maintain user information datastore 124A as part of a virtual assistant service executing locally on computing device 110A for a particular user, such as user a. Other ones of computing devices 110 may include components similar to computing device 110A. In some examples, each respective one of computing devices 110 may include a respective local assistant module and a respective user information data store associated with a respective user. For example, computing device 110B may include a local assistant module 122B (not shown) and a user information data store 124B (not shown) associated with user B. The local assistant modules 122A-122N may be collectively referred to as "local assistant modules 122". User information data stores 124A-124N may be collectively referred to as "user information data store 124".
In the example of fig. 1, user interface 114 is a graphical user interface associated with a virtual assistant service accessed by computing device 110A (e.g., provided by local assistant module 122 and/or remote assistant module 123A of assistant server system 160). In some examples, the user interface 114 may be an audible user interface. As shown in fig. 1, user interface 114 shows text of a conversation between a user of computing device 110A (i.e., "user a"), a user of computing device 110B (i.e., "user B"), a user of computing device 110C (i.e., "user C"), and a virtual assistant executing or accessible at computing device 110. The user interface 114 may include various forms of virtual assistant information such as audible sounds, vibrations, text, graphics, content cards, images, and the like. UI module 120 may cause UID 112 to output user interface 114 based on data UI module 120 receives from assistant server system 160 via network 130. UI module 120 may receive as input from assistant server system 160 and/or local assistant module 122 for presenting information (e.g., audio data, text data, image data, etc.) of user interface 114, and instructions from assistant server system 160 and/or local assistant module 122 for presenting information within user interface 114 at UID 112.
Local assistant module 122 of computing device 110 and remote assistant module 123 of assistant server system 160 may each perform similar functions described herein to automatically execute a respective assistant for a group of users that is configured to provide recommendations to the group of users. Remote assistant module 123 and user information data store 125 represent a server-side or cloud implementation of the example virtual assistant, while local assistant module 122 and user information data store 124 represent a client-side or local implementation of the example virtual assistant.
Modules 122 and 123 may each include a respective software agent configured to execute as an intelligent personal assistant that may perform tasks or services for a person (e.g., a user of a computing device of computing device 110). Modules 122 and 123 may perform these tasks or services based on user input (e.g., detected at UID 112), location awareness (e.g., based on context), and/or the ability to access other information (e.g., weather or traffic conditions, news, stock prices, sports scores, user schedules, shipping schedules, retail prices, etc.) from various information sources (e.g., stored locally on computing device 110, assistant server system 160, or obtained via a search service provided by search server system 180). Modules 122 and 123 may perform artificial intelligence and/or machine learning techniques to automatically identify and complete one or more tasks on behalf of a user.
The respective assistants provided by remote assistant module 123 and local assistant module 122 may automatically create, generate, or otherwise maintain personal records of information and store the personal records as user-specific values in a structured and semantic manner as user information data store 124 and user information data store 125, respectively. Data stores 124 and 125 may enable respective assistants executed by remote assistant module 123 and local assistant module 122, respectively, to quickly access personal information (e.g., user-specific values) to complete real-world tasks, virtual tasks, or otherwise respond to the user's immediate or future needs.
The assistant modules 122 and 123 may only retain personal records associated with the user after first receiving explicit permission for the user to allow this. Thus, users may have complete control over the manner in which their assistants collect and use information about them. For example, before maintaining a personal record associated with user a of computing device 110A, assistant modules 122A and 123A may cause UI module 120 to present, via UID 112, a user interface requesting user a to select a box, click a button, make a voice input, or otherwise provide a particular input to the user interface that is interpreted by assistant modules 122A and 123A as an explicit and affirmative consent for assistant modules 122A and 123A to collect and use user a's personal information.
Before storing the personal information in the data stores 124 and 125, the assistant modules 122 and 123 may encrypt or otherwise process the information maintained as a personal record to remove the actual identity of the user. For example, this information may be processed by assistant modules 122 and 123 such that any personally identifiable information is removed from the user's personal records when stored on data stores 124 and 125.
Assistant modules 122 and 123 can cause UI module 120 to present a user interface from which a user can modify or remove information from personal records stored on data stores 124 and 125. For example, the user interface may provide an area where the user may provide input to communicate commands to the assistant modules 122 and 123 to modify or remove particular pieces of personal information. In this way, each user of the computing device 110 may have full control over the information retained on the data stores 124 and 125 by the respective assistant modules 122 and 123.
Assistant modules 122 and 123 may enable a user to control the manner in which information in data stores 124 and 125 is used. For example, the assistant modules 122 and 123 may tag, mark, or otherwise annotate information in the data stores 124 and 125 as having various privacy levels. For example, assistant modules 122 and 123 may mark some information in data stores 124 and 125 as having a first privacy level and some information in data stores 124 and 125 as having a second privacy level. The second privacy level may be more restrictive than the first privacy level. That is, information tagged as having the second privacy level may be considered more private than information tagged as having the first privacy level. In some examples, the information tagged as having the first privacy level may be public information, or the information obtained may be otherwise publicly available.
In performing various operations, the assistant modules 122 and 123 may use the information in the data stores 124 and 125 tagged with various privacy levels for different purposes. For example, the more private the information, the more stringent assistant modules 122 and 123 may be in protecting the information. For example, assistant modules 122 and 123 can expose or otherwise provide information marked as exposed to other users and/or virtual assistants associated with other users, while hiding or otherwise protecting information marked as private from other users and/or virtual assistants associated with other users. In this manner, each user of the computing device 110 may have full control over how the information on the data stores 124 and 125 is used by the respective assistant modules 122 and 123.
Each entry in the personal records stored by the data stores 124 and 125 may be associated with a predefined schema that can be quickly traversed or parsed by the assistant modules 122 and 123 to find the information needed by the information assistant modules 122 and 123 at the current time to learn the user's needs and to assist the user in completing the task. Once the personal information has been recorded as one or more values specific to the user, the assistant modules in assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the user can quickly use the information associated with the user stored on data stores 124 and 125 to complete the task. If there are no ongoing tasks, the assistant modules 122 and 123 may provide the user (e.g., via the user interface 114) with examples of how the assistant may use this information in the future to assist the user. The user may later provide input at UID 112 to instruct assistant modules 122 and 123 to forget or modify the information.
The values stored by data stores 124 and 125 may be textual values (e.g., names of people, names of places, other textual descriptors of entities), numerical values (e.g., age, height, weight, other physiological data, other numerical information associated with the entities), or pointers to specific values of the user associated with the data store (e.g., to locations in memory of entities in a knowledge graph of the user, to locations in memory of contacts in an address book, etc.). In other words, the user-specific value may take many forms and be specific to a field of the personal record defined by the recording mode. The value may indicate the actual user-specific information or may be a reference to a location from which user-specific information may be retrieved.
The users of computing devices 110 may be in a group. Examples of groups include, but are not limited to, groups on a social media website, chat rooms, group chats, a special designation of a group of users, or any other affiliation of multiple users. The user of computing device 110 may join the group by itself, be added to the group (after receiving the user's consent), or create the group.
Assistant modules 122 and 123 may be configured to provide one or more recommendations, also referred to as group recommendations or multi-user recommendations, to a group of users. For example, a user may request that one of the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the user provide one or more recommendations for a group. Some examples of group recommendations include, but are not limited to, entertainment (e.g., a recommendation for a movie watched by the group), food (e.g., a recommendation for a restaurant or bar to which the group is traveling), travel (e.g., a recommendation for a travel location, a flight to pick up, or a tour), and shared goods (e.g., a purchase recommendation for a car/television/game console).
The quality of the group recommendations provided by the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user (i.e., the user requesting the recommendations) may be related to the quality of the information available to the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user. For example, the more information about the users in the group that the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user can use, the higher the quality of the resulting recommendation (i.e., the recommendation will be more likely to be accepted by members of the organization). Thus, it may be desirable for the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user to use as much of the personal information of the various members of the group as possible in order to generate recommendations that may be accepted by more members of the group.
However, the users of the group may not want their information to be accessible by other members of the group or the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user. Thus, the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user may have only limited access to information of users of the group other than the requesting user. Accordingly, the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user may generate the original recommendation list based on the first privacy level data for the users of the group. The first privacy level data may comprise public information of the users of the group and/or information that the users of the group have agreed to be available for group recommendation purposes. Since the original recommendation list is generated based on the limited data of the users of the group, the original recommendation list may not be as high quality as when the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user have access to the private information of the other users of the group.
In accordance with one or more techniques of this disclosure, respective ones of assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with a group of users may evaluate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the condensed recommendation list for the group based on respective second privacy level data for the group of users. For example, assistant modules 122 and 123 (e.g., assistant modules 122A and/or 123A) associated with a first user of the group may evaluate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the condensed recommendation list for the group based on a second privacy level of the first user, assistant modules 122 and 123 (e.g., assistant modules 122B and/or 123B) associated with a second user of the group may evaluate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the condensed recommendation list for the group based on a second privacy level of the second user, and so on. The second privacy level data may be more restrictive than the first privacy level data. For example, some data may be marked as second privacy level data by default, and/or a user of the group may have adjusted one or more settings to cause the data to be marked as second privacy level data.
Respective ones of the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the users of the group may output the results of the evaluations to the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user. For example, respective ones of assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with users of a group may output, for each respective recommendation in the original recommendation list, an indication of whether the respective recommendation should be included in the condensed recommendation list for the group. When the second privacy level data for a particular user indicates that the particular user has any negative preference for the recommendation, the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the particular user may determine that the particular recommendation should not be included in the condensed list of recommendations. The data of the user may indicate that the user has a negative preference for a recommendation when the data indicates that the user does not accept the recommendation, dislikes the recommendation, may accept the recommendation but prefers another option, or has any other negative meaning. However, the reason or explanation may not be provided to the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user along with the evaluation results.
The assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user may receive the rating results and determine whether any recommendations from the original recommendation list should be included in the condensed recommendation list. If none of the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the users of the group determine that the recommendation should not be included in the condensed recommendation list, the recommendation from the original recommendation list should be included in the condensed recommendation list.
In response to the condensed list of recommendations including at least one recommendation, the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user may output the condensed list of recommendations for presentation to the users of the group. For example, the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the requesting user may output a condensed list of recommendations to the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with other users of the group, which may be displayed, spoken, or otherwise output for presentation to their associated users. Since the original recommendation list is not known to the users of the group, and the assistant modules of which users are not known to the users of the group, resulting in recommendations not being included in the condensed recommendation list, the respective ones of the assistant modules 122 and 123 associated with the users of the group may effectively have blind "overrules" on recommendations from the original recommendation list. In this way, the assistant modules 122 and 123 may provide higher quality recommendations while still protecting the privacy of the private information of their associated users.
In some examples, such as the examples described above, the requesting user may be included in a group of users for which recommendations are generated. For example, a user may request a recommendation for the user and one or more other users. Thus, in such an example, recommendations may be generated based on the data of the requesting user. In some examples, the requesting user may not be included in the group of users for which recommendations are generated. For example, a user may request recommendations for other users (e.g., an administrative assistant may request recommendations for a group of other users). Thus, in such an example, recommendations may not be generated based on the requested user's data.
The above method provides several benefits: 1) maintaining privacy of personal information of individual users while generating higher quality recommendations for groups containing the users using the personal information of the users, 2) generating higher quality recommendations to minimize the time required to reach group consensus and thus the amount of power (e.g., battery power).
Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example computing device configured to execute an example virtual assistant in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Computing device 210 of fig. 2 is described below as an example of a computing device in computing device 110 of fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows only one particular example of computing device 210, and many other examples of computing device 210 may be used in other examples, and may include a subset of the components included in exemplary computing device 210, or may include additional components not shown in fig. 2.
As shown in the example of fig. 2, computing device 210 includes a user interface device (USD)212, one or more processors 240, one or more communication units 242, one or more input components 244, one or more output components 246, and one or more storage components 248. USD212 includes a display component 202, a presence-sensitive input component 204, a microphone component 206, and a speaker component 208. Storage components 248 of computing device 210 include UI module 220, assistant module 222, search module 282, one or more application modules 226, and user information data store 224.
One or more communication units 242 of computing device 210 may communicate with external devices (e.g., assistant server system 160 and/or search server system 180 of system 100 of fig. 1) via one or more wired and/or wireless networks by sending and/or receiving network signals over one or more networks (e.g., network 130 of system 100 of fig. 1). Examples of communication unit 242 include a network interface card (e.g., an ethernet card), an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, a GPS receiver, or any other type of device that can send and/or receive information. Other examples of the communication unit 242 may include short wave radio, cellular data radio, wireless network radio, and Universal Serial Bus (USB) controller.
One or more input components 244 of computing device 210 may receive input. Examples of inputs are tactile, audio and video inputs. In one example, input component 242 of computing device 210 includes a presence-sensitive input device (e.g., touch-sensitive screen, PSD), mouse, keyboard, voice response system, camera, microphone, or any other type of device for detecting human or machine input. In some examples, input components 242 may include one or more sensor components, one or more location sensors (GPS components, Wi-Fi components, cellular components), one or more temperature sensors, one or more motion sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes), one or more pressure sensors (e.g., barometers), one or more ambient light sensors, and one or more other sensors (e.g., infrared proximity sensors, hygrometer sensors, etc.). Other sensors may include heart rate sensors, magnetometers, glucose sensors, olfactory sensors, compass sensors, pedometer sensors, to name a few other non-limiting examples.
One or more output components 246 of the computing device 110 may generate output. Examples of outputs are tactile, audio and video outputs. In one example, output components 246 of computing device 210 include a presence-sensitive display, a sound card, a video graphics adapter card, a speaker, a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), or any other type of device for generating output to a human or machine.
While shown as an internal component of computing device 210, UID 212 may also represent an external component that shares a data path with computing device 210 to send input and/or receive output. For example, in one example, UID 212 represents a built-in component of computing device 210 (e.g., a screen on a mobile phone) that is located within and physically connected to external packaging of computing device 210. In another example, UID 212 represents an external component of computing device 210 that is located outside and physically separate from a packaging or housing of computing device 210 (e.g., a monitor, projector, etc. that shares a wired and/or wireless data path with computing device 210).
As one example range, presence-sensitive input component 204 may detect an object such as a finger or stylus within a distance of 2 inches or less of display component 202. Presence-sensitive input component 204 may determine the location (e.g., [ x, y ] coordinates) of display component 202 at which the object was detected. In another example range, presence-sensitive input component 204 may detect objects that are 6 inches or less away from display component 202, and other ranges are possible. Presence-sensitive input component 204 may use capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques to determine the position of display component 202 selected by the user's finger. In some examples, presence-sensitive input component 204 also provides output to the user using tactile, audio, or video stimuli as described with respect to display component 202. In the example of fig. 2, PSD 212 may present a user interface (e.g., graphical user interface 114 of fig. 1).
The speaker assembly 208 may include speakers built into a housing of the computing device 210, and in some examples, may be speakers built into a set of wired or wireless headphones operatively coupled to the computing device 210. Microphone component 206 may detect audible input occurring at or near UID 212. The microphone component 206 may perform various noise cancellation techniques to remove background noise and isolate user speech from detected audio signals.
One or more processors 240 may implement the functions associated with computing device 210 and/or execute instructions associated with computing device 210. Examples of processor 240 include an application processor, a display controller, an auxiliary processor, one or more sensor hubs, and any other hardware configured to function as a processor, processing unit, or processing device. Modules 220, 222, 226, and 282 may be operable by processor 240 to perform various actions, operations, or functions of computing device 210. For example, processor 240 of computing device 210 may retrieve and execute instructions stored by storage component 248 that cause processor 240 to execute operational modules 220, 222, 226, and 282. When executed by processor 240, the instructions may cause computing device 210 to store information within storage component 248.
One or more storage components 248 within computing device 210 may store information for processing during operation of computing device 210 (e.g., computing device 210 may store data accessed by modules 220, 222, 226, and 282 during execution of the data at computing device 210). In some examples, storage component 248 is a temporary memory, meaning that the primary purpose of storage component 248 is not long-term storage. The storage component 248 on the computing device 210 may be configured as volatile memory for short-term storage of information, and therefore does not retain stored contents if power is removed. Examples of volatile memory include Random Access Memory (RAM), Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), and other forms of volatile memory known in the art.
In some examples, storage component 248 also includes one or more computer-readable storage media. In some examples, storage component 248 includes one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media. Storage component 248 may be configured to store larger amounts of information than is typically stored by volatile memory. Storage component 248 may also be configured as a non-volatile memory space for long-term storage of information and retain information after power on/off cycling. Examples of non-volatile memory include magnetic hard disks, optical disks, floppy disks, flash memory, or forms of electrically programmable memory (EPROM) or Electrically Erasable and Programmable (EEPROM) memory. Storage component 248 may store program instructions and/or information (e.g., data) associated with modules 220, 222, 226, and 282 and data store 224. Storage component 248 may include a memory configured to store data or other information associated with modules 220, 222, 226, and 282 and data store 224.
In some examples, UI module 220 may receive an indication of one or more user inputs detected at UID 212 and may output information regarding the user inputs to assistant module 222. For example, UID 212 may detect voice input from a user and send data regarding the voice input to UI module 220.
The assistant module 222 can include all of the functionality of the local assistant module in the local assistant module 122 of the computing device in the computing device 110 of fig. 1 and can perform similar operations as the local assistant module used to provide assistants. In some examples, the assistant module 222 may execute locally (e.g., at the processor 240) to provide assistant functionality. In some examples, assistant module 222 may act as an interface to a remote assistant service accessible to computing device 210. For example, assistant module 222 may be an interface or Application Programming Interface (API) to a remote assistant module in remote assistant modules 124 of assistant server system 160 of fig. 1.
Similar to user information data stores 124 and 125 of system 100 of FIG. 1, user information data store 224 may store personal records created by assistant module 222 that include information about the user of computing device 210 that assistant module 222 has learned or been provided with. In addition to any information provided by the search module 282, the assistant module 222 may also rely on information stored at the data store 224 to perform assistant tasks.
Similar to the assistant modules 122 and 123 of fig. 1, the assistant module 222 may be configured to generate recommendations for a group of users. For example, the assistant module 222 may generate an original recommendation list based on the first privacy level data of the group of users and output the original recommendation list for evaluation by computing assistants associated with other users of the group. The assistant module 222 may receive an indication from computing assistants associated with other users of the group as to whether a recommendation from the original recommendation list should be included in the condensed recommendation list for the group. In some examples, the indication may be positive. For example, a computing assistant associated with another user of the group may output to assistant module 222 a list of recommendations from the original recommendation list that are approved for inclusion in the condensed recommendation list. In some examples, the indication may be negative. For example, a computing assistant associated with another user of the group may output to the assistant module 222 a list of recommendations from the original recommendation list that are not approved for inclusion in the condensed recommendation list (i.e., a list of recommendations from the original recommendation list that are rejected by a computing assistant associated with another user).
The computing assistant associated with the group of users may generate the indication based on the respective second privacy level data for the group of users. As described above, the use of data tagged with the second privacy level may be more restricted than data tagged with the first privacy level. Also as described above, users of the group may be provided with an option to control which data is tagged with the second privacy level, and computing assistants associated with other users of the group may receive consent to use the data tagged with the second privacy level for generating group recommendations.
When the second privacy level data for a particular user indicates that the particular user has any negative preference for the recommendation, the computing assistant associated with the particular user of the group may determine that the particular recommendation should not be included in the condensed list of recommendations. The data of the user may indicate that the user has a negative preference for a recommendation when the data indicates that the user does not accept the recommendation, dislikes the recommendation, may accept the recommendation but prefers another option, or has any other negative meaning.
The assistant module 222 may generate a condensed list of recommendations based on the evaluations performed by the computing assistant. For example, assistant module 222 may determine whether each respective recommendation included in the original recommendation list has been overruled by at least one computing assistant. If the recommendation in the original recommendation list is not overruled by any computing assistant, the assistant module 222 may include the recommendation in a condensed recommendation list.
In response to the condensed list of recommendations including at least one recommendation (i.e., in the event that the at least one recommendation from the original list of recommendations is not vetoed by any computing assistant associated with the group of users), assistant module 222 may output the condensed list of recommendations for presentation to the group of users. As one example, assistant module 222 can cause UI module 220 to display a GUI including a condensed list of recommendations via display component 202. As another example, assistant module 222 may cause UI module 220 to output, via speaker component 208, synthesized speech that includes the condensed list of recommendations. As another example, the assistant module 222 may output the condensed list of recommendations to computing assistants associated with other users of the group, which may then display, speak, or otherwise output the condensed list of recommendations to their respective users.
In some examples, the condensed list of recommendations may not include any recommendations. For example, each recommendation from the original list of recommendations may be overruled by at least one of the computing assistants associated with the group of users. In some examples, assistant module 222 may notify user assistant module 222 of computing device 210 that no recommendations can be generated for the group. However, it may be undesirable for the assistant module 222 to be unable to generate any recommendations for the group, particularly if the recommendations are pruned based on the user having any negative preferences for the recommendations.
In accordance with one or more techniques of this disclosure, the assistant module 222 may cause a computing assistant associated with a user of the group to rate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the modified reduced recommendation list based on the weighted second privacy level data of the users of the group. As one example, in response to determining that the second privacy level data for a particular user of the group indicates that the particular user has a completely negative preference for the recommendation, a computing assistant associated with the particular user of the group may determine that the recommendation from the original recommendation list should not be included in the modified, reduced recommendation list. As another example, in response to determining that the second privacy level data for a particular user of the group indicates that the particular user has a partially negative preference for the recommendation, a computing assistant associated with the particular user of the group may determine that the recommendation from the original recommendation list should be included in the modified, reduced recommendation list.
The data for the user may indicate that the user has a complete negative preference for a recommendation when the data indicates that the user does not accept the recommendation, dislikes the recommendation, never accepts the recommendation, or has any other complete negative preference. For example, data indicating that the user is a vegetarian may indicate that the user has a completely negative preference if the user would feel offensive to going to a steak museum. The data of the user may indicate that the user has a partial negative preference for a recommendation when the data indicates that the user may accept the recommendation but prefers another option, generally dislikes the recommendation but may accept the recommendation for a group, or has any other moderate meaning. For example, data indicating that the user is a vegetarian might indicate that the user has a partial negative preference if the user is still feeling for a spot salad.
The assistant module 222 may generate a modified, reduced list of recommendations based on the evaluations performed by the computing assistant. For example, the assistant module 222 may determine whether each respective recommendation included in the original recommendation list has been rejected by at least one computing assistant based on the weighted data. If the recommendation from the original recommendation list is not rejected by any computing assistant based on the weighted data, the assistant module 222 may include the recommendation in the modified reduced recommendation list.
In response to the modified reduced list of recommendations including at least one recommendation, the assistant module 222 may output the modified reduced list of recommendations for presentation to the group of users. As one example, assistant module 222 can cause UI module 220 to display a GUI including the modified condensed list of recommendations via display component 202. As another example, assistant module 222 may cause UI module 220 to output, via speaker component 208, a synthesized voice that includes the modified, condensed list of recommendations. As another example, the assistant module 222 may output the modified reduced list of recommendations to computing assistants associated with other users of the group, which may then display, speak, or otherwise output the modified reduced list of recommendations to their respective users.
In some examples, a computing assistant (including assistant module 222) associated with the group of users may refrain from outputting any indication of data used to generate the recommendation list (reduced or modified reduced). For example, the computing assistant may refrain from indicating whether the recommendation list is based on the second privacy level data (i.e., is a reduced list) or the weighted second privacy level data (i.e., is a modified reduced list). The computing assistant may refrain from outputting any indication of the original recommendation list. Thus, the computing assistant may enable group recommendations to be generated based on the private data of group members without revealing the private data. In this way, the computing assistant may generate higher quality recommendations for the group.
Fig. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example computing system configured to execute an example virtual assistant in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The assistant server system 360 of fig. 3 is described below as an example of the assistant server system 160 of fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows only one particular example of the assistant server system 360, and many other examples of the assistant server system 360 may be used in other examples, and may include a subset of the components included in the example assistant server system 360, or may include additional components not shown in fig. 3.
As shown in the example of fig. 3, the assistant server system 360 includes one or more processors 340, one or more communication units 342, and one or more storage devices 348. Storage devices 348 include assistant module 322, search module 382, and user information datastores 325A-325N (collectively "user information datastores 325").
The search module 382 of the assistant server system 360 is similar to the search module 282 of the computing device 210 and may perform integrated search functions on behalf of the assistant server system 360. That is, search module 482 may perform a search operation on behalf of assistant module 322. In some examples, search module 382 may interact with an external search system to perform search operations on behalf of assistant module 322. When invoked, the search module 382 may perform search functions, such as generating search queries and performing searches on various local and remote information sources based on the generated search queries. The search module 382 may provide the results of the executed search to the calling component or module. That is, the search module 382 may output the search results to the assistant module 322.
Similar to user information data stores 124 and 125 of system 100 of fig. 1, user information data store 325 may store personal records created by assistant module 322 that include information about the respective user that assistant module 322 has learned or been provided with. In addition to any information provided by the search module 382, the assistant module 322 can also rely on information stored at the data store 325 to perform assistant tasks.
Fig. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating example operations performed by one or more processors executing an example virtual assistant in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 4 is described below in the context of system 100 of fig. 1. For example, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure, the local assistant module 122A may perform one or more of operations 402 and 420 when executed at one or more processors of the computing device 110A. And in some examples, according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure, the remote assistant module 122A may perform one or more of operations 402-420 when executed at one or more processors of the assistant server system 160. For purposes of illustration only, fig. 4 is described below in the context of computing device 110A of fig. 1.
In operation, computing device 110A may receive a request to generate a recommendation for a group of users (402). As shown in the example of fig. 1, user a, user B, and user C may be in a group chat. User a may ask: "do you also have an interest in traveling in march of march in march? ", user B may answer saying" i am interested ", user C may ask" where do you consider? ". However, seeing the chat, user B may say "do not do so again, we always say nothing together". To avoid discussing potential destinations, user a may say that they "let their virtual assistant provide some recommendations". In the example of FIG. 1, user A may query their virtual assistant for some recommendations by entering an assistant activation command and provide a request for recommendations for the group of users. For example, UI module 120 may receive an indication of user input at user a's UID 112, where user a types "@ associatant" where we should travel in month 3 ". UI module 120 may provide user input to assistant modules 122A and/or 123A.
An assistant module associated with the users of the group may obtain consent of the users of the group to use the first and second privacy level data (404). For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may obtain consent of user a to use first and second privacy level data of user a, assistant modules 122B and/or 123B may obtain consent of user B to use first and second privacy level data of user B, and assistant modules 122C and/or 123C may obtain consent of user C to use first and second privacy level data of user C.
Assistant module 122A and/or 123A may generate an original recommendation list for the group based on the first privacy level data for the users of the group (406). For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may evaluate first privacy level data of user a, user B, and user C to generate an original recommendation list. In this example, the first privacy level data for the group may indicate that user a, user B, and user C all prefer winter mountain sports (e.g., skiing or snowboarding), wayside alcohol, and tropical vacations. Based on the first privacy level data, the assistant module 122A and/or 123A may generate the original recommendation list to include boltzmann mountains for winter mountain sports, liechndon city, kentucky, for tasting wayside wine and visiting a brewery, and caribbean island for beach vacation. Assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may propagate or otherwise output the original recommendation list to computing assistants associated with other users of the group. For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A can output the original recommendation list to a computing assistant associated with user B (e.g., assistant modules 122B and/or 123B), and a computing assistant associated with user C (e.g., assistant modules 122C and/or 123C).
The respective computing assistant associated with the group of users may evaluate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the condensed recommendation list based on the respective second privacy level data of the group of users (408). For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may determine whether user a has any negative preferences for recommendations from the original recommendation list based on user a's second privacy level data. Similarly, the computing assistant associated with user B may determine whether user B has any negative preferences for recommendations from the original recommendation list based on the second privacy level data for user B, and the computing assistant associated with user C may determine whether user C has any negative preferences for recommendations from the original recommendation list based on the second privacy level data for user C.
Continuing with the above example, assistant module 122A and/or 123A may determine that user a has a partial negative preference for mountain sports in boltzmann's winter season based at least on the second privacy level data for user a indicating that user a is most recently on a ski trip. Thus, the assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may determine that the tasting of wayside wine and the visiting of the brewery in liechstandon, kentucky, and the beach vacation in caribbean should be included in a condensed list, and that the winter mountain motion in boltzmann should not be included in the condensed list.
The computing assistant associated with user B may determine that user B has a completely negative preference for caribbean island based at least on the second privacy level data for user B (which indicates that user B is intending to be a child and has conducted a substantial search for zika viruses) and the data indicating that zika viruses are present on caribbean island. Thus, the computing assistant associated with user B may determine that the taste of wayside wine and the visit to the brewery in rocky star town, kentucky, and the winter mountain sports in bolzmann mountain should be included in a condensed list, and that beach vacations in caribbean island should not be included in the condensed list.
The computing assistant associated with user C may determine that user C has a partial negative preference for tasting bourbon wine and visiting a brewery in the city of rocky town, kentucky, based at least on the second privacy level data for user C indicating that user C has attempted to drink less. Thus, the computing assistant associated with user C may determine that winter mountain sports in bolzmann mountain and beach vacation in caribbean should be included in the condensed list, and should not include tasting waviness and visiting a brewery in rocky star town, kentucky in the condensed list.
Assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may generate a condensed list of recommendations based on the evaluations performed by the computing assistant. For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may determine whether each respective recommendation included in the original recommendation list has been overruled by at least one computing assistant. If a recommendation from the original recommendation list is not vetoed by any computing assistant, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may include the recommendation in a condensed recommendation list.
Assistant module 122A and/or 123A may determine whether there are any recommendations in the resulting condensed list of recommendations (410). In response to the condensed list of recommendations including at least one recommendation (i.e., in the event that the at least one recommendation from the original list of recommendations is not vetoed by any computing assistants associated with the group of users), "yes" branch of 410, assistant module 122A and/or 123A may output the condensed list of recommendations (412). As one example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may cause UI module 120 to display a GUI that includes a condensed list of recommendations. As another example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may cause UI module 120 to output synthesized speech that includes a condensed list of recommendations. As another example, the assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may output the condensed list of recommendations to computing assistants associated with other users of the group, which may then display, speak, or otherwise output the condensed list of recommendations to their respective users.
In response to the reduced recommendation list not including at least one recommendation ("no" branch of 410), a respective computing assistant associated with the group of users may evaluate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the modified reduced recommendation list based on the weighted respective second privacy level data of the group of users (414). In some examples, the evaluations may be performed simultaneously. For example, a respective computing assistant associated with a group of users may concurrently evaluate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the reduced recommendation list based on respective second privacy level data for the group of users and evaluate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the modified reduced recommendation list based on weighted second privacy level data for the group of users. If the modified reduced list includes at least one recommendation ("YES" branch of 416), the assistant module 122A and/or 123A may output the modified reduced list of recommendations (418). For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may output the modified reduced recommendation list in a manner similar to the output of the reduced recommendation list described above. If the modified, condensed list does not include at least one recommendation ("NO" branch of 416), assistant module 122A and/or 123A may output an indication that the computing assistant is unable to provide any recommendations for the group (420).
Continuing with the above example, the original recommendation list includes boltzmann mountain for winter mountain sports, lotto city, liekton, kentucky for tasting wayside wine and visiting the brewhouse, and caribbean for beach vacation. Assistant module 122A and/or 123A may determine that there are no recommendations remaining in the condensed list based on the evaluations. In particular, winter mountain sports in bolzmann mountain are overruled by user a's computing assistant (i.e., assistant modules 122A and/or 123A), tasting wayside wine and visiting a brewery in the city of rocky star, kentucky by user C's computing assistant (i.e., assistant modules 122C and/or 123C), and vacation at the beach in caribbean by user B (i.e., assistant modules 122B and/or 123B).
The computing assistant associated with user a, user B, and user C may rate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the modified reduced recommendation list based on the weighted respective second privacy level data of the respective users. For example, because the second privacy level data for user a indicates that user a has only a partially negative preference for winter mountain movement in boltzmann mountain, and no negative preference for tasting wayside wine in rocky star town, kentucky and visiting a brewery and beach vacations in caribbean, the assistant module 122A and/or 123A may determine that winter mountain movement in boltzmann mountain, tasting wayside wine in rocky star town, kentucky and visiting a brewery and beach vacations in caribbean should all be included in the modified condensed list. Similarly, because the second privacy level data for user C indicates that user C has a partially negative preference for only tasting wayside wine and visiting a brewery in rocky star town, and no negative preference for winter mountain movement in boltzmann mountain and beach vacations in caribbean, the computing assistant associated with user C may determine that winter mountain movement in boltzmann mountain, tasting wayside wine in rocky star town, and visiting a brewery and beach vacations in caribbean should all be included in the modified condensed list. However, because the second privacy level data for user B indicates that user B has a completely negative preference for beach vacations in caribbean and no negative preference for winter mountain sports in boltzmann mountain and for drinking wayside wine and visiting a brewery in rocky star town, the computing assistant associated with user B may determine that winter mountain sports in boltzmann mountain and for drinking wayside wine and visiting a brewery in rocky star town should be included in the modified condensed list and that beach vacations in caribbean should not be included in the modified condensed list.
The assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may determine, based on the evaluation, that winter mountain movement in bolzmann mountain and the tasting of bourbon wine and visiting of the brewery in liechstandon, kentucky should be included in the modified, condensed list. Because the modified reduced list includes at least one recommendation, the assistant module 122A and/or 123A may output the modified reduced list for presentation to the group of users.
Fig. 5 is a flowchart illustrating example operations performed by one or more processors executing an example virtual assistant in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 5 is described below in the context of system 100 of fig. 1. For example, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure, the local assistant module 122A may perform one or more of operations 502 and 524 when executed at one or more processors of the computing device 110A. And in some examples, according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure, the remote assistant module 122A may perform one or more of operations 402 and 520 when executed at one or more processors of the assistant server system 160. For purposes of illustration only, fig. 5 is described below in the context of computing device 110A of fig. 1.
In operation, computing device 110A may receive a request to generate a recommendation for a group of users (502). As shown in the example of fig. 1, user a, user B, and user C may be in a group chat. User a may ask: "do you also have an interest in traveling in march of march in march? ", user B may answer saying" i am interested ", user C may ask" where do you consider? ". However, seeing the chat, user B may say "do not do so again, we always say nothing together". To avoid discussing potential destinations, user a may say that they "let their virtual assistant provide some recommendations". In the example of FIG. 1, user A may query their virtual assistant for some recommendations by entering an assistant activation command and provide a request for recommendations for the group of users. For example, UI module 120 may receive an indication of user input at user a's UID 112, where user a types "@ associatant" where we should travel in month 3 ". UI module 120 may provide user input to assistant modules 122A and/or 123A.
An assistant module associated with the users of the group may obtain consent of the users of the group to use the first and second privacy level data (504). For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may obtain consent of user a to use first and second privacy level data of user a, assistant modules 122B and/or 123B may obtain consent of user B to use first and second privacy level data of user B, and assistant modules 122C and/or 123C may obtain consent of user C to use first and second privacy level data of user C.
Assistant module 122A and/or 123A may generate an original recommendation list for the group based on the first privacy level data for the users of the group (506). For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may evaluate first privacy level data of user a, user B, and user C to generate an original recommendation list. In this example, the first privacy level data for the group may indicate that user a, user B, and user C all prefer winter mountain sports (e.g., skiing or snowboarding), wayside alcohol, and tropical vacations. Based on the first privacy level data, the assistant module 122A and/or 123A may generate the original recommendation list to include boltzmann mountains for winter mountain sports, liechndon city, kentucky, for tasting wayside wine and visiting a brewery, and caribbean island for beach vacation. Assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may propagate or otherwise output the original recommendation list to computing assistants associated with other users of the group. For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A can output the original recommendation list to a computing assistant associated with user B (e.g., assistant modules 122B and/or 123B), and a computing assistant associated with user C (e.g., assistant modules 122C and/or 123C).
The respective computing assistant associated with the group of users may evaluate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the condensed recommendation list based on the respective second privacy level data for the group of users (508). For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may determine whether user a has any negative preferences for recommendations from the original recommendation list based on user a's second privacy level data. Similarly, the computing assistant associated with user B may determine whether user B has any negative preferences for recommendations from the original recommendation list based on the second privacy level data for user B, and the computing assistant associated with user C may determine whether user C has any negative preferences for recommendations from the original recommendation list based on the second privacy level data for user C.
Continuing with the above example, assistant module 122A and/or 123A may determine that user a has a partial negative preference (e.g., a 60% objection) for mountain sports in boltzmann's winter based at least on the second privacy level data for user a indicating that user a is most recently on a ski trip. Thus, the assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may determine that the tasting of wayside wine and the visiting of the brewery in liechstandon, kentucky, and the beach vacation in caribbean should be included in a condensed list, and that the winter mountain motion in boltzmann should not be included in the condensed list.
The computing assistant associated with user B may determine that user B has a completely negative preference (e.g., 100% objection) for caribbean island based at least on user B's second privacy level data (which indicates that user B is intending to be a child and has conducted a large search for zika viruses) and data indicating that zika viruses are present on caribbean island. Thus, the computing assistant associated with user B may determine that the taste of wayside wine and the visit to the brewery in rocky star town, kentucky, and the winter mountain sports in bolzmann mountain should be included in a condensed list, and that beach vacations in caribbean island should not be included in the condensed list.
The computing assistant associated with user C may determine that user C has a partial negative preference (e.g., 25% objection) to tasting bourbon wine and visiting the brewery in the city of rocky star, kentucky, based at least on the second privacy level data of user C indicating that user C has attempted to drink less. Thus, the computing assistant associated with user C may determine that winter mountain sports in bolzmann mountain and beach vacation in caribbean should be included in the condensed list, and should not include tasting waviness and visiting a brewery in rocky star town, kentucky in the condensed list.
Assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may generate a condensed list of recommendations based on the evaluations performed by the computing assistant. For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may determine whether each respective recommendation included in the original recommendation list has been overruled by at least one computing assistant. If a recommendation from the original recommendation list is not vetoed by any computing assistant, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may include the recommendation in a condensed recommendation list.
Assistant module 122A and/or 123A may determine whether there are any recommendations in the resulting condensed list of recommendations (510). In response to the condensed list of recommendations including at least one recommendation (i.e., in the event that the at least one recommendation from the original list of recommendations is not vetoed by any computing assistants associated with the group of users), "yes" branch of 510, assistant module 122A and/or 123A may output the condensed list of recommendations (512). As one example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may cause UI module 120 to display a GUI that includes a condensed list of recommendations. As another example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may cause UI module 120 to output synthesized speech that includes a condensed list of recommendations. As another example, the assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may output the condensed list of recommendations to computing assistants associated with other users of the group, which may then display, speak, or otherwise output the condensed list of recommendations to their respective users.
In response to the reduced recommendation list not including at least one recommendation ("no" branch of 510), the respective computing assistant associated with the group of users may evaluate the recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the modified reduced recommendation list based on the weighted respective second privacy level data of the group of users (514). For example, a computing assistant associated with the group of users may determine whether the user's second privacy level data indicates that the user has a negative preference for the recommendation that is above an initial threshold. In some examples, the threshold may initially be set lower (e.g., 5%, 10%, 15%,. 25%, etc.), and as discussed in further detail below, the threshold may be increased if no recommendations can be provided. In an instance in which the assistant determines that the second privacy level data of the user indicates that the user's preference for recommendations is above a threshold, the assistant may determine that the recommendations should not be included in the modified reduced recommendation list. In some examples, if the assistant is unable to provide any recommendations using the initial threshold, the assistant may determine whether the second privacy level data of the user indicates that the user's negative preference for recommendations is above an increased threshold (e.g., 5%, 10%, etc. above the previous threshold).
If the modified reduced list includes at least one recommendation ("YES" branch of 516), the assistant module 122A and/or 123A may output a modified reduced list of recommendations (518). For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may output the modified reduced recommendation list in a manner similar to the output of the reduced recommendation list described above. If the modified, condensed list does not include at least one recommendation ("NO" branch of 516), assistant module 122A and/or 123A may determine whether the weight used to evaluate the recommendation is above a maximum threshold (520). For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may determine whether the threshold used to evaluate the recommendation is above a maximum overall threshold level (e.g., 75%, 85%, 90%, 95%). If the weight is above the maximum threshold ("yes" branch of 520), assistant module 122A and/or 123A may output an indication that the computing assistant is unable to provide any recommendations for the group (524). If the weight is not above the maximum threshold ("no" branch of 520), assistant module 122A and/or 123A may increase the weight (522). For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may increase the threshold by 5%, 10%, 20%, etc. The respective computing assistant associated with the group of users may evaluate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the modified reduced recommendation list based on the increased weight of the respective second privacy level data of the group of users (514). For example, a computing assistant associated with the group of users may determine whether the user's second privacy level data indicates that the user has a negative preference for the recommendation that is above an increased threshold. In some examples, the loop may continue until the computing assistant is able to provide the at least one recommendation. In some examples, the loop may continue until the threshold used to evaluate the recommendation is above a maximum overall threshold level. In this way, the assistant module may include the most desirable recommendations in the modified condensed list, while not including recommendations for which some users have strong negative preferences.
Continuing with the above example, the original recommendation list includes boltzmann mountain for winter mountain sports, lotto city, liekton, kentucky for tasting wayside wine and visiting the brewhouse, and caribbean for beach vacation. Assistant module 122A and/or 123A may determine that there are no recommendations remaining in the condensed list based on the evaluations. In particular, winter mountain sports in bolzmann mountain are overruled by user a's computing assistant (i.e., assistant modules 122A and/or 123A), tasting wayside wine and visiting a brewery in the city of rocky star, kentucky by user C's computing assistant (i.e., assistant modules 122C and/or 123C), and vacation at the beach in caribbean by user B (i.e., assistant modules 122B and/or 123B).
The computing assistant associated with user a, user B, and user C may rate recommendations from the original recommendation list for inclusion in the modified reduced recommendation list based on the weighted respective second privacy level data of the respective users. For example, the computing assistant associated with user a, user B, and user C may determine whether the second privacy data of the respective user indicates that the respective user's negative preference for recommendations from the original recommendation list satisfies an initial threshold (10% for purposes of this example).
For example, because the second privacy level data of user a indicates that user a has a 60% opposition preference for winter mountain movement in boltzmann mountain and no negative preference for tasting wayside wine in rockmann city, kentucky and visiting the brewhouse and beach vacations in caribbean, the assistant module 122A and/or 123A may determine that winter mountain movement in boltzmann mountain (e.g., because the 60% opposition preference is greater than a 10% threshold) should not be included in the modified condensed list and that tasting wayside wine in rockmann city, kentucky and visiting the brewhouse and beach vacations in caribbean should be included in the modified condensed list. Similarly, because the second privacy level data for user C indicates that user C has a 25% objection preference for tasting bourbon wine and visiting a brewery in the city of rocky star dun, kentucky, and no negative preference for winter mountain movement in the city of rocky star dun and beach vacation in caribbean, the computing assistant associated with user C may determine that tasting bourbon wine and visiting a brewery in the city of rocky star dun, kentucky (e.g., because the 25% objection preference is greater than a 10% threshold) should not be included in the modified condensed list, and that winter mountain movement in the city of rocky mountain and beach vacation in caribbean should be included in the modified condensed list. Additionally, because the second privacy level data for user B indicates that user B has a 100% deprecated preference for beach vacations in caribbean and no negative preference for winter mountain sports in boltzmann mountain and for drinking wayside wine and visiting a brewery in rocky star town, kentucky, the computing assistant associated with user B may determine that winter mountain sports in boltzmann mountain and for drinking wayside wine and visiting a brewery in rocky star town, kentucky should be included in the modified condensed list and that beach vacations in caribbean should not be included in the modified condensed list.
Assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may determine, based on the evaluation, that none of the recommendations from the original recommendation list should be included in the modified, condensed list (e.g., because winter mountain movement of boltzmann mountain was denied by the computing assistant of user a, tasting bourbon wine in rockdon city, kentucky and visiting a brewery was denied by the computing assistant of user C, and beach vacation in caribbean was denied by the computing assistant of user B). Because the modified, condensed list does not include any recommendations, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may increase the threshold. For example, assistant modules 122A and/or 123A may increase the threshold to 30%. Since the objection preference of user C to tasting the bourdon wine in the city of rocky star town and visiting the brewery is 25% below the increased threshold of 30%, the computing assistant associated with user C may determine that the tasting of the bourdon wine in the city of rocky star town and visiting the brewery should be included in the modified condensed list of recommendations. However, because user a's opposition to mountain motion in boltzmann's winter season prefers an increased threshold of 60% above 30%, the computing assistant associated with user a may determine that mountain motion in boltzmann's winter season still should not be included in the modified reduced recommendation list. Similarly, since the objection of user B to beach vacation in caribbean prefers 100% above the increased threshold of 30%, the computing assistant associated with user B may determine that beach vacation in caribbean should still not be included in the modified condensed list of recommendations. Because the modified reduced list includes at least one recommendation, the assistant module 122A and/or 123A may output the modified reduced list for presentation to the group of users.
