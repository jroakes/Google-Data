- Search engine 112 generates search results in response to search queries from one or more clients 102 and also provides personalized recommendations of popular search queries. It should be appreciated that the layout of the search engine system 112 is merely exemplary and may take on any other suitable layout or configuration.
- the search engine system 112 is used to search an index of documents, such as billions of web pages or other documents indexed by modern search engines.
- the search engine system 112 can be used as an Internet search engine, for locating documents on the WWW and/or as an intranet search engine, for locating documents stored on servers or other hosts within an intranet.
- the search engine system 112 utilizes an index 130 of the full text of a set of documents.
- the methodology described herein is also applicable to implementations where only portions of documents, such as titles and abstracts, are stored in a database (e.g., 132 ) of the search engine system 112 .
- the search engine system 112 may include multiple data centers, each housing a backend.
- the data centers are generally widely dispersed from one another, such as across the continental United States. Search queries submitted by users at one of the clients 102 to the search engine system 112 are routed to an appropriate backend as part of the Domain Name System (DNS), based on current load, geographic locality and/or whether that data center is operating.
- DNS Domain Name System
- Each backend preferably includes multiple query servers, such as query server 114 , coupled to a communications network 106 via a network communication module 120 .
- the communications network 106 may be the Internet, but may also be any local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN).
- each query server 114 is a Web server that receives search query requests and delivers search results and personalized recommendations of popular search queries in the form of web pages or feeds via HTTP, XML, RSS or similar protocols.
- the query server 114 is used within an intranet, it may be an intranet server.
- the query servers, such as query server 114 are configured to control the search and recommendation processes, including searching a document index, analyzing and formatting the search results.

- the query receipt, processing and response module 122 is primarily responsible for receiving search queries, processing them and returning responses and personalized recommendations of popular search queries to the client 102 via the network communications module 120 .
- the history module 128 maintains a record of queries submitted by users.
- the history module also maintains a record of search results selected by the users for viewing or downloading, sometimes called click through information.
- the click through information may include statistical information, including the number of times that each search result was clicked through and/or the number of times each search result was viewed by users for more than a threshold period of time (i.e., the number of times the users clicked through each search result without navigating away from the resulting page or document in less than the threshold period of time).
- the user information processing module 124 assists in accessing, updating and modifying the user information database 116 .
- the user information database 116 stores various information about the user's activities in a user record (described below).

- the query processing controller 118 is connected to an inverse document index 130 , a document database 132 and a query cache 134 .
- the cache 134 is used to temporarily store search queries and search results, and is used to serve search results for queries submitted multiple times (e.g., by multiple users).
- the inverse document index 130 and document database 132 are sometimes collectively called the document database.
- “searching the document database” means searching the inverse document index 130 to identify documents matching a specified search query or term.
- Search rank values for the documents in the search results are conveyed to the query processing controller 118 and/or the query server 114 , and are used to construct various lists, such as a list of ordered search results, a personalized list of recommended web pages, or a list of new results for one or more prior searches by a user.
- the query processing controller 118 may transmit to the document database 132 a request for snippets of an appropriate subset of the documents in the list. For example, the query processing controller 118 may request snippets for the first fifteen or so of the documents in the list.
- the document database 132 constructs snippets based on the search query, and returns the snippets to the query processing controller 118 .
- the query processing controller 118 then returns a list of located documents with their associated links (i.e., hyperlinks) and snippets back to the query server 114 .
- the snippets are stored in the cache server 134 along with the search results.
- the query processing controller 118 may only request snippets for documents, if any, for which it is unable to obtain valid cached snippets from the cache server 134 .
- fewer and/or additional modules, functions or databases are included in the search engine 112 .

- the user identifier 402 is associated with a particular instance of a client application 320 .
- the user identifier is associated with a computer user (e.g., when the user logs in with a username and password).
- Event-based data 404 includes one or more events, each of which has a data type associated with it.
- event-based data includes: one or more queries 410 ; one or more result clicks 412 (i.e., the results presented in a set of search results on which the user has clicked); and one or more browsing data 416 (e.g., URLs visited, URL visit duration data, etc.).
- Event-based data 404 includes one or more elements relevant to the event. For example, in some embodiments the events in the event-based data 404 includes either or both an eventID 418 and a timestamp 420 .
- the eventID 418 is a unique identifier associated with the particular event which may be assigned by the search system in some embodiments (e.g., a 64-bit binary number).
- the timestamp 420 is a value (e.g., a 64-bit binary number) representing the date and/or time at which the particular event record in event-based data 404 was created or at which the particular event occurred.
- one or more of the query events 410 , and one or more of the result click events 412 include a query portion 421 which includes zero or more query terms associated with the recorded event.
- the query portion indicates the query string to which the event is associated (e.g., what query produced the results that the user clicked-though).
- the query portion 421 includes a pointer or identifier to the query event 410 associated with the result click (e.g., an eventID).
- the query portion 421 may additionally identify a “related query”.
- the related query may be a query related to an initial query that contains a misspelling. In some instances is it more desirable to associate the event with the corrected query rather than the query containing the spelling mistake.
- the search system 112 may generate “related queries” automatically based on the user's entered query.
- one or more of the result click events 412 , and one or more of the browsing data 416 include a contentID 422 which identifies the content associated with the particular event.
- the contentID can represent the URL or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that has been clicked on by the user.

- the contentID 422 may be a document identifier that identifies a document in a document repository.
- the event-based data has a history score 425 .
- An event's history score 425 may be calculated in any of a number of different ways or combinations of ways.
- the history score 425 may be a time-based ranking value which may be periodically modified based on a length of time that has passed since the event was recorded.
- the value of the history score decreases as the time from the recordation increases.
- all the history scores in the event-based data may be multiplied by a predetermined factor (e.g., a value less than one, such as 0.9, 0.8, 0.75 or 0.5) at predetermined times (e.g., at a fixed time of each day or week) so as to attenuate the history scores over time.
- a predetermined factor e.g., a value less than one, such as 0.9, 0.8, 0.75 or 0.5
- event data having a time-based ranking value below a threshold may be deleted.
- the values can be determined and re-determined periodically at various points in time. In some cases, removal of one or more events triggers a re-determination of one or more derived values as described above.
- the history score 425 is determined in response to a request instead of being determined during batch or off-line processing.
- a browsing event 416 indicates a particular browsing event not associated with a query, but instead, with some other user activity (e.g., user selection of a link in a web page, or an email message, or a word processing document).
- This other user activity can be identified in an information field 426 .
- the information field 426 stores ranking values associated with the event. Such ranking values can be system generated, user created, or user modified (e.g., PageRank for URLs, or a value assigned to the event by the user).
- Other examples of user activity include, but are not limited to web browsing, emailing, instant messaging, word processing, participation in chat rooms, software application execution and internet telephone calls.
- derived data 406 includes one or more information fields 428 containing information derived from the event-based data 404 .
- the information field 428 represents a user profile which is generated from one or more of the user's query events 410 , results click events 412 , and browsing events 416 .
- a user profile may be created that includes one or more information fields 428 indicating levels of interest in various topic categories (e.g., a weighted set of Open Directory Project (http://dmoz.org) topics).
- one or more information fields 428 in the user record 400 indicate topic categories associated with web pages or other documents visited by the user, without any indication of weightings or levels of interest, but only including topic categories which satisfy predefined criteria indicating at least a threshold level of user interest.
- the one or more information fields 428 in the user record 400 indicate websites associated with web pages or other documents visited by the user.
- the one or more information fields 428 may optionally include weights or level of interest values for the identified websites; alternately, the website information in information fields 428 may be restricted to websites which satisfy predefined criteria indicating at least a threshold level of user interest.
- the derived data 406 includes one or more pairs of a score 432 associated with particular contentID 434 .
- the score 432 represents a derived score assigned to the content associated with the contentID 434 (e.g., a web page).
- the score 432 can be based on one or more of a number of different factors.
- the score 432 incorporates the number of times that a user has clicked on the contentID over a period of time (which may include click throughs as a result of search queries and/or browsing activities).
- the score 432 incorporates a time duration that the user is estimated to have been looking at the content (a stay-time).
- the score 432 incorporates a time since the user last viewed the content.
- the score 432 may be modified based on user activities. In some embodiments, the score 432 is negatively affected if the user is presented the content in a series of search results, but fails to select the content from the results page. In some embodiments, the score 432 is positively affected when the user visits locations or pages or clicks on results that are similar to the content. Similarity can be determined by a number of well-known techniques (e.g., text classifier, ODP categorization, link structure, URL, edit distance, etc.). In some embodiments, similarity can be determined by co-citation analysis.

Description
This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/447,575, filed Jun. 5, 2006 now abandoned, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/097,884, filed Mar. 31, 2005, entitled “Systems and Methods for Providing Subscription-Based Personalization,” which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
The disclosed embodiments relate generally to search engines. More particularly, the disclosed embodiments relate to methods, systems, and user interfaces for providing personalized recommendations of popular search queries.
Search engines typically provide a source of indexed documents from the Internet (or an intranet) that can be rapidly scanned in response to a search query submitted by a user. As the number of documents accessible via the Internet grows, the number of documents that match a particular query may also increase. However, not every document matching the query is likely to be equally important from a user's perspective. A user may be overwhelmed by an enormous number of documents returned by a search engine, unless the documents are ordered based on their relevance to the user's query. One way to order documents is the PageRank algorithm more fully described in the article “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine” by S. Brin and L. Page, 7th International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia and U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference as background information.
In addition to responding to search queries, search engines can also proactively identify and recommend popular queries. The recommendation techniques developed to date, however, have only limited utility because they often recommend queries that are not of interest to the user.
Thus, it would be highly desirable to find new, more efficient and accurate ways to provide recommendations of popular search queries.
The present invention overcomes the problem described above by providing personalized recommendations of popular search queries.
One aspect of the invention involves a computer-implemented method in which a search engine receives a plurality of search queries submitted by a plurality of users; determines submission popularity data for each distinct query in the plurality of search queries; receives Internet usage data for a computer user; determines one or more queries to recommend to the computer user that meet predefined criteria, wherein the predefined criteria are based on the Internet usage data for the computer user and the submission popularity data for the search queries submitted by the plurality of users; and sends links corresponding to at least some of the determined queries to a computer associated with the computer user for display.
Another aspect of the invention involves a computer-implemented method in which a client computer sends Internet usage data for a computer user to a search engine.

For a better understanding of the aforementioned aspects of the invention as well as additional aspects and embodiments thereof, reference should be made to the Description of Embodiments below, in conjunction with the following drawings in which like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the figures.
Methods, systems, and user interfaces for providing personalized recommendations of popular search queries are described. Reference will be made to certain embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to these particular embodiments alone. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents that are within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
Moreover, in the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these particular details. In other instances, methods, procedures, components, and networks that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art are not described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the present invention.
Note that the search engine system 112 can be used as an Internet search engine, for locating documents on the WWW and/or as an intranet search engine, for locating documents stored on servers or other hosts within an intranet. In some embodiments, the search engine system 112 utilizes an index 130 of the full text of a set of documents. However, the methodology described herein is also applicable to implementations where only portions of documents, such as titles and abstracts, are stored in a database (e.g., 132) of the search engine system 112.
The search engine system 112 may include multiple data centers, each housing a backend. The data centers are generally widely dispersed from one another, such as across the continental United States. Search queries submitted by users at one of the clients 102 to the search engine system 112 are routed to an appropriate backend as part of the Domain Name System (DNS), based on current load, geographic locality and/or whether that data center is operating.
Each backend preferably includes multiple query servers, such as query server 114, coupled to a communications network 106 via a network communication module 120. The communications network 106 may be the Internet, but may also be any local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN). In some embodiments, each query server 114 is a Web server that receives search query requests and delivers search results and personalized recommendations of popular search queries in the form of web pages or feeds via HTTP, XML, RSS or similar protocols. Alternatively, if the query server 114 is used within an intranet, it may be an intranet server. In essence, the query servers, such as query server 114, are configured to control the search and recommendation processes, including searching a document index, analyzing and formatting the search results.
The query server 114 typically includes a network communications module 120, a query receipt, processing and response module 122, a user information processing module 124, and a history module 128, all interconnected. The network communications module 120 connects the query server 114 to the communication network 106 and enables the receipt of communications from the communication network 106 and the provision of communications to the communication network 106 bound for the client 102 or other destinations. The query receipt, processing and response module 122 is primarily responsible for receiving search queries, processing them and returning responses and personalized recommendations of popular search queries to the client 102 via the network communications module 120. In some embodiments, the history module 128 maintains a record of queries submitted by users. In some embodiments, the history module also maintains a record of search results selected by the users for viewing or downloading, sometimes called click through information. The click through information may include statistical information, including the number of times that each search result was clicked through and/or the number of times each search result was viewed by users for more than a threshold period of time (i.e., the number of times the users clicked through each search result without navigating away from the resulting page or document in less than the threshold period of time).
The user information processing module 124 assists in accessing, updating and modifying the user information database 116. The user information database 116 stores various information about the user's activities in a user record (described below). In addition, the user information database 116 may store derived information about the user based on the user's activities. In some embodiments, the user information database 116 stores user profiles, a portion of which are the derived information. The other databases 117 optionally include other databases with which the various modules in query server 114 may interact, such as a message database (electronic or otherwise), and user-created document databases (e.g., documents created from word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, or other various applications).
The query processing controller 118 is connected to an inverse document index 130, a document database 132 and a query cache 134. The cache 134 is used to temporarily store search queries and search results, and is used to serve search results for queries submitted multiple times (e.g., by multiple users). The inverse document index 130 and document database 132 are sometimes collectively called the document database. In some embodiments, “searching the document database” means searching the inverse document index 130 to identify documents matching a specified search query or term.
Search rank values for the documents in the search results are conveyed to the query processing controller 118 and/or the query server 114, and are used to construct various lists, such as a list of ordered search results, a personalized list of recommended web pages, or a list of new results for one or more prior searches by a user. Once the query processing controller 118 constructs the list, the query processing controller 118 may transmit to the document database 132 a request for snippets of an appropriate subset of the documents in the list. For example, the query processing controller 118 may request snippets for the first fifteen or so of the documents in the list. In some embodiments, the document database 132 constructs snippets based on the search query, and returns the snippets to the query processing controller 118. The query processing controller 118 then returns a list of located documents with their associated links (i.e., hyperlinks) and snippets back to the query server 114. In some embodiments, the snippets are stored in the cache server 134 along with the search results. As a result, in these embodiments the query processing controller 118 may only request snippets for documents, if any, for which it is unable to obtain valid cached snippets from the cache server 134.
In some embodiments, fewer and/or additional modules, functions or databases are included in the search engine 112. The modules shown in FIG. 1 as being part of search engine 112 represent functions performed in an exemplary embodiment.
Although FIG. 1 portrays discrete blocks, the figure is intended more as a functional description of some embodiments of the invention rather than a structural description of the functional elements. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that an actual implementation might have the functional elements grouped or split among various components. For example, the user information database 116 may be part of the query server 114. In some embodiments the user information database 116 may be implemented using one or more servers whose primary function is to store and process user information. Similarly, the document database 132 may be implemented on one or more servers whose primary purpose is to store various documents. In some embodiments, the inverse document index 130 and the document database 132 are stored on the same server or set of servers. Moreover, one or more of the blocks in FIG. 1 may be implemented on one or more servers designed to provide the described functionality. Although the description herein refers to certain features implemented in the client 102 and certain features implemented in the search system 112, the embodiments of the invention are not limited to such distinctions. For example, features described herein as being part of the search system 112 could be implemented in whole or in part in the client 102, and vice versa.

client storage 328 for storing data and documents, including web pages or feeds with personalized popular query recommendations.
- an
Each of the above identified modules and applications in FIGS. 2-3 correspond to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. These modules (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. In some embodiments, memories 206 and 306 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore, memories 206 and 306 may store additional modules and data structures not described above.
Although FIGS. 2-3 show search engine 112 and client 102 as a number of discrete items, FIGS. 2-3 are intended more as a functional description of the various features which may be present in search engine 112 and client 102 rather than as a structural schematic of the embodiments described herein. In practice, and as recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated. For example, some items shown separately in FIG. 2 could be implemented on single servers and single items could be implemented by one or more servers. The actual number of servers in search engine 112 and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
In some embodiments, one or more of the query events 410, and one or more of the result click events 412, include a query portion 421 which includes zero or more query terms associated with the recorded event. In some embodiments, the query portion indicates the query string to which the event is associated (e.g., what query produced the results that the user clicked-though). In some embodiments, the query portion 421 includes a pointer or identifier to the query event 410 associated with the result click (e.g., an eventID). In some embodiments, the query portion 421 may additionally identify a “related query”. For example, the related query may be a query related to an initial query that contains a misspelling. In some instances is it more desirable to associate the event with the corrected query rather than the query containing the spelling mistake. In some embodiments, the search system 112 may generate “related queries” automatically based on the user's entered query.
In some embodiments, one or more of the result click events 412, and one or more of the browsing data 416 include a contentID 422 which identifies the content associated with the particular event. For a result click 412, the contentID can represent the URL or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that has been clicked on by the user. For browsing event 416, the contentID 422 can be the content identifier used to identify the location of the browse event (e.g., URL, data location, or other similar identifier). In some embodiments, the contentID 422 may be a document identifier that identifies a document in a document repository.
In some embodiments, the event-based data has a history score 425. An event's history score 425 may be calculated in any of a number of different ways or combinations of ways. For example, the history score 425 may be a time-based ranking value which may be periodically modified based on a length of time that has passed since the event was recorded. In some embodiments, the value of the history score decreases as the time from the recordation increases. For example, all the history scores in the event-based data may be multiplied by a predetermined factor (e.g., a value less than one, such as 0.9, 0.8, 0.75 or 0.5) at predetermined times (e.g., at a fixed time of each day or week) so as to attenuate the history scores over time. In some embodiments, event data having a time-based ranking value below a threshold may be deleted. The values can be determined and re-determined periodically at various points in time. In some cases, removal of one or more events triggers a re-determination of one or more derived values as described above. In some embodiments, the history score 425 is determined in response to a request instead of being determined during batch or off-line processing.
In some embodiments, a browsing event 416 indicates a particular browsing event not associated with a query, but instead, with some other user activity (e.g., user selection of a link in a web page, or an email message, or a word processing document). This other user activity can be identified in an information field 426. In some embodiments, the information field 426 stores ranking values associated with the event. Such ranking values can be system generated, user created, or user modified (e.g., PageRank for URLs, or a value assigned to the event by the user). Other examples of user activity include, but are not limited to web browsing, emailing, instant messaging, word processing, participation in chat rooms, software application execution and internet telephone calls.
In some embodiments, derived data 406 includes one or more information fields 428 containing information derived from the event-based data 404. For example, in some embodiments, the information field 428 represents a user profile which is generated from one or more of the user's query events 410, results click events 412, and browsing events 416. For example, by examining one or more of the various events a user profile may be created that includes one or more information fields 428 indicating levels of interest in various topic categories (e.g., a weighted set of Open Directory Project (http://dmoz.org) topics). Alternately, one or more information fields 428 in the user record 400 indicate topic categories associated with web pages or other documents visited by the user, without any indication of weightings or levels of interest, but only including topic categories which satisfy predefined criteria indicating at least a threshold level of user interest. In some embodiments, the one or more information fields 428 in the user record 400 indicate websites associated with web pages or other documents visited by the user. In these embodiments, the one or more information fields 428 may optionally include weights or level of interest values for the identified websites; alternately, the website information in information fields 428 may be restricted to websites which satisfy predefined criteria indicating at least a threshold level of user interest.
In some embodiments, the derived data 406 includes one or more pairs of a score 432 associated with particular contentID 434. The score 432 represents a derived score assigned to the content associated with the contentID 434 (e.g., a web page). The score 432 can be based on one or more of a number of different factors. In some embodiments, the score 432 incorporates the number of times that a user has clicked on the contentID over a period of time (which may include click throughs as a result of search queries and/or browsing activities). In some embodiments, the score 432 incorporates a time duration that the user is estimated to have been looking at the content (a stay-time). In some embodiments, the score 432 incorporates a time since the user last viewed the content. In some embodiments, the score 432 may be modified based on user activities. In some embodiments, the score 432 is negatively affected if the user is presented the content in a series of search results, but fails to select the content from the results page. In some embodiments, the score 432 is positively affected when the user visits locations or pages or clicks on results that are similar to the content. Similarity can be determined by a number of well-known techniques (e.g., text classifier, ODP categorization, link structure, URL, edit distance, etc.). In some embodiments, similarity can be determined by co-citation analysis. In some embodiments, a site is defined as a logically related group of pages, or physically related pages such as pages belonging to the same URL or related URLs. In some embodiments, the score 432 incorporates the number of past queries of the user for which the content was presented (e.g., a higher number of times certain content is presented to the user correlates with a higher score 432). In some embodiments, the score 432 incorporates the number of past queries of the user for which related content was presented (e.g., a higher number of times related content is presented to the user as a result of the user's queries correlates with a higher score 432). In some embodiments, derived data 406 includes aggregate scores. For example, the same query may be generated by the user multiple times and in some embodiments each occurrence will have a different eventID. Accordingly, in some embodiments, an aggregate score is maintained for events that occur multiple times. The aggregate score can be computed by any of a number of different methods. A reference to the multiple events and to the aggregate score can be maintained in the derived data 406.
In some embodiments, the submission popularity data 218 (see FIG. 2 ) include the number of times 232 the distinct query (e.g., 224) was received in a predefined time period (e.g., 230). In some embodiments, the submission popularity data 218 include the change in the number of times the distinct query was received between two predefined time periods (e.g., the difference in the number received 232 in period 1 226 versus a prior period 2 228). In some embodiments, the submission popularity data 218 include the percentage change in the number of times the distinct query was received between two predefined time periods (e.g., the percentage change in the number received 232 in period 1 226 versus period 2 228).
In some embodiments, for each distinct query 224 in the plurality of search queries, the query 224 is associated with one or more web sites, e.g., via website to query mapping 236. In some embodiments, the associated web sites contain web pages that are selected by at least some of the plurality of users from among search results produced in response to the distinct query 224.
In some embodiments, for each distinct query 224 in the plurality of search queries, the query 224 is associated with one or more categories, e.g., via category to query mapping 240. In some embodiments, the associated categories contain (i.e., are associated with) web pages that are selected by at least some of the plurality of users from among search results produced in response to various search queries, including the aforementioned distinct query 224. In some embodiments, the associated categories contain web sites with web pages that are selected by at least some of the plurality of users from among search results produced in response to various search queries, including the aforementioned distinct query 224.
In some embodiments, for each distinct query 224 in the plurality of search queries, query server 114 determines (504) submission popularity data 218 for the query 224, and associates the query 224 with one or more web sites, e.g., via website to query mapping 236, wherein the web sites contain web pages that are selected by at least some of the plurality of users in response to the distinct query 224.
Prior to sending Internet usage data for a computer user, client 102 receives login information for the user, such as a username and password, and sends the information to search engine 112 via communications network 106. Search engine 112 receives and verifies the login information, thereby enabling search engine 112 to associate subsequent data received from client 102 (e.g., Internet usage data such as event-based data 404) with a particular user record 400 in user information database 116. In some embodiments, the user must pre-approve the use of the user's Internet usage data (e.g., via an opt-in process) and thus Internet usage data of users who have not given their approval is excluded from the submission popularity data.
In some embodiments, the Internet usage data include data about the user's interactions with search engine 112 (e.g., query events 410 and result click events 512). In some embodiments, the data about the user's interactions with the search engine include search queries by the user (e.g., queries 421 in query events 410), times of search queries by the user (e.g., timestamps 420 in query events 410), links in search results that were activated by the user (e.g., contentID 422 in result click events 412), and/or times that links in search results were activated by the user (e.g., timestamps 420 in result click events 412).
In some embodiments, the Internet usage data include data about the user's web browsing (e.g., browsing events 416). In some embodiments, the data about the user's web browsing include addresses of web pages browsed by the user (e.g., contentID 422 in browsing events 416), times when web pages were accessed by the user (e.g., timestamps 420 in browsing events 416), and/or lengths of time that web pages were displayed to the user.
In some embodiments, the Internet usage data include click stream data for a computer user (e.g., event-based data 404). In some embodiments, the Internet usage data is collected over a period of days, weeks, or months.
Search engine 112 (e.g., query server 114 in the search engine 112) receives (508) the Internet usage data for the computer user. In some embodiments, the Internet usage data includes web pages selected by the computer user. In some embodiments, the selected web pages correspond to search results selected by the computer user (e.g., contentID 422 in result click events 412). In some embodiments, the Internet usage data includes queries by the computer user (e.g., queries 421 in query events 410). In some embodiments, search engine 112 stores the Internet usage data in user record 400 in user information database 116.
In some embodiments, the predefined criteria include that (1) the determined query is associated with a plurality of web sites that contain web pages in the computer user's Internet usage data, and (2) the change in the number of times the determined query was received between two predefined time periods exceeds a predefined value or percentage. For example, the determined query may be “world series” if (1) the computer user's Internet usage data indicates that the computer user has looked at web pages in sports-related web sites (e.g., www.ESPN.com and www.Foxsports.com) that other users have visited in response to the query “world series” and (2) the change in the number 232 of “world series” queries received by search engine 112 between period 1 226 (e.g., this week) and period 2 228 (e.g., last week) exceeds a particular number or percentage. In this example, there may be a large change in the number of “world series” queries around the time that the baseball world series is being played, but this popular search query is not recommended to all users because many of these users may have no interest in baseball. Instead, the “world series” query is recommended to users whose Internet usage history indicates that they visit sports-related web sites that contain pages that are often clicked on by other users as search results to the query “world series.” In some embodiments, the association between web sites (e.g., www.ESPN.com and www.Foxsports.com) and queries (e.g., “world series”) is made via website to query mapping 236.
In some embodiments, the predefined criteria exclude queries in the computer user's Internet usage data. For example, if the computer user's record 400 indicated that the computer user had already submitted “world series” as a query 421, then “world series” would not be recommended to the computer user as a personalized popular search query. Alternately, the query would not be recommended if the user had already submitted the same query within a predefined period of time (e.g., one week, two weeks, or a month).
In some embodiments, the predefined criteria include that the determined query is associated with a plurality of web sites containing web pages in the computer user's Internet usage data. In some embodiments, the associated web sites exceed a predetermined number. For example, it may be required that the “world series” query is associated with two or more web sites (e.g., www.ESPN.com and www.Foxsports.com) that contain web pages in the computer user's Internet usage data.
In some embodiments, the predefined criteria include that the determined query is associated with one or more categories containing (i.e., associated with) web pages in the computer user's Internet usage data. For example, the determined query may be “world series” if this query is associated (e.g., via mappings 238 and 240) with one or more categories (e.g., sports) containing web pages in the computer user's Internet usage data. In this example, “world series” is recommended to a user whose Internet usage history indicates that he or she visits sports-related web pages. For example, the one or more categories associated with a respective query may be compared with the categories identified in the user record 400 (FIG. 4 ) to determine if the respective query is likely to be of interest to the user. In those embodiments in which the user record 400 of a user includes weightings or level of interest values for the identified categories, those values may be used to order and/or select from among a set of queries that are potentially of interest to the user.
In some embodiments, the predefined criteria include that the determined query is associated with a plurality of categories (i.e., two or more categories) containing web pages in the computer user's Internet usage data.
In some embodiments, the predefined criteria include that the number of times the determined query was received in a predefined time period exceeds a predefined value. For example, the number 232 of “world series” queries received by search engine 112 in period 1 226 (e.g., this week) exceeds a particular number (e.g., 2000).
In some embodiments, the predefined criteria include that the change in the number of times the determined query was received between two predefined time periods exceeds a predefined value. For example, the change in the number 232 of “world series” queries received by search engine 112 between period 1 226 (e.g., this week) and period 2 228 (e.g., last week) exceeds a particular number (e.g., an increase of at least 10,000 queries).
In some embodiments, the predefined criteria include that the percentage change in the number of times the determined query was received between two predefined time periods exceeds a predefined value. For example, the percentage change in the number 232 of “world series” queries received by search engine 112 between period 1 226 (e.g., this week) and period 2 228 (e.g., last week) exceeds a particular number (e.g., an increase of at least 50 percent, 100 percent, 200 percent, or 300 percent).
In some embodiments, the predefined criteria include that the change in the number of times the determined query was received between two predefined time periods exceeds a first predefined value and the percentage change in the number of times the determined query was received between two predefined time periods exceeds a second predefined value. For example, the change in the number 232 of “world series” queries received by search engine 112 between period 1 226 (e.g., this week) and period 2 228 (e.g., last week) exceeds a first particular number (e.g., 2000) and (2) the percentage change in the number 232 of “world series” queries received by search engine 112 between period 1 226 (e.g., this week) and period 2 228 (e.g., last week) exceeds a second particular number (e.g., 200 percent).
In some embodiments, the queries 602 are displayed in a home web page personalized to the user.
The recommended search queries 602 may correspond to recommended search queries of the Internet or just a portion thereof. Recommended search queries of just a portion of the Internet include, without limitation, image search queries, recommended shopping search queries (e.g., Froogle queries), and recommended local search queries (e.g., Google Local queries).
The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
