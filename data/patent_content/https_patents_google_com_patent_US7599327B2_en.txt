Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to communication systems, and in particular, to a method and apparatus for randomly accessing a wireless communication system by a subscriber station in order to obtain or maintain such parameters as uplink timing, power control, channel estimation, and frequency alignment of the subscriber station.
- a remote subscriber station SS
- the access signal fulfills important functions such as requesting resource allocation from the BS, alerting the BS of the existence of the SS that is trying to enter the network, and initiating a process that allows the BS to measure some parameters of the SS (e.g., timing offset caused by propagation, transmit power, etc.) that must be maintained and adjusted constantly in order to ensure a non-interfering sharing of the uplink resource.
- some parameters of the SS e.g., timing offset caused by propagation, transmit power, etc.
- this process is often referred to as a random access.
- the process is also referred to as “ranging”, as used in the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standards, because the access signal can help the BS to measure the propagation distance from the SS (thus, its range).
- a parameter known as a timing advance offset is used by the SS to advance its transmission relative to the reference timing at the BS so that the signals from all the SS's appear synchronized at the BS (i.e., uplink timing synchronization).
- uplink timing synchronization Once uplink timing synchronization is achieved, the SS orthogonality is ensured (i.e., each SS occupies its own allocated sub-carriers without interfering with other SS).
- the terms “access”, “random access”, and “ranging” will be used interchangeably to describe these processes and also to describe the signal transmitted by the SS to initiate the access process.
- the random access or ranging process includes an initial/handover ranging function for synchronizing an SS with a BS during the initial network entry or re-entry and during cell handoff, a periodic ranging function for maintaining SS synchronization, and a bandwidth request function that allows each SS to request uplink bandwidth allocation.
- These uplink ranging functions fulfill very important tasks that can significantly influence the user experience. For example, the bandwidth request ranging performance directly impacts the access latency perceived by a user, especially during communication sessions (e.g., HTTP) that consist of sporadic packet traffic that requires fast response, in which case high detection and low collision probabilities of the access request are very desirable.
- robust detection of an initial ranging signal is essential in order to allow a user to quickly enter the network or to be handed over to a new serving sector.
- Reliable extraction of the accurate timing offsets from the initial ranging signals is also critical for achieving uplink synchronization that ensures user orthogonality (i.e., to make sure that each SS occupies its own allocated sub-carriers without interfering with other SS).
- Other important information that the BS needs to extract from ranging includes power measurement, frequency synchronization, and channel impulse response estimation, etc. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and flexible air interface mechanism that enables fast and reliable user access to the network.

Accordingly, the apparatus components and method steps have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of communication system 100 .
- Communication system 100 comprises a plurality of cells 106 and 107 (only two shown) each having a base station (BS) 104 , 105 .
- the service area of the BS 104 covers a plurality of subscriber stations (SSs) 101 - 103 , each at a time may be performing some type of ranging function, which is also called herein a random access function.
- SS 101 may move out of the service area of BS 104 and enter into the service area of BS 105 , in which case a handover occurs that often involves a handover access.
- SS 102 makes a bandwidth request and/or SS 103 makes an initial entry access when it is first activated within the communication system.
- communication system 100 utilizes an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexed (OFDM) modulation or other variants of OFDM such as multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA), multi-carrier direct sequence CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA).
- OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexed
- MC-CDMA multi-carrier CDMA
- MC-DS-CDMA multi-carrier direct sequence CDMA
- the multi-channel communication system 100 can use any arbitrary technology such as TDMA, FDMA, and CDMA.
- a time-domain diagram shows a “basic” dedicated basic ranging zone 201 defined for an OFDM example system (the term “zone” is interchangeable herein with the term “interval” used in the figure), in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- the duration of the dedicated basic ranging interval 201 consists of an interval of a special OFDM symbol 202 (denoted as “extended-CP” OFDM symbol) and a “dead interval” 204 that is a no-transmission interval equal to the maximum timing delay to be accommodated in the cell.
- the special OFDM symbol 202 has a duration equal to the sum of the duration of a special Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) window 209 and the duration of an extended cyclic prefix (CP) 203 wherein the CP represents the repeat of a portion of the signal as commonly known in OFDM.
- FFT Fast Fourier Transform
- CP extended cyclic prefix
- the special Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) window 209 may be chosen conveniently to be the same as a “regular” OFDM symbol period in an example deployment of an OFDM system, or other designed value (discussed later).
- the duration of the extended CP 203 equals to the sum of the duration of a “regular” CP 205 and the maximum timing delay 206 to be accommodated.
- the maximum timing delay is chosen based on the possible timing differences among all possible subscriber locations. This value directly relates to the round-trip propagation delay and the cell size.
- the duration of a “regular” CP 205 within the extended CP 203 is the same as the CP length defined for regular data transmissions if the invention is used for an OFDM system.
- the time duration of a regular CP is often chosen based on the excessive delay spread of the channels encountered in a deployment environment, which is also how the CP length is determined for OFDM systems.
- the appended “dead” interval is chosen according to the maximal timing delay,
- a ranging signal is allowed to be transmitted only in the defined ranging interval.
- the ranging waveform itself is constructed as an OFDM symbol, i.e., by appending a CP of a certain length to a ranging signal.
- waveform For convenience, we will use the term “waveform” to refer to the CP-included signal and the term “signal” for the CP-excluded portion only.
- the ranging waveform transmission starts from what the SS determines to be the right timing. For initial ranging users, that transmission point (i.e., the transmission start time) will be the beginning of the dedicated ranging interval according to the base reference plus the one-way propagation delay. The initial ranging SS should send at that point a waveform whose CP portion is of the length of an extended CP.
- the non-initial ranging SS can either transmit a waveform with a regular CP at a timing point in advance to the start of 205 within 203 of FIG. 2 , or transmit a waveform with an extended CP at a timing point in advance to the start of 203 .
- the maximum timing delay should be large enough to accommodate the maximum propagation delay for SSs that have not adjusted their timing (i.e., initial ranging users).
- the maximum timing delay is a parameter determined based on the cell size.
- the BS should know how to adjust the sampling position accordingly in order to extract the special FFT window 209 .
- the special FFT window can be any size in theory.
- a large special FFT window can reduce the proportion of the extended CP to the special FFT size (i.e., reducing the overhead) and provide more ranging opportunities to reduce collision. Also, the time span of the transmission can also be extended so that there will be more signal power arriving at the BS for the same average transmit power. However, with a large special FFT window, the overall overhead of a ranging signal as a portion of the uplink sub-frame increases and the ranging signal also becomes more susceptible to channel time variations (e.g. mobility) that results in inter-carrier interference caused by Doppler shift.
- the choice of the special FFT size should also consider practical implementation. For example, in an OFDM system, making it an integer multiple of the regular FFT size may simplify the BS processing.
- the total ranging overhead which is the ratio of the duration of the dedicated basic ranging interval to the entire uplink sub-frame, depends only on the uplink sub-frame. The longer the uplink, the lower is the overhead. If the overhead due to the “dead interval” 204 delay becomes too excessive, the “dead interval” 204 can be omitted at the price of generating inevitable interference to the next symbol.
- a time-domain diagram shows an “extended” dedicated ranging interval 303 that is built upon the “basic” dedicated ranging interval 201 , in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- an extended ranging interval 303 can be defined where one or more regular OFDM symbols 301 and 302 with only a regular CP length may be added in front of the extended-CP special symbol. Initial ranging transmission is allowed only during the extended-CP interval, but other ranging transmissions are allowed everywhere. This design is an alternative to the case in which the special FFT size is enlarged, as described with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the ranging signal is allowed to occupy only a portion of the system bandwidth instead of the entire bandwidth as before.
- the extended-CP symbol 401 that is the same as extended CP symbol 202 in FIG. 2
- a portion of the bandwidth 402 is dedicated to ranging
- the remaining bandwidth 403 is for data traffic.
- such a design in which the ranging and data traffic are multiplexed can be done using different data/ranging ratios for each symbol in the extended ranging interval such as that illustrated in FIG. 4 , where the additional regular OFDM symbols 404 and 405 are used.
- the generic term “frequency-time ranging zone” is used for these cases.
- a time-domain diagram shows an exemplary ranging interval for an OFDM system similar to OFDM systems described by drafts and the published version of the IEEE 802.16 standard
- the ranging interval 501 is composed of one special OFDMA symbol with an extended CP that may be preceded by up to four regular OFDMA symbols each having a regular CP for providing more ranging opportunities if needed.
- the duration of the extended CP is signaled by the base in a control message sent from the BS (e.g., the UL-MAP message defined in draft and published versions of IEEE 802.16 standards) as an integer multiple of the regular CP.
- the special FFT size of the extended-CP symbol which may also be an integer multiple of the regular FFT size, is signaled in the control message as well.
- the special OFDMA symbol there is a “dead” interval that equals to the largest maximum timing difference. But it may be omitted to trade performance degradation for overhead reduction.
- the control message may indicate whether the dead interval is included.
- the duration of the dead interval is implicitly known to the SS and is equal to the difference between the extended-CP symbol duration and the regular CP duration.
- a block diagram shows the division of ranging opportunities in frequency, time, and code domains, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- Each random access signal is generated based on a ranging sequence (interchangeable with “access sequence” and “ranging code” and “access code”) that is randomly chosen from a code group 601 allocated to the sector (the code group size is denoted herein as N c , an integer).
- N c the code group size
- the ranging sequence may be used to generate an access signal by directly modulating the contiguous sub-carriers in a frequency block (sub-band) that is randomly chosen among N b1 sub-bands 602 , wherein N b1 is an integer including the value “1” known to both BS and SS. N b1 may be determined based on the system bandwidth and be made known to the BS and the SS.
- the time-domain access signal is generated by performing an IFFT on the ranging sequence after modulating the chosen sub-band.
- the access signal Before a CP is inserted in front of the access signal to form a complete access waveform, the access signal may be cyclically (circularly) shifted in time domain, where the shift is chosen randomly among N sh allowed values 603 that are known to the BS and SS, wherein N sh is an integer.
- a CP is added to form the final ranging waveform where the length of the CP is that of the extended CP for initial ranging and for other ranging, either the extended CP or the regular CP depending on the transmission point (discussed above).
- the duration of the waveform corresponds to the duration of one OFDM symbol in the extended ranging interval, in embodiments such as those described with reference to FIG. 3 and FIG. 5
- the ranging sequence may be used to generate an access waveform by appending data symbols to the ranging sequence and directly modulating the contiguous sub-carriers in the frequency block (sub-band) that is randomly chosen, using terms of the appended ranging sequence.
- N b1 frequency blocks 602 N b1 sub-bands with K sub-carriers in each sub-band.
- a ranging signal may occupy only one sub-band.
- the reason for dividing the bandwidth into orthogonal blocks is for better flexibility.
- the number of ranging opportunities can be made adjustable to the bandwidth: larger bandwidth systems need to provide more opportunities than narrower bandwidth systems for a similar collision rate.
- transmitting on a narrow sub-band allows power boost on that band to achieve a decent uplink SNR, even though narrowband transmission has lower timing resolution than wider bandwidth transmission (N b1 channel taps will collapse into one channel tap when only 1/N b1 of the bandwidth is excited).
- the number of sub-carriers in each sub-band which equals to the length of the ranging sequence code, affects the cross-correlation characteristics. For example, halving the number of sub-carriers in a sub-band allows a 3 dB transmit power boost on that band, but the potential interference from other co-channel ranging codes also increases by 3 dB. So the number of sub-carriers in a sub-band involves a tradeoff between SNR boost and interference sacrifice.
- the parameter N b1 is specified by the BS based on the bandwidth (FFT size), uplink SNR requirement, timing precision requirement, suppression capability to potential co-channel interferences, and the number of ranging opportunities that needs to be provided. It should also be specified jointly with the other two parameters N c and N sh described in more detail below.
- a number of ranging codes 601 may be allowed. Since these ranging codes occupy the same band, they may interfere with each other even without any code collision. Sequences with good cross-correlation are much desired for better code detection and channel estimation.
- a low PAPRi of the time-domain ranging waveform is also much desirable in order to be able to boost the transmission power to improve the uplink SNR. The details of the sequences that have these desirable properties will be discussed in the next section.
- a number of sequence groups are also required for allocating to different neighboring sectors.
- the parameter N c is determined by the BS based on the access needs and the maximally tolerable interference level at which the successful detection rate is still good.
- N sh cyclic time shifts 603 of the time-domain ranging signal can be used to further increase the number of ranging opportunities.
- s(k) is the original (or 0 th shift) sequence
- L is the CP length (regular or extended CP, depending on the type of ranging)
- N FFT is the FFT size.
- code separability is achieved by the fact that the estimated channel is shifted in time domain by some multiples of L. If L is large enough to cover most of the channel length, the access signals using distinct cyclic shifts will allow their corresponding channels to be separated reasonably well.
- the initial ranging transmission may be used by any SS that wants to synchronize to the system channel for the first time.
- a control message from the BS may specify the sub-bands that an initial ranging signal can use. All sub-bands or, for example, a specified number of the sub-bands starting from the lowest frequency offset may be allowed for initial ranging.
- N sh ⁇ N sp /L CPe ⁇ shifts are preferred for interference-free code separation among different shifts of a ranging signal
- ⁇ x ⁇ denotes the flooring function (i.e., the maximum integer that is not greater than x)
- L Cpe is the length of an extended CP
- N sp is the FFT size of the special FFT symbol ( 209 of FIG. 2 ) that may be multiples of the regular FFT size N. If some interference between estimated channels can be tolerated, that maximal number may be even increased. In general, more shifts can be used at the expense of increased interference.
- N sh ′ ⁇ N sp /L CPe ⁇ 1 so that a good estimation of the noise and interference level can be obtained from the “channel-free” IFFT samples.
- L Cpe can be significantly larger than the regular CP length (denoted as L CP ) used in an OFDM system (for non-OFDM that does not define a CP length, the duration of a regular CP, or L CP , is often chosen based on the excessive delay spread of the channels encountered in a deployment, as discussed before), the allowed N sh can be significantly reduced.
- the number of initial ranging opportunity is then N sh ′*N c *N b1 ′. If initial ranging is allowed on all sub-bands, the total number of all ranging opportunities is N sh ′*N c *N b1 , of which a portion may be assigned to initial ranging.
- Periodic-ranging transmissions are sent periodically for system periodic ranging.
- Bandwidth-requests transmissions are for requesting uplink allocations from the BS.
- These non-initial ranging transmissions may be sent only by SSs that have already synchronized to the system. These transmissions can also use the additional OFDM symbols if these symbols are allocated for ranging in a control message from the BS.
- PAPR peak to average power ratio
- cross-correlation It is desirable to use ranging sequences that have low PAPR (peak to average power ratio) and good cross-correlation.
- a large PAPR requires more power backoff in order to avoid signal distortion.
- a reduced average transmit power resulting from using such power backoff causes a decrease of the uplink SNR, which can be problematic for the BS to detect the ranging signals from mobile devices with limited power.
- the PAPR is usually much higher than that in the traditional “single-carrier” transmission when the OFDM sub-carriers are modulated with random PSK/QAM symbols.
- the PAPR for the access signals described in drafts and a published version of the IEEE 802.16 standard are in the range of 6.5 to 12 dB.
- the cross correlation since distinct ranging signals can interfere with each other, a good cross correlation among them can mitigate the interference, which results in improved detection rate and reduced false alarm.
- the presence of other ranging codes on the same set of sub-carriers and at the same cyclic shift may severely distort the estimation of the desired channel if the cross correlation property is unsatisfactory. This results in low detection rate and high false alarm rate even just for the purpose of detecting the presence of a ranging code, needless to say the goal of obtaining accurate channel knowledge.
- the performance becomes more and more unacceptable as the channel conditions become worse (for example, under larger delay spread) or the number of ranging users increases.
- the ranging signal uses access sequences that have good PAPR and cross correlation.
- the set of sequences can come from a search of a special type of sequences such as random PSK or Golay PSK sequences so that the resulting set has good PAPR and cross correlation.
- the sequence can be constructed more systematically from the Generalized Chirp Like (GCL) sequences which are non-binary unit-amplitude sequences.
- GCL Generalized Chirp Like
- N G is the length of the GCL sequence (a prime number is preferred as will be explained later) and u is referred to as the class index that is a non-zero integer chosen between 1 and N G ⁇ 1.
- the GCL sequence has the following important properties:
- Property 3 The absolute value of the cyclic cross-correlation function between any two GCL sequences is constant and equal to 1/ ⁇ square root over (N G ) ⁇ , when
- the cross-correlation mentioned here is a sequence itself with each value corresponding to the correlation between two sequences where one of them is shifted by an integer number of elements (referred to as a “lag”).
- the cross-correlation 1/ ⁇ square root over (N G ) ⁇ at all lags (Property 3) actually achieves the optimal cross-correlation value for any two sequences that have the ideal autocorrelation property (meaning that the theoretical minimum of the maximum value of the cross-correlation over all lags is achieved).
- the minimum is achieved when the cross correlations at all lags equal to 1/ ⁇ square root over (N G ) ⁇ .
- the cross correlation property allows the interfering signal be evenly spread in the time domain after correlating the received signal with the desired sequence. Hence, at least the significant taps of the desired channel can be detected more reliably.
- the N G -point DFT/IDFT operation is equivalent to a size-N G matrix transformation where the matrix is an N G by N G unitary matrix.
- sequences formed based on unitary transformations performed on the GCL sequences still fall within the scope of the invention, because the final sequences are still constructed from GCL sequences. That is, the final sequences are substantially based on (but are not necessarily equal to) the GCL sequences.
- the number of sub-carriers in a sub-band is often not a prime number. In this case, in one embodiment, the smallest prime number is chosen that is larger than the desired length, and the GCL sequence is truncated to the desired length.
- the largest prime number that is smaller than the desired length is chosen and the GCL sequence is cyclically extended to the desired length.
- Other modifications of the GCL sequence may be allowed in the same spirit to approximate the good properties as much as possible. When such a modification is performed, the three previously described properties will only hold approximately, but it is found that they still hold very well, especially when the sequence is reasonably long.
- the absolute correlation values for all lags of the cross correlation between any sequence pair are still very evenly distributed such that the maximum absolute correlation value over all lags is no more than two times the average of the absolute correlation values of the cross correlation. This is a good cross-correlation.
- Constant amplitude in Property 3 means that the sub-carriers are excited evenly to allow unbiased channel estimation.
- GCL sequence When GCL sequence is applied onto all OFDM sub-carriers (or onto uniformly spaced sub-carriers), the time domain signals also have constant amplitudes. But due to the guard sub-carriers used in all practical OFDM systems and possible sub-band excitation, the time domain waveform is equivalent to an oversampled discrete-time sequence after passing through a “sinc” pulse-shaping filter. The resulting PAPR will not have exactly constant amplitude, but a large number of the GCL sequences still generate waveforms with low PAPRs.
- N G ⁇ 1 there are a large number (N G ⁇ 1) of GCL sequences, so the classes of GCL sequences that give good PAPR can be chosen as the ranging codes while the good cross correlation among them is approximately kept.
- N G ⁇ 1 the classes of GCL sequences that give good PAPR can be chosen as the ranging codes while the good cross correlation among them is approximately kept.
- an average PAPR that is substantially lower than the PAPR of the ranging waveforms currently described in drafts and a published version of an IEEE 802.16 standard can be obtained.
- an average PAPR range of 2.5-5 dB can be achieved (versus 6.5-12 dB in IEEE 802.16-2004) by aspects of the present invention with a sequence length of approximately 100.
- the present invention can provide enough sequences with an average PAPR of less than 6 dB in many situations.
- sequences may then be divided into a number (denoted as Ngr) of equal-size code groups, each of which is to be assigned to a cell/sector.
- the number of sequences in each code group is Nc, and the number of groups Ngr may be predetermined according to Nc and the total number of sequences with good PAPRs.
- Other more sophisticated cell planning is possible with the goal of assigning groups so that the possible interference from neighboring cells/sectors is minimized.
- the access sequences can be based on arbitrary sequences.
- PRBS Physical Random Binary Sequence
- the access sequences based on arbitrary sequences may not necessarily have good PAPR and cross correlation properties but in some cases (e.g. binary sequences) may provide simpler sequence generation/storage/processing.
- FIG. 7 a flow chart shows some steps of methods used in a subscriber station, such as any of the subscriber stations 101 , 102 , 103 ( FIG. 1 ) when operating as described herein, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- an access sequence is selected from a set of N c access sequences that have been identified to have a low average of peak-to-average-power-ratios of access signals generated by the set of N c access sequences and to have a good cross-correlation of the access signals generated by the set of N c access sequences, and wherein the set of N C access sequences has been generated by a corresponding set of sequences of length K, wherein K is a quantity of sub-carriers identified for transmitting an access signal.
- the sub-band in which the signal is transmitted is randomly selected in some implementations.
- the access waveform is formed by generating an access signal using the access sequence and appending in the time domain a cyclic prefix to the access signal. Since the access sequence is used to modulate the subcarriers in the chosen sub-band, the time-domain access signal can be conveniently generated by taking an Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation (IFFT) of the frequency-domain sequence, in one embodiment.
- the frequency-domain sequence whose length equals the total number of subcarriers, is preferably the zero-padded ranging sequence (i.e., the ranging sequence at the subcarrier locations of the chosen sub-band and zeros else where). In the case of frequency multiplexing the ranging with data traffic ( FIG. 4 ), the frequency-domain sequence preferably comprises the access sequence, zeros as needed, and the data sequence.
- the access waveform is transmitted.
- a flow chart shows some steps of methods used in a subscriber station, such as any of the subscriber stations 101 , 102 , 103 ( FIG. 1 ) when operating as described elsewhere herein, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- an access sequence is selected from a set of Nc access sequences.
- the sub-band of K sub-carriers in which the ranging signal is going to be transmitted is randomly selected in some implementations.
- an access signal is generated using the selected access sequence.
- the generated access signal is cyclically time shifted by a shift value that is one of a defined set of N sh shift values.
- an access waveform is formed by appending a cyclic prefix in front of the generated access signal.
- the access waveform is transmitted using a sub-band of K sub-carriers.
- the BS may signal to all the SS's the definition of the ranging zone, the division of the frequency, time, and code domains, and the code grouping information. This signaling mechanism is essential to allow a flexible ranging scheme that can adjust the overhead and performance according to the deployment system parameters (e.g., bandwidth, cell size, etc.) and the access traffic need.
- deployment system parameters e.g., bandwidth, cell size, etc.
- control message is contained in the UL-MAP message in the following form:
- a flow chart shows a method used by a base station in a wireless multi-carrier communication system for facilitating an access of the communication system by a subscriber station, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- a transmitted control signal from the BS identifies one or more sub-bands in an access interval, each of which comprises K sub-carriers and for which each of the sub-bands is available for a subscriber station to use to transmit an access signal.
- an access signal is received from the SS in one of the one or more sub-bands during the access interval.
- the access signal is decoded.
- the uplink processing is discussed here to illustrate how the cross correlation property can be taken advantage of.
- a time-domain channel corresponding to each ranging user i.e., subscriber station performing an access function
- the timing offset also needs to be extracted, which is straightforward after the channel is estimated in the process.
- the signal and interference power can also be estimated in the process.
- the detection of the presence of a ranging code is often performed by comparing a pre-set threshold with the ratio of the peak of the estimated channel to the estimated noise floor.
- an N-point FFT of the received signal at the appropriate FFT window is preferably performed first.
- the start of the appropriate window is known to the BS after the special FFT window ( 209 of FIG. 2 ) and the extended CP length ( 203 of FIG. 2 ) is designed.
- the received data on all sub-bands is then obtained.
- a bank of N c detector/estimators run in parallel for each of the N b1 sub-bands, using the data resulted from taking an N-point FFT of the received signal at the appropriate FFT window.
- M be Y m (k) where k is a data sub-carrier in a sub-band.
- Y m (k) consists of possibly more than one ranging code.
- K is the number of sub-carriers in the sub-band and the IFFT size P can be chosen as the smallest power-of-2 integer that is larger than K.
- w(k) is an optional weighting window applied onto the noisy frequency response.
- the windowing is to reduce the power leakage problem caused by the discontinuity from the edge of the band to null sub-carriers (since zeros are inserted in place of the null sub-carriers before the IFFT). It can be thought as an artificial pulse-shaping filter that is a “sinc” function if a flat weighting is applied.
- the pulse-shaping filter can reduce the tail effect so that there will be fewer taps in ⁇ tilde over (h) ⁇ m (l) introduced by “sinc” pulse shaping, rather than by true multipaths.
- An example is the traditional raised cosine pulse shaping whose tails decay much faster than that in the “sinc” function case. Similar to a raised cosine function, a “Hanning” window can be used, i.e.,
- w ⁇ ( k ) ( 0.5 + 0.5 ⁇ cos ⁇ ⁇ 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ k ⁇ ) , ( 6 ) where the parameter ⁇ controls the shape of the window (an infinite ⁇ means a flat window). ⁇ should be larger than K.
- the ranging users' channels are separable in the time domain from ⁇ tilde over (h) ⁇ m (l) in (5).
- This means that an estimate of n th user channel is simply contained in samples (n ⁇ 1)L through nL ⁇ 1 of (5) where L is the same CP length in (1).
- the receiver processes the access signal to obtain a sequence of time domain values (i.e., ⁇ tilde over (h) ⁇ m (l)) of a length that equals to the IFFT size P.
- the receiver analyzes the subset of the time domain samples according to n, i.e., the samples indexed from (n ⁇ 1)L through nL ⁇ 1 in (5). All allowed cyclic shifts will be examined in the random access case.
- an estimation of the noise plus interference level (within some scaling) for each of the M antennas can be obtained by averaging
- 2 for l P ⁇ L CPe , . . . , P ⁇ 1, i.e.,
- This detection variable will be compared with a threshold. If z n is greater than the threshold, detection is declared. A larger threshold value reduces the false alarm probability, but it also increases the probability of a “miss”.
- Another type of detection variable is the ratio between the peak and the mean power value, i.e.,
- This detection value may be used when there is no “channel-free” region to estimate the noise floor.
- the timing offset can be estimated in the following way. First, over the region of the extended CP (L CPe ), a rectangular window of width L CP slides through this extended-CP window. The estimated signal power is computed recursively as
- L CP ⁇ L sampling points before the correct timing point are all “valid” choices in the sense of not causing any SNR degradation.
- One conservative way to choose the timing point within the plateau is to choose the mid-point between the peak and the right edge of the plateau (defined as the point that x n (i) first falls below a certain percentage (say 95%) of the peak). Instead of trying to estimate the true timing offset and risking a significant SNR degradation occurred even when the estimate is just a few taps later than the true timing, this approach chooses a conservative timing advance compensation point that can often be earlier than the true timing offset, but the degradation of SNR is guaranteed to be minimal.
- the channel of the ranging user can also be estimated reasonably well if needed. This information can be helpful for closed loop antenna processing.
- a tap-selection or “de-noising” strategy is important. Tap selection simply means that the channel taps below some threshold, ⁇ , are set to zero. Hence, tap selection improves the channel estimation for relatively sparse channels by attempting to match the channel estimator to the instantaneous power delay profile for each user.

Abstract
Description
s j(k)=s(k)e −j2πk(j−1)L/N
where s(k) is the original (or 0th shift) sequence, L is the CP length (regular or extended CP, depending on the type of ranging) and NFFT is the FFT size. In essence, code separability is achieved by the fact that the estimated channel is shifted in time domain by some multiples of L. If L is large enough to cover most of the channel length, the access signals using distinct cyclic shifts will allow their corresponding channels to be separated reasonably well.
where NG is the length of the GCL sequence (a prime number is preferred as will be explained later) and u is referred to as the class index that is a non-zero integer chosen between 1 and NG−1. The GCL sequence has the following important properties:
Group Index=mod(Decimal number corresponding to the last five bits of cell ID, Ngr) (3)
Other more sophisticated cell planning is possible with the goal of assigning groups so that the possible interference from neighboring cells/sectors is minimized.

Next the noisy estimates are transformed to the time domain through a P-point IFFT as:
where K is the number of sub-carriers in the sub-band and the IFFT size P can be chosen as the smallest power-of-2 integer that is larger than K. w(k) is an optional weighting window applied onto the noisy frequency response. The windowing is to reduce the power leakage problem caused by the discontinuity from the edge of the band to null sub-carriers (since zeros are inserted in place of the null sub-carriers before the IFFT). It can be thought as an artificial pulse-shaping filter that is a “sinc” function if a flat weighting is applied. The pulse-shaping filter can reduce the tail effect so that there will be fewer taps in {tilde over (h)}m(l) introduced by “sinc” pulse shaping, rather than by true multipaths. An example is the traditional raised cosine pulse shaping whose tails decay much faster than that in the “sinc” function case. Similar to a raised cosine function, a “Hanning” window can be used, i.e.,
where the parameter Γ controls the shape of the window (an infinite Γ means a flat window). Γ should be larger than K.
The detection variable for the nth shift ranging user is then calculated as
This detection variable will be compared with a threshold. If zn is greater than the threshold, detection is declared. A larger threshold value reduces the false alarm probability, but it also increases the probability of a “miss”.
This detection value may be used when there is no “channel-free” region to estimate the noise floor.
xn(i) will exhibit a plateau whose width depends on the number of “valid” timing compensation values. Ideally, the right edge of the plateau corresponds to the correct timing offset estimation. However, if the channel length L is smaller than the regular CP length LCP, then LCP−L sampling points before the correct timing point are all “valid” choices in the sense of not causing any SNR degradation. One conservative way to choose the timing point within the plateau is to choose the mid-point between the peak and the right edge of the plateau (defined as the point that xn(i) first falls below a certain percentage (say 95%) of the peak). Instead of trying to estimate the true timing offset and risking a significant SNR degradation occurred even when the estimate is just a few taps later than the true timing, this approach chooses a conservative timing advance compensation point that can often be earlier than the true timing offset, but the degradation of SNR is guaranteed to be minimal.
