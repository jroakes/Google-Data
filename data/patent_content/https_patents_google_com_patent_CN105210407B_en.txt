Fig. 2 illustrates the possible configuration (Fig. 1) of eNB 110, AP 120 or wireless device 130.According to its configuration, at this
There may be variation in a little equipment.ENB 110, AP 120 or wireless device 130 include user interface 208, controller 210,

210 emit data to other entities of cellular network 105 (referring to Fig. 1) via network interface 260.
Referring again to FIGS. 1, station 150 follows transmission and received rule according to wireless standard.In one embodiment, it stands
150 meet 802.11 standard of IEEE, this standard needs the inactive period between transmission, should not there is station during the period
Transmitting.The duration of inactive period depends on the transmission of period generation in-between.When inactive required for these
Section is referred to as interframe gap.For example, being permitted if a station is emitting many big groupings that each grouping has multiple segmentations
More interframe gaps will be short interframe gap (" SIFS ").However, if control frequently replaces between different stations, many interframe
Gap may be distributed coordination function interframe gap (" DIFS ").
Channel utilization (for example, 802.11 channel utilization of IEEE) is the percentage for the time that AP senses channel busy,
As physics or virtual carrier are monitored indicated by (" CS ") mechanism.In IEEE 802.11, channel utilization by linear scale,
255 indicate 100% utilization rate, and channel utilization field value is only main channel calculation.Channel utilization calculates as follows：
Channel busy time is that CS mechanism has indicated that channel is busy microsecond number during it.Parameter " dot11 channel utilization
Beacon interval " indicates the quantity in the continuous beacon gap that channel busy time is measured during it.Although channel utilization is general
It is notified by AP, but radio station can also execute this calculating.
The DIFS period is usually twice or more of SIFS period.Therefore, emit a station of mass data in seconds
Channel utilization is set to seem very high, even if other stations are without activity.Alternatively, because separating the bigger of the transmission at different stations
DIFS period, transmitting and many stations for receiving mass data make channel utilization seem very low.
Referring still to Fig. 1, wireless device 130 is configured to determine on the wireless channel of WLAN106 in one embodiment
The reference period.Wireless device 130, which also determines, indicates that wireless channel is the busy duration with reference in the period during it
Channel utilization.Wireless device 130 further determines that required interframe gap between continuously transmitting during busy periods.It is based on
The channel utilization and required interframe gap initially determined that, wireless device 130 can determine the letter of the modification of wireless channel
Road utilization rate.Then, wireless device 130 can report modification to the network entity (for example, eNB 110) of cellular network 105
Channel utilization.
It continues to refer to figure 1, eNB 110 passes through cellular connection and 130 communication linkage of wireless device.In one embodiment,
In order to which communication service is unloaded to WLAN 106, eNB 110 requests wireless device 130 to provide the channel utilization letter of WLAN 106
Breath.Wireless device 130 obtains channel utilization information from the one or more in AP 120 and provides this information to eNB 110.
Channel utilization information includes channel utilization measurement.During transmitting during interframe gap and over the wireless channel, channel benefit
It will indicate that channel is busy with rate metric.If channel usage rate metric is lower than predetermined threshold, eNB 110 is by communication service
At least part of (for example, voice, video or other data) hands over to WLAN connection (that is, wireless terminal from cellular connection
Connection between 130 and WLAN 106).
Fig. 3 is turned to, timing shows the channel busy periods based on the instruction of standard channel utilization rate or refers to period (example
Such as, dot11 channel utilization beacon interval x dot11 beacon periods) in the first AP 122 (see Fig. 1) wireless channel channel
Busy time (being obtained by CS mechanism) and idle time of channel.Busy time section 302,304,306,308,310,312 and 314 is by sky
Idle section 320,322,324,326,328 and 330 separates.However, although idle period seems to occupy the most of of timing diagram,
This may imply that enough availabilities that additional station is connect with the first AP 122, but nothing based on the operation of WLAN 106
Line standard (for example, IEEE 802.11) needs many this idle periods.For example, idle period 320,322,324 and 328 are complete
It is filled up entirely by the required SIFS and DIFS period (for example, " silence period (silent periods) ").In addition, idle period
326 and 330 a big chunk is filled up by the required DIFS period 332 and 334 respectively, and only surplus part 340 and 342 is for tasting
Try other transmission or reception.
Fig. 4 is turned to, the channel utilization that timing diagram illustrates the modification of the instruction of the standard channel utilization rate based on Fig. 3 refers to
Show.The channel utilization instruction modified in this embodiment occupies silence period (for example, required for SIFS, DIFS or other
Silence period).In this embodiment, wireless device 130 is configured to determine the channel utilization instruction of modification.
Turn to Fig. 5, in one embodiment, step shown in 130 execution flow chart of wireless device.In 572 steps, nothing
Line equipment 130 determines the value (first time period for indicating busy time section) of channel busy time.In step 574, wireless device 130 is true
The value (second time period for indicating interframe gap associated with first time period) of fixed correlation silence period.In step 576, nothing
Line equipment 130 determines the channel utilization of modification based on the value of channel busy time and the value of related silence period.According to a reality
Example is applied, for doing so, wireless device 130 is with the value (obtaining in step 572) of channel busy time plus related silence period
Value replace equation 1 molecule (for example, " channel busy time ").
Notice that standard channel utilization rate method only uses busy time section 302,304,306,308,310,312 and 314 (see figure
3) channel busy time is calculated.However, on the contrary, the wireless device 130 of the present embodiment, which calculates channel busy time, (is based on busy time section
302,304,306,308,310,312 and 314) and silence period (for example, idle period 320,322,324 and 328 and DIFS
Period 332 and 334) the two.Therefore, the timing diagram of Fig. 4 includes the busy periods 452,454 and 456 of modification.
In the channel usage for determining modification based on channel busy time (first time period) and silence period (second time period)
After rate, in the step 578 of Fig. 5, channel utilization of the wireless device 130 to the report modification of eNB 110.In one example,
The channel utilization of report modification includes that request is switched to WLAN channel.
In one embodiment, the wireless device 130 of Fig. 1 be configured to by initial channel busy measurement period by silencing
Period is set as zero to determine the silence period for being added to channel busy time.For each transmission n and next transmission n+
1, wherein needing SIFS therebetween, wireless device 130, which is based on SIFS, is incremented by silence period.In one embodiment, wirelessly
Equipment 130 is configured as, if at least meeting one of following condition, determination needs SIFS：(1) transmission n and transmission n+1 are respectively
Transmission from the first equipment and the acknowledgement frame to the transmission, (2) transmission n are in response in the precedent transmission n- from the first equipment
1 acknowledgement frame, and transmitting n+1 is the transmission from the first equipment, is next segmentation of grouping identical with transmission n-1,
(3) transmission n is the request for sending frame and transmission n+1 is Clear to Send frame, or (4) transmission n is block confirmation request and transmission n+1
It is block confirmation (" BlockAck ").
Acknowledgement frame may include the instruction of confirmation or the instruction of negative confirmation.If BlockAck process is in use,
Then the starting station may send multiple segmentations of grouping, successively separate (that is, not confirming therebetween) by SIFS.However, observation station can
It can not know that BlockAck process is used in two stations.Therefore, above-mentioned condition collection is for continuous when BlockAck is used
Segmentation between the SIFS period be incorrect.
For each transmission n and next transmission n+1, wherein needing DIFS therebetween, wireless device 130 is based on
DIFS is incremented by silence period.In one embodiment, wireless device 130 is configured as, if at least meet following condition it
One, determination needs DIFS：(1) transmission n is from the first equipment and transmission n+1 from the second equipment and is not in response in the first transmission
Acknowledgement frame, or (2) transmission n is in response in the acknowledgement frame of the precedent transmission n-1 from the first equipment, and transmits n+1 and come
From the transmission of the first equipment, but next segmentation of the grouping of transmission n-1 is not corresponded to.
For example, if channel busy measurement period includes a station or the access point for emitting multiple segmentations, wireless device 130
The above-mentioned calculating carried out increases channel utilization based on the SIFS period between segmentation.If measurement period includes transmitting grouping
Difference station, then above-mentioned calculating increases channel utilization based on the DIFS period (it is greater than the SIFS period) between grouping.Therefore, exist
Utilization rate is higher in the case where multiple station exchanges data (even if data include many small groupings).
In another embodiment, the molecule that related silence period replaces equation 1 is not added with channel busy time,
Wireless device 130 changes the molecule of equation 1, so that the duration in denominator eliminates the interframe gap period.This be by from
What the required interframe gap (based on above-mentioned condition) that channel busy measurement period subtracts accumulation executed.
In embodiment of the disclosure, equal downlink and uplink data rate and honeycomb channel quality are referred to
Show the mapping or the following generation of transformation of WLAN channel state information (" the CQI ") measurement of symbol (" CQI ").CQI report is by wirelessly setting
Standby 130 are generated using based on wireless device and AP by the information of its wireless channel communicated.This CQI report here by
Referred to as WLAN CSI.WLAN CSI is in view of the quality of the communication link of AP and the load of AP.WLAN CSI can be uplink
Road communication and downlink communication and determine.
In one embodiment, since the transmission of different number and receiving antenna, access point and station are to the Bu Tong sharp of resource
With difference, the CSI feedback that rate is horizontal, explicit or implicit beam forming is supported are supported, low-density checksum is supported and it is other because
Element, downlink and uplink data rate on 802.11 communication link of IEEE are asymmetric.Therefore, the substitution of CQI
Calculating is necessary WLAN downlink and uplink data rate.In one embodiment, wireless device 130 to
The WLAN CSI report that eNB 110 is sent is used with the channel detection of one, two, three or four transmission antenna.
It turns again in Fig. 1, in one embodiment, wireless device 130 selects MCS rope from available MCS indexed set
Draw and turns to downlink data rate maximum：
Wherein,It is that (its expression can be based on the measurement carried out by wireless device 130 for the data rate of WLAN
Obtained total downlink (" DL ") data rate), BLER (∏, MCS) is that singular association window (passes through NSSStream transmitting, it is assumed that
Vertical code) block error rate (" BLER "), ∏ is the channel status set of sub-band channel matrix and signal-to-noise ratio (estimation), R(peak)(MCS, QoS) is in bandwidth (for example, using NSSThe every channel 20 of spatial flow or 40 megahertzs (" MHz ")) on may be positive
The achievable peak data rate of service quality (" QoS ") mode that the candidate Traffic stream being unloaded from cellular network 105 is established,
And CRU is channel resource utilization rate (" CRU ").BLER is based on the first radio link, WLAN modulation and encoding scheme, or both
Channel status.
For the wireless channel with time varying channel states information, wireless device 130 by the time is averaged (and from
And on different channel status is realized) determine average WLAN data rate
The selection of the MCS carried out in this case by wireless device 130 is represented as：
Alternatively, wireless device 130 sends single parameter, such as MCS, R(peak)(MCS, QoS) or CRU, so that eNB 110
These measurements can be received, or alternatively it can be based on mobile management entity forwarding information of the measurement to cellular network 105.
Referring still to Fig. 1, wireless device 130 is directly given Business Stream in its R in one embodiment(peak)(MCS,
QoS) determination can be by the data rate that the wireless channel of WLAN 106 is supported (for example, wireless device 130 and AP in the determination of function
120 wireless channels just communicated on it).R(peak)The value of (MCS, QoS) function is based on whether AP can guarantee wireless device 130
Or cellular network 105 intends to be unloaded to AP (that is, the QoS of the Business Stream to WLAN 106).R(peak)(MCS, QoS) function may
Consider other AP.R(peak)(MCS, QoS) function may also consider the ability of receiver, such as whether supporting high-throughput greenery patches
Format is leading or mixed mode, whether supports low-density checksum and using short or long protection interval.
Wireless device 130 is configured to select for cellular network 105 close to can be wireless in WLAN in one embodiment
The MCS of the data rate obtained on channel.For example, wireless device 130 selects MCSLTESo that：
Wherein,It is intended to l layers of LTE MCSFunction LTE number
According to rate, and v is order (for example, sum of layer).Transmission block selection assumes that one refers to subframe and complete bandwidth allocation.Example
Such as, for 10MHz LTE downlink channel, all 50 resource blocks in 1 subframe, which are assumed to be, for example to be sent out using open loop
Diversity Space Frequency Block Coding is penetrated to be launched.In one embodiment, wireless device 130 is reported to eNB 110Nothing
Line equipment 130 determines equivalent order v, and v fed back included together in it with the MCS of corresponding order.In addition, once calculating equivalent
Order, wireless device 130 can recalculate MCS and the MCS at different fs made to be equal.The case where code rate is equal to 1
Lower theoretical peak rate is every layer every hertz (" Hz ") 6 bit/second (" bps "), but for the every of 10MHz LTE downlink channel
Layer, typical peak rate is in the range of 50-60 megabits per second (" Mbps ").For order 2 and 4 transmission (for example, v be equal to 2
Or 4), using 10MHz LTE downlink, peak data rate may be up to 100Mbps and 200Mbps respectively.Wireless device
130 to the ability that eNB 110 provides equivalent order (and MCS according to order) to give eNB 110 achievable by WLAN chain road
Ability of the data rate to immediate LTE sum of ranks LTE broadband MCS.
Referring still to Fig. 1, feedback mechanism discussed above, including broadband CQI and order, WLAN chain is provided to eNB 110
The estimation of the average support data rate of road.Therefore, the modification or extension of honeycomb MCS table are not required (it is assumed that from LTE
Communication link unloads or is unloaded to LTE communication link).WLAN MCS, which is transformed into honeycomb MCS, allows eNB 110 in candidate WLAN
