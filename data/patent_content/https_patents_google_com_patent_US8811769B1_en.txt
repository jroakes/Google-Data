- One skilled in the art will further recognize that several of the components shown in the configurations of FIGS. 8A and 8B are optional, and may be omitted or reconfigured.
- camera 800 may be a light-field camera that includes light-field image data acquisition device 809 having optics 801 , image sensor 803 (including a plurality of individual sensors for capturing pixels), and microlens array 802 .
- Optics 801 may include, for example, aperture 812 for allowing a selectable amount of light into camera 800 , and main lens 813 for focusing light toward microlens array 802 .
- microlens array 802 may be disposed and/or incorporated in the optical path of camera 800 (between main lens 813 and sensor 803 ) so as to facilitate acquisition, capture, sampling of, recording, and/or obtaining light-field image data via sensor 803 . Referring now also to FIG.
- FIG. 9 there is shown an example of an architecture for a light field camera 800 for implementing the present invention according to one embodiment.
- the Figure is not shown to scale.
- FIG. 9 shows, in conceptual form, the relationship between aperture 812 , main lens 813 , microlens array 802 , and sensor 803 , as such components interact to capture light field data for subject 901 .
- light-field camera 800 may also include a user interface 805 for allowing a user to provide input for controlling the operation of camera 800 for capturing, acquiring, storing, and/or processing image data.
- light-field camera 800 may also include control circuitry 810 for facilitating acquisition, sampling, recording, and/or obtaining light-field image data.
- control circuitry 810 may manage and/or control (automatically or in response to user input) the acquisition timing, rate of acquisition, sampling, capturing, recording, and/or obtaining of light-field image data.
- camera 800 may include memory 811 for storing image data, such as output by image sensor 803 .
- memory 811 can include external and/or internal memory.
- memory 811 can be provided at a separate device and/or location from camera 800 .
- camera 800 may store raw light-field image data, as output by sensor 803 , and/or a representation thereof, such as a compressed image data file.
- memory 811 can also store data representing the characteristics, parameters, and/or configurations (collectively “configuration data”) of device 809 .
- captured image data is provided to post-processing circuitry 804 .
- Such circuitry 804 may be disposed in or integrated into light-field image data acquisition device 809 , as shown in FIG. 8A , or it may be in a separate component external to light-field image data acquisition device 809 , as shown in FIG. 8B . Such separate component may be local or remote with respect to light-field image data acquisition device 809 .
- Any suitable wired or wireless protocol can be used for transmitting image data 821 to circuitry 804 ; for example camera 800 can transmit image data 821 and/or other data via the Internet, a cellular data network, a WiFi network, a BlueTooth communication protocol, and/or any other suitable means.
- Light-field images often include a plurality of projections (which may be circular or of other shapes) of aperture 812 of camera 800 , each projection taken from a different vantage point on the camera's focal plane.
- the light-field image may be captured on sensor 803 .
- the interposition of microlens array 802 between main lens 813 and sensor 803 causes images of aperture 812 to be formed on sensor 803 , each microlens in array 802 projecting a small image of main-lens aperture 812 onto sensor 803 .
- These aperture-shaped projections are referred to herein as disks, although they need not be circular in shape.
- Light-field images include four dimensions of information describing light rays impinging on the focal plane of camera 800 (or other capture device).
- Two spatial dimensions (herein referred to as x and y) are represented by the disks themselves.
- Two angular dimensions (herein referred to as u and v) are represented as the pixels within an individual disk.
- the angular resolution of a light-field image with 100 pixels within each disk, arranged as a 10 ⁇ 10 Cartesian pattern is 10 ⁇ 10.
- This light-field image has a 4-D (x,y,u,v) resolution of (400, 300, 10, 10).
- FIG. 1 there is shown an example of a 2-disk by 2-disk portion of such a light-field image, including depictions of disks 102 and individual pixels 203 ; for illustrative purposes, each disk 102 is ten pixels 203 across.
- FIG. 2 there is shown an example of transmission of light rays 202 , including representative rays 202 A, 202 D, through microlens 201 B of array 802 , to illuminate sensor pixels 203 A, 203 B in sensor 803 .
- solid rays 202 A, 202 B, 202 C illuminate sensor pixel 203 A
- dashed rays 202 D, 202 E, 202 F illuminate sensor pixel 203 B
- the value at each sensor pixel 203 is determined by the sum of the irradiance of all rays 202 that illuminate it.
- That ray 202 may be chosen to be representative of all the rays 202 that illuminate that sensor pixel 203 , and is therefore referred to herein as a representative ray 202 .
- Such representative rays 202 may be chosen as those that pass through the center of a particular microlens 201 , and that illuminate the center of a particular sensor pixel 203 .
- rays 202 A and 202 D are depicted as representative rays; both rays 202 A, 202 D pass through the center of microlens 201 B, with ray 202 A representing all rays 202 that illuminate sensor pixel 203 A and ray 202 D representing all rays 202 that illuminate sensor pixel 203 B.
- sensor pixels 203 and their representative rays 202 There may be a one-to-one relationship between sensor pixels 203 and their representative rays 202 . This relationship may be enforced by arranging the (apparent) size and position of main-lens aperture 812 , relative to microlens array 802 , such that images of aperture 812 , as projected onto sensor 803 , do not overlap.
- FIG. 3 there is shown an example of an arrangement of a light-field capture device, such as camera 800 , wherein microlens array 802 is positioned such that images of a main-lens aperture 812 , as projected onto sensor 803 , do not overlap. All rays 202 depicted in FIG. 3 are representative rays 202 , as they all pass through the center of one of microlenses 201 to the center of a pixel 203 of sensor 803 .
- the 4-D light-field representation may be reduced to a 2-D image through a process of projection and reconstruction.
- FIG. 4 there is shown an example of such a process.
- a virtual surface of projection 401 may be introduced, and the intersection of each representative ray 202 with surface 401 is computed.
- Surface 401 may be planar or non-planar. If planar, it may be parallel to microlens array 802 and sensor 803 , or it may not be parallel. In general, surface 401 may be positioned at any arbitrary location with respect to microlens array 802 and sensor 803 .
- the color of each representative ray 202 may be taken to be equal to the color of its corresponding pixel.
- pixels 203 of sensor 803 may include filters arranged in a regular pattern, such as a Bayer pattern, and converted to full-color pixels. Such conversion can take place prior to projection, so that projected rays 202 can be reconstructed without differentiation. Alternatively, separate reconstruction can be performed for each color channel.
- the color of an image pixel 402 on projection surface 401 may be computed by summing the colors of representative rays 202 that intersect projection surface 401 within the domain of that image pixel 402 .
- the domain may be within the boundary of the image pixel 402 , or may extend beyond the boundary of the image pixel 402 .
- the summation may be weighted, such that different representative rays 202 contribute different fractions to the sum.
- Ray weights may be assigned, for example, as a function of the location of the intersection between ray 202 and surface 401 , relative to the center of a particular pixel 402 .
- Any suitable weighting algorithm can be used, including for example a bilinear weighting algorithm, a bicubic weighting algorithm and/or a Gaussian weighting algorithm.
- the system of the present invention corrects artifacts resulting from incorrect calibration of sensor 803 .
- Existing light-field cameras can experience artifacts resulting from incorrect calibration of sensors 803 .
- Each pixel 203 on sensor 803 is illuminated by actual rays 202 of light that pass through microlens array 802 .
- representative rays 202 as described above, are not actual rays of light, but are instead mathematical rays that are defined based on the geometric relationship of microlens array 802 and sensor 803 .
- microlens array 802 and pixels 203 on sensor 803 must be known to a sufficient degree of accuracy. If this relationship may vary from one sensor 803 to another, then calibration of each sensor 803 may serve to compensate for such variation. If the actual geometric relationship between microlens array 802 and sensor 803 differs from the (known) relationship indicated by calibration, images created by projecting the light field image may contain unwanted artifacts.
- Microlenses 201 and sensor pixels 203 are depicted in their calibrated geometric relationship—that is, as they are believed to be related.
- Representative rays 202 which pass through the calibrated microlens 201 centers and the centers of sensor pixels 203 , are depicted with solid lines.
- the actual position of microlens 201 B differs from the calibrated (expected) position.
- Actual light rays 501 that pass through the center of microlens 201 B, and also pass through the centers of certain sensor pixels 203 are depicted with dashed lines.
- microlens 201 B is centered at the point where the dashed lines representing actual light rays 501 intersect microlens 201 B, rather than (as depicted) the point where the solid (representative) rays 202 intersect it. In this example, these positions differ by a distance equal to one-eighth of the microlens pitch.
- One image artifact herein known as geometric distortion, may result from the difference between 1) the representative ray 202 assigned to a sensor pixel 203 and 2) the actual light ray 501 that passes through the center of that sensor pixel 203 and the true center of the microlens 201 associated with that sensor pixel 203 .
- This situation is illustrated by sensor pixel 203 A in FIG. 5 .
- the solid line passing through sensor pixel 203 A is the representative ray 202 A assigned to sensor pixel 203 A. It passes through the calibrated center of microlens 201 B, and through the center of sensor pixel 203 A.
- the dashed line passing through the center of sensor pixel 203 A is an actual light ray 501 A, which passes through the true center of microlens 201 B.
- the color of sensor pixel 203 A will be projected along the path specified by the (solid) representative ray 202 A passing through it. In actuality, however, light arrived at sensor pixel 203 A from light rays surrounding dashed ray 501 A, and should be projected along this path. This discrepancy between the projection and the actual light path causes artifacts.
- This distance will manifest as geometric distortion in the projected image, the magnitude of the distortion being proportional to the distance between virtual projection surface 401 and microlens array 802 . If projection to a range of surfaces 401 is animated (for example, as a focus sweep), regions of the resulting images in which calibration errors exist may sweep or twist across the field of view.
- a second form of distortion may also result from incorrect microlens-position calibration.
- ghosting is illustrated by sensor pixel 203 B in FIG. 5 .
- representative ray 202 B and actual light ray 501 B passing through sensor pixel 203 B follow different paths. Accordingly, geometric distortion, as described in the case of sensor pixel 203 A, will result.
- the difference between ray paths is much greater than for the rays that pass through sensor pixel 203 A, because the two rays pass through different microlens centers—the representative ray passing through the pre-calibration center of microlens 201 A, and the actual light ray passing through the true center of microlens 201 B.
- This difference causes light passing through microlens 201 B to be aggregated with light passing through sensor pixel 203 B.
- the effect in projected images is adjacent duplicates of image features; hence the term “ghosting”.
- Light field camera 800 may be designed so that small calibration errors result in geometric distortion, but do not cause ghosting. This may be accomplished, in at least one embodiment, by arranging the imaging geometry, including the geometry of sensor 803 and of the microlens array, so that disks 102 not only do not overlap, but are separated by a gap. Sensor pixels 203 are “assigned” to the nearest microlens 201 center, in calibrated coordinates, so gaps allow calibration errors up to half the gap size before a pixel's 203 assignment snaps to the incorrect microlens 201 . Such a technique limits or eliminates ghosting, since, until such snapping occurs, calibration errors may result in only geometric distortion, rather than ghosting.
- Microlens 201 positions can be difficult to measure directly. However, they may be inferred from pixel values in the light field image, which is readily available. Thus, in at least one embodiment, the key calibration problem is to identify the center of each disk 102 in the light field image.
- the center of a disk 102 is formally the point where a ray from the center of the exit pupil of the light field camera's 800 main lens 813 , which passes through the center of the corresponding microlens 201 , intersects sensor 803 . Assuming that the exit pupil is round, or nearly round, and that the light field image is a modulation image, the center of a disk 102 may be approximated as the weighted-center of pixels values illuminated by rays passing through the corresponding microlens 201 .
- x i is the x coordinate of the pixel's 203 center
- p i is the pixel's value
- x center is the x coordinate of the disk 102 center (that is being computed).
- either of two general approaches can be used to estimate the center of a disk 102 prior to computing it more exactly using these equations. In a first embodiment, either of the following methods are performed:
- a technique referred to as gridded calibration is performed.
- FIG. 14 there is shown an example of a method of gridded calibration, according to one embodiment.
- Each disk 102 in the light-field image is reduced 1401 to a roughly 2-pixel by 2-pixel point on a black background, using grayscale image erosion.
- a least-squares algorithm is applied 1402 to fit a small number of lines to the disk centers along orthogonal directions; these lines may be horizontal and vertical for a square grid, or at 60-degree angles for a hexagonal grid.
- Step 1402 may be implemented by fitting each line incrementally, first to a single disk center, then to additional disk centers at substantial incremental distances (for example, at 10-disk separations).
- disks from defective microlenses are also detected and ignored during the mapping in order to prevent inaccurate mapping.
- Defective disks can include, but are not limited to, those that are decentered by greater than half of the disk pitch or have low transmission.
- a rigid square or hexagonal grid (as appropriate) is fitted 1403 to the entire light field image.
- the corresponding disk center is computed 1405 by passing all values for pixels 203 within that grid region into the weighted-center equations.
- a vector distance is computed 1406 from the geometric center of the region to the computed disk center. This vector is assigned as the displacement associated with the corresponding disk center.
- a spatial filter is then applied 1407 to the spatial array of displacement vectors. Any of a number of known and suitable filters, such as Gaussian and Box, can be used. Optimizations such as bucketing may also be employed. In at least one embodiment, a square filter is employed.
- the final disk center is computed 1408 as the vector sum of the grid's geometric center and the filtered displacement vector.
- the method ends 1499 .
- FIG. 16 there is shown an example of gridded calibration in a hexagonal grid, according to one embodiment.
- a weighted center 1601 has been computed for each disk 102 .
- Application of grid 1602 (using, for example, a least-squares algorithm) yields ideal position 1603 for each disk 102 .
- a similar technique can be used for square grids.
- gridded calibration several steps of gridded calibration can be performed in parallel, allowing for efficient and high-performance implementation.
- the primary limitation of the above-described gridded calibration method is that only small errors (displacement-vector magnitude less than half the pitch of microlens array 802 ) may be computed accurately. If manufacturing tolerances cannot be held to this tight standard, gridded calibration may fail to compute a correct calibration.
- a second form of calibration may also operate on a modulation image, as is described in the above-cited related U.S. Provisional Application.
- Incremental calibration overcomes the primary shortcoming of gridded calibration, which is its inability to handle error vectors with magnitudes greater than half the microlens pitch. It does so by first calibrating a single disk, and then growing a region of calibrated disks around this initial disk, taking incremental (e.g., one-microlens) steps. As long as the relative error of adjacent disks remains below a (fairly large) threshold, the correct 1-to-1 mapping of pre-calibration and post-calibration disks is ensured. After all disk centers have been calibrated, the calibrated centers are filtered with steps equivalent to steps 1406 to 1408 described above, wherein the displacement vectors may have magnitudes greater than half the microlens pitch.
- Modulation images may vary as a function of camera parameters such as zoom, focus, and f-stop. Thus, in at least one embodiment, calibration is based on an appropriate modulation image.
- both gridded calibration and incremental calibration assume that the true center of a disk 102 corresponds to its pixel-weighted center. This may not be true in the case of vignetting, especially vignetting that is due to occlusion of the main-lens exit pupil. Such occlusion rarely occurs for disks 102 near the center of the light field image, but may be common for disks 102 near the edge (or, especially, the corner) of the light field image. Because such occlusion may vary slowly across the light field image, and may vary little from one camera of the same design to another, it may be modeled as an invariant field for cameras of the same design.
- Both algorithms may be modified to account for such occlusion vignetting by adding a step prior to step (5) in which each calibrated disk center is perturbed to account for vignetting, by 1) resampling the vignetting field (which may itself be defined as a regular pattern of displacement vectors), and adding the sampled displacement vector to the disk center.
- representative rays 202 that pass through the centers of pixels 203 which are themselves near the centers of disks 102 may be given more influence in the reconstructed 2-D image than representative rays that pass through pixels 203 that lie near the edge of disks 102 .
- An influence value may be assigned to each representative ray 202 . This influence value may be computed as a function of sensor-pixel location and of other parameters.
- each pixel 402 in the 2-D image may include an influence value, in addition to the values of its color components. During reconstruction, color components are multiplied by the filter coefficient (as described above) and also by the ray's influence value, before they are summed into the 2-D image pixel 402 .
- the product of the filter coefficient and the ray's 202 influence value is then summed to the 2-D pixel's influence value.
- the color components in each 2-D image pixel are normalized, meaning that they are divided by the 2-D pixel's influence value. After normalization of a pixel is complete, that pixel's influence value may be discarded.
- each representative ray's 202 influence value is set to the value of a corresponding pixel in the modulation image. This corresponding pixel is the pixel 203 through which the representative ray 202 passes.
- the influence value is determined based on a function that takes noise into account.
- a function that takes noise into account In the projection process, if all sensor pixels 203 ⁇ L i
- i 1, . . . , N ⁇ reaching the same image pixel 402 are assumed to come from the same physical point in the scene, and if they are equally affected by the optical and electrical system and thus have identical signal strength and noise level, an estimate of the pixel value of that image pixel 402 , say p, is
- sensor pixels 203 are demodulated to begin with.
- m i the modulation factor for i-th sample.
- m i can be obtained from the modulation image.
- the imaging system can apply an analog or digital gain factor g to the sensed signal, before storing pixel values in digital form.
- Each sensor pixel 203 may also be affected by noise N i .
- the task is to find the optimal estimate of p.
- the “optimality” of the estimate can be defined as the expected difference between the estimate and the true value.
- the noise characteristics of the system can be modeled.
- the system of the present invention can use other techniques for taking into account noise in determining influence for pixels 203 at different positions within disks 102 .
- Different techniques may be applicable for different imaging systems. For example, if a sensor pixel 203 is defective or is clamped due to saturation, there may be no way to infer the original pixel L i value from the corrupted data E i . In this case, the variance of this sensor pixel 203 can be modeled as infinite, and thus the influence would be zero. Alternatively, if there is no signal-dependent component in the noise, the optimal influence would be:
- Infilling may be implemented by first pulling 2-D image values up into an array of images of gradually reduced dimensions, then pushing values from these reduced-dimension images back down into the original 2-D image. Identifying the original 2-D image as image 0, each image n may have pixel dimensions that are half those of image n ⁇ 1. For example, if image 0 has dimensions w ⁇ h, then image 1 would have dimensions w/2 ⁇ h/2, and image 2 would have dimensions w/4 ⁇ h/4. (We visualize the reduced-dimension images as being stacked above image 0 in their indexed order, hence values are pulled up and pushed down.) The total number of images may be k+1 for any integer k such that both w/2 k and h/2 k are integer values.
- different ratios may exist between the pixel dimensions of adjacent image levels; thus, any n ⁇ n square of pixels in a given level can be combined into a single pixel in the next level up. For example, each 3 ⁇ 3 square of a level might be combined into an individual pixel in the next level up.
- the groups of pixels to be combined need not be squares; thus any group of pixels of any shape can be combined into a single pixel in the next level up.
- FIG. 10 there is shown a flow diagram depicting an example of a method for pulling 2-D image values up into array of images of gradually reduced dimensions, according to one embodiment.
- Pulling may proceed one image level at a time, such that all pixels in image n ⁇ 1 are pulled up to image n, before any pixels in image n are pulled up to image n+1.
- four pixels in level n ⁇ 1 are pulled to each single pixel in level n.
- each 2 ⁇ 2 block of pixels in image n ⁇ 1 corresponds to a single pixel in image n.
- a pixel in image n with coordinates [i,j] corresponds to pixels in image n ⁇ 1 with coordinates [2i,2j], [2i,2j+1], [2i+1,2j], and [2i+1,2j+1].
- Initial image (designated as image 1), is received 1001 .
- Steps 1002 to 1006 are performed for successively higher levels on images having successively reduced resolution.
- each pixel in image n is set to the sum of its corresponding pixels in image n ⁇ 1, so as to combine 1002 multiple values of pixels in the current-level image n ⁇ 1 into a single pixel value in the next-higher-level image n.
- each value within the pixel at a given level typically red, green, blue, and influence, takes the sum of the corresponding values in the corresponding pixels at a lower level.
- the sums in each pixel in image n are then normalized 1003 such that they represent average values of the corresponding pixels in image n ⁇ 1.
- This normalization may be accomplished by dividing each value by four, or may alternatively be implemented by dividing each value by the number of corresponding pixels in image n ⁇ 1 with non-zero influence values. (Division by zero may be avoided by not normalizing in this case.) Other normalization algorithms are also possible.
- a clamping algorithm may be applied 1004 to image n, as follows.
- a maximum pull influence I pull may be specified. For each pixel in image n, if I n (the influence value of that pixel) is greater than I pull , then each value in the pixel (including I n ) is multiplied by I pull /I n . Thus, the pixel's influence value is effectively set equal to I pull .
- Other clamping algorithms are possible.
- a low-pass filter may be applied 1005 to image n. Pulling proceeds one image level at a time, and is complete when all the pixels in image k have their final values. Thus, a determination is made 1006 as to whether the pull operation is complete, by determining whether all the pixels in image k have their final values. If so, image k is output 1007 and the method ends 1099 . Otherwise, the method returns to step 1002 .
- pushing down begins after pulling up is complete, working one image at a time, starting with image k and completing with image 1.
- Image k is received 1101 .
- Steps 1102 through 1105 are performed for successively lower levels on images having successively higher resolution.
- step 1102 for each pixel at the current level, target pixels in the next lower-level image are identified.
- the image-to-image pixel correspondence is the same as for pulling.
- each pixel in image n is pushed down to four pixels in image n ⁇ 1.
- each pixel-to-pixel push may be conditioned on a test. For example, the push may happen only if I n-1 , the influence value of the pixel in image n ⁇ 1, is less than a threshold influence value I push .
- a determination is made 1103 as to whether this condition is satisfied.
- each value v n-1 in the pixel in image n ⁇ 1 is replaced 1104 with a weighted sum of its value and the value of the pushed pixel in image n.
- pixel values v n-1 may be replaced as follows:
- v n - 1 v n - 1 ⁇ ( I n - 1 I push ) + v n ⁇ ( I n - 1 I push ) ( Eq . ⁇ 10 )
- Pushing down is complete when all pixels in image 1 have been (conditionally) pushed to image 0. If, in step 1105 , level 0 has not yet been reached, the push operation is not yet complete, and the method returns to step 1102 . If, in step 1105 , the push operation is complete, the color components in each image-0 pixel are normalized 1106 , meaning that they are divided by the image-0 pixel's influence value. After normalization 1106 of a pixel is complete, that pixel's influence value may be discarded. Image 0 can then be output 1107 , and the method ends 1199 .
- FIG. 6 there is shown an example of a pull-push image stack containing three levels: image 601 A at level 0, image 601 B at level 1, and image 601 E at level 2.
- image 601 A at level 0 image 601 A at level 0
- image 601 B at level 1 image 601 E at level 2.
- image 601 E image 601 E at level 2.
- each pixel 402 in each image n is pushed down to four pixels 402 in image n ⁇ 1.
- the value of single pixel 402 of image 601 C at level 2 is conditionally pushed to all four pixels 402 of image 601 B at level 1.
- the values of each of the four pixels 402 of image 601 C at level 2 is conditionally pushed to an associated group of four pixels of image 0, thus populating all sixteen pixels in level 0.
- a depth map is a set of image-side points (points on the image side of main lens 813 ), each of which corresponds to a visible point in the scene.
- a point in the scene is visible if light emitted from it reaches the anterior nodal point of main lens 813 , either directly or by being reflected from a highly specular surface.
- the correspondence is such that light emitted from the scene point would be in best focus by main lens 813 at the corresponding image-side point.
- the optical effects of microlens array 802 primarily refraction and reflection
- sensor 803 primarily occlusion
- the position of an image-side point in a depth map may be specified in Cartesian coordinates, with x and y indicating position as projected onto sensor 803 (x positive to the right, y positive up, when viewing toward the scene along the optical axis of main lens 813 ), and depth d indicating perpendicular distance from the surface of microlens array 802 (positive toward the scene, negative away from the scene).
- the units of x and y may be pixels—the pixel pitch of sensor 803 .
- the units of d may be lambdas, where a distance of one lambda corresponds to the distance along which a cone of light from any scene point changes its diameter by a value equal to the pitch of microlens array 802 . (The pitch of microlens array 802 is the average distance between the centers of adjacent microlenses 201 .)
- Depth maps are known in the art. See, for example: J. Sun, H.-Y. Shum and N.-N. Zheng, “Stereo Matching using Belief Propagation,” IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence , vol. 25, no. 7, pp. 787-800, 2003; and C.-K. Liang, T.-H. Lin, B.-Y. Wong, C. Liu, and H. Chen, “Programmable Aperture Photography: Multiplexed Light Field Acquisition,” ACM TRANS. GRAPH. 27, 3, Article 55, 2008.
- a depth map may be computed using techniques that are known in the art.
- the depth map may include image depth values at points with a regular distribution in x and y, and thus may be treated as a height field.
- the sample density of this height field, in the x and y dimensions, may roughly correspond to the distribution of microlens centers, or it may be greater or smaller.
- a depth value may be assigned to each representative ray 202 by intersecting that ray 202 with the image depth height field. If the representative ray 202 intersects the height field at multiple locations, the intersection that is farthest behind microlens 802 surface is selected. (This corresponds to the scene intersection that is nearest to camera 800 .) The depth value at this intersection is assigned to representative ray 202 . If there is no intersection, representative ray 202 may be discarded, or it may be assigned a depth value by another means. For example, it may be assigned a depth value computed from depth values assigned to nearby rays 202 .
- a ray 202 may intersect a height-field point if it passes within a threshold distance of that point.
- the height-field points may be interpreted as control points for a surface, and ray 202 can be intersected with that surface.
- representative rays 202 are intersected with virtual projection surface 401 that is parallel to microlens array 802 , but displaced from it. If virtual projection surface 401 is ahead of microlens array 802 (closer to the scene), then the reconstructed 2-D image is focused at a virtual projection surface 401 that is ahead of the best focus scene plane of the light-field camera 800 . (It is farther from the light-field camera 800 .) Likewise, if virtual projection surface 401 is behind microlens array 802 (farther from the scene) then the reconstructed 2-D image is focused at a virtual projection surface 401 that is behind the best-focus scene plane of the light-field camera 800 . Objects in the scene whose scene depths correspond to the image depth of virtual projection surface 401 are in exact focus; other objects in the scene are projected with blur that increases with their displacement from that scene depth.
- an image with extended depth of field may be desirable to construct an image with extended depth of field.
- this may be accomplished by projecting representative rays 202 to a (typically non-planar) image-side surface that corresponds to the depths of objects in the scene.
- the depth map height field as described in the previous section, is such a surface.
- the surface of projection may be non-planar, the resulting 2-D image is planar.
- [x,y] be the (calibrated) coordinates of the point that a representative ray intersects the microlens array
- [u,v] be the slopes of that ray as a function of depth.
- d be the depth assigned to that representative ray, as described above.
- the units of positions, slopes, and depth values be consistent with each other. (That is, if the units of x and y are x unit , and the units of depth are d unit , then the units of u and v are x unit /d unit .
- the units of x and y may be the pixel pitch of sensor 803
- the units of depth may be lambdas.
- the units of u and v are pixels/lambda.
- y′ y ⁇ dv (Eq. 12)
- Each projected representative ray now terminates at its plane of best focus and is associated with a new 2D spatial coordinate [x′,y′]. These 2D coordinates make up a reconstructed extended depth of field 2-D image.
- FIGS. 17 and 18 there is shown an example of extended depth-of-field projection according to one embodiment.
- Different representative rays 202 terminate at different planes 1701 of best focus.
- some of the rays 202 terminate at plane 1701 A, which is behind MLA plane 1702 ;
- other rays 202 terminate at plane 1701 B or 1701 C, which are ahead of MLA plane 1702 .
- Rays 202 terminating at plane 1701 A come from objects that are farther away from camera 800 ; these are represented with a positive lambda value (assuming lambda is calibrated with respect to MLA plane 1702 , which is assigned a lambda value of zero).
- Rays 202 terminating at plane 1701 B or 1701 C come from objects that are closer to camera 800 ; these are represented with a negative lambda value.
- the determination of which plane 1701 is of best focus for a particular representative ray 202 is specified by the depth map.
- the projections at different planes 1701 as generated in FIG. 17 are combined with one another to generate 2D output image 1801 A.
- the center of perspective is considered to be parallel to the optical axis (i.e., perpendicular to MLA plane 1702 ).
- output image 1801 A is generated from the superposition of the projections at different planes 1701 .
- Projections having lower lambda values are considered to be closer to camera 800 and are thus given precedence over projections having higher lambda values.
- the pixel values from the lower-lambda projection are used in generating 2D output image 1801 A.
- the projection at plane 1701 C overlaps a portion of the projection at plane 1701 A. Since the projection at plane 1701 C has a lower lambda value than does the projection at plane 1701 A, the portion 1802 C of output image 1801 A corresponding to the overlap takes its pixel values from the projection at plane 1701 C.
- Output image 1801 A thus has four portions:
- unstructured high frequency error (referred to herein as “noise”), may be present in varying amounts depending on many factors of the reconstructed image.
- the reconstructed images may be any 2D output image created from the light field, including but not limited to, image(s) having a different virtual plane of focus, image(s) having an extended depth of field image, and/or image(s) with shifted perspective.
- the noise in the 2D output image may vary depending on many factors related to processing, including, but not limited to, the distance between the virtual focus and the optical focus of the physical system, whether or not a subject is in-focus or out-of-focus at the virtual focus computed, and/or the type of 2D output image created.
- composition refers to one or more 2D image(s) intended to be viewed together
- varying amounts of noise may be considered more aesthetically displeasing than if the entire composition has a higher overall amount of noise that is more evenly distributed, or “normalized”.
- the noise content of the image(s) is analyzed, and some amount of noise is added to areas or images with lower noise in order to better match the portion of the image or other images with more noise.
- the result is that the entire composition of images may be normalized such that all images have a similar amount of noise that is evenly distributed throughout each image.
- the noise performance of the system is fully characterized as part of a calibration routine.
- FIG. 12A there is shown a flow diagram depicting an example of a method for noise calibration, according to one embodiment.
- the calibration data may be gathered 1201 by capturing light fields of a flat field under a variety of conditions, including but not limited to, differing exposure times and/or sensor gains.
- a variety of 2D output images are generated 1202 by varying the processing parameters; this generates, for example, images having different virtual plane(s) of focus, extended depth(s) of field, and/or perspective shift(s).
- the resulting images from this calibration are then analyzed 1203 for noise, and the results are recorded 1204 .
- the noise may be analyzed and characterized in any manner.
- a local area average is computed for each region in the image. Deviations from the local are average are recorded and classified by size (for example, number of pixels), magnitude, and frequency of occurrence.
- FIG. 12B there is shown a flow diagram depicting an example of a method for normalizing image noise, according to one embodiment.
- a method for normalizing image noise can be used, for example, when images are computed.
- an appropriate noise distribution is loaded 1205 based on the capture conditions.
- a noise ceiling distribution is generated 1206 from all the input noise and taking the highest frequency of occurrence for each magnitude and size.
- noise may be added 1207 to each computed 2D image, in proportion to the difference between the noise ceiling distribution and the noise distribution for the processing parameters.
- the proportion applied is equal to one, and the image set may be considered to have the noise fully normalized. In other cases, the proportion may be less than one, so that the noise content is more similar, but not fully normalized.
- any of a number of techniques can be used for varying the center of perspective for projected images.
- sub-aperture images are described in Ng et al. and in related U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 13/027,946 for “3D Light Field Cameras, Images and Files, and Methods of Using, Operating, Processing and Viewing Same”, filed on Feb. 15, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- representative rays 202 are culled, such that only rays 202 that pass through a contiguous sub-region of main lens aperture 812 are projected to the 2-D image.
- the contiguous sub-region of main-lens aperture 812 is referred to herein as a sub-aperture, and the resulting image is referred to as a sub-aperture image.
- the center of perspective of a sub-aperture image may be approximated as the center of the sub-aperture. Such a determination is approximate because the meaning of “center” is precise only if the sub-aperture is rotationally symmetric.
- the center of an asymmetric sub-aperture may be computed just as the center of gravity of an asymmetric object would be.
- the aperture of the main lens is rotationally symmetric, so that the center of perspective of a 2-D image that is projected with all representative rays 202 (i.e., the sub-aperture is equal to the aperture) is the center of main-lens aperture 812 , as would be expected.
- Sub-aperture projection works well in principle, but has limitations in practice. Because fewer rays are projected to the 2-D image, its resolution is reduced and its noise level is increased. Also, the range of possible centers of perspective is limited by the dimensions of the sub-aperture. Large sub-apertures project more rays, but their centers cannot deviate substantially from the center of main-lens aperture 812 . Small sub-apertures increase the allowable deviation of the center of perspective, but compromise the quality of the projected 2-D image.
- FIG. 19 there is shown an example of sheared EDOF projection.
- the center of perspective is not parallel to the optical axis. Pixel values are combined as described above in connection with FIG. 18 , although here the off-axis angle is taken into account.
- Collapsing the projections at different planes 1701 yields 2D output image 1801 B where each projection has been shifted horizontally depending on its lambda value (i.e., depending on its vertical distance from MLA plane 1702 ).
- Output image 1801 thus has four portions:
- output image 1801 B contains a gap, or hole 1901 , where there are no ray intersections and therefore no data is available.
- no projection maps to that area on MLA plane 1702 .
- Push-pull infilling can be used, as described above, to fill in pixel values in hole 1901 .
- another mechanism can be employed.
- the height field can be used to identify the holes, and then the holes can be filled with the image from sub-aperture projection.
- the above-described EDOF projection methods can introduce undesirable artifacts.
- samples with different depth values d may be projected to the same [x′,y′] intersection. Since those samples come from different objects, this means their colors are mixed and the contrast of the projection image is lost.
- a mechanism for detecting occlusions is applied, and occluded samples are rejected.
- the depth value of [x′,y′] in the depth map is compared to the depth value of the incoming samples; the sample is accepted only if the two depth maps are sufficiently close to one another.
- the depth map varies with u cop and v cop ; those depth maps of different u cop and v cop can be estimated jointly, or generated from analyzing the height field described above.
- disk-center calibration may be applied either during projection or as a warping of the projected 2-D image.
- change in center of perspective may be introduced during projection (as described in “Sub-Aperture Projection”, above, and in “Shearing the EDOF Projection”, below) or as a warping of the projected 2-D image.
- D(x,y) returns an estimate of the depth map value at location [x,y].
- the system and method of the present invention provide mechanisms for interactive projection of 2-D images with varying center of perspective. For example, a person may view the 2-D image on a screen, adjust the desired center of perspective by moving a mouse or other input device, and see the effects of that motion immediately on the screen, as a sequence of 2-D images with different centers of perspective.
- the range of motion of the center of perspective may be limited to the entrance pupil of the main-lens 813 of light-field camera 800 .
- the diameter of the entrance pupil (assuming a circular aperture) cannot be larger than the physical diameter of lens 813 , and will typically be somewhat smaller.
- the range of motion of the center of perspective may be small in comparison to objects in the scene being photographed.
- FIG. 15 there is shown a flow diagram depicting an example of a method of interactive projection of 2-D images with varying center of perspective, according to one embodiment.
- the depicted method operates as follows to create the impression that the center of perspective is moving more than it is.
- the 2-D image is scaled 1501 to be somewhat larger than the screen (or the window on the screen) that it is being displayed in, such that only a window-sized sub-region of the 2-D image may be viewed at any moment.
- the range of motion of the 2-D image is defined 1502 , relative to the screen, as the maximum allowed while ensuring that the image is visible at all locations of the screen. Thus, the edges of the 2-D image remain out of view.
- the position of the 2-D image is coupled 1503 , relative to the screen, with the position of the center of perspective, such that full-range motion of the center of perspective corresponds to full-range motion of the 2-D image.
- the coupling may be linear or non-linear.
- the polarity of the coupling may ensure that, for example, when the center of perspective is at its lower-left extreme (in the coordinates of the viewer), the lower-left corner of the 2-D image is visible.
- step 1506 additional user input is received, the method returns to step 1504 . Otherwise, the method ends 1599 .
- FIG. 7 there is shown an example of exaggerated center-of-perspective movement, according to one embodiment.
- the Figure depicts the display of an unscaled 2-D image 702 (containing object 703 ) in an on-screen window 701 .
- the size of window 701 is the same as the size of 2-D image 702 , so there is no room for movement to give the impression of a change in the center of perspective.
- object 703 changes in appearance at the center of perspective shifts from the lower left to the upper right, there is no change in the position of object 703 within window 701 .
- 2-D image 702 has been scaled to 1.25 times the size of window 701 .
- a portion of 2-D image 702 is outside window 701 and is not visible. This allows for a range of movement of 2-D image 702 with respect to window 701 , giving the impression of a change in the center of perspective.
- object 703 moves within the displayed window 701 to reinforce the change in center of perspective.
- Hand-held devices such as mobile phones and tablets, often include accelerometers to measure the magnitude and direction of an instantaneous acceleration vector, including the effect of gravity. If the device is held still, except for slow changes to its orientation, the accelerometers provide an accurate indication of the direction of gravity relative to the device, and thus of the tilt of the device.
- the measured time-varying tilt angle of a device is used to vary the center of perspective of a light-field picture being projected to a screen on the device.
- Any of a number of algorithms can be used to convert the time-varying tilt angle to parametric specification of the 2-D image projection.
- the u cop and v cop from Equations 15 and 16 can be mapped to the tilt angle output by the accelerometer on the device.
- the accelerometer output can be linearly or quadratically scaled for effect.
- tilt angles are coupled in a directly proportional manner to the position of the center of perspective. For example, tilting to the left or right controls left or right displacement of the center of perspective, respectively; forward-backward tilt controls forward or backward displacement of the center of perspective, respectively.
- inertia is introduced, so that changes in tilt angle are not coupled directly to the position of the center of perspective; rather a previous position is taken into account, so that changes to the position are effectively damped.
- the introduction of inertia adds smoothness to the response.
- the slide show may be viewed on any type of digital display, including, for example a display associated with a computer, tablet computer, laptop computer, mobile phone, television, and/or any other type of display.
- the perspective in displaying a slideshow, the perspective may be automatically changed to produce more engaging effects.
- the display may automatically zoom in on the image, and then pan across the image.
- Such operations may be performed in an automated manner, either according to specifications provided by an author of a slideshow, or based on default settings.
- the perspective While panning, the perspective may be changed in tandem with the pan. With the pan and perspective change synchronized, an effect similar to viewing a scene while moving one's head may be created.
- the change in perspective is performed in a manner that is consistent with the pan. In at least one embodiment, this effect is accomplished using the method described above in connection with FIG. 15 , although instead of responding to user input, shifts in the center of perspective are performed automatically based on the desired effect for the slide show.
- any number of images having different centers of perspective can be pre-computed and stored in a cache. Such a technique is useful, for example, when the processing power of the playback device is insufficient for on-the-fly generation of such images.
- the system can retrieve images as needed from the cache. If a desired center of perspective is not available in the cache, in at least one embodiment, the system can retrieve two or more images having centers of perspective close to the desired center of perspective in the cache file, and interpolate or blend them together to generate an image that approximates the desired center of perspective. Images from the cache file can also be used in connection with techniques for sharing images, such as those described in related U.S. Utility application Ser. No.
- images in the cache file can be shared in lieu of (or in addition to) sharing the light-field picture.
- the number of images to be stored in the cache file is determined based, at least in part, on the particular characteristics of the image content.
- a particular scene may dictate storage of more (or fewer) images based on, for example, the depth variation of the scene being depicted. For example, if the scene is a flat wall, it is sufficient to store only one image in the cache, because all images of different perspective are identical. By contrast, images having greater amounts of depth variation of the scene, more images can be stored so as to avoid artifacts that may result from insufficient images in the cache. Such an approach improves overall quality, while avoiding overtaxing resources such as preprocessing time and storage space by pre-computing more images than necessary.
- the number of images to be stored, and their centers of perspective are determined from the depth map and/or image content.
- FIG. 20 there is shown an example of a distribution of centers of perspective 2000 within a bounding aperture 812 , according to one embodiment, wherein an image for each center of perspective 2000 has been pre-computed and stored in a cache.
- a hexagonal grid is used, and the range of [u cop , v cop ] is limited to the range of aperture 812 .
- Central center of perspective 2000 A is an on-axis point of view, while all others are off-axis by an amount indicated by the distance from that center of perspective 2000 and central center of perspective 2000 A.
- the spacing L in-between neighboring centers of perspective 2000 can be chosen such that the disparity of an object with certain depth D T is below some threshold T: L
- D T can be computed in various ways, like the maximal absolute value in the depth map. Given the grid structure, range, and L, the number of the centers of perspective their values can be calculated. In at least one embodiment, the lower bound of L can be constrained to limit the maximal number of images in the cache file.
- images generated from a light-field picture may be presented to a viewer in an interactive manner.
- a set of images computed using a set of virtual focal planes may be animated to change the focus.
- it may help to understand which objects and/or subjects are salient to viewers and which are not.
- an interactive image may include an automatically generated animation.
- a user can interactively change the image (for example, by clicking on an area of the image to select the best focus for that object).
- the automatic animation may execute until the user attempts to directly interact with the image (for example, by clicking a mouse); at that point, the animation stops and the user controls the interaction.
- the automatic animation may be guided by user input.
- user actions are recorded (for example, each click of the mouse and the location of the click) and stored (for example, in a database).
- the automatic animation is generated, the user action data is analyzed and used to create an animation that is aesthetically pleasing to users.
- a series of images referred to as a refocus stack, each corresponding to a different virtual focal plane, is made publicly available on the Internet.
- This set of images also includes a mapping of location to the image containing the best focus for the location.
- the click and location are recorded to a database.
- the animation may be generated by selecting the three most popular locations on the image, and cycling the focus through these three positions on some interval (for example, one second at each position, followed by a 0.5-second transition). In this manner, an animation is automatically generated based on the recorded user interactions.

- f is a 2-degree polynomial of x and y.
- the modified equations change the constant refocusing depth to a smooth spatially-variant field. This allows the image to be refocused to different depths for different regions. Distortion can thereby be corrected by matching the shape of the field to the particular field curvature indicated by the characteristics of the capture equipment.

Description
-
- aggregated irradiance: total irradiance over a period of time, e.g., on a sensor pixel while the shutter is open.
- anterior nodal point: the nodal point on the scene side of a lens.
- automatic white balance (AWB): the process of computing white-balance (WB) factors and estimating color of a scene's illumination.
- Bayer pattern: a particular 2×2 pattern of different color filters above pixels on a digital sensor. The filter pattern is 50% green, 25% red and 25% blue.
- center of perspective: relative to a scene being photographed, the center of perspective is the point (or locus of points) where light is being captured. Relative to the camera's sensor image, it is the point (or locus of points) from which light is being emitted to the sensor. For a pinhole camera, the pinhole is the center of perspective for both the scene and the sensor image. For a camera with a more complex main lens, the scene-relative center of perspective may be best approximated as either the anterior nodal point of the main lens, or the center of its entrance pupil, and the sensor-relative center of perspective may be best approximated as either the posterior nodal point of the main lens, or as the center of its exit pupil.
- clamp: in the context of the described invention, to “clamp a signal to a value” means to select the smaller of the signal value and the clamp value.
- chrominance: a mapping of color channel values to a lower (typically n−1) space.
- CoP: abbreviation for center of perspective.
- demosaicing: a process of computing and assigning values for all captured color channels to each pixel, especially when that pixel initially includes a value for only one color channel.
- disk: a region in a light-field image that is illuminated by light passing through a single microlens; may be circular or any other suitable shape.
- entrance pupil: the image of the aperture of a lens, viewed from the side of the lens that faces the scene.

- light-field image: an image that contains a representation of light field data captured at the sensor.
- luminance: a 1-component reduction of color that corresponds to perceived brightness or intensity.
- microlens: a small lens, typically one in an array of similar microlenses.
- MLA: abbreviation for microlens array.
- modulation image: an image that is computed from a flat-field image by normalizing based on average values (per color channel).
- nodal point: the center of a radially symmetric thin lens. For a lens that cannot be treated as thin, one of two points that together act as thin-lens centers, in that any ray that enters one point exits the other along a parallel path.
- normalized pixel value: a sensor pixel value that has been adjusted to a range where 0.0 corresponds to black (no light) and 1.0 corresponds to saturation.
- posterior nodal point: the nodal point on the image side of a lens.

- 1. Grayscale image erosion is performed. Referring now to
FIG. 13 , there is shown an example of a method of grayscale image erosion, according to one embodiment. Grayscale image erosion is a morphological image processing technique that is well known in the art. A singlemorphological step 1301 revalues eachpixel 203 in the image as a function of its pre-step value and the pre-step values of neighboringpixels 203. This serves to reduce (erode) the values ofpixels 203 that are on the edge of groups of high-value pixels 203. A determination is made 1303 as to whether sufficient erosion has taken place; if not,step 1301 is repeated. Repeatederosion steps 1301 reliably reduce the light field image to a pattern of 2×2-pixel illuminated regions (disks), with interstitial pixel values reduced (nearly) to zero. After erosion is complete 1399, these 2×2-pixel blocks can be identified, and their centers can be evaluated. (The equations given above reduce to linear interpolation for a 2×2-pixel block.) - 2. An alternative method is referred to as “stepping”. According to this method, a disk's 102 center is estimated by taking a grid step from the center of an accurately calibrated disk center. In a square tiling of
microlenses 201, a grid step changes either x or y by the known microlens pitch. In a hexagonal tiling ofmicrolenses 201, a grid step changes x and y in one of six directions, such that the distance moved is equal to the microlens pitch.

- 1. Projection. Once calibrated
representative rays 202 have been computed, they may be projected as described above.Representative rays 202 may be computed from calibrated disk centers in at least two different ways:- a. Perspective. For each
disk 102, the correspondingmicrolens 201 center may be computed by casting aray 202 from the disk center to the center of the main-lens exit pupil, and then finding the intersection of thisray 202 with the surface ofmicrolens array 802. Truerepresentative rays 202 for eachpixel 402 in the light field image may then be determined as theray 202 that extends from the correspondingmicrolens 201 center through the center of thesensor pixel 203. - b. Orthographic. Each
disk 102 may be treated as though it is at the center ofmicrolens array 802, or equivalently, that its center is coincident with the optical axis ofmain lens 813. In this approximation, disk centers and microlens centers are the same in two coordinates; they differ only in the dimension that is parallel to the main lens optical axis. Equivalently, for eachdisk 102, the corresponding microlens center may be computed by casting aray 202 from the disk center directly up towardmicrolens array 802, and then finding the intersection of thisray 202 with the surface ofmicrolens array 802. Orthographicrepresentative rays 202 for eachimage pixel 402 in the light field image may then be found as the ray that extends from the correspondingmicrolens 201 center through the center of thesensor pixel 203. - c. Warping. Projection may also be computed using
representative rays 202 that pass through pre-calibration microlens centers. In this case, regions in the image will be distorted as a predictable function of their depth. A depth map may be computed using techniques that are known in the art. Using this depth map, and the known divergence between corrected and uncorrectedrepresentative rays 202, a distortion vector may be estimated for eachpixel 402 in the projected image. The projected image may than be warped to correct this distortion at eachpixel 402. This algorithm may be used to correct geometric distortion.

- Points at scene depths on the plane of best focus in the scene correspond to an image depth at the (microlens) surface, or plane, of
sensor 803. - Points at scene depths that are farther from
camera 800 than the plane of best focus correspond to points with image depths that are closer to themain lens 802 than the plane of best focus, and therefore that have positive depth values. - Points at scene depths that are nearer to the
camera 800 than the plane of best focus correspond to points with image depths that are further from themain lens 802 than the plane of best focus, and therefore that have negative depth values.
- Points at scene depths on the plane of best focus in the scene correspond to an image depth at the (microlens) surface, or plane, of
