- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method and system of job search in a geo-spatial environment.
- Job search engines are websites that facilitate job hunting.
- the job search engines may allow users to store resumes on the site and/or submit the resumes to potential employers.
- employers may post job listings and/or search for potential employees on the job search engines.
- the job search engine may encompass a variety of occupations and/or job types or serve a niche market, such as engineering, legal services, insurance, social work, and/or teaching.
- the job search engines may cater to a specific geographic region, level of education, and/or skill level.
- the job search engines may include separate interfaces for candidates and employers.
- the candidates may be allowed to perform functions such as browsing and/or searching for job listings, posting, editing, and/or updating of resumes and/or cover letters, updating user profiles and preferences, contacting potential employers. submitting resumes and/or cover letters to the potential employers, etc.
- the employers may post, edit, and/or update job listings, access posted resumes and/or cover letters, search resumes for matches with job listings, contact candidates, etc.
- the job search engines may be implemented by traditional job boards.
- a job board may provide job search capabilities for the candidates and the employers to find desired positions and the potential employees, respectively.
- the job search engines may be implemented to search across multiple job boards.
- Other job search engines may index directly from the employers' websites, thus bypassing traditional job boards altogether and/or allowing the candidates to find new positions that may not be advertised on the traditional job boards.
- the candidates and/or the employers may still have difficulty finding an ideal match for a position.
- the candidates may not adequately find ideal positions using typical search parameters offered by the job search engines.
- the candidates may seek positions within a certain commute distance and/or time from home.
- the ideal commute distance and/or time for a candidate may be based on a number of factors, such as traffic conditions, mode of transportation, cost of transportation, willingness to devote time to commuting, etc.
- current job search methods may be limited to returning results from a particular city, region, and/or state. As a result, the candidates may have difficulty using the job search engines to find positions that alleviate problems associated with commuting to work.

Abstract
Description
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method and system of job search in a geo-spatial environment.
- Job search engines are websites that facilitate job hunting. The job search engines may allow users to store resumes on the site and/or submit the resumes to potential employers. Similarly, employers may post job listings and/or search for potential employees on the job search engines. The job search engine may encompass a variety of occupations and/or job types or serve a niche market, such as engineering, legal services, insurance, social work, and/or teaching. In addition, the job search engines may cater to a specific geographic region, level of education, and/or skill level.
- The job search engines may include separate interfaces for candidates and employers. The candidates may be allowed to perform functions such as browsing and/or searching for job listings, posting, editing, and/or updating of resumes and/or cover letters, updating user profiles and preferences, contacting potential employers. submitting resumes and/or cover letters to the potential employers, etc. The employers may post, edit, and/or update job listings, access posted resumes and/or cover letters, search resumes for matches with job listings, contact candidates, etc.
- The job search engines may be implemented by traditional job boards. For example, a job board may provide job search capabilities for the candidates and the employers to find desired positions and the potential employees, respectively. Alternatively, the job search engines may be implemented to search across multiple job boards. Other job search engines may index directly from the employers' websites, thus bypassing traditional job boards altogether and/or allowing the candidates to find new positions that may not be advertised on the traditional job boards.
- Despite the development of specialized and/or indexed job search engines, the candidates and/or the employers may still have difficulty finding an ideal match for a position. In other words, the candidates may not adequately find ideal positions using typical search parameters offered by the job search engines. For example, the candidates may seek positions within a certain commute distance and/or time from home. The ideal commute distance and/or time for a candidate may be based on a number of factors, such as traffic conditions, mode of transportation, cost of transportation, willingness to devote time to commuting, etc. However, current job search methods may be limited to returning results from a particular city, region, and/or state. As a result, the candidates may have difficulty using the job search engines to find positions that alleviate problems associated with commuting to work.
- A method and system of job search in a geo-spatial environment are disclosed. In one aspect, a method of conducting a job search includes obtaining candidate data (e.g., name, resume, cover letter, experience level, education level, and/or employment preference, etc.) corresponding to a job search profile, determining a location associated with the job search profile (e.g., may be a non-residential location) based on the candidate data, storing the job search profile in a candidate repository, processing a search request from a user associated with the job search profile, obtaining a search radius associated with the location (e.g., may be a distance from the location and/or a commute time from the location) from the user, obtaining at least one employer profile based on the search radius, and displaying the employer profile to the user on a geo-spatial map.
- The method may further include obtaining a search parameter from the user, and obtaining the employer profile based on the search radius and the search parameter (e.g., job category, job type, keyword, salary range, experience level, and/or education level, etc.).
- In another aspect, a community network includes a candidate repository including a plurality of job search profiles, an employer repository including a plurality of employer profiles (e.g., may include employer name, employer description, location, education level, experience level, job title, job description, compensation, and/or candidate preference, etc.), a geo-spatial repository including a plurality of locations on a geo-spatial map, and a job management module configured to determine a first of the locations associated with one of the job search profiles (e.g., may include name, resume, cover letter, experience level, education level, and/or employment preference, etc.), process a search request from a first user associated with the one of the job search profiles, obtain a first search radius associated with the first of the locations (e.g., may be a distance from the location and/or a commute time from the first of the locations) from the first user, obtain the employer profiles based on the first search radius, and display the employer profiles to the first user on the geo-spatial map.
- The job management module may be further configured to obtain a first search parameter (e.g., may include job category, job type, keyword, salary range, experience level, and/or education level, etc.) from the first user, and obtain the employer profiles based on the first search radius and the first search parameter.
- In addition, the job management module may be configured to determine a second of the locations associated with one of the employer profiles, process a search request from a second user associated with the one of the employer profiles, obtain a second search radius associated with the second of the locations from the second user, obtain the job search profiles based on the second search radius, and display the job search profiles to the second user on the geo-spatial map. The job management module may also be configured to obtain a second search parameter from the second user, and obtain the job search profiles based on the second search radius and the second search parameter.
- In yet another aspect, a method of conducting a job candidate search includes obtaining employer data (e.g., may include employer name, employer description, location, education level, experience level, job title, job description, compensation, and/or candidate preference, etc.) corresponding to an employer profile, determining a location associated with the employer profile based on the employer data, storing the employer profile in an employer repository, processing a search request from a user associated with the employer profile, obtaining a search radius associated with the location (e.g., may be a distance from the location and/or a commute time from the first of the locations) from the user, obtaining at least one of the job search profile based on the search radius, and displaying the job search profile to the user on a geo-spatial map.
- The method may further include obtaining a search parameter (e.g., may include job category, job type, keyword, salary range, experience level, and/or education level) from the user, and obtaining the job search profile based on the search radius and the search parameter.
- The methods, systems, and apparatuses disclosed herein may be implemented in any means for achieving various aspects, and may be executed in a form of a machine-readable medium embodying a set of instructions that, when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform any of the operations disclosed herein. Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.

In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It will be evident, however to one skilled in the art that the various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.
- In one embodiment, a method of conducting a job search includes obtaining candidate data (e.g., using the
candidate repository 114 ofFIG. 1 ) corresponding to a job search profile (e.g., thejob search profile 300 ofFIG. 3 ), determining a location associated with thejob search profile 300 based on the candidate data, and storing thejob search profile 300 in a candidate repository (e.g., thecandidate repository 114 ofFIG. 1 ). The method includes processing a search request from a user (e.g., candidate) associated with thejob search profile 300, obtaining a search radius (e.g., the search radius 204 ofFIG. 2A ) associated with the location from the user, obtaining an employer profile (e.g., theemployer profile 400 ofFIG. 4 ) based on the search radius 204, and displaying the employer profile 400 (e.g., using thejob management module 108 ofFIG. 1 ) to the user on a geo-spatial map (e.g., the geo-spatial map 200 ofFIG. 2A ). - In another embodiment, a community network (e.g., the
community network 102 ofFIG. 1 ) includes acandidate repository 114 including a number of job search profiles (e.g., thejob search profile 300 ofFIG. 3 ), an employer repository (e.g., theemployer repository 112 ofFIG. 1 ) including a number of employer profiles (e.g., theemployer profile 400 ofFIG. 4 ), and a geo-spatial repository (e.g., the geo-spatial repository 110 ofFIG. 1 ) including a number of locations on a geo-spatial map 200. - The
community network 102 also includes a job management module (e.g., thejob management module 108 ofFIG. 1 ) configured to determine a first location associated with ajob search profile 300, process a search request from a first user (e.g., candidate) associated with thejob search profile 300, obtain a first search radius (e.g., the search radius 204 ofFIG. 2A ) associated with the first locations from the first user, obtain the employer profile (e.g., theemployer profile 400 ofFIG. 4 ) based on the first search radius 204, and display theemployer profile 400 to the first user on the geo-spatial map 200. - In yet another embodiment, a method of conducting a job candidate search includes obtaining employer data (e.g., the
employer name 402, thelocation 404, theeducation 406, and/orexperience 408, etc.) corresponding to an employer profile (e.g., theemployer profile 400 ofFIG. 4 ), determining a location associated with theemployer profile 400 based on the employer data, storing theemployer profile 400 in an employer repository (e.g., the employer repository 1 12 ofFIG. 1 ), processing a search request from a user (e.g., employer) associated with theemployer profile 400, obtaining a search radius (e.g., the search radius 204 ofFIG. 2 ) associated with the location from the user, obtaining a job search profile (e.g., thejob search profile 300 ofFIG. 3 ) based on the search radius 204, and displaying the job search profile 300 (e.g., using thejob management module 108 ofFIG. 1 ) to the user on a geo-spatial map 200. -
FIG. 1 is a system view of acommunity network 102 enabling a job search and a candidate search on a geo-spatial map (e.g., the geo-spatial map 200 ofFIGS. 2B and 2C), according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 1 illustrates thecommunity network 102, acommunity 104,members 106A-N, ajob management module 108, a geo-spatial repository 110, anemployer repository 112 and acandidate repository 114, according to one embodiment. - The
community network 102 may be a network formed by an association of themembers 106A-N in thecommunity 104. Thecommunity 104 may refer to a group ofmembers 106A-N located in a specific geographic region. Themembers 106A-N may include individuals (e.g., employers, candidates, etc.) searching for desired positions and/or potential employees. Themembers 106A-N may be connected with each other through thecommunity network 102. In one or more embodiments, the member 106 of thecommunity network 102 performing any one of a job search and a candidate search is referred as a user (e.g., candidate, employer). - The
job management module 108 may enable a job search and/or a candidate search based on a search parameter and/or a search radius (e.g., the search radius 204 ofFIGS. 2A , 2B and 2C). In addition, thejob management module 108 may obtain and/or display profiles (e.g., thejob search profile 300, theemployer profile 400, etc.) to users (e.g., employer, candidate, consultants, etc.) on the geo-spatial map 200. For example, the job search may include obtaining and displaying an employer profile(s) (e.g., the employer profiles 400 ofFIG. 4 ) based on a search request of a candidate. In addition, the candidate search may include obtaining and displaying a job search profile(s) (e.g., thejob search profile 300 ofFIG. 3 ) to an employer (e.g., based on a search request of the employer). - In one example embodiment, the search request may be a request made by the member 106 (e.g., anyone of the employer and candidate) based on the search parameters (e.g., job category, job type, and/or experience, etc.) and/or the search radius 204. For example, the search radius 204 may be a geographical distance through which a location of the candidate and the employer are separated.
