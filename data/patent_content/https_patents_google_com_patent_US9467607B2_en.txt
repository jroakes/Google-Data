- light field sensor 14 of light field data acquisition device 10 may sub-sample and/or down-sample the light field image by storing, reading, sampling and/or obtaining a subset of pixels associated with each disk image, optionally combining or filtering their values, and aggregating the light field data in and/or generating an image array in order to construct an image which is lower-resolution relative to images generated using more or all of the light field data acquired by light field sensor 14 .
- the lower resolution image (which may be generated more rapidly than a higher resolution image using more of the light field image data) may be provided to the user interface 36 for display to the user or operator during the live-view process.
- the subset of pixels of each disk may be those pixels near the center regions of disk images, for example, the center 50% of the pixels.
- the pixel nearest to the center of each microlens “disk image” may be selected and a small live-view frame may be computed where the value for each pixel in the live view frame is the value of the pixel nearest the center of the corresponding “disk image”.

- c. Microlens having a predetermined resolution, for example, a resolution determined using one or more of the techniques of using a human face or other selected, desired or predetermined object or subject as the field of view size of a predetermined refocusable distance (for example, a closest refocusable distance). The microlens array may correspond to, for example, an array of convex, image-forming lenses, and it may be positioned between the main lens and the image sensor at a separation from the sensor surface of approximately the focal length of each microlens in the microlens array.

Light Field Data Acquisition Device Optics
-
- Let m equal the distance between the centers of two neighboring microlenses in the microlens array (in millimeters).
- Let N equal the number of sensor pixels across a microlens disk image that is formed through the microlens on the sensor, or are located under a microlens.
- Let F#optics equal the F-number of the main lens.
- Let F#MLA equal the F-number of the microlens array.
- Let Nusable equal the number of pixels containing usable directional information across a microlens disk image that appears or are located under a microlens. In the case where the F-numbers of the main lens and microlens array are equal or nearly equal, Nusable may equal N. In cases where the F-numbers are not equal or near equal, Nusable may be less than N. In some embodiments, Nusable may be calculated by:
N usable =N*min(F# MLA /F# optics,2.0−F# MLA /F# optics)
b=ε/(F# optics)
Thus, expressing ε as a function of b gives the maximum distance that the sensor can be placed from the desired image plane to permit the object to be brought into a predetermined focus using a light field processing technique:
ε=b(F# optics)
To produce a refocused image, the maximum blur size b that may be overcome by post acquisition refocusing of the light field image data (via processing circuitry) may be characterized approximately as follows:
b=KN usable m,
such that
ε=KN usable m(F# optics)
where K is a constant factor that may vary depending on various factors (for example, the manufacturing process and/or the desired output resolution), and will be discussed later herein.
Microlens F#=f/T micro→Main lens F#=f/T main
-
- where: M is the magnification, and Tmain=Tmicro/(1+M).
-
- the closest fixed-focus position; and/or
- the fixed-focus position that provides, allows and/or permits refocusing the furthest towards infinity, such that the imaged object's in-focus plane is within the refocusing range of that fixed-focus position.
OP AF =OP LF−ε
Notably, in this specific embodiment, the subject of the autofocus may be placed at the far end of the designated refocusing range.
-
- Use the mean image plane location; and/or
- Use the image plane location which permits refocusing to the greatest number of in-focus image locations.
NumPositions=ROUND-UP(Focal plane separation/(ε1+ε2)),
Where ROUND-UP is a mathematical function taking one argument and returning the smallest integer larger than the given argument. Notably, the formula above may construct focus positions such that each potential focal depth may be within the refocusing range of one focus position. In some embodiments, the number of focus positions may be greater to allow overlapping zones of focus.
-
- Let WMLA equal the width of the microlens array, in number of lens elements
- Let Woutput equal the width of the refocused image, in number of pixels
Determine ε such that:
where C is a constant. In some embodiments, 0.7≦C≦3. In these embodiments, minimum and maximum values for ε are established based on the intended resolution of images computed from light fields captured by the device.
ε=KN usable m(F# optics)
In some embodiments, a minimum value for ε may be established at the point where the diameter of the optical blur on the light field sensor from rays originating at optical infinity is at least m (the diameter of a microlens). In these embodiments, b≧m, which, solving for K, leads to:
b≧m
ε=b(F# optics)
ε=KN usable m(F# optics)
Thus,
K≧1/N usable
Notably, as the diameter of the blur introduced by misfocus at this separation equals the size of a microlens diameter, the optical depth of field of the optics with respect to the light field sensor may be considered to end nearer to the device than optical infinity. In other embodiments, a minimum value for ε may be established at the point where the diameter of the optical blur on the light field sensor from rays originating at optical infinity is at most Nusable*m, which may allow refocusing with detail maintained to approximately the resolution of the microlens array. In these embodiments, K≦1.0. In one exemplary embodiment, 1/Nusable≦K≦1.0. In a specific exemplary embodiment, K=0.6.

- Use a main lens design in which the exit pupil's size and position does not change with zoom and/or focus. One example of this design is to have static (non-moving) lens elements between the aperture of the light field data acquisition device and the sensor thereof, with all moving lens elements between the aperture and the scene (outside World).

- Determine the geometric parameters, starting with known values, including pixel size, microlens size, pixel pattern, and microlens grid pattern.
- Find the center of an initial light field disk image, by maximizing the value of a search function.
- In one search function, a series of potential microlens centers are tested (for example, a grid spaced at ¼ pixel increments).
- For each potential center, a spatial filter may be applied (for example, a cubic filter with a positive area equal to the expected area of a light field disk image.
- The potential center with the largest score may be selected as the center of the microlens element.
- Estimate the location of a neighboring light field disk center using the previously determined center and the known parameters (pixel size, microlens size, and grid patterns).
- Determine the center of the neighboring light field disk center using the estimated center and by maximizing the value of a localized search function (for example, as described above).
- Continue finding light field disk centers by estimation and search function (as in the previous 2 steps) until enough centers are located (for example, all centers or all centers inside a 500 pixel border).
- Use the centers located to create a geometric model that is a good fit for the determined data.
- In one embodiment, the light field disk image grid pattern (for example, rotation and separation of light field disk image grid coordinates) and offsets (for example, the X and Y offset from the center pixel to a light field disk image grid coordinate).
In some embodiments, the geometric model determined from calibration is used when computing refocused images. (See, for example, Ren Ng's PhD dissertation, “Digital Light Field Photography”, Stanford University 2006, U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/170,620, entitled “Light Field Camera Image, File and Configuration Data, and Method of Using, Storing and Communicating Same”, filed Apr. 18, 2009.

- Focus analysis: for a given image region (e.g., a face) determine where it is in focus; and/or
- Focus analysis: for a given image region at a certain focus depth, determine how in-focus (or the degree of focus) the image or region thereof is.
-
- A face detection method is used on each image in the stack.
- If one of more focused faces are detected in an image, then the measure of importance is the area of the focused faces in the image.
- If no faces are detected in the image, then the measure of importance is the area of the image that is in-focus.
Interaction for User-Guided Focus
-
- Selection of which objects/subjects to focus on, for example by clicking on the desired portion of the image displayed on a touch screen on the device; and/or
- Selection of the depth of field to use; and/or
- In general, selection of any parameter that may be described herein as being automatically determined; accordingly, such parameter may be selected manually and, for the sake of brevity, such discussion will not be repeated in this context.
