FIG. 3 illustrates a schematic block-diagram of a system in accordance with some embodiments. -
FIG. 4 illustrates a schematic block-diagram of a supervisor-oriented website in accordance with some embodiments. - In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of some embodiments. However, it will be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art that some embodiments is able to be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, units and/or circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the discussion.
- Embodiments of the present invention are directed toward a device, system and method of television broadcasting of live feed from mobile devices. Some embodiments of the present invention include a communication system which allows live reporting, real-time reporting, substantially live reporting, and/or substantially real-time reporting of events as a “live feed” by one or more users of wireless communication devices to a central location. The central location is able to, in turn, substantially simultaneously broadcast such live feed as a television broadcast, e.g., through cable television, satellite or dish television, or Radio Frequency (RF) transmission based television broadcast. The present invention advantageously allows an “eyewitness news” type of broadcasting from mobile devices to live television. Some embodiments of the present invention utilize a sub-system of wireless communication devices, which is able to interface with a sub-system of television broadcasting. It should be recognized that the invention is herein described relative to television broadcasts. However, the invention can be applied to other types of broadcasts, including radio broadcasts.
- A community of users of mobile devices is able to be associated with a particular television channel or station or program (e.g., eyewitness news mobile user community, or other television broadcaster mobile user community). A mobile device of such a user typically includes a particular application or client-side software that allows the user to register in advance as a potential driver, traveler, eyewitness and/or reporter associated with that television broadcaster. Typically, the application is retrievable and downloadable from a source location. In some embodiments, only pre-registered users are able to provide live feed to the television broadcaster, which incorporates such live feed, incoming from such mobile devices, substantially in real time within a live television broadcast (e.g., occupying the entire television screen, or a selected portion or window within the television screen). Alternatively, users who simply have such an application on their mobile devices are able to provide live feed to the television broadcaster.
- For example, assume a user of the eyewitness news mobile user community is traveling or driving. Once the user sees or notices an event, which is suitable for news reporting (e.g., an accident, a fire, a flood, a terror attack), the user is able to turn into a live reporter for broadcast television by utilizing the user's mobile device.
- In some embodiments, the television broadcaster is able to query the system to find out which particular users are currently located in proximity to a particular location-of-interest, in which a news-worthy event is possibly occurring. The television broadcast is able to then initiate communication with such selected users to invite them to provide live audio/video/text feed from their mobile devices to the television broadcaster, with or without such users' additional commentaries in the background.
- Alternatively or in addition to, a user is able to initiate the communication with the television broadcaster, by utilizing the user's mobile device, the particular application in the mobile device, or by other suitable ways, e.g., by sending a text message or an email message to the television broadcaster, or by otherwise signaling the television broadcaster that the mobile device user is located in proximity to a news-worthy event, and that the mobile device user is willing to commence a live feed of audio, video and/or text from the event scene to the television broadcaster.
- Once the television broadcaster receives such proposal from the mobile device user, the television broadcaster can accept or reject the proposal from the mobile device user to transfer live feed of audio, video and/or text from the event scene. The television broadcaster can also modify or negotiate the terms of such transfer of live feed (e.g., the user is able to propose to transfer a live feed of audio, and the television broadcaster is able to respond to the user with a request to transfer a live feed of both audio and video, or vice versa).
- The live feed received from one or more users of mobile devices is incorporated into television broadcasting, either in real time, or substantially in real time, or in real time but can be subject to a pre-defined intentional delay (e.g., a seven seconds delay) in order to allow the television broadcaster to close or mute or pause the television broadcast of the live feed if the live feed includes audio, video and/or text segments that are not suitable for broadcasting on television for various reasons.
- Some embodiments of the present invention allow integration and interactive communication between a television broadcaster (e.g., a news channel) and one or more users of mobile devices who are not, by themselves, professional news reporters but who happen to be located in proximity to a news-worthy event or scene.
- Embodiments of the present invention can thus advantageously eliminate or reduce the response time of a news channel to a news-worthy event. For example, instead of sending a news broadcasting vehicle to the event scene, which can take a long period of time to arrive at the scene (e.g., particularly since roads is able to be closed or blocked due to the event taking place), the news channel is able to directly communicate with nearby users of mobile devices, and is able to obtain within seconds live feed or live footage of audio, video and/or text of such event or scene.
- In some embodiments, a route guidance system, a navigation system and/or a traffic alerts system is able to have a community of users of mobile devices. Typically, the users are able to wirelessly transmit to a central server updated data about current situations on various roads (e.g., traffic congestion, hazards, accidents, or the like), together with data indicating the exact or proximate geo-spatial location of each such mobile device.
- All users are able to register to a system of “eyewitness news reporting” and, by doing so, the users allow authorized personnel, such as a system supervisor at the television broadcaster, to view and know their respective locations, substantially in real time. Such registered users also allow the system supervisor at the television broadcaster to selectively or collectively contact them via communication means to propose to them to go live in television broadcasting through their mobile devices and/or in order to interview them as a witness on the scene. Exemplary communication means include phone, instant text messaging, video chat, electronic mail and the like.
- Once the system supervisor receives an indication of a news-worthy event, the system supervisor is able to dispatch a news reporting crew to that scene and, in parallel, while the news reporting crew is on its way to the event scene, the system supervisor is able to view a computerized representation of a geographical map which shows indications of registered users of mobile devices that are located near that scene location. The system supervisor is able to select one or more of such users, in order to interview them on television through their mobile devices, and/or in order to obtain from them live audio feed, live video feed, live audio/video feed, captured audio footage, captured video footage, captured audio/video footage, captured photographs, real-time audio commentary from such users, or other user input, including but not limited to text, which is able to then be incorporated by the television broadcaster in live television broadcasting to millions of users nationwide or worldwide.
- In some embodiments, the system supervisor is able to select the best or optimal user for reporting on an event, out of a group of users which are located at approximately the same distance or within a predetermined distance from the scene of interest. A data store at and/or accessible by the television broadcaster is configured to store data about each such user, including data that the user provided during the registration process (e.g., age, gender, profession, home address, level of education, knowledge of particular language, or the like) and/or data that the system is able to collect and aggregate by itself (e.g., history of previous reporting by the user; comments or feedback or rating that various members of the television broadcaster wrote about the user).
- For example, the system supervisor is able to select, out of a group of nearby users, a particular user that speaks a particular language (e.g., Spanish) in order to provided details about a particular news events which involves natives of such language (e.g., to describe a demonstration by Spanish-speaking people).
- For another example, the system supervisor is able to select, out of a group of nearby users, a particular user that belongs to a certain profession or occupation (e.g., a nurse, or a student) in order to provided details about a particular news events which involves particular type of persons. Other suitable criteria and user attributes can be used (and are available to the system supervisor through a control interface, which is discussed in detail elsewhere) in order to select a more-suitable user for live-television reporting through a mobile device.
