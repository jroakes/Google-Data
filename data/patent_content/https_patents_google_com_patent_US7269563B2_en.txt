Definitions
- This invention relates generally to methods of dialing a phone number.
- the invention relates to a method of voice-activated dialing based on string and character matching with locally stored dialing number information.
- Some mobile phone manufacturers have embedded speech-recognition technology into their phones, allowing users to program phone numbers that are matched with a spoken name. While in a programming mode, a user may create voice dial entries, for example, by speaking and recording a name or series of digits one to three times.
- Some telecommunication providers offer network-based, voice-activated dialers and administer large address books of names and numbers. Because the information is on the network, users may update that information via the web and through their contact management software.
- ASR automatic speech recognition
- CPU central processing unit
- a most basic vocabulary might be, for example, words such as yes, no, and digits zero through nine.
- dialing services have been introduced where phone callers are able to dial the pound sign and a three-digit number on a mobile phone, to say the name of the person they want to reach such as “Mom”, and to be connected to that person by the speech-recognition software.
- callers Via simple voice commands, callers can access and dial up phone numbers that they have programmed in a locally stored phone number directory by either voice or keypad input.
- Speech-enabled applications offer enhanced services designed to increase productivity, efficiency and responsiveness.
- Some telephone services require callers to dial more digits, and thus, voice dialing is becoming a time-saving feature.
- New area codes are being added to many metropolitan areas, forcing callers to dial eleven digits for local calls.
- International calling which continues to become more common, requires long dialing strings with access codes, country codes and, in many cases, newly lengthened city codes.
- voice-recognition technologies have been applied to other fields such as database searches, interactive television, and computer interfaces.
- Davallou discloses a phonetic self-improving search engine and a related method for searching databases that employ synthetic phonetic lexicons in “Phonetic Self-Improving Search Engine”, U.S. patent application No. 2002/0156776 published Oct. 24, 2002.
- an initial query in a primary database fails, an error database of records of previously failed searches is queried with a search string to obtain a positive result, and if no record is found still, the search string is parsed into one or more pronounceable units.
- Phonetically equivalent formulas are applied to one or more pronounceable units to create one or more search strings, which then are re-queried into the error memory database and the primary database.
- a phonetic database with phonetic equivalent formulas and their respective pronounceable units helps find possible matches with database records.
- Voice-recognition software has been used with interactive televisions.
- An interactive, speech-enabled television system that enables a user to select channels by spoken request is disclosed in “Automatic Search of Audio Channels by Matching Viewer-Spoken Words against Closed-Caption/Audio Content for Interactive Television” by Boman, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,480,819 issued Nov. 12, 2002.
- the system includes a semantic analyzer that is able to discriminate between speech intended to describe program content and speech intended to supply meta-commands to the system. By extracting meaning as well as keywords and phrases from the spoken input, the system finds matching content when the spoken words do not match the closed caption text exactly.
- a number of current voice-dialing services allow callers to speak a name or phone number clearly into a phone and the system will dial based on matches to a first name, last name, full name, business name or phone number.
- voice-recognition software is not always able to decipher voice input, particularly in the case of phone numbers.
- Voice recognition systems typically look for pattern matches for each individual digit in a telephone number when a user dials via voice, which can lead to one or more digits being misrecognized and can result in the potential for a misdialed number or a need to restart the voice dialing, even though the rest of the number is correct. Digits may be misrecognized due to several reasons.
- Systems may not be able to distinguish between, for example, the words one and nine. They may have difficulty translating, for example, the words nine thousand into the four digits of 9-0-0-0. Users may forget to give an area code. The voice input may be garbled, or background noises may be interpreted as numbers. Users may have different accents or nuances with specific numbers that a speech-recognition system has difficulty in recognizing accurately.
- One aspect of the invention provides a method of operating a voice-activated communication device.
- a voice input that includes a plurality of spoken numbers is received, and a sequence of digits based on the plurality of spoken numbers is determined.
- the sequence of digits is compared to a list of stored phone numbers, and at least one proposed dialing number is presented based on the comparison.

- Voice-activated dialing method 300 includes steps to dial a phone number with a voice-activated communication device such as a cellular phone, a mobile handset, a personal digital assistant with phone capabilities, or a personal computer with phone capabilities.
- a voice-activated communication device such as a cellular phone, a mobile handset, a personal digital assistant with phone capabilities, or a personal computer with phone capabilities.
- a voice input that includes a plurality of spoken numbers is received, as seen at block 305 .
- the plurality of spoken numbers may be, for example, a ten-digit calling number typical of a phone number used in the United States.
- the plurality of spoken numbers may be a shortened seven-digit local number or a four- or five-digit extension number.
- the voice input may include other content, such as a command to receive a phone number so that a call may be initiated.
- a sequence of digits is determined based on the plurality of spoken numbers, as seen in 310 .
- the sequence of digits or the voice-recognized entry may be determined using voice-recognition hardware and software contained within the voice-activated communication device.
- a corresponding character such as an ASCII number between 0 and 9 may be assigned to each spoken digit.
- common references to sets of numbers such as nine thousand, individual digits are determined and assigned to the sequence. Other special cases may be handled during the determination, such as substituting a zero for a spoken letter “o”.
- pattern matches on a digit-by-digit basis using voice dial may sometimes lead to one or more digits being misrecognized, even though the rest of the number is correct. Improved accuracy may be obtained by comparing the sequence of digits to frequently or recently used phone numbers. These numbers can be used as a basis for error recovery when the spoken digits are received incorrectly. Recognized numbers, both correct and incorrect, can be compared to recently stored numbers to look for matching sequences. Exact matches have high confidences of being correct. Matches that are in error by a single digit can be paired with their closest match. The user can be queried to pick one of the choices. In some cases, one of the stored numbers is the desired number, rather than the recognized sequence of digits. In other cases, the last call received, particularly when unanswered, is highly likely to be the first call made when placing a call.
- the sequence of digits is compared to a list of stored phone numbers, as seen at block 315 .
- Phone numbers in a user's phone book, last calls received, and last calls made provide valuable information about the likely recipient of a call that the voice-recognition system can use to attempt to match an entire phone number to a spoken entry.
- the list of stored phone numbers may comprise, for example, a set of recently called phone numbers.
- the list of stored phone numbers may include a set of phone numbers corresponding to recently received phone calls.
- the list of stored phone numbers may include a combination of recently called phone numbers and recently received phone numbers.
- the list may comprise the last ten dialed phone numbers and the phone numbers of the last ten phone calls received by the voice-activated communication device, with repeated numbers excluded from the list.
- the list of phone numbers may be dynamically loaded from internal memory such as the phone book, last calls received, and last calls made.
- the list of phone numbers may be stored in the memory of the voice-activated communication device or within the network to which the device is connected. The phone numbers in the list may be loaded from their stored positions into local memory within the voice-activated communication device for faster processing.
- the list of phone numbers may be assigned an ordinal number corresponding to the order of the number called or the order of the number received.
- the ordinal number one may be assigned to the phone number of the last number called or to the phone number corresponding to the last call received.
- the ordinal number ten may be assigned to the tenth number most recently received or called.
- Software in the phone may include program code to determine the order of the last phone call called or received.
- the last phone call may correspond to the ordinal number of one, the next to last phone call may correspond to two, and so forth.
- the list of phone numbers and the ordinal numbers assigned to the phone numbers may be updated and modified with each incoming or outgoing call.
- Proposed dialing numbers refer to a set of one or more candidate phone numbers for connecting a call.
- a proposed dialing number may comprise a listed phone number from the list of incoming or outgoing stored phone numbers when the determined sequence of digits from the voice input matches all digits of the listed phone number.
- the determined sequence of digits may be presented to the user with an audio or visual interface, and the user may respond with a verification of the number as presented or with another attempt at voice input.
- one or more dialing numbers may be proposed and presented to the user based on string matching with locally stored information.
- the listed number may be proposed and presented to the user.
- String matching techniques may be used to compare the determined sequence of digits to the list of stored phone numbers.
- the listed phone numbers that best match the sequence of digits may be presented to the user. For example, if nine digits of a total of ten digits in the sequence of digits match one of the phone numbers in the list of stored phone numbers except for one missing digit somewhere in the string, the phone number is a likely candidate for the intended phone number and the phone number may be presented to the user.
- the phone number is a likely candidate for the intended phone number and may be presented to the user.
- the listed number is a likely candidate and may be proposed and presented to the user.
- Other candidate numbers include dialing numbers with eight of ten digits matched correctly or numbers with two digits interposed.
- Other candidate numbers may be proposed and presented when six, five or even four digits are correct, for example, when an area code is omitted or when a three-digit local prefix is omitted, which is typical for phone extension numbers within a company.
- Stored phone numbers and the sequence of digits may be broken down into sub-strings that are patterned after local phone number convention to further improve recognition accuracy, since regularly recurring stored entries such as an area code are highly likely to be accurately matched to the voice input.
- embedded software may determine that more than one phone number from the list of stored phone numbers matches or closely matches the sequence of digits corresponding to the voice input, and multiple phone numbers may be presented to the user.
- the proposed dialing numbers may be ranked, as seen at block 320 .
- the program may rank, for example, the phone number of the exact match as number one, the next closest match to the sequence of digits as number two, and so forth.
- the program may also include and present with high ranking the initial sequence of digits corresponding to the voice input for cases where the desired calling number has not recently been called or received.
- the proposed dialing numbers may be ranked based on the ordinal number in addition to the degree of matching. For example, when the matched number has only seven digits correct yet the seven correct digits correspond to the most recently dialed phone number except for the area code, the matched number may be presented first to the user because of the low ordinal number. In another example where eight of ten numbers in the sequence of digits correspond to several numbers within the list of stored phone numbers, the phone number with the lowest ordinal number may be ranked highest when presenting the proposed dialing numbers to the user.
- At least one proposed dialing number is presented to the user, as seen at block 325 .
- the proposed dialing numbers are presented based on the comparison between the sequence of digits of the phone number received from initial voice input and the phone numbers in a list of stored phone numbers.
- the dialing numbers may be presented, for example, based on the confidence level of the string matching. Alternatively, the dialing numbers may be presented based on the ordinal number ranking.
- the dialing numbers may be presented based on a combination of the confidence level of the-string matching and the ordinal number ranking.
- the sequence of digits received from the initial voice input may be presented with a high ranking or with special indicia to indicate that the number corresponds to the voice input as received.
- One or more proposed dialing numbers may be presented using an audio interface or a visual display.
- a digitized voice may speak, for example, a phrase indicating the intention to give a phone number and then the sequence of digits of the proposed phone number.
- a display may present a list of one or more proposed dialing numbers to the user. The program may pause to receive a verification or a selection from the user.
- a verification of the proposed dialing number may be received from the user, as seen at block 330 .
- the verification may comprise a verbal approval or a key entry indicating approval.
- the user may approve the proposed dialing number or another option may be selected, such as a repeat voice entry, perform another function, or power down.
- the proposed dialing number may be dialed, as seen at block 335 .
- the number may be dialed to initiate a call or to return a call.
- the number may be dialed using suitable hardware and software within the voice-activated communication device.
- the user may select one target dialing number from the proposed dialing numbers.
- the selection of the target dialing number may be received, as seen at block 340 .
- the selection may be received verbally using the voice-recognition software.
- the selection may be received with manual entry from, for example, a key depression or a selection from a menu using a suitable data-entry input device such as a keypad.
- the selected target dialing number is dialed, as seen at block 345 .
- the number may be dialed to initiate a call or to return a call.
- the number may be dialed using suitable hardware and software within the voice-activated communication device.
