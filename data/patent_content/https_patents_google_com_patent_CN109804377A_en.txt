(inline frame, iFrame), which is embedded between the secondary webpage in leading web, establishes two-way communication, even if main and
When secondary webpage has not homologous.Once establish bi-directional communication channel, the script in the two webpages can using channel come
Realize a set of service separated across source.For example, when user clicks on the element in leading web, the script from main page
Execution contextual awareness in secondary page can be used to click event.Processing routine script (handler from secondary page
Script the routine of programming) then can be executed in response to clicking event.In this way, intersecting the two-way between source execution context
Letter channel can promote seamless user experience so that it is really leading web that the content of insertion, which appears like it for user,
A part, without being built-in in individual container.
Generally, executing context is for executing particular content item (such as, script, webpage, worksheet or other texts
Shelves) dedicated computing process.System can execute context for each window creation opened in application accordingly, wherein each
Different content items is presented in window.System (for example, application in operating system or computing system) can keep each execution
Context is separated from each other, so that executing the event occurred in context at one does not influence in the execution that other simultaneously run
Hereafter.For example, refresh events can not be directly affected in phase when user refreshes first webpage with the first execution context
With other webpages opened in browser, because they are maintained in the execution context of separation.In addition, for enforcing
It is interactively with each other can further to limit the execution context from not homologous content item for the computing system of origin policy.To the greatest extent
It is interactively with each other and freely access that guard system can permit the script in the execution context of the content item with identical sources
The data of this management, but origin policy may limit interactively with each other or visit as the script type for carrying out Self-crossover source execution context
Ask the data managed each other.
Referring now to Figure 1, showing the schematic diagram for the example web page 102 being presented in the window 100 of web page browsing application.
Webpage 102 includes each main contents (such as, title " Example Website ") and text fields.Webpage 102 comes from first
Source, wherein the first source is at least partly by uniform resource locator (URL) (http://www.firstorigin of webpage 102
Domainexample.com/home.htm it) indicates.In some embodiments, source is by including that the information tuple of following the description limits
It is fixed: (i) URI scheme or agreement (for example, http is to ftp to https), (ii) Hostname and the port (iii).If at two
Any one information in tuple mismatches, then is considered different by the source that tuple limits.In more generally embodiment,
" source " can be according to Internet Engineering Task group (Internet Engineering Task Force, IETF) Request for Comment
(Request for Comments, RFC) 6454, the journey specified in " Web source contents (The Web origin Content) "
Sequence determines.
The main contents of webpage 102 can be executed in dedicated implementation procedure by browser.Because webpage 102 is presented on clear
It lookes in device window 100, so to be also presented on window 100 therein with webpage 102 right for the implementation procedure for leading web 102
It answers.
Other than the main contents of webpage 102, webpage 102 further includes the content frame 104a and 104b of insertion.First
The content frame 104a of insertion is presented the minor coverage from the second source, and the content frame 104b of the second insertion is presented from the
The minor coverage that three sources obtain.In some embodiments, content frame 104a and 104b is limited by one or more iFrame
It is fixed, and the execution context of their own can be provided to each iFrame.It is described in further detail with reference to Fig. 2 such as content
The framework of the content frame of the example insertion of frame 104a and 104b.As the homologous plan enforced by web browser application
Slightly and top ranked webpages 102 and the content being presented in the content frame 104a and 104b of insertion not homologous is as a result, can be with
The corresponding execution context for limiting the content of webpage 102 and insertion carries out mutual certain interactions and/or the mutual data of access.
It can be for example including the DOM Document Object Model for document with document (or execution context for document) associated data
(DOM), the combination of the instruction, document properties or these and other data that are interacted with the user of document.It is come from for example, can permit
The DOM of the second webpage of script inspection and modification from identical sources in first webpage in the first source, or setting are directed to the second net
The detectaphone of the event occurred in page.In comparison, as origin policy as a result, the first net from the first source can be prevented
The DOM of script inspection or modification from the second not homologous webpage in page, or setting is for the event occurred in the second webpage
Detectaphone.
It in some embodiments, can be by the way that script or other computer codes be injected in (inject) top page
By in the content frame insertion top ranked webpages of minor coverage for rendering, the script or other computer codes are being performed
When be inserted into browser dynamically frame in webpage and request one or more minor coverage projects to present in the frame.
Minor coverage project can be retrieved from the source different from the source of top ranked webpages.For example, can be come from from for having agreed to display
The first web domain (for example, first source) of the publisher of the minor coverage of content provider network obtains top ranked webpages 102.Then,
One insertion content frame 104a in script can call content provider network with obtain minor coverage project (for example, for
The weather data of user location, the map from map server or navigation server or other content project) to be shown in frame
In frame 104a.Similarly, it is another to retrieve can also to call content provider network for the script in the content frame 104b of the second insertion
One secondary content item is to be shown in frame 104b.
In some embodiments, bi-directional communication channel can be established between not homologous associated execution context.
With reference to Fig. 4-7 description how can establish as channel details.Advantageously, bi-directional communication channel, which can permit, carrys out Self-crossover
The service when script that source executes context sends message between each other and realizes a set of operation for being related to the interaction of intersection source.Example
Such as, event listener can be set in the first execution context.When event listener detects the generation of defined event,
Detectaphone can call the processing routine using two-way channel so that second executes the generation of contextual awareness to event.Second holds
Detectaphone in row context then can processing notification in any suitable manner, including executed by two-way channel to first
Context sends back to confirmation and further message.
In some embodiments, bi-directional communication channel can be used for executing context (such as top ranked webpages in intersection source
102 and insertion content frame 104a and 104b) between create uniform user interfaces.Disappeared based on what is sent by two-way channel
Breath, top ranked webpages 102 can respond the event in the content frame 104a or 104b of insertion, and vice versa.For example, top ranked webpages
102 may include user interface element 106a and 106b.Element 106a and 106b are respectively adjacent to but in its corresponding insertions
It is shown except content frame 104a and 104b.Because element 106a and 106b are provided in top page 102 and in insertion
Outside content frame 104a and 104b, so the origin policy of browser can typically limit the frame of these control of element insertion
Movement in frame 104a and 104b.But it is built between context once being executed according to one of presently disclosed technology in intersection source
Bi-directional communication channel is found, the interaction with element 106a or 106b in top ranked webpages 102 can be respectively in insertion
Hold frame 104a or 104b internal trigger response.
For example, detectaphone can be arranged in top ranked webpages 102 with (for example, click) element that identifies when user has selected
106a.When detecting the selection to element 106a, processing routine script in top ranked webpages 102 can be by previously having established
Bi-directional communication channel sends message, the detectaphone detection in the content frame 104a being then embedded into.Then, carry out self-embedding
The processing routine script of content frame 104a can execute one or more operations, example to the selection of element 106a in response to user
Such as, content frame 104a is closed, the content shown in content frame 104a is updated, plays or suspend the matchmaker in content frame 104a
Body project, for collect about the content being shown in content frame 104a recently the problem of user generate summary, request about
The additional information of the state of top ranked webpages 102 provides instruction to top ranked webpages 102 to execute movement (for example, from top ranked webpages
102 close content frame 104a, generate the content frame or pop-up window of new insertion) or these and other operation combination.

The script of two-way communication is established between hereafter.In some embodiments, the execution context for each container in document 300
It can be indicated with corresponding with the hierarchical structure of container arrangement hierarchical structure.
Fig. 4 is gone to, shows and is created in context for being executed in the environment for enforcing origin policy in intersection source
It builds and the flow chart of the instantiation procedure 400 using bi-directional communication channel.Its of the operation for establishing channel is described about Fig. 5-7
His details.
In the stage 402, computing system is (for example, desktop computer, notebook computer, mobile computing device or wearable
Calculate equipment) create the first execution context and the second execution context.In some embodiments, first execute context and
Second execution context respectively with document or be configured as that the difference in other interfaces from not homologous content item is presented
Container is corresponding.For example, this discussion will consider that computing system has created the first execution context to execute and come from first
The content in source, the content from the first source are presented in the outer container (for example, sub- container 202) of the content frame of insertion.Document
The top level container that is embedded of content frame also include the content from the first source, therefore top level container and outer container are held
Row context is identical.Therefore, origin policy allows these to execute the relatively free of context interaction and to mutual limited number
According to access.In comparison, second in the example executes context and executes the content from the second source, which is presented on embedding
In the inner pressurd vessel (for example, grandson's container 208) of the content frame entered.
In the stage 404, system executes connection service in the execution context of the execution context and the second source in the first source
Between establish bi-directional communication channel.For example, communication channel can directly by with the first source it is associated first execute context and/or
Top execution context, which is connected to, executes context with the second source associated second.
In order to generate bi-directional communication channel, system can execute the operation in several sub-stage 406-410.In sub-stage
406, the first unidirectional subchannel is established between the first execution context and the second execution context.First unidirectional subchannel is from
One execution context goes to the second execution context and is configured as that message is carried to second and is held from the first execution context
Row context.In sub-stage 408, the second unidirectional subchannel is established between the second execution context and the first execution context.
Second unidirectional subchannel goes to the first execution context from the second execution context and is configured as executing message from second
Context is carried to the first execution context.First subchannel and the second subchannel are formed together bi-directional communication channel, wherein often
Sub-channels limit the target endpoint for being used for two-way communication.
In some embodiments, the connection service of the first execution context and the second execution context can use original
(primitive) but the intersections source message transmission protocol of safety come during the process for establishing communication channel in corresponding execution
Message is sent between hereafter.Can by first execute context and second execute context in the operating system wherein run or
Message transmission protocol is exposed to connection service by the Application Programming Interface (API) of application.For example, some web browsers include
PostMessage () function limits and asynchronously sends another execution context from an execution context for message
Ability, or even when the two execute context and are otherwise limited interactively with each other under origin policy.Executing context can detect
The postMessage being sent to it is listened, and can choose the message of processing detection or do not handle.
PostMessage () agreement is designed to make the postMessage sent, and the side's of being received implementation procedure is not automatic
Processing, although Founder it is expected message and recipient's implementation procedure provides script appropriate (for example, detectaphone if received
And processing routine) to detect and handle any postMessage being sent to it, then it can handle the postMessage of transmission.
Other in given document or interface are executed however, postMessage () agreement does not pass through itself to provide two-way communication or provide
The discovery of context.It can at for example least be partially solved in some instances about Fig. 5-7 operation being further disclosed in detail
These defects of postMessage () agreement.
In alternate embodiments, when initially setting up the first unidirectional subchannel and the second unidirectional subchannel, they are initial
Not connected (not operation) state can be set to.It, can be with when subchannel and when therefore two-way channel is in not-connected status
Prevent external service (for example, servicing when operation) using channel, because there are no confirmation messages can be successfully delivered to phase
The recipient answered executes context.Therefore, in the stage 410, system verifies bi-directional communication channel to confirm its mode of operation.If
Channel (including the first subchannel and second subchannel) is verified, then system by channel (including the first subchannel and second son believe
Road) state be set as connection status (mode of operation).Otherwise, the state of channel keeps not connected.
In the stage 412, after establishing and verifying bi-directional communication channel, service can be used channel to execute in intersection source
Message is carried between context.Service can be used channel and execute the request for the information about restricted data from first
Hereafter be sent to the second execution context (or vice versa), notice executes one of channel and executes event in channels at other
Occur, check that other execute some parts of the DOM of context, modifies a part for the DOM that other execute context and/or hold
The combination of row these operations and other operations.
Fig. 5 is for executing the swim-lane diagram for establishing the instantiation procedure 500 of bi-directional communication channel between context in intersection source.
Process 500 can be by having the computing system in one or more computers of one or more positions to execute, wherein calculating system
Instantiated first for executing the content from the first source of uniting executes context and for executing in the second source
Second held executes context.In the example of hgure 5, first context and outer container (for example, outer container 202 (Fig. 2)) are executed
It is corresponding, and the second execution context is corresponding with inner pressurd vessel (for example, the container 208 (Fig. 2)) being nested in outer container.Especially
Ground, what the operation by executing context execution for the first of outer container can be serviced by providing the connection that first executes context
One or more script executions.It similarly, can be by providing the by executing operation that context executes for the second of inner pressurd vessel
Two execute one or more script executions of the connection service of context.In addition, outer container can be embedded in top level container (example
Such as, container 203) in.The content also from the first source can be presented in top level container.Context and second is executed as first to execute
Context is not homologous as a result, system can enforce origin policy to limit the first execution context and second and execute up and down
Interaction between text, still, the common source for the execution context for executing context and top level container due to first can permit the
One executes the such interaction of context and top level container executed between context.
In the stage 506, detectaphone is arranged in top execution context for discovery message in the first execution context.First
Detectaphone can be arranged in top execution context under origin policy in the connection service for executing context, because they are shared
Identical source.Particularly, first the connection service of context is executed in top execution context rather than is executed up and down first
Detectaphone is set in text because second execution context due to origin policy limitation and do not discover in the first execution initially
Hereafter.In this way, as the expection recipient of discovery message, i.e., the second execution context initially cannot execute context for first
Can instruction message should be sent to the top level container that is set of discovery detectaphone.
In the stage 508, detectaphone is arranged in the second execution context for connection broadcast message in the second execution context.
Connection broadcast message is further described about the stage 518 and 520.
In the stage 510, second, which executes context, sends discovery message to top level container.In some embodiments, it uses
PostMessage () agreement sends discovery message.It was found that message is one type of message, first executes context
It is configured as the message for being identified as the message to initiate the connection routine for being used to establish bi-directional communication channel.
In the stage 512, first, which executes context detection, executes the discovery message that context is sent from second.Using
The discovery detectaphone detection discovery message that stage 506 is arranged.
In the stage 514, the first execution contextual analysis finds message to determine the source of message.In some embodiments,
First execution context determines the source of discovery message by the value of the source field of access message.The value can be in the second execution
Unique identifier hereafter.The top discovery message for executing context is sent to allow the first execution context to determine second
It executes the presence of context and identifies that second executes context.
In the stage 516, the first execution context establishes first between the first execution context and the second execution context
Unidirectional subchannel.First unidirectional subchannel executes context identification for second based on the unique identifier accessed from discovery message
One endpoint of bi-directional communication channel.First unidirectional subchannel can be used for sending second from the first execution context for message
Execute context.
In the stage 518, the first execution context sends second for connection broadcast message using the first unidirectional subchannel and holds
Row context.In some embodiments, connection broadcast message is sent to be related to: using postMessage () agreement and use from
It was found that the identifier for the second execution context that message obtains sends a message to the second execution context and disappears as connection broadcast
The expection recipient of breath.It was found that message is one type of message, the second execution context is configured as knowing the message
It Wei not be for the response of discovery message.
In the stage 520, second, which executes context detection, executes the connection broadcast message that context is sent from first.Make
The connection broadcast listener detection connection broadcast message being arranged used in the stage 508.
When detecting connection broadcast message, the second execution context analyzes to determine its source message.Some
In embodiment, the second execution context determines the source of connection broadcast message by the value of the source field of access message.The value
It can be the unique identifier of the first execution context.The connection broadcast message of the second execution context is sent to allow the
Two execution contexts determine the presence of the first execution context and identify that first executes context.
In the stage 522, the second execution context establishes second between the second execution context and the first execution context
Unidirectional subchannel.Second unidirectional subchannel is known the first execution context based on the unique identifier from connection broadcast message access
Not Wei bi-directional communication channel the second endpoint.Second unidirectional subchannel can be used for sending message to from the second execution context
First executes context.
As the first unidirectional subchannel and the second unidirectional subchannel are established, bi-directional communication channel is also established, because should
Sub-channel is enough to provide two-way communication between the first execution context and the second execution context.However, in some implementations
In mode, initially it can set not connected for the state of bi-directional communication channel.In the unconnected state, bi-directional communication channel
It may be for the service other than connecting service using unavailable, because the operation of channel is also unauthenticated.Service can be with
It is configured as checking the state of channel before the use.If channel is connected, it is can be used to be crossed over fork in external service
Source executes context and sends message.If channel is not connected, external service cannot also use channel.
The verification process for making channel become connection status may begin at the stage 524, execute up and down in the stage 524, second
Text sends the second execution context for the first channel connection message using the second subchannel in bi-directional communication channel.Channel connects
Connecing message is to indicate that recipient executes the message that context sets the state of bi-directional communication channel to connection status.In some realities
Apply in mode, postMessage () agreement can be used send channel connection message (and first execute context and
Second executes any other message swapped between contexts).First execution context may be directed to the first connection message
It is executed in context first and is provided with detectaphone (for example, after establishing the first subchannel).It is come from when detectaphone detects
When the first connection message (stage 526) of the second execution context, bi-directional communication channel is set as connecting by the first execution context
Connect state (stage 528).However, each place in the first execution context and the second execution context independently keeps channel
State.Therefore, in the stage 530, second channel connection message is sent the second execution context by the first execution context.The
Two execution contexts may be directed to the second connection message and execute in context provided with detectaphone second (for example, building
After vertical second subchannel).When detectaphone is detected from the second connection message (stage 532) of the first execution context,
Bi-directional communication channel is also converted to connection status from not-connected status by the second execution context.Context is executed with first
With endpoint is activated in second execution both context and the state of channel is arranged to connection, can by with the first source
Two-way channel is correctly used with the associated one or more services executed in context in the second source.
As described in about Fig. 3, some documents or interface may include the content frame of multiple insertions, such as frame 304a-
n.For such document, the content frame of each insertion may have the bi-directional communication channel for establishing their own to allow embedding
The content frame for executing context and insertion of the outer container (for example, container 202) of the content frame entered inner pressurd vessel (for example,
Container 208) between the needs that are communicated.Involve when establishing the corresponding two-way channel for the content frame of each insertion
The initial discovery message that one challenge is sent to the execution context for top level container can be by by for all insertions
Each discovery message detectaphone of the execution context setting of the outer container of content frame is heard.In order to prevent above and below each execution
Text all responds each discovery message, the processing journey for discovery message event of the outer container of the content frame for given insertion
Whether sequence can be the outer container for being directed to the content frame of insertion by checking the source (that is, second execution context) of discovery message
Execution context offspring come determine if be find message expection recipient.For example, if the content of the first insertion
The discovery message that connection service in the outer iFrame of frame determines that first detects is out of be nested in outer iFrame
IFrame send, then connect service can determine that it is discovery message expection recipient and can by continue establish pair
Carry out response message to the program of communication channel, as disclosed in Fig. 5.If it find that message is to send (example from non-clan source
Such as, the offspring in the content frame not from identical insertion), then it is discovery that the connection service of outer iFrame, which can determine it not,
The expection recipient of message and it can therefore abandon message.
Fig. 6 is when providing the content frame of multiple insertions in a document for establishing the example of intersection source bi-directional communication channel
The swim-lane diagram of process 600.The connection service for illustrating in the container for the content frame that can be embedded in by two is taken to be every
The content frame of a insertion establishes the movement of dedicated bi-directional communication channel.In some embodiments, the property frame of each insertion
Frame is similar to the frame 201 from Fig. 2 and arranges, and respectively includes that the top from the content frame with each insertion of trustship is presented
The outer container of the content of the identical sources of the content of grade container.Inner pressurd vessel in the content frame of each insertion can present from
The content in the outer framework one or more sources different with the source of top level container.Computing system can instantiate individual and execute context
To execute the content from each container respectively.In some embodiments, presently disclosed technology advantageouslys allow for multiple embedding
The content frame entered using the same or similar script (for example, connection service) with and meanwhile be connected to the execution of top level container or more
Text, or even when identical discovery message is sent top execution context by each inner frame.
In the stage 614, discovery message detectaphone is arranged in the first execution context in top execution context.Similarly,
In the stage 618, third executes the context also setting discovery message detectaphone in top execution context.In 616 He of stage
620, the setting connection broadcast in its corresponding execution context of both the second execution context and the 4th execution context is listened to
Device.In the stage 622, second, which executes context, sends initial discovery message to the execution context of top level container.In 624 He of stage
626, the initial discovery message that the discovery detectaphone detection for the content frame being embedded in from two executes context from second.So
Afterwards, in the stage 628, the first execution context determines that it is the target (for example, it is contemplated that recipient) of initial discovery message, because disappearing
The value instruction message of the attribute of breath is sent from the offspring of the first execution context.In comparison, in the stage 628, third is held
It is the target of initial discovery message that row context, which determines it not, because it is not that the offspring for executing context from third sends,
Therefore the inner pressurd vessel of the content frame not from identical insertion.Third executes context and therefore ignores discovery message and abandon
It is without taking movement further to establish the connection for executing context with second.On the other hand, first context is executed from rank
514 (Fig. 5) of section continue to continue to establish and verify bi-directional communication channel.
Fig. 7 is for the swimming for the instantiation procedure 700 for executing multiple service multiplexing bi-directional communication channels in context
Road figure.For example, the inner pressurd vessel that the content frame of insertion can service when including the first operation is (for example, iFrame or other windows
Mouthful object) in presentation content, service is configured as having selected the specific control element in top level container in user when the first operation
When the content frame of insertion is closed with send instructions using bi-directional communication channel.Inner pressurd vessel takes when can also include the second operation
Business, service is configured with bi-directional communication channel transmission and intersects sourse instruction based on first to control in inner pressurd vessel when the second operation
The selection of element is to update the content in top level container.In some embodiments, each service may need dedicated two-way communication
Channel.Process 700 indicates example technique, can be established between same pair of intersection source execution context by the technology multiple
Channel.In some embodiments, each channel is assigned to and executes the difference in the associated multiple services of one of context
One.In Fig. 7, operation of the road the Zuo instruction for the first execution context of the outer container of the content frame of insertion；In
Between road instruction second execute context represent insertion content frame inner pressurd vessel first service operation；And most right Dow Jones index
Show that the second of the second service of the inner pressurd vessel of the content frame for insertion executes the operation of context.
In the stage 708, discovery message event is arranged in the first execution context in the execution context for top level container
Detectaphone, the top level container and outer container share identical sources.
In the stage 710 and 712, the second connection service for executing context executes two connections of setting in context second
Broadcast the message event listener.Service is set when the first detectaphone in these detectaphones represents the first operation, and these
Service is set when the second detectaphone in detectaphone represents the second operation of inner pressurd vessel.It later may be from father's friends' row in order to distinguish
The received expected connection broadcast message of context (for example, first executes context), the first detectaphone are configured as only detecting packet
It includes and broadcasts the message with the connection for servicing associated first token when the first operation.Similarly, the second detectaphone is configured as only examining
Survey includes broadcasting the message with the connection for servicing associated second token when the second operation.
In the stage 714, it is two-way to indicate to establish that the second execution context will be seen that message is sent to top execution context
The request of communication channel.Transmitted discovery message services associated first token when may include with the first operation, with instruction
Channel is established in service when will be about the first operation.
In the stage 716, the first execution context is detected based on the instruction for carrying out self-discovery message detectaphone and is executed from second
The discovery message of context.In the stage 718, the first execution contextual analysis finds message to determine the source of message.For example, first
The identifier of the second execution context can be determined from the attribute with discovery message relating by executing context.It is executed using second
Identifier hereafter, in the stage 720, the first execution context then sets up the first of the first service for executing context with second
Unidirectional subchannel.It include that the second execution context is being sent to by the first unidirectional subchannel by the first subchannel arrangements by being
Subsequent message in discovery message in include the first token, the first unidirectional subchannel can be associated with first service.?
Stage 722, the first execution context then pass through the first unidirectional subchannel and send the second execution for the first connection broadcast message
Context.Clothes when first connection broadcast message belongs to the first operation of the second execution context including the first token with instruction message
Business.
As by first connection broadcast message be sent to the second execution context as a result, second execution Context Accept disappear
It ceases and (stage 724 and 730) is detected by connection broadcast listener.In the stage 726, second, which executes contextual analysis first, is connected
Broadcast message, service when identifying the first token in message and determining that message belongs to the first operation from the first token.Process 700
The stage 522 (Fig. 5) is then proceeded to build between the first execution context and the first service of the second execution context
It stands and verifies bi-directional communication channel.First token may include during establishing channel first execute context and second execute on
In subsequent message between hereafter, and it is being used to send clothes when data belong to the first operation with instruction message after establishing channel
Business.
In comparison, in the stage 732, the second execution context determines that the first connection broadcast message does not include and the second operation
When service associated second token, therefore the first connection broadcast message is not belonging to service when the second operation.Therefore, it second executes
Service abandons the first connection and broadcasts the message and select not hold in the first execution context and second when below with respect to the second operation
Channel is established between service when the second operation of row context.Although not shown in the figure of Fig. 7, in some embodiments
In, when the channel that can establish separation is used to execute context first and second executes the second operation of context between service
It is communicated.
In some embodiments, in order to strengthen the safety of bi-directional communication channel, can by first execute context and
Second executes the white list that any one of context or both keeps allowing source.If for request to establish with for the
Discovery message is received in the execution context in the first source of the two-way channel of another execution context in two sources, then is used for first
The execution context in source can check white list to determine whether the second source occurs (for example, whether the domain in the second source is white list
In trust domain).If the second source, not on white list, the execution context for the first source can be refused to establish communication letter
The request in road.In some embodiments, banned source can be added to blacklist, is executed receiving to establish for intersecting source
The blacklist is checked before the request of the channel of context.
