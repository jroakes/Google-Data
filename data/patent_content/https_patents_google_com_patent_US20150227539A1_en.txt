FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example of a process for identifying search queries for display with data associated with search terms. -
FIG. 4 shows an example of a computer device and a mobile computer device that can be used to implement the techniques described herein. - Like reference symbols and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- A system consistent with this disclosure identifies search queries for display with data associated with search terms. In an example, the system identifies the search queries based on amounts of advertising revenue associated with the search queries. Generally, advertising revenue includes an amount of revenue that is attributable to an advertisement.
- In response to a search query, the system provides a user with search results. The search results can include advertisements, e.g., for display next to the search results in a web page. In this example, an amount of advertising revenue can be attributable to advertisement. An amount of advertising revenue also can be attributable to the search query. In this example, advertising revenue for the search query is based on amounts of advertising revenue that are attributable to advertisements in search results of the search query.
- An amount of advertising revenue for an advertisement can vary, e.g., based on numerous factors. In an example, the amount varies based on an effectiveness of the advertisement. In this example, the amount of advertising revenue increases as the effectiveness of the advertisement increases. An increase in the advertising revenue for the advertisement causes the advertising revenue for the search query to also increase. The system is configured to select search queries with increased amounts of advertising revenue, e.g., relative to amounts of advertising revenue for other search queries.
-
FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram of an example ofsystem 100 for identifying search queries for display with data associated with search terms.System 100 includesserver 102,data repository 108 andnetwork 107.Data repository 108 is configured to host numerous resources, including, e.g., web pages, images, documents, files, and the like. In the example ofFIG. 1 ,data repository 108stores web pages 110, 114 andimage 117. -
Server 102 includesdata engine 106 that is configured to crawl, index, and/or search resources, including, e.g.,web pages 110, 114 andimage 117.Data engine 106 can crawl, index and/or search contents ofdata repository 108 and/or contents of other devices configured for communication withserver 102 throughnetwork 107. - In an example,
data engine 106 includes a search engine and/or components of a search engine. Althoughdata engine 106 is shown as a single component inFIG. 1 ,data engine 106 can exist in one or more components, which can be distributed and coupled bynetwork 107. -
System 100 also includesclient device 104.Client device 104 can communicate withserver 102 overnetwork 107. In the example ofFIG. 1 ,client device 104 usesnetwork 107 to accessweb pages 110, 114.Web page 110 includes a graphical user interface for searching for data associated with search terms, including, e.g., search terms indicative of a geographic location (e.g., a travel destination, a city, a state, a region, a country, a hotel, a restaurant, a shopping mall, a park, and the like). -
Web page 110 includes search box 112. A user (not shown) ofclient device 104inputs search terms 111 into search box 112. In this example,search terms 111 include the terms of Sanya Yalongwan and are indicative of a geographic location in China. Sanya City is a city in Hainan Province, China. Yalongwan Bay is a bay in Sanya City, China. -
Client device 104 generates a request (not shown) for a search that usessearch terms 111.Client device 104 sends the request toserver 102.Server 102 receives the request. In response,data engine 106 generatessearch query 128.Search query 128 includes instructions to search for data that is relevant tosearch terms 111. Usingsearch query 128,data engine 106 searches for data associated withsearch terms 111. - In an example,
data engine 106 searches an index (not shown) indata repository 108 for the data. The index includes data specifying contents of resources stored indata repository 108 and/or contents of resources hosted by other servers (not shown) that are configured for communication withserver 102. In this example,data engine 106 updates the index with data collected by crawling contents of the resources stored indata repository 108 and/or the contents of the resources hosted by the other servers. -
Data engine 106 searches the index for the data that is associated withsearch terms 111. In an example, the data that is associated withsearch terms 111 includes data that is relevant tosearch terms 111. Based on searching the index,data engine 106 identifies data that is associated with the geographic location specified bysearch terms 111. In the example ofFIG. 1 , the identified data includesimage 117, including, e.g., a map of the Yalongwan Bay in Sanya City, China. -
Data engine 106 also identifies search queries to display withimage 117, e.g., in web page 114 and/or in another resource. Search queries include data specifying searches that have been performed bydata engine 106.Data repository 108 stores data specifying the search queries performed bydata engine 106, including, e.g.,search query 128. In this example,search query 128 is generated when a user of a client device (e.g.,client device 104 or another client device) submits one or more search terms toserver 102. In this example,search query 128 includes the one or more submitted search terms. - In this example, the data specifying the search queries performed by
data engine 106 is stored in the index indata repository 108.Data engine 106 searches the index for search queries associated with the geographic location specified bysearch terms 111. In an example,data engine 106 identifies search queries that include one or more ofsearch terms 111, a derivative of one or more ofsearch terms 111, one or more synonyms ofsearch terms 111, and the like. - In another example,
data engine 106 identifies search queries for topics that are related to one or more ofsearch terms 111. In this example,search query 128 can include terms that differ fromsearch terms 111. In an example,search terms 111 include a name of a baseball player. In this example,data engine 106 identifiessearch query 128 for a topic that is related to the baseball player, namely, a search query for the baseball team of which the searched baseball player is a member. - For the identified search queries,
data engine 106 determines search results and advertisements displayed with the search results. For the advertisements,data engine 106 determines amounts of advertising revenue. Using the amounts of advertising revenue for the advertisements,data engine 106 determines amounts of advertising revenue for the identified search queries, e.g., as described in further detail below. - In an example,
data repository 108 is configured to store search queries and associated search results for a predefined period of time, including, e.g., a number of hours, a number of days, a number of months, and the like. In this example,data repository 108 is also configured to store the advertisements included in the search results for the predefined period of time. In another example,data repository 108 is configured to store search queries and associated search results (and the associated advertisements) for an indefinite period of time. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,data engine 106 identifiessearch query 128 as associated withsearch terms 111.Search query 128 includes the search terms of Parks in Yalongwan. In this example,search query 128 includes one ofsearch terms 111, e.g., the search term of Yalongwan. -
Search query 128 is associated withadvertisements 115 a . . . 115 n and search results (not shown), e.g., following execution ofsearch query 128.Advertisements 115 a . . . 115 n are associated withadvertising revenues 120 a . . . 120 n, respectively. In this example,advertising revenues 120 a . . . 120 n include data specifying an amount of revenue attributable toadvertisements 115 a . . . 115 n, respectively.Advertising revenues 120 a . . . 120 n can include various metrics that measure amounts of advertising revenue. In an example,advertising revenues 120 a . . . 120 n include Revenue per Minute (RPM) metrics. Generally, a RPM metric includes a measure of revenue generated per minute time internal that is attributable to an advertisement. - Using
advertising revenues 120 a . . . 120 n,data engine 106 determines an amount ofadvertising revenue 120 attributable to searchquery 128.Advertising revenue 120 includes data specifying a value of a summation ofadvertising revenues 120 a . . . 120 n, including, e.g., a summation of RPM metrics foradvertisements 115 a . . . 115 n. For example,advertising revenue 120 can include a value indicative ofadvertising revenues 120 a+ . . . +120 n. - In another example, advertisements 115 a-115 n include three advertisements, e.g.,
advertisements 115 a, 115 b (not shown), 115 c (not shown). In this example,advertisements 115 a, 115 b, 115 c are associated withadvertising revenues 120 a, 120 b, 120 c, respectively.Advertising revenue 120 includes a summation ofadvertising revenues 120 a, 120 b, 120 c, including, e.g.,advertising revenue 120 a+advertising revenue 120 b+advertising revenue 120 c. - In an example,
data engine 106 attributesadvertising revenues 120 a-120 n to advertisements 115 a-115 n based on tracking conversions that are attributable to advertisements 115 a-115 n. In this example, as a user ofclient device 104views advertisements 115 a . . . 115 n, the user can make a conversion. Generally, a conversion includes a completion of a transaction associated with an advertisement. In an example, a conversion occurs when the user viewsadvertisement 115 a, clicks onadvertisement 115 a, accesses a landing page (not shown) foradvertisement 115 a, and/or completes a purchase through the landing page. - When the user views
advertisement 115 a and completes the conversion, a client device (e.g., client device 104) that displayedadvertisement 115 a and the landing page sends cookie data todata engine 106. Generally, cookie data includes data that is stored in a cookie on a client device and other data pertaining to information accessed from the client device. The cookie data specifies a unique identifier of the client device. The cookie data also indicates that the client device displayedadvertisement 115 a and the landing page and that the user completed the conversion. - Using the cookie data,
data engine 106 determines that the user completed the conversion following viewing ofadvertisement 115 a and the landing page. In this example,data engine 106 attributes an amount of revenue for a conversion (e.g., a purchase) toadvertisement 115 a. The cookie data can include information indicative of an amount of revenue associated with the conversion, including, e.g., an amount of money for which a product was purchased. - In another example, the cookie data can be used in identifying an amount of revenue that is associated with the conversion following viewing of
advertisement 115 a and the landing page. In this example, when the user initiates a conversion using a client device (e.g., client device 104),client device 104 sends to server 102 a request to complete the conversion (e.g., to make a purchase). The conversion is associated with a conversion identifier. In this example, details of the conversion are stored indata repository 108 in association with the conversion identifier. Details of the conversion can include information specifying an amount of revenue associated with the conversion, a date on which the conversion was completed, and the like. - In this example, the cookie data also includes the conversion identifier. For example, when the user initiates the conversion through a web page, the web page can execute a script that generates a conversion identifier and populates the cookie data with the conversion identifier.
- Upon receipt of the cookie data that includes the conversion identifier,
date engine 106searches data repository 108 for a conversion identifier that matches the conversion identifier in the cookie data. Based on a match between conversion identifiers,data engine 106 determines an amount of revenue for a particular conversion specified by the cookie data. As previously described, the cookie data specifies that the user completed the conversion following viewing ofadvertisement 115 a and the landing page. In this example,data engine 106 attributes the amount of revenue (associated with the conversion identifier in the data repository 108) toadvertisement 115 a (which is also associated with the same conversion identifier via the cookie data). - In the example of
FIG. 1 , the amount of revenue for the conversion is included inadvertising revenue 120 a foradvertisement 115 a.Data engine 106 determines an amount ofadvertising revenue 120 forsearch query 128 by summing amounts ofadvertising revenues 120 a . . . 120 n. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,data engine 106 compares the amount ofadvertising revenue 120 forsearch query 128 to other amounts of advertising revenue (not shown) for other search queries (not shown). Based on results of the comparison,data engine 106 determines one or more search queries with increased amounts of advertising revenue, e.g., relative to the other amounts of advertising revenue for the other search queries.Data engine 106 selects the one or more search queries of the determined type for display withimage 117, e.g., in web page 114. - In an example,
data engine 106 selects a predefined number of search queries with increased amounts of advertising revenue, e.g., relative to the other amounts of advertising revenue for the other search queries. In another example,data engine 106 selects search queries with amounts of advertising revenue exceeding a threshold value. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,data engine 106 selects search queries with an increased amount of advertising revenue, e.g., relative to other amounts of advertising revenue for other search queries. In an example,data engine 106 also ranks the selected search queries in accordance with relevance of the search queries tosearch terms 111. In this example, the search queries are associated withsearch terms 111.Data engine 106 generates data forvisual representations -
Visual representation 116 includes a depiction of the search terms used insearch query 128, e.g., the search terms of Parks in Yalongwan.Visual representation 122 includes a depiction of the search terms of Hotels in Yalongwan that are included in another search query (not shown) performed bydata engine 106.Visual representation 124 includes a depiction of the search terms of Yalongwan Bars that are included in another search query (not shown) performed bydata engine 106. - In this example,
search query 128 and the search queries represented byvisual representations -
Data engine 106 generates web page 114 for display ofvisual representations image 117. In the example ofFIG. 1 , web page 114 includes a graphical user interface in whichvisual representations - In an example,
visual representations client device 104 selects a selectable portion ofvisual representations client device 104 sends a request (not shown) toserver 102 fordata engine 106 to execute a search query associated with the selected portion. - In an example,
data engine 106 can labelimage 117 with data specifying geographic locations identified bysearch query 128. In this example,data engine 106 executessearch query 128 to identify parks in Yalongwan, China.Data engine 106 generates data specifying geographic locations of the parks.Data engine 106 overlays the data onimage 117 to labelimage 117 with the geographic locations of the parks. In this example, data specifying a geographic location of a park is linked to resources about the park, including, e.g., websites about the park, pictures of the park, and the like. - In another example,
image 117 includes various types of maps, including, e.g., a schematic map, a satellite map, and the like. In this example,web page 110 can include a control (not shown) through which the user ofclient device 104 selects an image type forimage 117. -
