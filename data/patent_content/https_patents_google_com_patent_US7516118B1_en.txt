Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to methods and systems for network browsing.
- the present invention relates particularly to methods and systems for assisted network browsing.
- Page visits on the World Wide Web are often inquisitive or exploratory in nature. Many users rely on a search engine to help them locate web pages containing the information or resources they are in search of.
- a search engine performs the search based on a conventional search method. For example, one known method, described in an article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, assigns a degree of importance to a document, such as a web page, based on the link structure of the global population of available documents.
- the user may find that the destination page does not contain the type or amount of information or resources desired, forcing a return trip to the origin web page to select a different hyperlink.
- this process of navigating the World Wide Web in search of information or resources without knowing the relevance or usefulness of a destination web page before loading it consumes a large amount of the user's time.
- the user may perform a large number of round trips to unacceptable or inadequate destination web sites before locating the information or resources desired.
- Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for assisted network browsing.
- a client device receives an interest signal indicating a user's interest in a hyperlink contained in a first document.
- the client device responds to the interest signal by generating a request signal comprising a request for third-party-provided information about a second document associated with the hyperlink.
- the client device then receives the requested information and causes it to be output in association with the first document.
- a server device when a user expresses interest in a hyperlink contained in a first document, a server device receives a request signal comprising a request for third-party information about a second document associated with the hyperlink. In this embodiment, the server device retrieves the requested information and generates an information signal configured to cause the information to be output in association with the first document.
- An embodiment of the present invention may utilize ratings, annotations, history of use, anchor text, summaries or other data associated with the second document or the user to provide the most helpful and pertinent information.
- One advantage of an embodiment of the present invention is that a user is provided helpful information about a destination web page associated with a hyperlink while the bandwidth and time required to load an origin web page containing the hyperlink are not increased.
- Another advantage of an embodiment of the present invention is that the user's primary or immediate perception of an origin web page is not altered.
- Still another advantage of an embodiment of the present invention is that the user's browsing activities, comprising which hyperlink a user considers following on an origin web page, an amount of time a user spends considering a hyperlink, and which hyperlink a user follows after receiving information about a destination web page associated with it, may be anonymously and securely monitored and used to help develop better user models, search engines and web browsers.

- the advertisements are based, at least in part, on the network browsing choices of the user 112 a . This feature provides numerous benefits. Not only are users more likely to be satisfied because the advertising is more targeted, but the click-through rate for the service provider may increase, resulting in increased revenue.
- One embodiment of the present invention utilizes an anti-spamming mechanism to avoid the problem of document publishers with a financial interest in driving information network traffic to their documents by attempting to falsify previous users' interest in their documents.
- the assisted network browsing service employs credit card validation (for identification only) and/or CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) to gain evidence that a server device 122 hosting a document 128 is interacting with a legitimate user 112 a.
- embodiments of the present invention may require a user 112 a to opt-in to the logging of network browsing activities.
- the system alerts the user 112 a when data logging is in effect and provides a simple mechanism for reverting to generic network 106 browsing.
- network 106 browsing data may be stored in a secure data center separate from a user 112 a 's other personal data.
- Embodiments of the present invention provide numerous advantages to the user 112 a and to the provider of the assisted browsing service.
- An embodiment of the present invention may improve the user 112 a experience by providing information beyond that provided by the publisher of the document 128 to help the user 112 a determine whether the document 128 associated with a considered hyperlink is worth viewing.
- An embodiment of the present invention may provide advantages to the provider of an assisted browsing service by (1) increasing the stickiness of the browsing experience by giving a user 112 a a compelling reason to identify himself and share interests with the provider, and (2) gathering better data regarding the relevancy of web pages to different users and different classes of users.

- the request signal 130 may comprise a request for third-party-provided information about the document 128 , where third-party-provided information comprises information 134 about the document 128 generated by a source other than the publisher or author of either the first document containing the hyperlink or the document 128 associated with the hyperlink.
- the request signal 130 may further comprise other data.
- the request signal 130 may comprise data related to the first document containing the hyperlink, such as the time required to load the first document, the liveness of the first document, a measure of whether the first document has changed since the user 112 a last viewed it, and the disruptiveness of the first document.
- data related to the first document containing the hyperlink such as the time required to load the first document, the liveness of the first document, a measure of whether the first document has changed since the user 112 a last viewed it, and the disruptiveness of the first document.
- such other data may be transmitted to the server device 104 over the network 106 at a different time than the request signal 130 .
- the other data may comprise information 134 related to the document 128 associated with the hyperlink generated after the user navigates to the document 128 on the user interface of the client device 102 a.
- the client device 102 a receives the information 134 that it requested with the request signal 130 .
- the received information 134 originates from a server device 104 that retrieves the information 134 and transmits it in an information signal 136 over the network 106 to the client device 102 a.
- the client device 102 a causes the requested information 134 about the document 128 to be output in association with the first document containing the hyperlink.
- the information 134 is displayed in a Microsoft Corporation's WindowsTM tooltip located near the hyperlink on a user interface such as Microsoft Corporation's Internet ExplorerTM.
- the information 134 is output in association with the first document using alternative methods, including, but not limited to, status bars, pop-up or persistent windows or right-click menus.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method 300 for assisted network browsing in one embodiment of the present invention implemented by a server device 104 .
