Definitions
- Interactive media e.g., the Internet
- advertisements have great potential for improving the targeting of advertisements (“ads”) to receptive audiences.
- some websites provide information search functionality that is based on keywords entered by the user seeking information. This user query can be an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, targeted ads can be provided to the user.
- a number of problems can arise by the placement of ads with non-ad content (e.g., search results) on devices with small displays, such as, mobile phones or personal digital assistants. If the ads are placed above the non-ad content, the user may be frustrated by the need to scroll or page down in the small display to view the desired non-ad content. If the ads are placed below the non-ad content, the user may not notice the ads, reducing their value to advertisers.
- non-ad content e.g., search results
- a technique, method, apparatus, computer program product, and system are described for vertically displaying text of content items on small display devices.
- individual characters e.g., Chinese, Japanese or Korean characters
- Text strings e.g., Latin characters, a URL included in the text
- the images can be rotated for display in a column.
- a computer-implemented method includes: receiving content items, including text to be displayed on a user's mobile browser; determining whether the mobile browser supports floating text columns; if the mobile device supports floating text columns, determining whether at least some of the text should be displayed vertically on the mobile browser, including determining if non-Latin characters are included in the text; and if the text should be displayed vertically, rotating text characters of at least some of the text to display vertically in a floating text column.
- a computer-implemented method includes: receiving a plurality of content items, including text, to be displayed on a user's mobile browser; determining whether the user's browser supports floating image columns; if the browser supports floating image columns: mapping the text to one or more images; rotating the images of individual text characters that should not be displayed vertically; and displaying the images of rotated text characters that should be displayed vertically and the images of text that should not be displayed vertically in at least one floating image column.
- a computer system includes a means for receiving content items, including text to be displayed on a user's mobile browser; a means for determining whether the mobile browser supports floating text columns; a means for determining whether at least some of the text should be displayed vertically on the mobile browser, including determining if non-Latin characters are included in the text; and a means for rotating text characters of at least some of the text to display vertically in a floating text column.
- a computer system includes: a module for receiving content items, including text to be displayed on a user's mobile browser; a module for determining whether the mobile browser supports floating text columns; a module for determining whether at least some of the text should be displayed vertically on the mobile browser, including determining if non-Latin characters are included in the text; and a module for rotating text characters of at least some of the text to display vertically in a floating text column.
- Displaying ad text vertically next to non-ad content on small display devices allows the ads to be more noticeable without requiring a user to scroll or page down in the small display to view the non-ad content.
- This technique can be especially useful for content displayed in languages where text is commonly displayed vertically, such as, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
- Vertical display of text can be applied to other types of content items, for example, headline news, real time quotes, email header information and announcements. This technique also can apply to local weather, new incoming email highlights or user customized message alerts.
- FIGS. 1-3 are examples of small display devices each displaying one or more vertical text advertisements.
- FIG. 4 is an example of a small display device displaying mixed vertical and horizontal text in an advertisement.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example process for vertically displaying text of one or more content items.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of generic computing devices.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an example process for displaying images of text in a floating text column.
- a computer network such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, can connect advertisers, an advertising system, publishers, and users.
- advertisers can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track advertisement (“ad”) information in the advertising system.
- Publishers may submit requests for advertisements to the advertising system. While reference is made to advertising, other forms of content including other forms of sponsored content can be delivered by the system.
- a search service can receive queries for search results.
- the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search service can submit a request for ads to the advertising system.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the ads provided by the advertising system. This combined information can be sent to (or rendered by) the user device that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- An advertisement from a particular advertiser provided by the advertising system can include a description in the form of a universal resource locator (URL) link to a web page for the advertiser.
- the description of the advertisement may be delivered along with the URL link.
- a user can be directed to the advertiser's web page after the user interacts with (e.g., selects or clicks) the URL link.
- the displays on mobile devices are typically small relative to personal computer (PC) displays, such that Internet services (e.g., Internet search service with advertisement delivery) do not always translate well from typical PC displays to mobile device displays.
- Internet services e.g., Internet search service with advertisement delivery
- certain services must be provided in different formats, e.g. one for the desktop and one for the mobile device display. For example, if an advertiser has advertisements for display on PCs and mobile devices, the advertiser may have different landing pages for the advertisements for the different platforms.
- the presentation of advertisements with search results can differ for different platforms.
- Vertical display of text ads allows the text ads and non-ad content (e.g., search results) to be viewed simultaneously on small display devices (e.g., mobile phones or personal digital assistants).
- This technique can be especially useful for content displayed in languages where text is commonly displayed vertically, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
- Individual characters e.g., Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters
- Latin characters e.g., a URL included in the ad
- headline news, real-time quotes, or other announcements can be vertically displayed.
- FIGS. 1-3 are examples 100 , 200 , 300 , respectively, of small display devices each displaying one or more vertical text advertisements 102 , 202 , 302 , respectively.
- each of the examples 100 , 200 , 300 illustrate vertical text advertisements displayed with Internet search results in Japanese
- vertical text advertisements can be displayed with any type of ad or non-ad content in any language.
- vertical text advertisements can be displayed in one or more locations on the displays of small display devices, such as, along the right-hand side, along the left-hand side, down the center of the small display, or anywhere in between.
- the small displays present floating columns 104 , 204 , 304 , which include the vertical text advertisements, alongside groups 106 , 206 , 306 of Internet search results.
- the floating columns 104 , 204 , 304 can be floating text columns or floating image columns, depending, in part, on the features and limitations of the viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system) for the particular small display device.
- a floating column 104 , 204 , 304 can have a different background color or pattern than the background color or pattern of the rest of the small display to indicate that the contents of the floating column 104 , 204 , 304 include advertising.
- a vertical text advertisement 102 , 302 displayed in a floating column 104 , 304 , respectively, can be delineated from other advertisements in the floating column 104 , 304 by brackets 108 or other symbols.
- a floating column 204 , 304 can include a label 210 at the top of the floating column 204 , 304 to indicate that the contents of the floating column 204 , 304 include advertising.
- the vertical text advertisements 102 , 202 , 302 can include titles and descriptions. In other implementations, the vertical text advertisements 102 , 202 , 302 can only include titles, which can be selectable URL links to the advertisers' web pages.
- the viewer e.g., a browser
- vertical text advertisements will still be displayed in a floating column alongside other content presented in the small display.
- vertical text advertisements can be presented in multiple (e.g., two or three) columns of the small display.
- advertisements can be reformatted to a standard horizontal form if the device is rotated to landscape orientation.
- the advertising system can use the same advertisement selection process whether text advertisements are displayed vertically or horizontally. In other implementations, the advertising system can use a different advertisement selection process when text advertisements are displayed vertically. For example, an advertisement selected (e.g., using a ranking algorithm) for display can be “promoted” or “demoted” to an advertisement slot in a floating column for vertical display from a different advertisement area (e.g., above or below the non-ad content) for horizontal display.
- FIG. 4 is an example 400 of a small display device displaying mixed vertical and horizontal text in an advertisement.
- the small display presents a floating column 404 , which includes a vertical text advertisement 402 alongside a group 406 of Internet search results.
- the vertical text advertisement 402 includes Japanese characters (Kanji and katakana), digits, punctuation, and a URL link written in Latin characters.
- digits, punctuation, and/or Latin characters in a vertical text advertisement can be treated as images and rotated.
- Some digits, punctuation, and/or Latin characters in a vertical text advertisement can be rotated as images while others can be treated as text and displayed vertically.
- Whether digits, punctuation, or characters are treated as text or images can depend, in part, on the features and limitations of a display device's viewer (e.g., a browser). For example, for vertical display of a text advertisement, a browser may need to support floating columns displayed on a left-hand or right-hand side of the device's display. Some browsers, however, allow floating images but not floating text. For these browsers, text of an advertisement can be converted to an image and rotated ninety degrees for display in a floating column.
- the URL link written in Latin characters of the vertical text advertisement 402 is converted to an image and rotated ninety degrees.
- the URL link is displayed as horizontal text in the vertical text advertisement 402 .
- the digits “0” to “9” and punctuation are displayed as rotated images in the vertical text advertisement 402 .
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example process 500 for vertically displaying text of one or more content items.
- the process 500 will be described with reference to an advertising system, which can perform the process.
- the one or more content items are to be displayed by a viewer (e.g., a browser) of a small display device.
- One or more (e.g., multiple) content items including text are received (step 502 ).
- an advertising system can receive multiple text advertisements identified from one or more advertisement databases.
- the received multiple text advertisements can be identified in response to a search query submitted by a user.
- the advertising system can detect the viability or quality of an advertisement for vertical display.
- determining whether at least some of the text should be displayed vertically can include determining that at least some of the text should be displayed vertically if the text includes Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters or if the content item was specified for vertical display by a provider of the content item. For example, an advertiser can specify that a particular advertisement should be vertically displayed alongside search results. In some implementations, when an advertiser specifies an advertisement for vertical display, a bidding algorithm used in the selection and/or ranking of the advertisements for display can be modified.
- determining whether at least some of the text should be displayed vertically can include determining that none of the text should be displayed vertically if the text includes a number of Latin characters that exceeds a defined value (e.g., ten). A determination that none of the text should be displayed vertically can also be made if the text includes a number of consecutive Latin characters that exceeds a defined value (e.g., three). Alternatively or in addition, a determination that none of the text should be displayed vertically can be made if the ratio of Latin characters to all characters in the text exceeds a defined value (e.g., 25%). In some implementations, a determination that none of the text should be displayed vertically can be made if a vertical display length of the content item would exceed a defined value. For example, if the vertical display length of a text advertisement is greater than the vertical dimension of the device's small display, the advertising system can determine that none of the text of the text advertisement should be displayed vertically.
- a defined value e.g., ten
- the text of the content item is displayed horizontally (step 506 ).
- the advertising system can present the text advertisement horizontally above or below non-ad content in the display.
- the advertising system can detect the type of browser supported by the small display device, where certain types of browsers support certain types of markup languages. Examples of markup languages include Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML), Compact HTML (CHTML), and Wireless Markup Language (WML).
- markup languages include Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML), Compact HTML (CHTML), and Wireless Markup Language (WML).
- the markup language supported can determine whether the browser can display floating text columns.
- the at least some of the text of the content item is displayed vertically in at least one floating text column (step 510 ).
- the advertising system can display at least some of the text of a text advertisement vertically in at least one floating text column alongside other received content (e.g., non-ad content).
- reference text cannot be displayed in the vertical direction, such as a reference URL and phone number.
- the text of the content item is mapped to one or more images (step 512 ).
- the images of text that should not be displayed vertically are rotated (step 514 ), for example, by ninety degrees in a clockwise direction.
- the images of text that should be displayed vertically and the rotated images of text that should not be displayed vertically are displayed in at least one floating image column (step 516 ).
- the advertising system can convert the text of an advertisement to multiple images, rotate the images of text to be displayed horizontally, and vertically display the rotated and un-rotated images in at least one floating image column alongside other received content (e.g., non-ad content).
- received content e.g., non-ad content
- text of a content item can be displayed vertically as a selectable hyperlink.
- the vertical text advertisements 102 , 202 , 302 of FIGS. 1-3 can be displayed as selectable hyperlinks to the respective advertiser's web page.
- text of a content item can be displayed vertically in at least one column alongside other received content (e.g., non-ad content), where the at least one column is displayed on a left-hand side or a right-hand side of a display of a mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone).
- a mobile device e.g., a mobile phone
- text of a content item can include an address for a resource associated with the content item, and the address for the resource includes Latin characters.
- the vertical text advertisement 402 of FIG. 4 includes a URL link to the advertiser's web page, where the URL link includes Latin characters.
- the resource address includes Latin characters
- the characters of the resource address can be mapped (e.g., converted) to an image, the image can be rotated, and the rotated image can be displayed in at least one floating image column.
- a determination can be made whether the punctuation character or digit character should be displayed vertically.
- the advertising system can make the determination using one or more rules.
- digits can be presented with vertical text in a single column in block form. For example, the date ‘2008’ can be displayed in a column as
- a two-digit number can be presented horizontally alongside neighboring vertical text, such as
- This kind of presentation can be found in Japanese print media, for example.
- the determination of when to present digits this way can be made based on a number of factors, including but not limited to length or whether the digits are part of a conceptual unit like a date.
- a digit character should not be displayed vertically if the digit character is part of a resource address (e.g., a URL link).
- the digit character can be mapped to an image and rotated with the Latin characters.
- a determination that digit characters should not be displayed vertically can be made if the number of consecutive digit characters is less than a defined value (e.g., three).
- the vertical text advertisement 402 of FIG. 4 has two consecutive digit characters (e.g., “1” and “9”), and a determination is made that the digit characters should be displayed as horizontal text and not vertical text.
- the number of consecutive digit characters equals or exceeds the defined value, it can be determined that each digit character should be displayed vertically with one digit character per line.
- Some punctuation characters (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, or Korean punctuation) defined in Unicode may not be fully supported in some small display device viewers (e.g., browsers).
- the display of punctuation characters can depend on the font used and can differ between different languages. If it is determined that a punctuation character should be displayed vertically, a determination can be made as to which Unicode punctuation character might work best in vertical form. For example, there are multiple “full stop” punctuation characters defined in Unicode (e.g., “ ⁇ ” or “ ⁇ ”). The “full stop” is printed in the center in Chinese, while the “full stop” is printed in the upper right in Japanese. The different appearance might be handled by the font. However, if the font does not handle the different appearance, the particular Unicode punctuation character might be selected for vertical display based on the language used.
