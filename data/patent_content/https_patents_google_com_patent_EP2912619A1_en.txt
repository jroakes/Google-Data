- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a client-server computer network including a plurality of computing devices at a household that communicate with a plurality of web servers on the Internet, the computer network including a router at the household and a remote web traffic logging server that are responsible for associating a web event from the household with a particular member of the household in accordance with some
- the computing devices in the household 180 include one or more computers 103 (e.g., desktop, laptop, tablet, etc.), game consoles 122, smartphones or MP3 players 124, smart TV 117, and TV meter 116 (e.g., a set top box).
- the smart TV 1 17 and the TV meter 116 may be merged together as one device.
- data access requests from these computing devices are sent to the respective web servers 140 though a router 120 in the household, the Internet service provider 128, and communication networks 130.
- the relationship between different household members 118 and the computing devices in the household is many-to-many.
- one household member may send a search query to an on-line shopping website from a computer 103 while another household member may visit a social networking website from the smart TV 117 at the same time.
- the same household member may be using the game console 122 to play an on-line game at one moment and sending an electronic message to a friend from his or her smartphone 124.
- these web events may be all captured by the router 120, the many-to-many relationship between the household members and the computing devices makes it difficult to determine which household member is behind a particular data access request.
- a household member who is a panel participant is often required to first log into his or her account from a computing device that he or she is going to use to browse the Internet.
- Terms of use between the household and/or the individual members and an agency that is interested in collecting data associated with the household's web activities may provide that no individual- level data will be collected for a web session unless that particular individual has logged into collection software or his or her account with the agency or otherwise consented to collection of information prior to that web session.
- terms of use the agency needs to get a prior approval from the household members before collecting any data from the household or using their data for any other purpose.
- the agreement specifies a protocol that the household members need to follow to make sure that the data collected from the household is not only legitimate but also meaningful so that a third-party data analyst (e.g., a sales person from an advertising company) can derive useful results from the data.
- a third-party data analyst e.g., a sales person from an advertising company
- a household member also known as a panelist
- the subsequent web browsing activities should be logged or not.
- the household when a household agrees to have its web browsing activities logged, the household provides demographic information for each household member and generates an account for each household member at the web traffic logging server 150 using the demographic information.
- the household may also provide a list of computing devices that the household members use to browse the Internet. Such information is stored at the household member at the web traffic logging server 150 and maybe the router 120. Whenever the household purchases a new computing device or stops using an existing computing device, it should update the household's associated device information accordingly. Note that the computing devices with Internet accessibility in a household can generally be divided into two distinct groups.
- a first group of computing devices such as the computer 103 and the smartphone 124 usually have more generic and/or accessible user interfaces and operating systems such that it is relatively easy for a third-party developer to develop an application for different household members to log into his or her account and provide instructions to the router 120 and the web traffic logging server 150.
- a second group of computing devices such as the smart TV 117 and the game console 122 run on a more proprietary operating system that makes it more difficult for supporting a third- party application (e.g., an application for panelist registration).
- a third- party application e.g., an application for panelist registration

- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating components of the web traffic logging server for collecting and organizing web traffic data from different households in accordance with some implementations.
- the web traffic logging server 150 includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 302 for executing modules, programs and/or instructions stored in memory 312 and thereby performing processing operations; one or more network or other communications interfaces 310; memory 312; and one or more communication buses 314 for interconnecting these components.
- the web traffic logging server 150 includes a user interface 304 comprising a display device 308 and one or more input devices 306 (e.g., keyboard or mouse).
- the memory 312 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices.

- memory 312 or the computer readable storage medium of memory 312 stores the following elements, or a subset of these elements, and may also include additional elements:
- a network communications module 318 that is used for connecting the web traffic logging server 150 to other computers via the communication network interfaces 310 and one or more communication networks (wired or wireless), such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on;
- the web traffic analysis module 320 further including one or more classifiers (e.g., a gender classifier module 322 or an age classifier module 324) to characterize the responsible individuals for those data access records that the routers at different households are unable to associate particular household members for these records;
- classifiers e.g., a gender classifier module 322 or an age classifier module 324
- each record (328- 1 , ... , 328-M) including a unique record ID 330 and associated web traffic data 332 and household data 334 (e.g., information extracted from the data access records submitted by different routers); and
- each record (338-1, ..., 338-N) including information collected from a particular household such as a user information record 340 for each household member.
- the computing devices shown in the figure communicate with the web servers 140 through the router 120.
- each data access request from any of these computing devices goes through the router 120 before reaching its destination, which gives the router 120 a unique opportunity to check whether this request is uniquely associated with a particular household member using a particular computing device. If so, the router 120 can generate a data access record accordingly. Otherwise, the router 120 can leverage the other information it has to lower the chance of reporting a data access request to the web traffic logging server 150 without being able to identify who is responsible for the request.
- FIG. 4 A is a flow chart illustrating a first interactive process performed by a first computing device (e.g., a router 120) and a second computing device (e.g., a computer 103) for attempting to identify a household member responsible for a data access request received by the first computing device in accordance with some implementations.
- a household member may choose to order a book from an on-line bookstore using a tablet computer.
- the tablet computer needs to send a data access request (e.g., an HTTP request) to a web server associated with the on-line bookstore and the first stop of the data access request is the router 120 (401).
- a data access request e.g., an HTTP request
- the router 120 Upon receipt of the data access request (403), the router 120 checks one or more parameters in the data access request (405) and then takes appropriate actions accordingly. For example, the router 120 extracts a device ID from the data access request that indicates which second computing device in the household the data access request comes from.
- the device ID is an IP address of the second computing device (e.g., a laptop computer).
- the device ID is a MAC address of the second computing device (e.g., a smartphone).
- the router 120 looks up its own memory to determine whether the user of the second computing device has provided his or her personal information as well as authorization to associate the data access request with the user's personal information (407). As described above in connection with FIG.
- a computing device record associated with the device ID may include the user information indicating, e.g., which household member is currently using the second computing device and, if so, whether the household member has granted any authorization for the router 120 to associate the data access request with the household member.
- the router 120 determines that a household member has previously logged into his or her account and also provided authorization of having his or her web browsing activity logged under his or her name, the router 120 then generates a data record (e.g., a data access record) for the request (411), the record including at least an identifier of the data access request (which is uniquely assigned to the data access request by the router 120 or by the web traffic logging server 150), the household member's personal information (e.g., a user ID) and maybe the device ID identifying the second computing device from which the request comes.
- a data record e.g., a data access record
- the record including at least an identifier of the data access request (which is uniquely assigned to the data access request by the router 120 or by the web traffic logging server 150), the household member's personal information (e.g., a user ID) and maybe the device ID identifying the second computing device from which the request comes.
- the router 120 may determine that there is no user information in the device record associated with the device ID, which might happen if a household member starts browsing the web without logging into his or her account according the protocol. In this case, the router 120 may look up the user records to identify one or more user identifiers that are associated with the second computing device (413). As noted above, each household member is supposed to provide a list of computing device that he or she often uses for browsing the Internet. After identifying the user IDs associated with the second computing device from which the data access request comes, the router 120 then returns the personal information associated with the user identifiers to the second computing device (415). For example, the router 120 may return the names of the household members that have registered using the second computing device.
- the second computing device Upon receipt of the personal information (417), the second computing device then displays the personal information to the current user of the second computing device.
- a computing device like a tablet or a smartphone may have a pre-installed application for a user of the device to log into his or her account at the router 120.
- the second computing device may render a list of user icons on its screen, each user icon representing one household member that has registered using this device.
- the second computing device returns the personal information associated with the user-selected user icon to the router 120 (412).
- the router 120 then generates a data access record accordingly as described above in connection with the step 411. By doing so, the household member currently using the second computing device may retroactively provide his or her personal information and authorization for associating the data access request with the household member.
- the approach described above may be achieved by the router 120 exposing a predefined application programming interface (API) to the second computing device through which the second computing device can exchange data with the router 120 and instruct the router 120 to perform user-designated operations.
- API application programming interface
- a user of the second computing device may launch an application on the device and log into his or her account at the router 120 by providing his or her user name and password (if necessary) to the router 120.
- the application is also used by the household to update their personal information and device information stored at the router 120 as well as the web traffic logging server 150.
- a household member using the second computing device can refuse to authorize the router 120 to associate data access requests from the second computing device with the household member after logging into his or her account.
- the router 120 does not generate any data access record or send anything about the household member's web browsing events to the web traffic logging server 150.
- a household member may log into his or her account at the beginning or during the middle of a web browsing session but without notifying the router 120 whether it is authorized to log the web browsing session. In this case, the router 120 assumes that lack of authorization means a denial and therefore takes no further action of logging the web browsing session.
- the router 120 may generate a data record for the data access request (409), the data record including an identifier of the data access request, an identifier of the second computing device, and optionally a type of the second computing device, and then send the data record to the web traffic logging server 150 for further processing.
- FIG. 4B is a flow chart further illustrating how the first computing device (e.g., the router 120) processes a data access request from a second computing device in accordance with some implementations.
- the first computing device first receives a data access request from a second computing device (431).
- the data access request is generated by a user of the second computing device for accessing data service at a remote server (e.g., a web server).
- a remote server e.g., a web server
- the first computing device determines whether the user has previously provided personal information and authorization to the first computing device through the second computing device (433).
- the first computing device then generates a record for the data access request, the record including the user's personal information and an identifier of the data access request (435). If the user's personal information is found but the user's authorization is not found, the first computing device generates a record for the data access request, wherein the record includes an identifier of the data access request and an identifier of the second computing device (437). If neither of the user's personal information and authorization is found, the first computing device identifies one or more user identifiers that are associated with the second computing device (439) and then returns personal information associated with the one or more user identifiers to the second computing device (441). The personal information associated with the one or more user identifiers is to be displayed on the second computing device so that the user of the second computing device can choose personal information associated with one of the one or more user identifiers.
- the first computing device in order to determine whether the user has previously provided personal information and authorization to the first computing device, extracts an identifier of the second computing device from the data access request and identifies a computing device record using the identifier of the second computing device. Next, the first computing device checks the computing device record to determine whether it includes personal information of the user of the second computing device and authorization to associate the user's personal information with the data access request.
- a household member may use a newly-purchased computing device to browse the Internet before even registering the device and the router 120 cannot identify a computing device record using the identifier of the second computing device.
- the first computing device determines a device type for the second computing device in accordance with the data access request, e.g., whether the second computing device belongs to the first group or the second group as described above.
- the first computing device then generates a new computing device record using the identifier of the second computing device and the determined device type.
- the first computing device sends a registration message to the second computing device, wherein the second computing device is configured to render a graphical user interface that prompts the user of the second computing device to provide personal information and authorization to the graphical user interface and forward the user-provided personal information and authorization to the first computing device.
- the first computing device updates the new computing device record using the user-provided personal information and authorization.
- FIG. 5A is a flow chart illustrating a second interactive process performed by a first computing device (e.g., the router 120) and a second computing device for attempting to identify a household member responsible for a data access request received by the first computing device in accordance with some implementations.
- the second computing device may be a computer 103 that provides a user login service through which the household member can log into his or her account at the router 120 or a game console 122 that may not have the user login service associated with the router 120.
- the router 120 Upon receipt of the data access request (503), the router 120 checks one or more parameters in the data access request (505) and then takes appropriate actions accordingly. For example, the router 120 extracts a device ID from the data access request and then identifies a device record associated with the device ID. If there is no personal information or authorization associated with the second computing device, the router 120 cannot associate the data access request with a particular household member. However, the router 120 can determine whether the second computing device provides a user login service or not based on the information in the device record (507). For example, as noted above in connection with FIG. 1, some devices like the computer 103 and the smartphone 124 can provide a user login service associated with the router 120 whereas other devices like the smart TV 117 and the game console 122 may not.
- the router 120 finds out that the second computing device provides the user login service (507-yes), the router 120 then notifies the second computing device to render its login service on its screen (509). Upon receipt of the notification (510), the second computing device then renders the user login service by displaying the personal information of the household members to the current user of the second computing device. For example, the personal information may be rendered in the form of a list of user icons on its screen, each user icon representing one household member that has registered using this device. In response to a user input by, e.g., selecting one of the user icons (513), the second computing device returns the personal information associated with the user-selected user icon to the router 120 (515).
- the router 120 then generates a data access record accordingly as described above in connection with the step 411. But if the router 120 finds out that the second computing device does not provide the user login service (507-no), e.g., if the data access request is from the game console 122, the router 120 determines an identifier for the second computing device (519) and generate a data record for the data access request (521).
- the data record may include an identifier of the data access request, an identifier of the second computing device, and optionally a type of the second computing device, which may be processed by the web traffic logging server 150 subsequently. In some
- the router 120 performs the operations associated with the steps 519 and 521 only if there is a prior approval from the household (e.g., when the household signs the agreement with the agency that manages the web traffic logging server 150).
- FIG. 5B is a flow chart illustrating how the first computing device processes a data access request from a second computing device in accordance with some implementations.
- the first computing device first receives a data access request from a second computing device (531).
- the data access request is generated by a user of the second computing device for accessing data service at a remote server (e.g., a web server).
- the first computing device examines the data access request to determine whether the second computing device provides a user login service through which the user can authorize the first computing device to associate the data access request with the user of the second computing device (533). If the second computing device provides the user login service, the first computing device then causes the second computing device to collect personal information and authorization from the user of the second computing device using the user login service (535).
- the first computing device generates a data record by associating the data access request with the user's personal information in accordance with the user's authorization (539). If the second computing device does not provide the user login service, the first computing device then generates a data record by associating the data access request with an identifier of the second computing device (541).
- the first computing device in order to examine the data access request, extracts an identifier of the second computing device from the data access request and identifies a computing device record using the identifier of the second computing device.
- the first computing device checks a device type of the computing device record to determine whether the second computing device provides the user login service. For a computing device that has no corresponding device record, the first computing device then determines a device type for the second computing device in accordance with the data access request, e.g., whether the second computing device belongs to the first group or the second group as described above. The first computing device then generates a new computing device record using the identifier of the second computing device and the determined device type.
- the first computing device sends a registration message to the second computing device.
- the second computing device renders a graphical user interface that prompts the user of the second computing device to provide personal information and authorization to the graphical user interface and then forwards the user- provided personal information and authorization to the first computing device.
- the first computing device then updates the new computing device record using the user-provided personal information and authorization.
- the second computing device does not has any of the plurality of predefined device types (e.g., the second computing device is a smart TV or a game console), the first computing device then updates the new computing device record using the identifier of the second computing device.
- FIG. 6 A is a flow chart illustrating a third interactive process performed by a first computing device (e.g., a router 120), a second computing device (e.g., a computer 103 or a game console 122), and a third computing device (e.g., a computer 103 or a smartphone 124) for attempting to identify a household member responsible for a data access request received by the first computing device in accordance with some implementations.
- the second computing device may or may not be able to provide a user login service whereas the third computing device can provide a user login service.
- the router 120 Upon receipt of the data access request (603), the router 120 checks one or more parameters in the data access request (605) and then takes appropriate actions accordingly. For example, the router 120 extracts a device ID from the data access request and then identifies a device record associated with the device ID. If there is no personal information or authorization associated with the second computing device, the router 120 cannot associate the data access request with a particular household member. However, the router 120 can determine whether the second computing device provides a user login service or not based on the information in the device record (607).
- the router 120 finds out that the second computing device provides the user login service (607-yes), the router 120 then notifies the second computing device to render its login service on its screen (609). Upon receipt of the notification (610), the second computing device then renders the user login service by displaying the personal information of the household members to the current user of the second computing device. For example, the personal information may be rendered in the form of a list of user icons on its screen, each user icon representing one household member that has registered using this device. In response to a user input by, e.g., selecting one of the user icons (613), the second computing device returns the personal information associated with the user-selected user icon to the router 120 (615). The router 120 then generates a data access record accordingly as described above in connection with the step 411.
- the router 120 finds out that the second computing device does not provide the user login service (607-no), e.g., if the data access request is from the game console 122, the router 120 then identifies a third computing device that is physically proximate the second computing device (619). As described above in connection with FIG. 2, the router 120 may store the location information of the computing devices. In some implementations, a computing device (e.g., a tablet or a smartphone) may update its location information using the API offered by the router 120.
- a computing device e.g., a tablet or a smartphone
- the router 120 may identify this smartphone as the third computing device and notifies the smartphone to render its user login service (621).
- the third computing device Upon receipt of the notification (623), the third computing device then renders the user login service by displaying the personal information of the household members to the current user of the second computing device.
- the personal information may be rendered in the form of a list of user icons on its screen, each user icon representing one household member that has registered using this device.
- the third computing device In response to a user input by, e.g., selecting one of the user icons (627), the third computing device returns the personal information associated with the user-selected user icon to the router 120 (629). The router 120 then generates a data access record accordingly by associating the data access request with the user's personal information provided by the third computing device (631).
- FIG. 6B is a flow chart illustrating how the first computing device processes a data access request from a second computing device in accordance with some implementations.
- the first computing device first receives a data access request from a second computing device (631).
- the data access request is generated by a user of the second computing device for accessing data service at a remote server (e.g., a web server).
- the first computing device determines whether the second computing device provides a user login service through which the user can authorize the first computing device to associate the data access request with the user of the second computing device (633).
- the first computing device then causes the second computing device to render the user login service so that the user can provide an instruction of whether or not to associate the data access request with the user of the second computing device (641).
- the first computing device Upon receipt of the user's personal information and authorization from the second computing device, the first computing device generates a data record by associating the data access request with the user's personal information in accordance with the user's authorization. If the second computing device does not provide the user login service, the first computing device then identifies a third computing device that is physically proximate the second computing device (635).
- the third computing device provides a user login service through which the user of the second computing device can authorize the first computing device to associate the data access request with the user of the second computing device or any other computing devices within the household.
- the first computing device then causes the third computing device to output an audio or visual alert signal prompting the user of the second computing device to respond (637).
- the third computing device is a smartphone, it may generate a predefined ringtone or flash its screen in a predefined manner to get the household members' attention.
- a user of the second computing device who notices the alert signal then provides instructions of whether or not to associate the data access request with the user through the user login service provided by the third computing device.
- the first computing device generates a data record accordingly (639).
- the first computing device in order to determine whether the second computing device provides a user login service, extracts an identifier of the second computing device from the data access request and identifies a computing device record using the identifier of the second computing device.
- the first computing device checks a device type of the computing device record to determine whether the second computing device provides the user login service. For a new computing device that has no corresponding device record, the first computing device determines a device type for the second computing device in accordance with the data access request, e.g., whether the second computing device belongs to the first group or the second group as described above. The first computing device then generates a new computing device record using the identifier of the second computing device and the determined device type.
- the first computing device sends a registration message to the second computing device.
- the second computing device renders a graphical user interface that prompts the user of the second computing device to provide personal information and authorization to the graphical user interface and then forwards the user-provided personal information and authorization to the first computing device.
- the first computing device then updates the new computing device record using the user-provided personal information and authorization.
- the first computing device selects one computing device record among a plurality of computing device records that has been identified as being physically proximate the second computing device and also providing the user login service.
- the first computing device sends an alert message to the third computing device.
- the third computing device outputs the alert signal prompting the user of the second computing device to respond by rendering a graphical user interface that prompts the user of the second computing device to provide personal information and authorization to the graphical user interface and then forwards the user- provided personal information and authorization to the first computing device.
- the first computing device then generates a data record for the data access request, the record including the user-provided personal information and the identifier of the data access request.
- first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another.
- first ranking criteria could be termed second ranking criteria, and, similarly, second ranking criteria could be termed first ranking criteria, without departing from the scope of the present invention.
- First ranking criteria and second ranking criteria are both ranking criteria, but they are not the same ranking criteria.
- the phrase “if it is determined [that a stated condition precedent is true]” or “if [a stated condition precedent is true]” or “when [a stated condition precedent is true]” may be construed to mean “upon determining” or “in response to determining” or “in accordance with a determination” or “upon detecting” or “in response to detecting” that the stated condition precedent is true, depending on the context.
- stages that are not order dependent may be reordered and other stages may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned, others will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover, it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware, firmware, software or any combination thereof.
