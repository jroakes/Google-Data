Embodiment
The detailed description stated below is intended to the description as the various configurations of this subject technology and is not intended to represent the unique configuration can putting into practice this subject technology.Accompanying drawing is herein incorporated and forms a part for embodiment.Specifically describe and comprise providing the specific detail being thoroughly interpreted as object to this subject technology.But, know and it is evident that this subject technology is not limited thereto the specific detail of place statement and can puts into practice when not having these specific detail.
This theme openly provides for using the social networks of agency's (such as specific to the signal in territory) to arrange in (such as arranging specific to territory and/or based on the social networks of grade), content recommendation may system and method maximally related with user to understand what content.Specific to territory social networks arrange refer to those wherein described content be directed to specific properties collection or territory social networks arrange.The community that the user preference that social networking service based on grade comprises certain content that is that share around user and/or that wish consumption builds.In some instances, described preference can comprise Aesthetic Style or appearance (such as about fashion or household and design).
In such community, be different from other social networking service, the signal of the people that such as user is paying close attention to and the intimate degree between this user and those users paid close attention to by this user possibly cannot provide user may wish the useful designator of the content type seen on website.Stronger signal for content recommendation can be the school designator (such as selected clearly by user or determine based on the User Activity about content) of the general preference of indicating user.This school is used as the agency for understanding maximally related inclusive segment.Exemplarily, this theme openly describes and uses the concept of style as school designator for understanding the maximally related inclusive segment for user in fashion or home decoration social networking service.It should be understood, however, that similar system and method can realize recommending and user-dependent content in various social networking system.
School can be provided for poly-group of the higher level being mapped to the content that user may like.Such as, people may the type of content (such as aesthetic, text etc.) that may appreciate of the content provider (such as brand, author, fabricator, sponsor etc.) of preference, people and can expect that model can be mapped to specific school for the creator of content of checking and be associated with this school based on user and be provided to this user for user transmits.When creating the mapping between this user and agency's (such as school, style), the OK range of the necessary overlay content of definition of agency.That is, this agency must be restricted to and make it not be the narrow definition that possible cause the broad definition of information overload or possibly cannot recommend appropriate content to customer consumption.
Limit and use these schools as understanding the strong form providing recommendation with the agency of user-dependent content type, because it makes recommended engine that school can be used to be mapped to different entities in every way.Such as, arrange about fashion or home decoration, the example physical that style can be mapped to is different brands, with style or the model of classifying with the product that this style represents.By creating the mapping between school and the different entities type being mapped to this school, dissimilar signal can be produced to create recommended engine of good performance.Supplier (such as brand, author, fabricator, publisher etc.), content type and creator of content (such as content distributed user) can complete in every way to the mapping of specific genre.In one example, this mapping manually can perform based on the structuring relevant to this entity or non-structured data.In some instances, the historical act be associated with this entity can be used to map this entity by specific genre.In some embodiments, this mapping can based on the content of the model at website place (be such as included in model about what entity and which user has issued such model).
Described school allows this system recommendation model and the product relevant to representing the entity of school to the mapping of these entities, and does not need this user to pay close attention to each entity respectively clearly.Such as, if brand A is included in school X and user indicates preference to school X, then any product with brand A or any model comprising the project with brand A recommendedly can give this user.Similarly, if model B is classified as represent school X, then model B can recommendedly give the interested user of school X.Similarly, if personage C tends to create the model relevant to school X or comprise the project of the brand being mapped to school X, then this system can recommend the model that created by personage C.
Once this mapping is created, recommends to occur in contrary direction, wherein can be used to recommend school to user to the understanding of the user preference of entity (such as brand, author, user, product).If then user selects to pay close attention to the school recommended, then larger signal (being such as mapped to the entity of recommended school) set can be used for content recommendation.
This process reduce user pay close attention to people, supplier, author, brand and classification big collection to find needs that are interested and related content.Instead, this user can pay close attention to specific genre, and described specific genre plays the effect of agency to all these entity types and can be changed along with the time and/or upgrade (such as based on the mapping of various entity to single school).The agency's (such as school) allowing user to subscribe the preference be used to indicate in content provides the process for the airborne streaming to system.Agency based on school widely allows user quickly through the initial step of registration service and starts social experience of navigating fast.Described process described herein decreases and allows relatively complete experience, because user need not subscribe a large amount of entities before being provided acceptable inner capacities for airborne to the friction in new service.Instead, to this user, the inner capacities that quick and simple mode receives the full experience that can allow in social network environment is provided to the reservation of the one or more schools being mapped to different entities.
The use acted on behalf of as preference instruction allows dynamically updating and the mapping to novel entities because novel entities becomes available Agent Definition further.Because the group that can meet the content of specific genre (such as style) can change in time, so due to the dynamic property of Agent Definition, the experience of user can automatically upgrade (such as in real time).The use of agency further based on the User Activity relevant with the content being mapped to school (such as, such as share, annotate and comment on, comment on, issue, subscribe, doings that model is checked, as the purchase of the result of doings and content, suggestion etc.), be provided for providing the information about the trend sending out pass with various flows.Such information can be that the supplier (such as businessman, businessman, manufacturer) to the different trend of interesting understanding is useful.Such as, described information can to understand user preference be useful and provide about target market (such as to the interested user of the particular tendency) useful information maximum to the content response of what type.
Depend on the territory of the content being supplied to user, identify that the mode of school can change.In some embodiments, the list of the various schools be associated with the content at website place (being such as mapped to the school of various content) can be supplied to user, and user can select school to subscribe.In other examples, represent that the entity of school can be provided to user's (such as visually) and this user can provide preference (such as grading or Yes/No preference) for each entity, and can be that this user identifies suitable entity to the preference of various entity based on user.Such as, arranging about fashion or home decoration, compared to attempting with correct lexical representation, can be subjective and more easily graphical identification to the expression of style.People can by checking that style easily identifies that what they like and do not need to know the details how expressing this style definitely.By the vision of various school or the description of text be supplied to user or identify that school provides the simpler mode that identifies the interested content type of user and this user can not be needed to understand at the very start express them may all language specific to territory required for interested school based on the preference of user to entity.
The user of social networking service can create association each other.Phrase as used herein " social networking service " comprises that it is blunt with common implication, includes, but are not limited to online service, is absorbed in platform or the website of the social activity association built between reflection user.These associations can be stored in the socialgram of each social networking service place (such as safeguarding at remote server 120 place).Such user-association can define on the basis of user to user, or is defined as the user's group be associated by the member relation in group.
