- FIG. 3D is a flowchart of an example process for saving and using content across multiple linked requesting sources associated with a user.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure.
- Requesting sources can include mobile devices (e.g., smart phone), laptop computers, tablets, desktop devices, set-top boxes, televisions, browser, applications on a mobile device, or stand-alone applications.
- the devices can be linked and used in this way, for example, without storing personally identifiable information associated with the user.
- a user with a mobile device may view a resource on a first device (e.g., a web page).
- the resource can be saved as a bookmarked resource on the first device. Later, the user can re-call the bookmarked resource on a second different device.
- a user can view an advertisement for a camera, and the advertisement may include a coupon or other offer.
- the user may briefly check out the camera on a web site, but may decide to wait until later to fully investigate details regarding the camera and/or to make a purchase.
- the user can bookmark a web page that is associated with the camera, or the user may save the advertisement or the coupon.
- the user may use a different device (e.g., a laptop computer or personal computer) to access the saved content, e.g., using the bookmarked web page or the saved advertisement or coupon.
- a different device e.g., a laptop computer or personal computer
- the saved content is available to the user in these examples because the devices are linked, e.g., using anonymous linking of requesting sources without requiring the user to be logged in to a service per se.
- a user service can be used to facilitate the collection of linked resource information, which can then be used for saving and re-calling content across multiple linked requesting sources associated with a user. For example, when a user logs onto a user service from a first device (e.g., the user's home PC), a public key-private key pair can be determined and the public key can be published. The public key can be associated with the user's first device and stored by the user service. The private key can be stored locally. Subsequently, when the user logs into the service from a second different device, the second different device can also determine a public-private key pair. Each device can subsequently compute a secret key using the device's own private key and the other device's published public key.
- a first device e.g., the user's home PC
- the public key can be associated with the user's first device and stored by the user service.
- the private key can be stored locally.
- the second different device can also determine a public-private key pair. Each device
- the secret key can be stored in combination with anonymous identifiers of each device, thus creating a linking or association between the devices.
- the association can be used to link or associate an impression on one device to a user interaction (e.g., a conversion) on a second different device.
- a user's different devices provide one example of different requesting resources for which conversions can be tracked.
- different requesting sources can include a mobile device including a smart phone, a laptop computer, a tablet, a desktop device, a set-top box, a television, a browser, an application on a mobile device, or a stand-alone application. Other requesting sources are possible.
- the anonymous identifiers can be cookies, browser cookies, device identifiers, or other identifiers that are associated with each device.
- the mapping can identify all of the devices associated with the user without storing personally identifiable information (PII) associated with the user.
- PII personally identifiable information
- information included in the mapping can be used to assist in selecting relevant content to be provided to the user.
- the selection of relevant content can include decisions regarding how content is delivered to the user, such as and including, limitations on when or how content is delivered. For example, the number of impressions of an advertisement can be limited to a fixed number of impressions per user per time period regardless of how many devices the user uses.
- anonymous identifiers can be associated with different browsers or other applications on the same device.
- the techniques described in this disclosure can be used to link two or more identifiers of applications that may have different cookie spaces on the same device, or applications on different devices, or a combination of both.
- linking anonymous identifiers can be used in handshaking among mobile applications or a combination of mobile applications, browsers and other applications.
- mobile applications may each have their own cookie space even on the same device which can prevent handshaking with other applications.
- Each mobile application can use the techniques described herein to generate, for example, a private key an a public key, publish the public key, access public keys of other mobile applications (or associated with other devices), and compute secret keys using their own private keys and the public keys of other mobile applications (or associated with other devices).
- users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable programs or features that allow the user to be discovered across multiple devices and/or to be provided content based on the discovery.
- the user can enable/disable programs or features related to the use of user interactions on anonymously-linked requesting sources.
- the mapping process can be repeated periodically to ensure that the anonymous identifiers (e.g., cookies) are not stale, thus keeping session history information for the user up-to-date.
- the anonymous identifiers e.g., cookies
- the cookies on a computer can expire over time, or a user can clear a cookie, resulting in setting a new cookie. Repeating the cookie-mapping process periodically can ensure that the current set of cookies belonging to the user are correctly mapped. While reference is made to cookies, other forms of anonymous identifiers that include or have been derived from a seed can be used.
- user session history information can be stored anonymously.
- the session history information can include a user's browsing history, the times that the user has seen a particular advertisement, and other session history information.
- the information can be stored in association with the anonymous identifiers described herein.
- session history information associated with the user's session on a first device can be stored in a table that includes the anonymous identifier associated with the first device.
- the same table can also be used to store the same user's session history information for the user's session on a second device.
- a separate or the same table can be used to store associations among the anonymous identifiers.
- anonymous identifiers, the associations (e g, linking to the secret key), and the session data all can be stored, for example, without any corresponding personally identifiable information for a given user.
- a request for content (e.g., an advertisement) can be sent from any of the devices associated with that user (the request including an anonymous identifier associated with a given device).
- the session history information stored in the tables can be used in determining, for example, advertisements that may be of interest to the user responsive to the received request. The determination can include inferences for the user based on the user's stored session history information.
- the session history information for the user can be aggregated, e.g., by joining tables using the anonymous identifiers. For example, a request for content can be received, and the request can include an anonymous identifier associated with a user's desktop device.
- the received anonymous identifier can be used to look up the user's other anonymous identifiers (e.g., for mobile and other devices of the user).
- the retrieved set of anonymous identifiers can be used to access session history information in the other tables (e.g., user browsing history).
- all of the session history information can be joined together for the respective devices producing aggregated information.
- the aggregated session history information can be provided to a content management system in order to determine and select eligible content for delivery to the user responsive to the received request. For example, because the session history information can include the number of times that the user has seen a particular advertisement, the content management system can help to avoid selecting an advertisement for the user which has already been presented a predetermined number of times.
- aggregating the information can occur on demand, e.g., in real time after a request for content occurs.
- the user's session history information stored individually by anonymous identifier in the various tables, can be joined. Aggregating the information in real time can solve issues, for example, related to whether the user has consented to being provided content based on the devices used by the user. For example, session history information for a device for which the user has not consented will not be aggregated with other session history information.
- the information for a user can be aggregated and stored in advance of any requests for content. For example, all of the user session history information can be stored in a third table, e.g., that includes all of the user session history information across all of the user's devices.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers 109 , and the content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 and publishers 109 .
- the example environment 100 further includes a user login service 120 that can provide, for any particular user, access to the user's Web services, e-mail, social networks, business applications or other resources.
- the user login service 120 can receive login requests from the user, such as through a Web browser or other application running on any device associated with the user.
- the login request can include, for example, the user's login ID (e.g., a unique identifier, an email address, a phone number, or any other identifier for the user that can be used for verifying the user at login).
- the user login service 120 can also maintain information related to the devices on which the user is currently logged on, or has been logged into recently.
- the information can include, for example, a mapping of anonymous identifiers for the devices with a session key that does not contain personally identifiable information associated with the user.
- the mapping can be stored, for each user, in a data store of linked anonymous identifiers 122 , or in some data structure.
- a data store of stored bookmarks 123 can store bookmarks and/or references (e.g., URLs or other links) to the bookmarks.
- Each bookmark stored can be associated with a resource that is presented to a user on a first requesting source for which the user has requested to be able to later access on the same or a different source.
- the bookmark (and/or reference to the bookmark) can include storing a reference to a first identifier, e.g., an anonymous identifier associated with the first requesting source. Linking the anonymous identifiers 122 allows for association of a bookmarked item with plural different requesting sources.
- the associated resource e.g., bookmarked web page, saved advertisement or saved coupon
- the associated resource can be made available to the user on a different, linked requesting source than the source originally used to set the bookmark.
- the user login information 121 or some other data store can store user login IDs, public keys and initial seeds.
- the information can be used by a second device used by a user to access the public key published by a first device used by the same user.
- the user's first device can access the public key published by the second device.
- seed values can be read from the user login information 121 by any of the user's devices and used to determine a secret key.
- a data store of user consents and privacy preferences 142 can include information that the user has provided regarding if and how information about the user's different devices can be used.
- users can use one or more user preferences web page that may be part of (or separate from) the user login service 120 .
- users can set a preference that says, “Do not link my different devices,” or selectively identify which devices are allowed (or not allowed) to be linked. Then, before any operation is performed that may link the anonymous identifiers of the user's different devices, the user's consents and privacy preferences can be checked, and the linking will be performed only if allowed by the user.
- the user may specify settings that prohibit providing content based on the linking. For example, while the user may allow his smart phone and PC to be linked, the user may decide that no content (e.g., advertisements) should be provided based on the linking.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 can be data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- the search results 118 include the content itself, such as a map, or an answer, such as in response to a query for a store's products, phone number, address or hours of operation.
- the content management system 110 can generate search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- slots on search results pages or other web pages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process.
- a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria.
- a schedule e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X
- content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation).
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals and behavioral signals. Other information, such as user identifier information that is associated with the mappings described above, can be used and/or evaluated when selecting eligible content.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a cost per thousand impressions (CPM) bid.
- CPM cost per thousand impressions
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by recognizing a user when the user has accessed resources using multiple devices. For example, if it is known that a content item (e.g., an advertisement) has already been seen by a user on a first device (e.g., the user's home PC), then a determination can be made (e.g., through parameters) whether or not to provide the same content item to the same user on a different device (e.g., the user's smartphone). This can increase the likelihood of a conversion, for example, by either repeating impressions of an advertisement or avoiding subsequent impressions, depending on how multiple impressions for the advertisement to the same user are predicted to lead to a conversion in either case.
- a content item e.g., an advertisement
- a first device e.g., the user's home PC
- a determination can be made (e.g., through parameters) whether or not to provide the same content item to the same user on a different device (e.g., the user
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by a content server.
- FIGS. 2A-2E collectively show an example system 200 for providing content to a user who is recognized when using multiple different devices.
- recognition of the user across different devices can be achieved by linking anonymous identifiers of the user's multiple different devices.
- an anonymous identifier 206 a of a first device 106 a e.g., a desktop computer of a user 202
- an anonymous identifier 206 b of a second different device 106 b e.g., a laptop computer of the user 202
- the system 200 can be part of the environment 100 that is described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- An example sequence of events (e.g., with numbered steps 0 and 1 a through 8 ) follows for associating the anonymous identifiers 206 a and 206 b and providing content based on the association.
- other sequences can also be used to link devices 106 a , 106 b and additional devices 106 associated with the user 202 .
- the devices 106 a , 106 b and additional devices 106 can be linked using associations stored in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- the associations can be stored, for example, without storing any personally identifiable information for the user 202 .
- the user login service 120 (or the content management system 110 ) can check 107 the user's user consents and privacy preferences 142 to see if the user has consented to such linking. For example, if the user has specified not to allow the user's devices to be linked (or use information thereof), then steps 2 a though 6 b will not occur, and the content provided in step 8 may be different.
- a first step 1 a (e.g., as allowed by the user) of the sequence of steps can occur, for example, when the user 202 logs into the first device 106 a (e.g., the user's desktop computer) using a login service (not shown in FIGS. 2A-2D ).
- the login service or some other component can receive a login request 208 a from the first device 106 a .
- the login request 208 a can be associated with the anonymous identifier 206 a (e.g., a cookie or device identifier) associated with the first device 106 a .
- the login request 208 a and/or other login requests can be requests to log into a social service.
- the user login information 121 can store user login IDs 210 , seeds 212 and public keys 214 associated with multiple users.
- the user login information 121 can serve as a directory that includes one or more entries, each entry indexed by an identifier associated with a given user (e.g., user login identifier, email address, or some other identifier).
- information stored for the user in the user login information 121 can include a login ID 210 a , a seed 212 a (e.g., a generator-prime pair, such as 7, 11, that is usable by all of the user's devices), and, as will be discussed in further detail below, a public key 214 .
- the public key 214 has not yet been determined for the current user.
- seeds 212 can vary by user, e.g., the seed 212 b (e.g., generator-prime pair 11, 13) for a second user can be different from the seed 212 a.
- the first device 106 a can read a seed 216 a (e.g., a generator-prime pair 7, 11 from the user login information 121 ) and create a private-public key pair that is associated with the user 202 using the first device 106 a .
- creating the private-public key pair can include, at step 3 a , computing 218 a a private key (e.g., 9) and computing a public key (e.g., 4).
- generation of public and private keys can use generator G, prime P pair (e.g., 7, 11), where G ⁇ P, an example of which is described with reference to FIG. 2F .
- the public key is published 220 a , e.g., stored as the public key 214 a .
- the private key 9 and the public key 4 constitute the private-public key pair, yet each typically is stored in a different location.
- the private key 9 can be stored locally on the first device 106 a , e.g., in local storage 221 a .
- the public key (e.g., 4) can be stored in the user login information 121 as the public key 214 a .
- the public key 214 a can be stored in a row 222 that includes user login information for the user 202 on one or more devices (e.g., devices 106 a and 106 b in the current example).
- the row 222 can serve as a directory entry associated with the user 202 .
- Each of the other rows can be used to store information for a different user.
- a seed 216 b (e.g., the generator-prime pair 7, 11) can be read (e.g., from the user login information 121 ) and a second private-public key pair that is associated with the user can be created.
- the second private-public key pair is associated with the user 202 using the second device 106 b .
- the second private-public key pair is different than the private-public key pair that is associated with the login by the user 202 on the first device 106 a .
- creating the second private-public key pair can include, at step 3 b , computing 218 b a private key (e.g., 6) and computing a second public key (e.g., 8).
- the second public key is published 220 b , e.g., by adding the second public key to the set of public keys stored as the public keys 214 a .
- the private key 6 and the public key 8 constitute the second private-public key pair (e.g., ⁇ 6, 8>), the values of which are different from those of the private-public key pair computed for the first device 106 a (e.g., ⁇ 9, 4>).
- the private key 6 can be stored locally on the second different device 106 b , e.g., in local storage 221 b .
- the public key (e.g., 8) can be stored, for example, in user login information 121 with the public key 4 from the first device 106 a .
- the directory entry stored in the row 222 (and associated with the user 202 ) is updated, now including two public keys.
- the second different device 106 b can create a secret key 226 a (e.g., 3) using the public key (e.g., 4) from the first device 106 a and the second private key (e.g., private key 6 from local storage 221 b ).
- the second different device 106 b can also associate 228 a the second anonymous identifier (e.g., “Device ID 2”) with the secret key (e.g., 3).
- the association can include storing the association, e.g., in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- the linked anonymous identifiers 122 can include secret keys 230 and anonymous identifiers of the same users 232 .
- a row 234 can include a secret key 230 a (e.g., 3 or a hashed representation of 3) and the anonymous identifier 232 b (e.g., “Device ID 2”) that corresponds to the association that occurred in step 6 a .
- the user may log in again at the first device 106 a .
- a login request 208 c can be received (e.g., by the login service) from the user at the first device 106 a .
- the login request 208 c can be similar to the login request 208 a described above.
- the login service for example, can determine that a public key exists for another device associated with the user, e.g., the second different device 106 . Using the additional public key, a link or association can be made between the two devices 106 a and 106 b as described in further detail below.
- the stored value can be a hashed version of the secret key, e.g., using a one-way hash function.
- the first device 106 a can create a secret key 226 b (e.g., 3) using the public key (e.g., 8) from the second different device 106 b and the first private key (e.g., private key 6 from local storage 221 a ).
- the secret key can match the secret key computed by the second different device 106 b .
- the first device 106 a can also associate 228 b the second anonymous identifier (e.g., Device ID 2) with the secret key (e.g., 3).
- the association can include storing the association, e.g., in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- the row 234 containing the secret key 230 a (e.g., 3) and the anonymous identifier 232 b (e.g., “Device ID 2”) can be updated to also include the anonymous identifier 232 a (e.g., “Device ID 1”).
- the anonymous identifiers 206 a and 206 b as well as the devices 106 a and 106 b , are now linked. Further, the association among the user's various devices is achieved without storing any personally identifiable information associated with the user.
- one or more anonymous identifiers such as anonymous identifier 232 a or anonymous identifier 232 b can appear in multiple rows (e.g., three or more) in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- This can be an indication, for example, that the device associated with the anonymous identifier is a shared device (e.g., at a library or an Internet café).
- the logins by several different users e.g., three or more
- the highly-shared devices when highly-shared devices are detected in this way, the highly-shared devices can be un-linked, or other considerations can be taken. For example, thresholds can be established, and if a cookie or other anonymous identifier appears in more than three rows, the associated can be considered a shared machine.
- the content management system 110 can receive a request for content 240 a or 240 b (e.g., a request for advertising content) from either the first device 106 a or the second different device 106 b .
- the request for content 240 a can be a request for an advertisement to fill an advertisement slot 242 a on a web page 244 a displayed on the first device 106 a .
- the request for content 240 b can be a request for an advertisement to fill an advertisement slot 242 b on a web page 244 b displayed on the second different device 106 b .
- the request for content 240 a is from the first device 106 a , for example, then the request for content can include the first anonymous identifier 232 a . Otherwise, if the request for content 240 b is from the second different device 106 b , for example, then the request for content can include the second different anonymous identifier 232 b.
- the content management system 110 can provide a content item (e.g., content items 246 a or 246 b ) in response to the request and using the association that maps the user 202 to multiple devices (e.g., from the linked anonymous identifiers 122 ).
- the association can be represented by information in the row 234 that associates anonymous identifiers 232 a and 232 b , e.g., based on the same secret key 230 a .
- the content management system 110 can, for example, treat the requests for content as if they originate from the same user, regardless of the particular user device.
- identifying eligible content items for the request for content 240 b can depend on content already provided to the same user 202 on the first device 106 a .
- an advertisement for California vacations, for example, that is intended for one impression per user can be shown on the first device 106 a and not repeated again on the second different device 106 b .
- Devices 106 a and 106 b are two examples of devices that the user 202 may use.
- the user 202 may use a third different device 106 c (e.g., a smart phone).
- the user login service 120 can store a third different anonymous identifier 232 in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- all three devices 106 a - 106 c can be associated with the user 202 , e.g., using the secret key 230 a.
- the user login service 120 can store fourth and fifth different anonymous identifiers in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 (e.g., stored in association with the second user using a secret key 230 that is different from the secret key 230 a ).
- FIG. 2F shows example calculations of public, private and secret keys.
- Device A calculations 250 provide examples for computing a public key, a private key and a secret key on a first device, e.g., the first device 106 a .
- Device B calculations 252 provide examples for computing a public key, a private key and a secret key on a second different device, e.g., the second different device 106 b .
- Other methods can be used to determine public, private and secret keys.
- the calculations can occur in steps, e.g., steps 254 a - 254 e .
- steps 254 a - 254 e both devices A and B can exchange a prime P (e.g., 11) and a generator G (e.g., 7).
- the prime and generator can be stored in the user login information 121 , as described above. For example, a prime and a generator that is unique to a user (and the devices associated with the user) can be determined and stored at a time that one or more entries in the user login information 121 are created and stored.
- each device can generate its own private key, e.g., using a random number or in some other way.
- device A's private key can be 6, and device B's private key can be 9.
- These private keys can be used in combination with at least the generator and prime from step 1 254 a to determine public and private keys in the following steps.
- each device can compute a public key.
- computing the public key can use a formula that includes the generator raised to the power of the device's private key, and a modulo P can be performed on the result.
- the generator, prime, and each of the devices' private keys the resulting public keys for the devices can result in being 4 and 8, respectively.
- the devices can share their public keys, e.g., by publishing the keys in the user login information 121 as described above.
- device A can know device B's public key (e.g., 8), and device B can know device A's public key (e.g., 4).
- secret keys can be computed, e.g., using a formula that raises the other device's public key to power of the current device's private key, and the result can undergo a modulo P (prime).
- the secret key for the first and second devices can be 3.
- the value can be used by either device to update the row in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 with the device's anonymous identifier. This can be repeated for any other device associated with the same user that computes the secret key using its own private key and the public key from one of the other devices.
- FIG. 2G shows an example sequence of events for saving and using content across multiple linked requesting sources associated with a user.
- the requesting sources can include the first device 106 a (e.g., the user's mobile device) and the second different device 106 b (e.g., the user's personal computer).
- Stage 1 of the example sequence of events can include a linking of the two devices 106 a and 106 b .
- the two devices 106 a and 106 b can be linked by the content management system 110 , e.g., using linked identifier information stored in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- Each identifier for example, is associated with a user and a specific requesting source.
- the anonymous linking includes linking at least two different identifiers that are associated with two different requesting sources used by the user to access content, in this example, devices 106 a and 106 b .
- the linked anonymous identifiers 122 do not store user login information, account information, personal information or any other information that would make it possible to easily identify the user. While a Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol is described herein as one possible way for anonymously linking identifiers, other techniques can be used to anonymously link requesting sources.

- the content management system 110 can store a reference (e.g., a URL) associated with the resource (e.g., web page 244 a ) in the stored bookmarks 123 as part of the save process.
- Other example content items stored can include a link or other reference for the advertisement 273 and a link, reference or other way for accessing the coupon 275 .
- the bookmarks associated with the user can be synched across multiple requesting sources, and the synching can be facilitated by using the anonymous linking of the plurality of identifiers to link bookmarks that are associated with different identifiers. For example, the synching can occur automatically without requiring an explicit user account creation or a user login step.
- a request 264 is received from the user 202 , e.g., to access a saved bookmark.
