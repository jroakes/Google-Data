Now, with each various embodiment of descriptive system.Following description provides the specific detail that is used for thorough and allows to describe these embodiment.Yet, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that and can under the situation of the many details in not having these details, implement said system.In addition, some known structures or function possibly not be illustrated in more detail or describe, so that avoid unnecessarily making the associated description of each different embodiment smudgy.
The term contemplates of using in the description that hereinafter provides with its most widely rational method make an explanation, even it combines the detailed description of specific embodiments more of the present invention and is used.Specific term even possibly stress hereinafter; Yet any expection all will obviously and particularly be limited in this embodiment part with the term that the mode of any restriction makes an explanation thus.
Part i-foreword
1.
System and user thereof
People visually absorb (consume) information from (printing with the show) medium that reproduce, and comprise the information that appears with text, image, video and other forms.For example, people read newspaper, magazine, books, blog, text message, billboard, receipt, note or the like; Browse photo, drawing, object, advertisement or the like; And watch film, video, performance, other people or the like.People are likewise in the information that acoustically absorbs from the many sources such as radio and TV.In fact, people receive and absorption information through the world of observing and listening attentively to theirs on every side simply always.
It can be positive (user perceives and often participate in information) or passive (user does not perceive, but still receives information) that such information absorbs.The individual is acquired information wittingly, frequent " towing " information of people for example, perhaps the individual can information by " pushing " to they the time acquired information (passiveness absorption) by mistake.In a sense, people its how with the world mutual aspect the equipment (computing machine, mobile phone and other equipment) of imitation towing information and the information that receives pushing.
Yet equipment is not the people, and the information that current equipment is caught through being everlasting in the surrounding environment is perhaps done badly near the message context of this equipment.The disclosed technical description of this paper launch and promote the system and method for the perception of equipment.This technology can promote near the text based information perception of equipment, near the information perception based on image of equipment, show the perception of (the for example document of Zai Xianing) or the like for the information near equipment.Use this disclosed technology, equipment can be at them how with the world mutual aspect the imitation people.Although be described as usually hereinafter with visually appreciable document is mutual, system likewise can be configured to collect and handle the information based on audio frequency.
1.1 physics/digital, interactive
In fact, each physical message show with or can be related with the numerical information of adding.For example, image can be related with description (for example metadata), webpage or the like; Single speech can be with definition, to tie up basic clauses and subclauses, advertisement or the like related; Document can be related with its electronic copies, webpage, lantern slide or the like; Geographic position (the perhaps object of position) can be with metadata, image, about the associating information of this position; Audio stream can be related with lantern slide; Or the like.Under the situation that exists physical message to show, system only need identify this information and show that (perhaps the part aspect of this information demonstration, the for example text in this information demonstration) is so that obtain the visit for related information.System makes physical message show can serve as such platform, and it is mutual to create out the abundant digital third dimension that comprises user and content by this platform.
1.2 reproduce the sign of document
In some cases, the document that sign is reproduced can provide the visit for a large amount of additional informations to the reader, and these information are replenished document itself and enriched reader's experience.For the document of each reproduction with electronic copies, the partial information in the document of reproduction can be used for identifying electronic copies.In some instances, system acquisition and use samples of text from the document that reproduces so that the electronic copies of sign and location document.In some cases, the samples of text that system needs is very little, because often can be as the identifier of the document that reproduces and as the link of its electronic copies from some speech of the text of document or part speech.In addition, system can use these speech so that not only identify document, and the position in the sign document.Therefore, can use system that this paper discusses with many useful related document that reproduces of modes and their digital copies.
Therefore, can use system that this paper discusses with many useful related document that reproduces of modes and their electronic copies.
Briefly; When some speech in the document that scanning input is reproduced, character or zone; System can obtain electronic copies document or its certain part; Show electronic copies or its certain part; Through Email it is sent to the someone, buy it, print it; It is published to webpage, perhaps carry out make the user can with document or other mutual actions of related content.For example; The user hovers over his/her mobile device (and camera) part top of newspaper or magazine article; Make user's mobile device on the touch-screen of this mobile device, show the electronic version of article, and to the user provide allow the user further with the mutual option of article.In some cases, for example when mobile device detected the certain proximity apart from article, hovering over the article top can be so that mobile device switches to document perception or interactive mode.
System realizes these and many other instances of " paper/numeral is integrated ", and need not to change into the current process of writing, printing and publishing document and the demonstration of other information, thus the brand-new digital function layer of document that reproduces and physical object.
In case system is with passage in the document that reproduces and the optional network specific digit entity associated of having set up, system just can make up the function of flood tide in this association.
The documents that great majority reproduce have can visit on WWW or can perhaps can for example make addressable electronic copies in response to the payment of expense or deposit from other online databases or document complete or collected works visit.So, under the simplest level, when the user catches some speech in the document of reproduction; System can obtain electronic document or its certain part, shows it, through Email it is sent to the someone; Buy it, print it, and/or it is published to webpage.As additional instance; Some speech of catching the individual books of during breakfast, reading can be so that the audio frequency in this people's the automobile-books version begins to read aloud from that time that he begins to drive to go to work, and the sequence number of perhaps catching on the ink-cases of printers can begin to order the process of replacing.
The typical case of system uses the text to use capture device to catch from the document that reproduces to begin, but is important to note that other catching methods of the object of other types are suitable for equally.Therefore, system is described to catch or scan the text from the document that reproduces sometimes, and wherein these term definitions are following.
The document that reproduces is the document that shows on document or the display or the monitor of printing.It is human appreciable document, still is in of short duration demonstration no matter be in permanent form.It is the physical object that information is provided through presentation layer.The document that reproduces comprises information that the presentation layer of paper document, billboard, sign, computing equipment provides, the information (for example audio or video information flow) through the ripple propagation and/or appears or other physical objecies of display message.
Catching or scanning is the process from the systems inspection of the document acquired information that reproduces.This process can relate to the optical acquisition of using the camera in mobile phone for example or the hand-held optical scanner, and perhaps it can relate to and document is read in audio capturing equipment loudly or on keypad or keyboard, it is keyed in.For more instance, referring to the 15th joint.
Except catching text from the document that reproduces; System can also catch the information from other sources such as radio-frequency (RF) identification (RFID) label, QR sign indicating number, bar code, other physical objecies (for example drawing, sculpture); Catch directly information from the presentation layer of computing equipment, or the like.Although system is described as in this article usually and document that print or demonstration is mutual and catch the data from these documents; But system can easily be configured to replacedly or additionally with based on the information interaction of audio frequency and catch information based on audio frequency, the information that this information for example receives from radio or television broadcasting.Therefore, other information sources can comprise the data based on audio frequency and/or video, for example radio programming on the radio channel and other guide; Video on the video channel and other guide, for example TV programme, television advertising or the like no matter be to reproduce from the local medium such as video disc, still are to send from remote server stream, or the like.As an instance, system can catch the information from audio-source, and the information or the supplemental content of the relevance of the audio stream of demonstration and this audio-source or the generation of should originating.
2.
System's profile
This joint is described some in equipment, process and the system that is configured for the integrated system of paper/numeral.In different instances, system is providing various services of structure and application on this bottom core of basic function.
2.1
Process
Figure 1A is the data flow diagram that the information flow among some embodiment of suitable system is shown.Other instance possibly not use all stages or the element that illustrates here, and some instances then use much more stage or element.
Capture device such as the mobile device with camera and/or voice recorder catches 100 from the document that reproduces or from text and/or other information of the information that shows near this equipment.Equipment can be handled 102 data of catching, for example so that remove information of the interior hope of pseudo-shadow, raising signal to noise ratio (S/N ratio), sign or the locator data of acquisition procedure or the like.System passes through identification component (for example OCR equipment, speech recognition apparatus, auto-correlation equipment or other technologies described herein) then alternatively with 104 one-tenth one or more signatures of data-switching, for example text chunk, text skew or other symbols or character.Replacedly, system carries out the replacement form of extracting one or more document signature from the document that reproduces.In some cases, signature is represented one group of possible text transcription.In some cases, this process possibly receive the influence or the constraint of feedback of the step of or follow-up execution previous from other.For example, before identified under the situation of catching the candidate documents that is derived from probably in system, it can dwindle the possible explanation of raw captured.
After-treatment components can receive from the data of identifying and filter 106 these data as required and perhaps carry out other operation.In some instances, for example when system acquisition during to phrase that comprises the enough information of inferring user view or symbol, system can infer immediately and under the situation that does not proceed to the subsequent step in the routine, confirms, sign and/or carry out directly action.In these cases, system can need not to identify or reference numerals copy document so that realize user's hope.
In step 108, system can construct an inquiry then or a group polling is searched for and caught related electronic copies or other guide being used to.Some aspects of this query construction possibly depend on the search procedure of use; And system can step afterwards in (for example after carrying out search) carry out them; But typically the certain operations that will exist system to carry out in advance for example removes identification or the incoherent character of obvious mistake.
System transmits 110 to search and contextual analysis parts with a said inquiry or a group polling.Raw data can be attempted to identify from its document of catching by system.For this reason, system can use search index and search engine 112, about user's knowledge 114 and/or about user's context or the contextual knowledge 116 of wherein catching.For example, system can be mutual with search engine 112, this search engine adopt and/or index especially about the document that reproduces, about their digital copies document and/or about the information of document with network (internet) existence.System can utilize these information sources to come transmission back information, and can be with other different steps of information feed-in routine of sign.For example, system can receive language, font, reproduction and the possible ensuing speech about catching based on receiving the knowledge of candidate documents during the step 110.
In step 120, system can obtain the copy of the one or more documents that are designated the electronic copies of reproducing document previously.System is access document source and warehouse 124 (for example local filing system or the database or the webserver) directly, and perhaps system can get in touch access services 122 so that obtain one or more documents.Access services 122 can be executed authentication, safety or the payment of document, and other services perhaps can be provided, and for example especially document is converted to the form or the language of hope.
The application of system can utilize the part or all of related of additional functionality or data and document.For example, advertisement applications can be related with the part of specific advertisement information or theme and document (for example key word, phrase or apart from the degree of approach of certain content).Stipulate that it should can be considered to the one or more coverings on the document and be called mark here with available together additionally related function or the data of the specific part of document.Therefore, in step 130, any mark that system banner is relevant with the electronic copies of data of catching and/or sign.In some cases, mark is provided by other users of the user of document, creator, publisher, document or the like, and can be stored in 132 places, source that can directly visit or dynamically generated by mark service 134.In some instances, mark can be associated with and be applied to digital copies or any or the two the group in these documents of document of document and/or the reproduction of reproduction.
As some or the whole results in the previous step, system can take or carry out 140 actions.These actions can be the system default actions, for example write down the information that finds simply, can depend on data or document, perhaps can from labeled analysis, derive.In some cases, system can give another system with data transfer simply.In some cases; The possible action of catching at the specified point place in the document that is fit to reproduce will be presented to the user as the menu on the display of association, and the display of said association is display of capture device (touch-screen of mobile device) or related display (screen of user's laptop computer) for example.System can in response to saidly catch, in response to the user's request of carrying out one or more actions or time marking afterwards or carry out one or more actions.
As an instance that can how to use capture device, the reader can utilize the camera related with her mobile device to catch the text from newspaper article.The text is captured as bitmap images through camera.Logic stores this bitmap images in the storer and with this image into and adds a cover timestamp, and the record and catch other related data (the for example position of equipment, geographic position data or the like).Logic is also carried out optical character identification (OCR) and image transitions is become text.System uploads to text and newspaper content associated index, and identifies and obtain the electronic copies of article.Capture device is then with the one or more actions that will carry out; Screen displaying electronic copies through association; Said action is for example downloaded and is checked that relevant article perhaps provides the article of additional background information; Add term in the bright article and the link that is provided to the definition of these terms, perhaps check in the article or the advertisement or the purchase information of the project of discussing on every side.
Other details about systematic procedure, parts and/or equipment can find in the application that is incorporated in by reference among this paper.As noted above; Although system is described in this article usually and document that print or demonstration is mutual and catch the data from these documents; But will understand like those skilled in the relevant art, system can easily be configured to replacedly or additionally with based on the information interaction of audio frequency and catch information based on audio frequency.
Figure 1B is the data flow diagram that the information flow in the instance of suitable system is shown.Capture device 155 is caught from information source 150 and the information that appears such as other source (not shown) with source that equipment wireless is communicated by letter, for example text, audio frequency, video, gps coordinate, user's attitude, bar code or the like.At step 160 place, the information that information conservator parts are collected and storage is caught by capture device 155.At step 165 place, system will pass to the capturing information processing element from the information that capture device is collected.Capturing information processing element 165 is configured to detect the existence of the document of reproduction, it is text filed from document, to extract; And analytical documentation information is so that discern document and text feature, for example absolute and relative layout information, paragraph, row and word shade or profile, font correlated characteristic and character code.In some instances, the capturing information processing element can be configured to handle the data type that is different from text, for example audio frequency, compass data, GPS, acceleration, history, temperature, humidity, body heat or the like.In some instances, when capture device is caught or send more information, the capturing information processing unit will along with the information of time integral information and compound accumulation so that for example form the bigger and/or more high-resolution image of information source.In some instances; The capturing information processing element can be utilized context (referring to the 13rd and 14 joints); User's previous information of catching for example is so that for example the treatment capacity of carrying out through restriction or expansion and the hypothesis that instructs anything just being processed instruct capturing information to handle.For example; If system identifies the user recently and has caught the information from particular source; Less processing possibly needed so that obtain similar determinacy level so subsequently about the information of newly catching; Because the search in the limited possibility space can obtain coupling apace, this coupling can further be confirmed (if desired) then.The capturing information processing element can be for example through automatically confirming or refuse the prediction of information based on tentative conclusion; Perhaps through utilizing protocol service (Concierge Service) 170 (referring to the 19.8th joint); Perhaps through request user feedback, the information that checking identifies.In step 175, system will catch and information processed as system a historical and contextual part and storing.
At step 180 place, (referring to 4.2.2,13 and 14 joints) are searched for based on information processed and context by system.In some instances; Can and make it relevant along with the time integral Search Results, for example Search Results intersected so that solve ambiguity (for example a plurality of parts of Ji Lu audio frequency, from the audio frequency of a plurality of frequency bands, multiple image or the like) based on the subclass of the information of catching along with the time.In some instances, can be for example can be based on the Flame Image Process parts to the further verification search result of former reason capturing information processing element of the additional analysis of Search Results (perhaps document manager parts 185 obtain document information) and the information and executing of catching.For example, if search unit generates 10 possible results, the capturing information processing element possibly confirmed wherein 6 unlikely match search results so, for example the pattern of the perpendicular pen in the text.At step 185 place, if document is identified, the document manager parts of the system expression that can obtain the document so.At step 190 place, the relevant dynamic and/or static tay of expression of the document that perhaps obtains with the document of text of exporting from the capturing information treatment step and/or sign can calculated and/or obtain to the flag member of system.For static and dynamically labeled more information, referring to the 5th joint.In some instances, text one is identified, and flag member just produces mark based on the text and the document identification of sign concurrently.
At step 195 place,, information can be presented to the user.In some instances, this information can comprise: feedback, for example move capture device so that the suggestion of Ju Jiaoing better; Highlight in the image that covering is caught is so that indicate possible area-of-interest, and it is included in the user possibly and capture device is hovered under the situation of same area top selecteed area-of-interest impliedly; The version of clean new reproduction of imaging text, its matching image yardstick, layout, to capture device when forward view modeling or the like; Tabulation based on the actions available of current area-of-interest; Take the result of single action based on current area-of-interest, for example automatically dial phone number; Use to be fit to be designated as the audiovisual materials that the template of one or more information types of its area-of-interest appears by the user; Show and/or audio frequency based on the area-of-interest presentation information.In some instances, area-of-interest can be by the zone and the formation of the bigger in succession zone (for example phrase, subordinate clause, row, paragraph, row, article, page or leaf, phase, publication or the like) around the area-of-interest of center of user concealed or explicit indication.In some instances; Main area-of-interest is advised based on the position in the image by system; The center of capture device screen for example; And this main area-of-interest can be through explicit user interactions or through hovering near same area in the short time period; Perhaps mutual through user and screen, for example gently sweep the somewhere that finger perhaps pats in the area-of-interest of suggestion and select through striding area-of-interest.
2.2
Parts
Like what discussed here, suitable system or operating environment comprise some various parts.For example, system can comprise one or more optical acquisition equipment or speech capture device (for example mobile phone and other multi-functional mobile computing devices, hand-held scanner equipment or the like).Capture device uses wired or wireless connection or communicates by letter with the miscellaneous part such as computing machine or other mobile devices of system through network.
Capture device on the network, computing machine and miscellaneous part can comprise the storer that comprises computer executable instructions, and these executable instructions are used to handle the data of catching from the document that reproduces and other sources or the information (for example screen or monitor show information) of reception.
Fig. 2 is the component diagram of the parts in the typical implementation that under the situation of typical operation environment, is included in system.As shown in the figure, operating environment comprises one or more capture devices 216.In some instances, capture device is supported perhaps " audio frequency " copy of optical acquisition.Each capture device can use direct wired or wireless connection or communicate by letter with other parts such as computing machine 212 of system through network 220; This capture device can use wired or wireless connection to communicate by letter with said network 220, and the latter typically relates to wireless base station 214.In some instances, capture device is communicated by letter with the miscellaneous part of system through cellular telecommunication network (for example GSM or CDMA).In some instances, capture device is integrated in the mobile device, and shares some audio frequency of using in this equipment and/or optics alternatively so that carry out Speech Communication and take pictures.
Same available on network 220 be search engine 232, document source 234, user account service 236, mark service 238 and other networks services 239.Network 220 can be corporate intranet, public internet, mobile telephone network or certain other network or above any interconnection.Tube apparatus and parts mode coupled to each other is not how, and they can be according to known business transaction and communication protocol (for example transmission control protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP)) operation.In some instances, many functions of system and ability can merge or be integrated in the capture device.
In different instances, the function and the ability of capture device 216 and computing machine 212 can be integrated in the equipment whole or in part.Therefore, the term capture device can refer to identical equipment with computing machine, and this depends on whether this equipment has merged the function or the ability of capture device 216 and computing machine 212.In addition, realize on any one that the some or all of functions of search engine 232, document source 234, user account service 236, mark service 238 and other network services 239 can be in said equipment and/or unshowned other equipment.
2.3
Capture device
Capture device can be caught from object, information through use and shown and/or the optics or the image-forming block of the view data of the document that reproduces or use caught the user the oral audio recorder of reading aloud or the additive method of the text that shows are caught text.In some instances; Capture device also can be caught image, film, graphical symbol and icon or the like; Comprise machine readable code, although for example bar code, QR sign indicating number, RFID label or the like are these related actions of text that need not be used for discerning document or execution and document usually or catch.In some cases, the image of the environment that capture device also can capture device comprises the image of the object around the equipment.Equipment can be extremely simple, and depend on other functions in other places in the system of residing in and only comprise converter, some memory storages and data-interface, and perhaps it can be the equipment of more full characteristic, for example smart mobile phone.In some cases, equipment can be the mobile device with image and audio capturing and playback capability, and it stores and move or carry out the one or more application programs that realize some or all of functions described herein in storer.
Capture device comprises the capture element of catching the text that shows from the document that reproduces and other information, symbol, figure or the like.This capture element can comprise image-forming block, for example optical scanning head, camera, optical sensor or the like.
In some instances, capture device is to be used for scanning the portable scanner from text, figure or the symbol of the document that reproduces.This portable scanner comprises the scanning element of the text of catching from the document that reproduces, symbol, figure or the like.In some instances, the document on being printed on paper, the document of reproduction also comprises the document on the screen that is presented at such as CRT monitor or LCD display.
Fig. 3 is the block diagram that an instance of capture device 300 is shown.Can be that mobile phone and/or other move or a portable set or a group communication devices; The capture device 300 that comprises the article (for example glasses, clothes, cap, ornaments or the like) that laptop computer, clipboard or net book, people wear can comprise capturing means 310, for example camera, image-forming block, scanner head, microphone or other voice-frequency senders or the like.Under the situation when capture device 300 is mobile phone, capturing means 310 can be the camera related with phone, for example is used in the sensor based on cmos image in many commercially available phones.Capture device 300 is under the situation of digital camera therein, and capturing means 310 can comprise mirror system, prism, lens and/or the view finder of camera.In other cases, capturing means can be not with integrated independent parts of the camera of phone or additional parts (not shown), comprise non optical component in some cases.
In some instances of system, capture device 300 comprise one or more can conversion capture device 300 and/or the parts of the operation of other computing equipments and system.Capture device 300 also can comprise detection part 330, and it detects equipment when near the information that can be caught by equipment 300.Detection part 330 can be the part of capturing means 310 or integrate (for example identifying the interior text of image that image-forming block is caught) with capturing means 310; It can be the proximity sensor of measuring the distance between capture device 300 and this equipment object (document, billboard or the like) on every side; Can be the orientation sensors at the orientation of measuring capture device 300 (with respect to pitch angle of x, y or z axle or the like), or the like.Described among this paper about the mutual other details between capturing means 310, display unit and/or the detection part 330, comprised the routine of carrying out by these parts.
For example; Capture device 300 is operating in information capture pattern following time or can some or all of routines described herein and method during in the operation application controls that is started by adjusted parts 340, comprises document and the information of sign and the associating information of catching, the action of the associating information of carrying out and catching (for example buy product, display ads, present side information, renewal network log or the like).Capture device 300 can be through capture device 300 the program of store memory storage carry out in said routine and the method some or whole, said program for example download to capture device 300 program, be integrated into program in the operating system of capture device 300 or the like.
Except parts described herein; Capture device 300 also can comprise miscellaneous part, for example related with operation of equipment operation of equipment parts 350 (processing element, memory unit, power component, SIM and other safety components, the input block such as keypad and button or the like), is used for communication component 360 (wireless station, GSM/ sub-district parts, SMS/MMS and other message transmit block, Bluetooth (bluetooth) with external network and/or other computing device communication
TMParts, RFID parts or the like), the parts 370 (GPS and other geographic position sensors, accelerometer and other motion sensors, orientation sensors, temperature and other environment measurement parts or the like) and the miscellaneous part 380 of contextual information are provided to equipment; For example audio converter, external modulation or the vibrating mass of feedback is provided and/or is used to receive button, roller or touch sensor, perhaps information is sent to the user and receive touch-screen from user's input from user's input to the user.
Logical block can read the time signal from the clock unit (not shown).In some instances, capture device can have power supply (not shown) on the plate.In other instances, can supply power to scanner 302 from the connection such as USB (universal serial bus) (USB) connects to the band cable of another equipment.In some instances, capture device 300 can be crossed over a plurality of independent device distribution.
2.3.1 information perception capture device
System can comprise that being used for definite capture device confirms the parts of the operation of change capture device near the information such as the document that reproduces and based on this.In some instances, the capture device degree of approach parts that comprise the camera of the document of catching reproduction or other information images displayed and detect the degree of approach that shows apart from the document that reproduces or other information.These degree of approach parts can be or can utilize the optics in the camera, perhaps can be independently parts, for example proximity sensor.System can show (the for example object of videotex) and mutual with it pattern at definite capture device so that capture device is changed into perception text, document and/or other information with pattern during near information.For example, under the document acquisition mode, system can initiate to catch document or the information images displayed of reproduction and based on such one or more processes of carrying out action of catching through capture device.
Part ii-system's field summary
Become more general along with paper-numeral is integrated, existence can change over and utilize this integrated or make many aspects of the prior art that it can more effectively be realized.Some problems in outstanding these problems of this joint.
3.
Search
Searching documents complete or collected works, even as WWW big complete or collected works, also become nothing to be surprised at for using keyboard structure to send to for the domestic consumer of search inquiry of search engine.This joint and ensuing part discussion are from structure of catching the inquiry that causes that reproduces document and the two the aspect of search engine of handling such inquiry.
3.1
As the catching/speak of search inquiry/key in
The use of described system typically comprises that with use the more any speech of catching from the document that reproduces in the Several Methods of those methods above-mentioned begin.Input needs certain explanation so that convert thereof under the situation of text, for example under the situation of OCR or phonetic entry, possibly have end-to-end feedback in the system, makes the document complete or collected works can be used for strengthening identifying.Can be through carrying out identification or approximate, one group of one or more candidate matches document of sign of explaining and using then from the possible information matching in the candidate documents and further improve or limit said identification or end-to-end feedback is used in explanation.Candidate documents can be carried out weighting according to their possible correlativity (for example based on having caught from other number of users of the information of these documents or they in the popularity on the Internet), and these weights can be applied to this iteration identifying.
3.2
Short phrase searching
Owing to strengthen greatly when the relative position of these speech is known based on the selection power of the search inquiry of some speech, thereby only need catch a spot of text so that the position of system banner text in complete or collected works.Modal is that input text will be contiguous word sequence, for example short phrase.
3.2.1
According to the short position of seeking in document and the document of catching
Except the document in phrase source, location, system can also identify the position in the document and can take action based on this knowledge.
3.2.2
Seek the additive method of position
System also can adopt the additive method of for example finding document and position through the watermark on the document that uses reproduction or other special tokens.
3.3
Other factors are merged in the search inquiry
Except the text of catching; Other factors (promptly about user identity, profile and contextual information) also can form the part of search inquiry, knowledge of the time of for example catching, user's identity and geographic position, user's custom and activity recently or the like.
Document identification with catch other relevant information especially can form search inquiry under situation that their occur quite in the recent period a part with previous.
Unique identifier that user's identity is can basis related with capture device and/or biometrics or other side informations (speech pattern, fingerprint or the like) are confirmed.
3.4
The knowledge of the unreliability in the search inquiry (OCR mistake or the like)
Search inquiry can be constructed through the type of error that occurs probably in the specific catching method of considering to use.Its instance be the indication specific character identification in suspicious mistake; In this example, search engine can be regarded these characters as asterisk wildcard or distribute their lower priority.
3.5
Be used to carry out/local cache of the index that off-line uses
Sometimes, capture device possibly not communicated by letter with search engine or complete or collected works when data capture.For this reason, can in advance the off-line to equipment be used helpful download of information to equipment, perhaps certain entity that to communicate by letter with it of the equipment of downloading to.In some cases, can download all related or the index of considerable part with complete or collected works.This theme will further be discussed at the 15.3rd joint.
3.6
The inquiry of quovis modo can and be worked by record afterwards
If exist probably and transmission inquiry or related delay or the cost of reception result, the information of this prestrain can improve performance, the reduction communications cost of local device and provide help and user feedback timely so.
In the situation of available (local device " off-line ") of not communicating by letter therein, can preserve inquiry and it is transferred to the remainder of system in the time such as communication recovery.
In these cases, possibly importantly inquire about the transmission time with each stabs.The time of catching can be the key factor in the explanation of inquiring about.For example, the 13.1st joint has been discussed and the early stage importance of catching relevant capture time.Be important to note that capture time is always not identical with the time of carrying out inquiry.
3.7
Parallel search
From the reason of performance, can catch and in turn or start a plurality of inquiries concurrently in response to single.Some inquiries can be caught and send in response to single, for example neologisms being added to when catching, perhaps so that inquire about a plurality of search engines concurrently.
For example, in some instances, system will send to the search engine on the local machine for the inquiry of the special index of current document, send to the search engine on the enterprise network, and send to the remote search engines on the Internet.
Compare with result, can give the higher priority of result of particular search from other search.
It is unnecessary possibly indicating other inquiries co-pending for the response of given inquiry; These inquiries can cancellation before accomplishing.
4.
Paper and search engine
Usually, hope that the search engine processing of the traditional online query of processing derives from those inquiries of the document of reproduction.Conventional search engine can strengthen in a number of ways or revise so that make them be more suitable in using with described system.
The search engine of system and/or miscellaneous part can have the index of different or extra characteristic with maintenance.System can revise the inquiry that derives from paper of arrival or change in the Search Results mode of handling inquiry, makes a distinction with those inquiries from the inquiry of keying in web browser and other sources thereby these are derived from the inquiry of paper.And compare with the inquiry from other sources, system can take different actions or different options is provided when deriving from the search return results of paper.In these methods each hereinafter is discussed.
4.1
Index
Usually, can use to derive from paper or traditional identical index of query search, but can strengthen index to be used for current system with various modes.
4.1.1
Knowledge about the paper form
Can add helpful extra field under based on the situation of the search of paper to such index.
The directory entry of the document availability under the indication paper form
First instance is the field that known document exists or distributes with paper-based form.System can give such document higher priority under the situation of inquiry from paper.
The knowledge of popular paper form
In this example; The statistics that relates to the popularity (and relating to the subarea in these documents alternatively) of paper document; Circulation that amount, publisher or other sources of the activity of for example catching provides or the like; Be used for giving such document higher priority, improve priority (for example for inquiry or web search) of digital copies document or the like based on browser.
The knowledge of the form that reproduces
Another important instance possibly be the information of record about the layout of the specific reproduction of document.
For example, for the books of particular version, index can comprise about where occurring entering a new line and skipping; Used which font, the information of any uncommon capitalization.
Index also can comprise the information about the degree of approach of other such as image, text box, form and advertisement on the page.
The use of the semantic information in the original paper
At last, also can in index, write down and can from source marking, infer still unconspicuous semantic information in paper document, for example the specific character section is quoted project for sale or specific paragraph comprises this fact of program code.
4.1.2
Index in the knowledge of catching method
Second factor that can revise the character of index is the portion that uses probably or the knowledge of type.If the character of obscuring easily in the OCR process considered in index, perhaps comprise some knowledge of the font of using in the document, the search of being initiated by the text image of catching possibly be benefited so.For example, in the OCR process letter " r " be afterwards the letter " n " sequence maybe with the letter " m " obscure.Therefore, string " m " or " rn " maybe be related with identical document sets in index.Similarly, if inquiry from speech recognition, so can be effectively how search for index based on similar sounding phoneme.As another instance, system can make fuzzy that the fuzzy so that reflection user of document occurs when capture device being moved to the image of catching document above the document probably before the index file artificially.Similar techniques can be so that system has elasticity for poor optical device, noise etc.The importance of iterative feedback during the additive factor that in described model, can influence the use of index is identifying.If search engine can provide the feedback from text when text is hunted down, it can increase the precision of catching widely so.
Use the index of skew
In some instances, if use probably describe in the 9th joint based on skew/auto-correlation OCR method search index, system stores suitable skew or signing messages in the index into so.
4.1.3
Many index
At last, in described system, maybe be commonly at the enterprising line search of many index.Index can be safeguarded on the some machines on the enterprise network.The index of part can download to the machine of capture device or close capture device.Can for have interests, the custom perhaps can user or the independent index of user's creation.For each file system on user's hard disk, each catalogue even each file, can there be index.Index is announced and is subscribed to by the user and by system.So, importantly construct the index that can distribute effectively, upgrade, merge and separate.
4.2
Handle inquiry
4.2.1
Know and catch from paper
Search engine can be taked different actions when recognizing that search inquiry derives from paper document.This engine can be handled inquiry for example more to tolerate the mode that appears at the type of error in the specific catching method probably.
Certain designator that it possibly comprise from inquiry (for example the sign of character is caught in indication) is inferred this point, and perhaps it can infer this point (for example, it can discern the typical fault or the uncertainty of OCR process) from inquiring about itself.
Replacedly, from the inquiry of capture device can through with arrive engine from the different passage of the passage in other sources or port or connection type or port or connection type, and can distinguish by that way.For example, some instances of system will be routed to search engine to inquiry through dedicated gateway.Therefore, search engine knows that all inquiries through dedicated gateway derive from paper document.
4.2.2
Contextual use
The 13rd following joint has been described various different factors, and it is in the outside of the text of catching itself, yet it possibly be important help in the sign document.These factors comprise such as the longer-term reading habit of catching history, specific user recently, user's geographic position and user recently for the thing the use of particular electronic document.Such factor is referred to herein as " context ".
Some contexts can be handled by search engine itself, and are reflected in the Search Results.For example, search engine can be followed the tracks of user's the history of catching, and also this can be caught historical cross reference to the conventional inquiry based on keyboard.Under these circumstances; Search engine safeguards and uses than the most conventional search engine more about each personal user's status information, and can be considered to cross over search several times alternately with each of search engine and such as the present longer time period of typical situation.
Some contexts can be transferred to search engine (the 3.3rd joint) in search inquiry, and can be stored in engine possibly and sentence just and in the inquiry in future, work.At last, some contexts are preferably in other places and handle, and therefore become filtrator or the binary search that is applied to from the result of search engine.
Be input to the data stream of search
An important input to search procedure is how mutual with the reproduction version of document communities of users is---for example which document is read and by the broader context of whose reading the most widely.Those pages that the similarity of existence and web search, said web search are returned the page of the most frequently link or from the Search Results in past, selected the most continually.For the further discussion of this theme, referring to the 13.4th and 14.2 joints.
4.2.3
The document subarea
Described system can not only send and use about the whole information of document, and sends and use even reduce to the document subarea of individual words.Many existing search engines concentrate on simply locatees document relevant with ad hoc inquiry or file.Can work on the meticulousr granularity and the sign document in those search engines of position will significant benefits be provided for described system.
4.3
Return results
Search engine can use some following information of its maintenance now so that the result that influence is returned.
System also can return specific document, and the user has the right to visit said specific document (the 7.4th joint) as just the result who has paper copies.
Search engine also can surmount the simple retrieval of text and new element or the option that is suitable for described system is provided.
5.
Mark, note, enhancing, metadata
Except execution catch-search for-retrieving, described system is also with additional functionality and document associations, especially with document in text position or text chunk related.This additional functionality often (although not being exclusively) through related with the electronic copies of the document that reproduces and with the document associations of reproduction.As an instance, the hyperlink in the webpage possibly have identical functions when the printout of this webpage is hunted down.In some cases, said function does not limit in electronic document, but storage or generation elsewhere.
The function of this layer interpolation is called " mark " here.
5.1
Static and dynamic the covering
A kind ofly consider that the mode of mark is " covering " regarded as on the document, it provides about the other information of document or its certain part and can stipulate and the action of document or its certain partial association.Mark can comprise the content that the people is readable, but often invisible and/or expection is used for machine and uses for the user.Instance comprises when the user catches the text from the specific region in the document that reproduces rendering preferences in the popup menu on the display nearby, and the audio samples of the pronunciation of particular phrase perhaps is described.As another instance, system can clang when the user catches the advertisement from the document that reproduces.
5.1.1
Possibly from the several layers of several sources
Any document can have a plurality of coverings simultaneously, and these coverings can be derived from all places.Flag data can perhaps perhaps be created by other certain sides by the user by the author of document or provide.
Flag data can be attached to electronic document or embed wherein.It can (for example in the position identical with document, still have different files name suffix) and find in the position of routine.Flag data can be included in the Search Results of inquiry of location original document, perhaps can pass through to the independent inquiry of identical or another search engine and finds.Flag data can find through using the original text of catching and other capturing informations or contextual information, and perhaps it can find through using about the position of catching and the information of having inferred of document.Even mark itself is not contained in the document, the position that flag data also can be stipulated in document is found.
Mark can be static to a great extent and be that document is distinctive, be similar to the mode that the link on traditional html webpage often embeds as the static data in the html document, but mark also can dynamically generate and/or be applied to a large amount of documents.A dynamically labeled instance is the information that is attached to the up-to-date share price of the company that mentions in the document comprising of document.The mark of Ying Yonging instance is the translation information of language-specific automatically available on the chapters and sections of a plurality of documents or document widely.
5.1.2
Individual's " plug-in unit " layer
The user also can install or subscribe to the particular source of flag data, thereby individualized for specific system responses of catching.
5.2
Key word and phrase, trade mark and sign
Some elements in the document based on himself characteristic rather than its in particular document the position and possibly have specific " mark " or the function related with them.Instance comprises and is used for captive purpose purely and is printed on the special token of document and can makes the user be linked to sign and trade mark about the other information of the tissue that relates to.This is equally applicable to " key word " or " keyword sets " in the text.Tissue possibly register they related or they want related particular phrase, and specific markers is attached with it, this mark will be captive available Anywhere at this phrase.
Any speech, phrase or the like can have related mark.For example, no matter when the user catches the title or the theme relevant with books of word " books " or books, and system can add specific project to popup menu (for example arriving the link of online bookstore).In some instances of system; Digital copies document or index consulted in case confirm to catch the title that whether appears at word " books " or books or the theme relevant with books near, and the behavior of system is according to being modified apart from this degree of approach of key word element.In the instance in front, notice that mark makes the data of catching from non-commercial text or document can trigger business transaction.
5.3
The content that the user provides
5.3.1
User comment and note comprise multimedia
Note be can with the electronic information of the another kind of type of document associations.For example, the user can be attached his/her about the audio file of the view of particular document so that retrieve as voice annotation later on.As another instance of multimedia note, the photo in the place that the user quotes in can attached document.The user provides the note of document usually, but system can related note (for example, other users in the working group can share note) from other sources.
5.3.2
Notes from check and correction
An important instance that is derived from user's mark is the note as the paper document of the part of check and correction, editor or checking process.
5.4
Third party's content
Like what mention previously, the third party can be often for example other readers through document flag data is provided.Online discussion is good instance with examination, as the information of the community management relevant with particular job, the translation and the explanation of volunteer's contribution.
Another instance of third party's mark is the mark that is provided by the advertizer.
5.5
Dynamically labeled based on other user's data stream
Through analyzing the data of catching from document by the several of system or all users, can community-based activity and interest generation mark.An instance possibly be an online bookstore of creating mark or note, and this mark or note are told the user, in fact, and " people who appreciates this book also appreciates ... ".The less anonymity of this mark, and can tell the user that who also read the document recently in his/her contacts list.Other instances of data-flow analysis are contained in the 14th joint.
5.6
Mark based on external event and data source
Mark is often based on external event and data source, for example from the input of enterprise database, from the information of public internet or by the statistical data of local operation systematic collection.
Data source can be local more also, the information about user's context particularly can be provided, his/her identity, position and activity.For example, system can and provide mark layer with the mobile phone components communicate of user's capture device, and this mark layer gives the user sends to document the someone that the user talks recently on phone option.
5.7 figure image intensifying
And compensation
In some instances, system provides the document views of enhancing through the display that utilizes different display elements to cover display document.The view of this enhancing can utilize the realtime graphic that covers the document part in the capture device visual field with the different display elements of document associations, perhaps can utilize the image or the related electronic version that present and cover the document that is obtained or generated by system with the different display elements of document associations.In some instances; System provides the document interaction technique; The various hardware configuration of its compensation capture device, for example camera and other image-forming blocks are with respect to the position of display or documentation center point, the size of capture device and/or the demonstration of capture device.System can provide the document interaction technique, and it makes user can navigate mark, convergent-divergent paper document of paper document, sign and document associations or the like.For example, system can respond the attitude that the user of capture device makes, and for example on each different direction, moves the attitude of capture device with respect to paper document.Therefore; System makes that the user can be mutual through using multifunction mobile equipment and paper document, destination object and other information to show, said multifunction mobile equipment not necessarily is manufactured into except that other benefits and only perhaps catches the information from the equipment surrounding environment with information interaction.
6.
Authentication, individualized and security
In many situations, will know user's identity.Sometimes, this will be " an anonymous identity ", wherein for example only pass through the sequence number identifying user of capture device.Yet, typically, expectation be the much detailed knowledge that system will have the user, it can be used for individualized and allow nominal executed activity and the transaction with the user to system.
6.1
User historical and " life library shop "
Yet one of simply the most useful function that system can carry out is to catch relevant any further information for the text that he catches under the user record and with this, comprises details, the position in the document and any action of as a result of taking of any document that finds.In some instances, system can send to the information of catching the e-mail address of user's appointment, and wherein the user can visit the information of catching through the email protocol such as POP3, IMAP or the like through email client.In addition, the information of catching that is stored as Email can be included in the link that life library shop is more fully experienced, for example described in the 16.1st joint.
The two all is useful to this stored historical for user and system.
6.1.1
For the user
" life library shop " can be provided, i.e. his anything record of having read and having caught to the user.This maybe be only from individual's interest, but maybe be for example in the library, use by the academic personnel of the bibliography material of the next chapter paper of collecting him.
In some cases, the user for example possibly hope through making on the network that with the similar mode of network log the library is published to the library is public, thereby other people can see that he is reading and finding funny shit.
At last; The user catches certain text and system and can not catch this immediately and (for example take action therein; Because the electronic version of document is not available as yet) situation in, this is caught and can store in the library and can automatically or in response to user's request handle afterwards.The user also can order new mark service and they are applied to previous catching.
6.1.2
For system
The record that the user catches in the past also is useful for system.The reading habit of knowing the user and historical many aspects that can enhanced system operation.The simplest instance is, the user makes any catch more maybe be from the user in the nearest past document from its capturing information, and if particularly previous being captured in nearest a few minutes, it very maybe be from identical document so.Similarly, more possible is, with beginning to the order reading documents that finishes.Therefore, for english document, more possible equally is that later catching will down take place in document more at a distance.Such factor can help system occur establishing the position of catching under the fuzzy situation, and also can reduce the amount of text that need catch.
6.2
Capture device is as payment, identity and authenticating device
Because acquisition procedure begins with the equipment of certain kind usually, thereby this equipment can be as identifying user and the key of authorizing specific action.
6.2.1
Capture device is related with user account
Can capture device is related with mobile telephone account.For example, can the SIM card through will be related insert in the capture device and capture device and this account is related with mobile telephone account.Similarly, this equipment can embed in credit card or other Payment Cards, perhaps has the connected system of such card.Therefore, said equipment can be used as payment token, and can be through initiating financial transaction from the catching of document of reproducing.
6.2.2
Use is caught to carry out authentication
Also can be through catching with token, symbol or the text of specific user or account association with capture device and this user or account association.In addition, capture device can for example be used for biometric identification through the fingerprint of catching the user.Under situation based on the capture device of audio frequency, the voice mode that system can be through match user or through requiring the user to say particular password or phrase identifies this user.
For example, catch the quotation of books and be provided under the situation of option that retailer from network buys books the user, the user can select this option, and is prompted to catch his/her fingerprint then to confirm this transaction.
Also see also the 15.5th and 15.6 joints.
6.2.3
Safe capture device
When capture device is used for sign and authenticated and representative of consumer when initiating transaction, importantly communicating by letter between other parts of equipment and system is safe.It is also important that protection such as another equipment imitation capture device and the situation wherein communicating by letter between equipment and the miscellaneous part so-called " go-between " that tackled attacked.
The technology of the security that is used to provide such is understood in the art well; In different instances, in the equipment and the hardware and software in system other places be configured to implement such technology.
7.
Publish model and element
An advantage of described system is, need not to change establishment, printing and publishes the conventional procedure of document so that obtain many benefits of this system.But, have the founder or the publisher of document---after this to abbreviate " publisher " as---possibly to hope to create the reason of the function of supporting described system.
This joint relates generally to the document of publication itself.For information, referring to the 10th joint that is entitled as " P-is commercial " about other relevant business transactions (for example advertisement).
7.1
The electronics companion of document printing
System allows document printing to have related electronics existence.Conventionally, publisher often loads and transports with books and comprises the perhaps CD-ROM of other reference material of other numerical information, study course film and other multi-medium datas, code sample or document.In addition; Some publishers safeguard the website related with niche publication; These websites provide such material and maybe be in updated information after publication time, for example the other source of errata, further comment, reference material, bibliography and the related data upgraded and to the translation of other language.Online forum allows the reader to contribute their comment about this publication.
Described system allows the document of such material and reproduction to be linked together than much tight in the past, and the permission user easier how find they and mutual with them.Through catching a part of text from document, system can automatically connect the user to document associations and more particularly with the related digital material of this specific part of document, and on capture device, show these materials.Similarly, the user can be connected to the Internet community of this part that text is discussed, perhaps other readers' note and comment through capture device.In the past, such information typically need find through searching for the specific page number or chapters and sections.
An one of which example application is (the 17.5th joint) in academic textbook field.
7.2
" subscription " document printing
Some publishers possibly have mail tabulation, if the redaction that the reader hopes to be notified new relevant matters or when publishes books, they can subscribe to mail tabulation so.Utilize described system, the user can more easily register the interest for particular document or documentation section, in some cases even just can be like this before publisher considers to provide any such function.Reader's interest can be presented to publisher, influences them possibly about when and where renewal, further information, redaction or even the decision-making of the brand-new publication of the relevant verified theme that in existing books, causes people's interest are provided.
7.3
Have special implication or comprise the printing mark of special data
Many aspects of system are simply through using the text in the document Already in to launch.Yet; If produce document knowing to use under the situation of document with systems incorporate; Can add extra function through the extraneous information of form of printing special token so; Said special token can be used for identifying more nearly text or required action, perhaps otherwise strengthens the mutual of document and system.The simplest and most important instance is to indicate certainly to the reader to pass through system's access document.Special icon can for example be used so that indication the document has the online forum related with it.
Such symbol can expect and be used for the reader purely that perhaps they can be by system identification when being hunted down and be used for initiating certain action.Enough data of can in symbol, encoding are so that not only identify this symbol: it for example also can store the information about the position of document, version and symbol, and it can and read by system identification.
7.4
Authorize through having paper document
Exist wherein to have document printing or visit document printing to give the user some privilege, for example some situations of the electronic copy of access document or additional materials.Utilize described system, can as just the user catch from the part text of document or catch special printing symbol the result and give such privilege.System need guarantee that the user has under the situation of entire document therein, and it possibly point out the user to catch particular items or phrase from specific webpage (for example " the 46th page of second row ").
7.5
Overdue document
If document printing is the gateway of additional materials and function, visiting such characteristic so also possibly be The limited time.At the date of maturity, the user possibly be asked to pay or obtain the renewal version of document so that visit said characteristic once more.Certainly, it is spendable that paper document will remain, but will lose its some enhanced electron functions.This possibly be desirable, for example, because publisher is in the expense of collecting the visit electronic material or requiring the user to buy to exist in the redaction profit every now and then, perhaps because exist and the out-of-date related shortcoming of document printing version that keeps circulating.Reward voucher is an instance that possibly have the business document type of date of expiry.
7.6
The popular analysis and the publication decision-making
The statistical data that the 10.5th joint has been discussed using system is with the compensation that influences the author and the price of advertisement.
In some instances, system's basis electronic communities related movable and the popularity of inferring publication according to the use of paper document with publication.These factors can help publisher what to publish in the future for them to make a policy.If certain chapter in the for example existing books is proved to be extremely welcome, probable value must be extended to it independent publication so.
8.
The document access service
An importance of described system is that the user to the reproduction of the access document of having the right copy provides the ability for the visit of the electronic version of the document.In some cases, document can freely obtain on the private network that public network or user have the right to visit.System uses the text catch so that sign, locate and obtain the document, on capture device, shows it in some cases or it is left in its email INBOX.
In some cases, document will can be used with electronic form, but from various reasons, maybe be for user's inaccessible.Only list some possibilities, possibly not exist enough connections obtaining the document, the user possibly have no right to obtain the document, possibly exist and obtains the related cost of the document, and perhaps the document possibly removed and replaced by redaction possibly.System typically provides the feedback about these situations to the user.
Like what mention in the 7.4th joint, the printing of the access document copy if known specific user has had the right, the degree or the character that give this user's visit so maybe be different.
8.1
The document access of authentication
Visit for document possibly be limited to those users that particular user perhaps satisfies specified criteria, perhaps maybe be only available under specific situation, and for example, the user can use when being connected to secure network.The 6th joint has been described some modes that wherein can set up the authority of user and capture device.
8.2
Document is bought---copyright owner's compensation
Document for the general public can not freely obtain maybe be still addressable when paying, usually as the compensation for publisher or copyright holder.System can directly realize payment mechanism or can utilize other methods of payment related with the user, comprises those methods of describing in the 6.2nd joint.
8.3
The document trustship is obtained with active
Electronic document often is a short-term; But the digital source version of the document that reproduces is available following inaccessible now.System can representative of consumer obtain and store existing version, even the user does not ask it, thereby under following its situation of request of user, guarantees its availability.This also makes it available for the use of system, for example is used for the search as the part of the following process of catching of sign.
If require payment with access document, trusted " document trustship " service can for example be obtained document the appropriate expense interval scale user of payment so, guarantees following user full remuneration copyright ownerL copyrighted material's owner under the situation of this service request document once.
If document can not used with electronic form when catching, can implement the modification of this scheme so.The user can authorize said service represent him to submit to for the request of document under the electronic document date afterwards becomes available situation and perhaps pay for document.
8.4
With other subscription and account association
Sometimes can abandon, reduce with the existing related of another account or subscription or sacrifice payment based on the user.For example, the subscriber of newspaper printing version can automatically have the right to obtain electronic version.
In other cases, this association is maybe not can direct like this: can perhaps catch and the authorized user visit based on what its printing that has for the friend as the subscriber copied based on the account that its employer sets up.
8.5
Utilization is caught and is printed and replaces xeroxing
Catch text, the sign electronic original part from paper document and print this original paper perhaps forms the tradition photomechanical printing with the process of certain part of catching this related original paper replaceable scheme, it has many advantages:
Paper document need not to be in and the final identical position of printout, and under any circumstance all need not simultaneously there
Can avoid the photomechanical printing process to document, especially to old, frangible wearing and tearing and destruction of causing with valuable document
The quality of copy is typically much higher
Can keep record about which part that the most often copies which document or document
A part that can be used as this process is made payment to the copyright owner
Can forbid unauthorised copies.
8.6
From xeroxing the valuable original paper in location
When under the situation of legal documents with history or other certain sense or document, when document was valuable especially, people typically possibly use on the copy of these documents, often be to use many years, and original paper remained on safe position.
Described system can be coupled to the record original document database of the position in the file warehouse for example, thereby makes the someone who has the right to visit copy locate the original paper document of file easily.
9.
The information processing technology
For example be conceived to comprise image on optical character identification (OCR) technology tradition from a large amount of texts of the flat bed scanner of catching full page.The OCR technology often needs user's a large amount of training and correction so that produce useful text.The machine that the OCR technology often requires to carry out OCR has suitable processing power, though and many systems use dictionary, expect that usually they work on the in fact unlimited vocabulary.
Traditional characteristic above all can be modified in described system.Yet, technology described herein, for example the sign of the identification of text, document, detection of information and other technologies certainly use typical OCR technology to realize.
Many problems of being discussed map directly to other recognition technologies, especially speech recognition.As mentioning in the 3.1st joint, the process of catching from paper can be read in text loudly the equipment of capturing audio through the user and realized.It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the principle about image, font and text fragments that this paper discusses often also is applicable to audio samples, user speech model and phoneme.
The capture device that uses with described system often is little, portable and lower powered, perhaps is not manufactured into and only catches text.It not is the optical element that is ideally suited in OCR that capture device possibly have, and perhaps possibly lack the optical element that helps OCR.
Capture device can once only be caught some speech, and in some implementations, does not even once catch whole character, but the dropping cut slice through text, the discernible signal that many such sections are stitched together and can therefrom infer text to form.Capture device also can have very limited processing power or memory space; Although thereby it can carry out all OCR processes itself in some instances; But many instances will depend on that possibly afterwards time is to the connection of more powerful equipment, so that the conversion of signals of catching is become text.At last, it can have the very limited device that is used for user interactions, thereby after possibly needing to postpone till for any request of user's input, perhaps on the bigger degree of the degree common such as the present, works in " best-guess " pattern.
In some instances; System handles the information of catching in the following manner: the existence that at first identifies information of interest to be identified (for example text or voice); Extract and the corresponding characteristic in the position of information of interest in the information of catching (speech for example; OK; Paragraph; Row or the like the position in the page; Specific speaker's frequency range among the crowd); And the characteristic of identification information of interest; For example the text layout in the document of Zai Xianing or with the document that reproduces in the sign of the corresponding Unicode character of letter discerned; So that the source of the sign image of catching for example, perhaps generate the mark layer above the image with display capture.Although can be for these processes of information and executing of any kind, below the document description that reproduces with reference to text based of instance these processes.
9.1
Sign and extraction
Sign is to confirm that the image of catching comprises the process of the possibility of text.Because capture device can constantly be caught image, thereby system can confirm at first whether the image of catching comprises text before attempting from the information of catching, to extract text feature or discerning text.In other words, system is " text perception ", because it can confirm whether it faces text at any time.
In case system confirms text and exists that system can begin leaching process so.The position of the text in the leaching process sign is caught.For example, speech and the corresponding border of paragraph in the leaching process image that can generate and catch.
Some factors can get into sign and leaching process.For example; When analyzing text; System can identify with text in the related various characteristic of stroke; The shortage of change color in the for example existence of high-contrast edges, stroke (the for example relatively existence of background and foreground color in the stroke), consistent width (level, vertical perhaps the two), the existence of straight edge, the existence of smooth edges curve, or the like.As another instance; System can identify the periodicity or the repetition of the characteristic (for example stroke edge) of potential text in the image of catching; Level and/or the vertically existence of the angle between stroke, baseline, altitude line, vertical curve and the baseline; Font or font subconstiuent (turning for example, curve, diagonal line; Bridging line between the part of font; The narrow stroke between the wide stroke in the calligraphy mail for example, serif, consistent line cap and mitered or the like) existence.System also can use motion blur so that identify the existence of text based on the existence of bright dark color ribbon on the direction of motion (the for example background and the prospect band of the horizontal text axle in the script from left to right under the fuzzy situation of extreme sport).
Admissible additive factor comprises during the sign of text and the extraction:
OK
Font vertical curve in the row
Font horizontal line in the row
Baseline
The height of row inside spread eagle or symbol
Horizontal space between font, speech and/or the stroke
Vertical space between the row
Edge and back gauge
Density
The ratio of stroke background
Interior and the density in the ranks of row
Grapheme sequence
The N unit syntax (sequence of N continuous speech)
Speech
Capitalization
Punctuate
Sentence (capitalization, punctuate, cycle)
Paragraph
Title
Captions
Based on the degree of approach apart from image
Legend
Frame, icon or the like
Literal on the figure
Short text
The contrast bigger, cycle or the like than background image
Sign
Company/product/service name
The primary commercial sign
Separatrix (for example oval border) with background.
The system that it will be understood by those skilled in the art that can use any or all above-mentioned characteristic when execution contexts identifies and extracts and is in any analysis level.For example, during identification procedure, system can only depend on the quantity of horizontal space in the distance that depends between the horizontal space, and during leaching process, depends in the image of catching the relation at they and edge.
System also can carry out sign to non-text message and extracts based on existence, the line of face, health or buildings in the smooth gradient in for example big zone, randomness (the for example inhomogeneity of the height of the position of high-contrast specific region, high-contrast edges, high-contrast edges), the image of catching or the inconsistent size or the like that is communicated with composition.
9.2
Text identification
Based on the positional information of extracting, text or the characteristic of text in the image of catching can be attempted to discern by system.For example, system can send to text the characteristic (the for example pattern of rising letter and/or descender in the text) of OCR parts or text based sign and generate signature.Before execution contexts identification, system can be through the form that for example all italics or bold text is converted to standard to text standardization or normalization.
The text identification process can depend on certain characteristics so that the signature of the characteristic of identification text or the document that generate to reproduce, for example font style characteristic (for example Feng Bi space, vertically and horizontal strokes or the like), punctuate, capitalization, character space, go characteristic, paragraph characteristic, row characteristic, title characteristic, captions characteristic, key/legend characteristic, flag sign, the last character features of figure or the like.In addition, the speech characteristic can help text identifying, for example speech spacing and density.For example, system can use and document on the information of space correlation between the speech that prints, for example width between the distance between the space (level, vertical, quadrature or the like), the space or the like.System can further merge to the knowledge about line feed in the analysis.For example, when line feed was known, system can depend on the vertical alignment that lexeme is put, and when line feed was unknown, system can depend on contiguous relative term length sequences.As another instance, system can use the information related with character density, for example relative density or the absolute density information between the relative density between the character (level, vertical, quadrature or the like), the character pairing of dividing into groups.Specific characteristic maybe be constant for font, font size or the like, for example the symmetry of Points And lines (for example in the font, the auto-correlation around point and/or the line).Which characteristic is system can dynamically select to analyze in the image of catching.For example, under the situation of village optical dimming and motion blur, system can use the less details aspect of text, for example relative term width.In some instances, system can represent that (for example for e-mail address and URL) or the like confirms whether the first syntax of unknown or rare n are that noise or high signal message (misspelling, e-mail address, URL or the like) utilize the first syntax of unique n through depart from grammatical degree of certainty, the length that departs from, the matching rules of public n unit based on for example character.
Text in the document that the document resource external that system can use reproduction is reproduced with identification, for example relate to the font in the speech appropriate number, dictionary (for example word frequency dictionary), grammer and punctuate rule, find the specific word syntax and the probability of the character syntax, the rule of coupling kinds of characters string in the complete or collected works to represent the knowledge of (for example e-mail address, URL or the like).In addition, system can use the text of the resource checking identification such as dns server, address book and telephone directory, for example URL, e-mail address and telephone number.As another instance, system can use the font matrix to help identification and to verify various font.Can compare so that help their identification based on the character of the relation between the character of reflect in the font matrix Unidentified and identification the identification of the Unidentified character of given font and same font.For example, be similar to the combination of " c " and " l " if the font matrix shows the representation class of " d ", so Unidentified " d " can be identified as " d " based on " c " and " l " that discern.
System can use text or the characteristic of identification so that among document complete or collected works' document, identify the document of describing in the image of catching.Quantity of information that is used for identifying and information type can change based on any amount of factor, and these factors are type, the complete or collected works' of document size, document content or the like for example.The sequence of 5 or 6 speech or the relative position in the space between the speech can identify corresponding document uniquely in the image of for example, catching in relatively large complete or collected works.In some instances, system can adopt conversion table will identify the probability of document uniquely with the combination that definite information about special characteristic perhaps belongs to the information of special characteristic.For example, conversion table can be indicated the word sequence of 5 speech 3 word sequences different with two, 2 rising letters and/or the descender pattern or the like of row are had the identical probability that identifies document uniquely continuously.In some instances, system can automatically accumulate the image of catching or with its " stitchings " together so that for example generate the combination picture of the document of reproduction, this combination picture possibly identify corresponding document more uniquely than the independent document of catching.
In some instances, the text identification process can influence catching of information.For example, if text is identified as out of focus or imperfect, so system can regulate capture device camera focus or point out the user to reappose or regulate capture device.System can be used for discerning the various technology of text and describe in further detail hereinafter.
9.2.1
" uncertain " OCR
The main new features of OCR are the following fact in the described system: it is present in inspection other places and the image of the text that possibly obtain with digital form usually.Therefore, always need be from the definite text transcription of OCR engine.The OCR system can export the matrix of one group of possible coupling or possible coupling, comprises probability right in some cases, and it still can be used for searching for digital original paper.
9.2.2
Iteration OCR---conjecture, disambiguation, conjecture
Can when handling, get in touch document index if carry out the equipment of identification, along with the continuation of OCR process, can inform the OCR process so, thereby much bigger accuracy of identification is provided potentially through document complete or collected works' content.
Such connection is also informed permission equipment when the user has caught enough texts with the reference numbers source.
9.2.3
Use the knowledge of possible reproduction
When the each side (for example the layout of the font printed words that use in the printing or the page or which part are italic) of the possible printing reproduction of document had been known by system, this also can help identifying (4.1.1 joint).
9.2.4
Font cache---confirm to download to the font on the main frame of client
During candidate's source text in having identified the document complete or collected works, font or its reproduction can be downloaded to equipment to help identification.
9.2.5
Auto-correlation and character skew
Although the composition character of text fragments possibly be the mode of approving most that representative can be used as the text fragments of document signature; But other expressions of text can enough be worked well; Thereby when attempting to locate the text fragments in digital document and/or the database or when the expression disambiguation to text fragments becomes readable form, need not to use the actual text of text fragments.Other expressions of text fragments can provide actual text to represent the benefit that is lacked.For example, expression is different is with other of the text fragments of catching, the frequent easy error of the optical character identification of text fragments, and said other expressions can be used for search and/or rebuild text fragments and do not appeal to for entire segment and carry out optical character identification.Such method possibly be more suitable in some equipment that use with current system.
Those of ordinary skills and other people will understand, and have many modes of the outward appearance of describing text fragments.Such sign of text fragments can include but not limited to speech length, relative term length, character height, character duration, character shape, character frequency, token frequency or the like.In some instances, the skew between the matched text token (promptly the quantity of token adds 1 between two parties) is used for characterizing text fragments.
Conventional OCR uses about the knowledge of font, letter configuration and shape so that the character in the text of attempting to confirm to scan.Instance of the present invention is different; They adopt various methods, and these methods use the text itself that reproduces to help identifying.These methods are used character (or token) " identification each other ".A kind of mode of quoting this self-identifying is " template matches ", and is similar to " convolution ".In order to carry out this self-identifying, system slides the copy of text on upper horizontal ground own, and writes down the matching area of text image.Existing templates coupling and convolution technique comprise various correlation techniques.These technology of tokenization and/or identification character/token will be referred to as " auto-correlation ", because when coupling character/token, it is relevant with the ingredient of himself that text is used for.
When auto-correlation, the complete connected region of coupling is interesting.When this appears at other instances of character (perhaps character group) covering identical characters (or group).The complete connected region of coupling automatically provides the text token is turned to the composition token.Along with two copies of text slip over each other, the zone that perfect match (promptly vertically all pixel matching in the section) wherein occurs is write down.When character/token and self coupling, the horizontal extent of this coupling (the for example connection compatible portion of text) is also mated.
Note, need not to confirm the actual identity (promptly with the corresponding particular letter of token image, numeral or symbol or these group) of each token, the skew that next time occurs of arriving identical token in the text of only confirming to catch.Offset numbers is the distance (token number) that next time occurs to identical token.If token is unique in text string, skew is zero (0) so.The token offset sequence of Sheng Chenging is the signature that can be used for identifying the text of catching like this.
In some instances, the token skew that will confirm to the token string of catching compares with index electronic document complete or collected works' index, and this is based on token skew (4.1.2 joint) of their content.In other instances, will convert text to the token skew that the token string of catching is confirmed to and its more index of routine with index electronic document complete or collected works will be compared based on their content.
As previous pointed, when acquisition procedure comprised the audio samples of oral speech, similarly the token correlated process can be applied to sound bite.
9.2.6
Font/character " self-identifying "
Conventional template matches OCR compares the image and the character picture storehouse of scanning.In fact, stored alphabet, and the image that will newly scan and image stored compare so that find out the coupling character to every kind of font.This process has initial delay usually, up to having identified correct font.Afterwards, the OCR process is very fast relatively, because most of document uses identical font in the whole text.Follow-up image thereby can compare through fontlib and convert text to nearest sign.
The most often the shape of the character in the font of Shi Yonging is correlated with.For example, in most of fonts, letter " c " is visually relevant with letter " e ", as " t " and " f " or the like.The OCR process is enhanced with the template of the letter that is configured to not scan as yet through using this relation.For example; Caught the short text string of the font that does not before run into from paper document the reader; Thereby system is less than under the situation of set of diagrams as template that itself and the image of catching are compared; System can utilize possible relation between the specific character with structure font template base, even it does not run into all letters in the alphabet as yet.System can use text and the further fontlib that improve structure of the font template base of structure with the identification subsequent captured then.
9.2.7
Unidentified anything (comprising figure) sent to server
When image can not the machine transcription becomes to be suitable for the form of search procedure, can preserve image itself in case afterwards by the user use, possible manual transcription perhaps different resources maybe for system can with the later date handle.
10.
P-is commercial
System makes its possible many actions cause some business transactions to take place.Word p-commerce is used for describing the business activity of initiating from paper through system here.
10.1
Document from its physics printing copy is sold
When the user caught the text from document, the user possibly be provided the purchase of the document of papery or electronic form.The user also possibly be provided relevant document, for example in paper document, offer or those documents of otherwise quoting, perhaps about those documents of similar theme, perhaps those documents of same authors.
10.2
Initiate or the sale of auxiliary any anything else through paper
Can catching with other business activities of text be interrelated with various modes.The text of catching maybe be in the catalogue that is designed to items for merchandising clearly, and in this case, text is incited somebody to action quite directly related with the purchase of article (the 18.2nd joint).Text also can be the part of advertisement, in this case, maybe thereby take place by the sale of the article of advertisement.
In other cases, the user catches other texts, therefrom can infer their the potential interest for business transaction.For example, the reader of the novel collection of particular country maybe be interested in spending a holiday of there.Read the new car comment someone possibly just consider to buy this car.The user can catch specific text fragments, knows that as a result of certain commercial opportunity will offer them, and perhaps it can be their movable afterclap of catching.
10.3
Catching of label on the article that cause selling, icon, sequence number, bar code
Sometimes, text or symbol actual print are on article or its packing.Instance is sequence number or the product id that on the label of the back side of the electronics of being everlasting or bottom side, finds.System can provide the mode that makes things convenient for of buying one or more identical items through catching the text to the user.They also can be provided handbook, support or maintenance service.
10.4
Contextual advertisement
Except directly catching the text from advertisement, system also allows a kind of new advertisement, and it but is based on the thing that people are reading not necessarily clearly in the document that reproduces.
10.4.1
Based on catching context and historical advertisement
In traditional paper publication thing, the space that advertisement is a large amount of with respect to the literal consumption of newspaper article usually, and the advertisement of limited quantity can place around the certain articles.In described system, can advertisement is related with other speech or phrase, and can be according to the user through the interests of catching the text and showing and consider it possibly and catch history and select advertisement.
Utilize described system, might interrelate with specific document printing buying and the advertizer obtains obviously more the feedback about its advertising effect in specific printed publication.
10.4.2
Based on user's context and historical advertisement
System can collect a large amount of contextual otherwise information about the user and use (referring to the 13rd joint) for self; The geographic position of estimating user is good instance.Such data also can be used for customizing the user's of the system of presenting to advertisement.
10.5
Compensation model
System allows for the advertizer and marketing person realizes some new compensation model.The publisher that comprises the document printing of advertisement can receive certain income from the purchase of the document that derives from them.This possibly be real, no matter whether advertisement exists with original printing form; It possibly added by publisher, advertizer or certain third party electronically, and the source of this advertisement possibly subscribed to through the user.
10.5.1
Based on epidemic compensation
The analysis of the statistical data that system generates can disclose the popularity (the 14.2nd joint) of the specific part of publication.For example, in newspaper, it can disclose the reader and spend the pouplarity the time quantum of browsing specific webpage or article or specific columnist.In some cases, for author or suitable being based on the movable of reader rather than receiving compensation of publisher's possibility based on the more traditional tolerance such as the copy number of speech that writes out or distribution.Its works become the author of authoritative works of the frequent reading of certain topic should be in the contract in future with its sales of books identical copy number but the author who seldom is opened takes in differently.
10.5.2
Based on epidemic advertisement
Decision-making about the advertisement in the document also can be based on the statistical data of relevant Readership.Advertising space around the most popular columnist can be sold by premium rate.Even can be after document be published a period of time based on how received knowledge is to advertizer's charge or to its compensation about it.
10.6
Marketing based on the life library shop
" the life library shop " described in the 6.1st and 16.1 joints or to catch history can be about user's the interest and the extremely valuable information source of custom.Through suitable agreement and privacy concern, such data can be informed providing of user's commodity or service.Even under the form of anonymity, the statistical data of collection also possibly be exceedingly useful.
10.7
Sale/the information (but when time spent) on later date
The advertisement of business transaction possibly not presented to the user immediately with other chances when catching.For example, the chance of buying the novel final result possibly can not obtain when the user reads novel, but system can present this chance to them when final result is published.
The user can catch and the data of buying or other business transactions are relevant, but can select not initiate and/or to accomplish this transaction when catching making.In some instances, and catch relevant data storage in user's life library shop, and these life library shop clauses and subclauses can keep " activation " (promptly can carry out subsequently mutual, be similar to and make can use when catching mutual).Therefore, the user can catch in certain time examination after a while, and accomplishes the transaction of catching based on this alternatively.Because system can follow the tracks of when and where original catching take place, thereby all sides that suitably relate in the compensation deal.For example; Their life library shop of user capture after six months; From history, select this specific catching; And when from popup menu (it can be similar or identical with the menu that when catching, appears alternatively), selecting " buying these article ", can appear at the user and compensate writing from its author and publisher that publishes this story of story nearby that catches the advertisement of data at Amazon.
11.
Operating system and application integration
Modern operating system (OS) and other software packages have numerous characteristics; These characteristics can advantageously be utilized so that use with described system, and these characteristics also in a different manner correct with provide in addition better platform use for it.
11.1
To catch and print relevant information merges in metadata and the index
New and upcoming file system and related database thereof often have the ability of the various metadata of storage and each file association.Traditionally, this metadata has comprised the thing ID such as the user who creates file, date created, nearest modification and the nearest use.The file system of upgrading allows the extraneous information of storage such as key word, picture characteristics, document source and user comment, and in some systems, this metadata can at random be expanded.Therefore, file system can be used for storage will be in realizing current system Useful Information.For example, file system can be stored the date that given document is printed recently, as storing about using described system to catch from its which text and the details of when catching and being caught by whom from paper.
Operating system also begins to merge the search engine device that allows the user more easily to find local file.These devices can advantageously be used by system.This means that many search related notions that the 3rd and 4 joints are discussed not only are applicable to based on the search engine the Internet and similar, and be applicable to each personal computer.
In some cases, specific software application also will comprise the support for the system outside above-mentioned and the device that OS provides.
11.2
OS for capture device supports
Along with the use of the capture device with integrated camera and microphone such as mobile communication equipment becomes more prevalent; What possibly hope is will be embedded in the operating system for their support with the roughly the same mode that provides support for mouse and printer, because the applicability of capture device exceeds outside the single software application.These other aspects for system operation are real equally.Some instances have been discussed below.In some instances, the system of whole description or its core are provided by OS (for example Windows, Windows mobile, Linux, Max OS X, iPhone OS, Android or Symbian).In some instances, by being provided by the application programming interface (API) that other software packages use, said software package comprises those software packages of the each side of the said system of direct realization for the support of system.
11.2.1
Support for OCR and other recognition technologies
The method that great majority are caught from the text of the document that reproduces requires certain identification software with source data, typically is the image of catching or the speech that some are said is interpreted as the text in the system of being suitable for.Some OS comprise the support for voice or handwriting recognition, although OS comprises that the support for OCR is uncommon, because the use of OCR typically is limited to application among a small circle in the past.
Because identification component becomes the part of OS, other devices that they can utilize OS to provide better.Many systems comprise for example speed dictionary, grammatical analysis instrument, internationalization and localized device; All these can be advantageously used in its identifying by described system, and this is especially because they possibly be speech and the phrase of specific user's customization to comprise that he usually runs into.
If operating system comprises the full-text indexing device, these devices also can be used for as informing identifying described in the 9.3rd joint so.
11.2.2
The action of taking when catching
If catch generation and offer OS, it can have is not so having other subsystems statements to have the default action of taking under these those situation of catching.An instance of default action is to present replaceable Scheme Selection to the user, perhaps the data of catching is submitted to the embedded searcher of OS.
11.2.3
OS has the default action that is used for particular document or Doctype
If find the digital source of the document of reproduction, so OS can have its when this particular document or such other document are hunted down with the standard operation of taking.Use with other subsystems and can register specific potential handle of catching type as to OS to use its similar fashion of handling particular file types of declaration.
With the document that reproduces or with the instruction that can comprise startup application-specific, delivery applications variable, parameter or data etc. from the related flag data of catching of document to operating system.
11.2.4
Explain attitude and be mapped to standard operation
In the 12.1.3 joint, the use of " attitude " has been discussed, the special exercise that wherein utilizes capture device to make possibly represented the action of standard, for example the beginning and the end in retrtieval zone.
This is similar to such action: when using the cursor key selection text filed, push the shift key on the keyboard, perhaps use the roller rolling document on the mouse.Such action of user is abundant standard, makes them explained with the mode of system scope by the OS of capture device, thereby guarantees consistent behavior.For other capture device relevant action, hope so same.
11.2.5
Setting is for the response of standard (with non-standard) icon/text printing menu item
According to similar mode, specific text items or other symbol items make standard operation take place when being hunted down, and OS can provide the selection for these.An instance possibly be that the text " [printing] " of catching in any document will make OS obtain and print the copy of the document.OS also can provide the such action of registration and it is caught related mode with specific.
11.3
In system's figure user interface component for the support of exemplary capture promotional activities
Test pattern user interface (GUI) parts that most of software application provide based on OS basically.
The developer uses these parts to help to guarantee to stride the behavior of the unanimity of a plurality of software packages, for example in any text editing context, pushes left cursor key and cursor should be moved on to the left side, realizes identical functions independently and need not each programmer.
When catching through text or during other aspects promotional activities of described system, the similar consistance in these parts is desirable.Some instances have been provided below.
11.3.1
Find the interface of certain text content
The typical use of system possibly be to supply the user to catch the zone of paper document, and the confession system opens electronic copies in the software package that can show or edit it, and makes this bag be rolled to and add the text of bright scanning (12.2.1 joint).The first of this process promptly finds and opens electronic document, and typically being provided by OS and stride each software package is standard.Yet, second portion---in document the one section particular text in location and make bag be rolled to it and add bright it---not standardization as yet, and often realizing by each bag differently.Be used for the availability operation of this aspect of enhanced system widely of the standard A PI of this function.
11.3.2
Text is mutual
In case in document, located one section text, system possibly hope the text is carried out various operations so.As an instance, the text around system can ask, thus the user possibly cause system's visit to comprise their whole sentence or paragraph for catching of some speech.Likewise, this function can be provided by OS effectively, rather than in each software of handling text, realizes.
11.3.3
Context (ejection) menu
The certain operations that system launches will need user feedback, and this asks in the context of the application of deal with data best.In some instances, system uses traditionally and on certain text, clicks right mouse button application associated popup menu.System inserts additional option in such menu, and makes their show as the result of activity such as a part of catching paper document.
11.4
The gateway/network interface
In the world that networks more and more today, function available also can be through access to netwoks on most of individual machines, and no exception with the function of described system relationship.As an instance, in office environment, many paper documents that the user receives can be printed by other users' on the same enterprise network machine.Be subjected to suitable control of authority, the system responses on computing machine possibly possibly caught corresponding document with this to the other machines inquiry in catching.
11.5
The printing of document causes preservation
An important factor is to safeguard the information of transformation between the two about this as much as possible in papery and digital document integrated.In some instances, OS keeps any document when to be printed and by the simple record of whose printing.In some instances, OS takes one or more other actions, and this will make it be more suitable in using with said system.Instance comprises:
With the digital reproduction version of preserving each document of printing about information of printing the source of each document from it
Preservation is about the subclass of the useful information of printing edition, the font of Shi Yonging and line feed where occurs for example, and this can help following explanation of catching
Preserve the version of the source document related with the copy of any printing
Print with event memory for index file automatically when searching in the future.
11.6
I (printing/catch) document
OS often safeguards particular file folder or the file class with special significance.By convention or design, can for example in " my document " file, find user's document.The File Open dialog box of standard can automatically comprise the tabulation of the document of opening recently.
On the OS that optimizes in order to use with described system, such classification can be enhanced with the hard-copies alternant way of considering user and files stored or expand.Classification such as " document of my printing " or " document of my nearest reading " possibly identified and merged in its operation effectively.
11.7
OS level mark layer aggregated(particle) structure
Because the importance of system is typically through using " mark " notion of discussing in the 5th joint to provide, thus obvious favourable will be to have the support of this mark that provides for OS for a plurality of application and for the addressable mode of OS itself.In addition, mark layer can based on the document under its control of OS self with and the knowledge of the device that can provide and providing by OS.
11.8
The use of OS DRM device
The operating system of more and more quantity is supported " digital copyright management " of certain form: the ability of controlling the use of particular data according to the right of authorizing specific user, software entity or machine.It can stop the for example unauthorised copies or the distribution of particular document.
12.
User interface
The user interface of system can be fully on capture device, if it is complicated and great processing power that have himself, for example mobile phone or PDA are perhaps fully on PC, if capture device is mute relatively and be connected to PC through cable.In some cases, some functions reside in each parts.
Therefore, the description in the following chapters and sections is to expect and so on indication in the specific implementation mode, but they are not necessarily suited for all and can make amendment in a number of ways.
12.1
On capture device
For most of capture devices, user's notice usually can be on equipment and paper when catching.So it is desirable for very much not to need user's notice too much to be in other places as any input and the feedback of the part of acquisition procedure, for example on the screen of computing machine.
12.1.1
The feedback of capture device
Capture device can have to the user provides the various modes about the feedback of particular condition.The most significantly type is direct vision, and wherein capture device merges the demonstration fully or the pilot lamp of the image of catching, and the sense of hearing, and wherein capture device can sound a buzzer, click or other sound.Important replaceable scheme comprises tactile feedback; Wherein capture device can vibrate, drone the sense of touch of making a sound or otherwise stimulating the user; And projection feedback, wherein it projects to paper through anything that will show from colored hot spot to complicacy and comes indicating status.
The important immediate feedback that can on capture device, provide comprises:
It is too high or too low that feedback about acquisition procedure---user moves capture device is too fast, ether is big angular movement or drift
Sufficient content---has been caught enough so that quite confirm to find coupling (if present)---, and this is important for the operation of breaking off
Context is known---located the source of text
Unique context is known---located a unique source of text
The indication whether content availability---content can be the free acquisition of user or obtain with certain cost.
If capture device for example has the part of display document or whole enough abilities, the many user interactions related with the later stage of system also can take place on capture device usually.
12.1.2
Control on the capture device
Capture device can provide various modes for the user input except basic text is caught to be provided, for example button, roller/touch wheel, touch sensitive surfaces, and/or be used for the accelerometer of the motion of checkout equipment.In these inputs some allow when still holding capture device, to realize one group of more enrich mutual.
For example, in response to catching certain text, capture device presents one group of some possible coupling document to the user.The user uses the sensitive surfaces that touches of capture device from tabulation, to select one.
12.1.3
Attitude
Striding the main cause that paper moves capture device is to catch text, but some motions possibly and be used to refer to other user interactions by Equipment Inspection.Such motion is called " attitude " here.
As an instance, the user can be through catching several leading speech and in dextrosinistral motion, catching last several speech and indicate big text filed in motion from left to right.The user also can move the vertical scope that capture device is indicated text through cross several rows along the page.Reverse between trapping period can be indicated and cancelled the previous operation of catching.
12.1.4
The on-line behavior
Many aspects of system possibly depend on system unit and the network connectivity between the wireless network such as capture device, perhaps arrive network connectivity type of attachment and the external world of enterprise database and Internet search.Yet this connectivity possibly not be to exist always, thereby the occasion can have the part of system or all possibly be considered to " off-line " time.In these cases, hope is that the permission system works with remaining valid.
When other parts of capture device and system were out of touch, capture device can be used for catching text.Very simple equipment possibly only can store with catch related, ideally with its related image or voice data of captive timestamp when of indication.Each are different catches and can when next capture device contacts with system, upload to the remainder of system and handle then.Capture device also can be uploaded and catch other related data, for example voice annotation or positional information.
More complex apparatus possibly itself carried out some or all of system operations, and no matter it is disconnected.The 15.3rd joint has been discussed the various technology that is used to improve the ability that they do like this.Usually, situation will be that some rather than the action that is hopeful can be carried out in off-line.For example, can discern text, but the sign in source possibly depend on the connection based on the search engine of the Internet.Therefore, in some instances, device storage fully about each operation progress information how far so that the remainder of system continues effectively when connect recovering.
The operation of system will be benefited from available immediately connection usually, wherein carry out some they possibly have advantage as batch processing some situations of catching and carry out then but exist.For example, like what discussed in following the 13rd joint, the sign in specific source of catching can make in the approximately uniform time through the inspection user other catch and strengthen widely.Provide in the system of real-time feedback to the user therein, system only can use catching in the past when handling current catching.Yet if catch one of batch processing of storing when being equipment off-line, system is in that carry out can considering when it is analyzed can be from catching and previous any data of catching acquisition afterwards so.
12.2
On main process equipment
Capture device can be with certain other devices communicating such as PC so that many functions of executive system, comprise more detailed mutual with the user.
12.2.1
The activity of carrying out in response to catching
When the main process equipment reception was caught, it can initiate various activities.System is following with the imperfect tabulation of catching the possible activity of carrying out afterwards in related electronic copies document and the position in the document in the location.
The details of catching can be stored in user's the history.(the 6.1st joint)
Can obtain document from local memory storage or remote location.(the 8th joint)
Can upgrade operating system metadata and other records with document associations.(the 11.1st joint)
Can check with the mark of document associations so that confirm ensuing associative operation.(the 5th joint)
Can start software application with editor, check or otherwise to document function.The selection of using can be depended on source document or depend on the content of catching or depend on other aspects of catching.(11.2.2,11.2.3 joint)
That application can be rolled to, add is bright, move the insertion point to or otherwise indicate the position of catching.(the 11.3rd joint)
Can revise the accurate boundary of the text of catching, so that whole speech, sentence or paragraph around the text of for example selecting to catch.(11.3.2 joint)
The user can be given and text copy is perhaps carried out other standard operation systems or dedicated operations to it to clipbook option will be caught.
Can note and document or the text of catching is related.These notes can perhaps for example can be hunted down under the situation of the voice annotation related with the image of catching from instant user's input in early days.(the 19.4th joint)
Can check mark so that confirm one group of other possible operation supplying the user to select.
12.2.2
The context popup menu
Sometimes the suitable action taked of system will be significantly, but it will require the user to make a choice sometimes.A kind of good mode of doing like this is " popup menu " or so-called " context menu " that occurs near the content on the display of capture device through using.(referring to the 11.3.3 joint).In some instances, capture device projects to popup menu on the paper document.The user can use the classic method such as keyboard and mouse; Perhaps, perhaps from such menu, select through using capture device and graphoscope mutual (12.2.4 joint) through using the control (12.1.2 joint) on the capture device.In some instances, the popup menu that can be used as result's appearance of catching comprises default, and these default representative is under the situation that the user does not respond---for example, ignore menu and make the action that occurs under another situation of catching the user.
12.2.3
The feedback of disambiguation
When the user begins to catch text, originally will there be some documents or other text positions that it can mate.Along with more text is hunted down, and considered other factors (the 13rd joint), the quantity of position candidate will reduce, and identified up to the position of reality, and further disambiguation is impossible under the situation that does not have the user to import.In some instances, system for example provides the document that finds or the real-time demonstration of position with tabulation, thumbnail image or text chunk form, and the number of elements in showing for this, reduces quantity along with the continuation of catching.In some instances, system shows the thumbnail of all candidate documents, and wherein the size of thumbnail or position depend on that it is the probability of correct coupling.
When sign is caught clearly, can for example use audible feedback to stress this fact to the user.
The text of sometimes, catching will appear in many documents and will be identified as quoted passage.System can for example be grouped in original source document through the document that will comprise the list of references of quoting and on screen, show this point on every side.
12.2.4
From screen capture
Some capture devices possibly can be caught the text that shows on screen and the paper.Therefore, the document that term reproduces here is used to refer to and is printed onto on the paper is not unique form of reproducing, and can be valuable equally during being captured in the text and being presented on the electronic console of the text that uses of confession system or symbol.
From various other reasonses, the user of described system maybe be mutual with computer screen, so that from option list, select.Other chapters and sections have been described as physical control on the capture device of input method (12.1.2 joint) or attitude (12.1.3 joint); It maybe even be easily when capturing information; Form the display device related, for example keyboard or mouse with replaceable input method.
In some instances, capture device can be under the situation that need not to handle the text of catching, possibly through specialized hardware or its position on screen of software sensing on the computing machine.
13.
Context interpretation
An importance of described system is except simply the catching of text string, to use other factor so that the document that helps sign to use.Often catching of amount of text of appropriateness can identify document uniquely, but under many situations, it will identify some candidate documents.A solution is to point out the user source of the information that affirmation is caught, but a preferred replaceable scheme is to utilize other factors automatically to dwindle possibility.Such side information can reduce the amount of text that need catch sharp and/or increase the reliability and the speed that can identify the position in the electronic copies.This extra material is called " context ", and it has carried out concise and to the point discussion in the 4.2.2 joint.We more in depth consider it now.
13.1
System with catch context
Perhaps, the most important instance of this information is user's the history of catching.
Very possible is, any given catch from the previous identical document of catching, perhaps come the document of auto correlation, formerly catch under the situation about occurring in nearest a few minutes especially true (6.1.2 joint).On the contrary, change between catching at two if system detects font, so more possible is that they are from different documents.
Equally usefully user's longer-term is caught history and reading habit.These also can be used for developing user's interest and correlation model.
13.2
User's real world context
The geographic position that useful contextual another instance is the user.For example, the user in Paris read Die Welt than read Seattle Times more maybe many.Therefore, the opportunity of the printed copy of document, scale and geographic distribution possibly be important, and can from the operation of system, infer to a certain extent.
Always read one type publication on the road that for example is on duty and under the user's who reads dissimilar publications on the lunchtime or the train of going home situation, day the time also possibly be significant.
13.3
Relevant digital context
The user comprises that recently for electronic document the use of those documents of searching for or obtain through more conventional means also can be helpful designator.
In some cases, for example on enterprise network, can consider other factor effectively:
Printed which document recently?
Revised which document on the corporate file server recently?
Sent which document through Email recently?
All these instances hint that perhaps the user more possibly read the hard-copies of these documents.What form contrast with it is if the resident warehouse of document can affirm that document is always perhaps sent to it by printing and possibly printed Anywhere, can in any search that derives from paper, eliminate the document safely so.
13.4
Other statistical data---global context
The 14th joint has been contained the data-flow analysis that obtains by based on the search of paper; But should be noted that; Here, about the popularity of document in other readers, about this epidemic opportunity and about the statistical data of the documentation section of catching the most continually all be possible in search procedure the instance of useful other factor.System takes the possibility of Google's formula page rank to the paper world.
Be used for some other implication of search engine for context, also save referring to 4.2.2.
14.
Data-flow analysis
The use of system generates extremely valuable data stream as spinoff.This stream is that what and the record when read the user reading, and is that what valuable especially record they find in many cases in the thing that they read.Always really not available before such data for paper document.
Described that wherein these data maybe be for system and for some useful modes of the user of system in the 6.1st joint.This joint concentrates on it and is used for other aspects.Certainly, have a large amount of privacy concerns, but the problem such as the anonymity of retention data is known for those skilled in the art for any distribution of reading and so on data about people.
14.1
Document tracking
When system knew that which document any given user reading, whom it also can infer was being read any given document.This allows to follow the tracks of document through tissue, for example allow to analyze who reading it and when read, it have manyly distribute widely, how long this distributions spends and who has seen current version when other people still use out-of-date copy.
For the document of publication with extensive distribution, follow the tracks of each copy difficulty more, remain possible but analyze the Readership distribution.
14.2
Read rank---the popularity in document and subarea
The user catches in the situation of their interested especially text or other data therein, and system can infer the popularity in the specific subarea of particular document and those documents.This is formed into the valuable input (4.2.2 joint) of system itself and is used for author, publisher and advertizer's important information source (the 7.6th joint, the 10.5th joint).These data also are useful in being integrated into search engine and search index the time, for example so that help the Search Results from the inquiry of the document that reproduces is carried out rank, and/or help rank is carried out in the routine inquiry of keying in the web browser.
14.3
Customer analysis---set up profile
The user is reading and so on the interest and movable quite detailed model that the user can create in the knowledge system that makes.This possibly be useful on the basis of abstract statistics---" buying the user's of this newspaper the 35% nearest books of also reading this author "---but as below discuss, it also can allow with other of individual user mutual.
14.3.1
Social networks
Instance be with a user with have a related interests other people be connected.These people can be the people that this user has been familiar with.The college professor can inquire in system; " you know that you have also just read this piece paper the colleague of XYZ university? " The user can inquire in system, " you want with your neighbours in also get in touch other people that read " letter is liked "? " Such contact can be the basis of the automatic formation of entity world or online books club and similar social structure.
14.3.2
Marketing
The 10.6th joint has been mentioned the thought that products & services are provided to the individual user alternately based on user and system.Current online bookman for example often based on the user previous with the bookman make recommendation to the user alternately.Being recommended in them and becoming much useful based on actual books mutual time the like this.
14.4
Based on the otherwise marketing of data stream
We have discussed some such modes, wherein system can influence those modes of publishing document, through those modes of their advertisements and other sale of initiating from paper (the 10th joint).Some business activities maybe be directly not mutual at all with paper document, yet influenced by they.For example, the people in community possibly be that to set up the someone institute of Health Club interested than the knowledge in cost more time aspect the financial part aspect the sports part of newspaper.
14.5
Can captive data type
Except the statistical data of discussing (for example who is reading which position of which document and when and where to read), possibly meaningfully check the actual content of captive text, no matter whether document is positioned.
Under many situations, the user also will not only catch certain text, and as a result of will make certain action take place.It possibly be for example will send to the acquaintance for quoting through Email of document.Even under situation about not existing about the recipient's of user's identity or Email information, someone thinks that the knowledge that the document is worth sending through Email also is very useful.
Except the distinct methods of discussing to the value of inferring particular document or one section text, in some cases, the user will be through distributing a grade and clearly show this value to it.
At last, when known one group of particular user forms a group, for example when known they when being the employee of specific company, the tabulate statistics data of this group can be used for inferring the importance of particular document for this group.This be applicable to through the machine sort technology based on about document, catch, group that user or the like identifies, said machine sort is counted for example Bayesian statistics, cluster, k arest neighbors (k-NN), svd (SVD) or the like.
15.
Apparatus characteristic and function
In some instances; Capture device can be integrated with mobile phone; Wherein telephony hardware is not modified so that support said system; For example its Chinese version is caught and can be through image capturing is accomplished fully and be in reason by phone directory; Perhaps by connecting through wireless network for example or honeycomb connects and can be moved the system handles of telephone interview, perhaps store in the storer of phone so that following the processing.The phone in many modern times has the ability of the software of downloading some part that is suitable for the system that realizes.In some instances, be embedded into the image that camera in many mobile phones is used for catching text.The telephone displays of serving as the stadimeter of camera usually can cover about picture quality and for applicability, which text chunk of OCR and just be hunted down and even on OCR can the real-time camera images information in the transcription of text under the situation about carrying out on the phone.Telephone displays also can provide interface, and the user is can be through this interface and the text of catching mutual and cause related action.
Similarly, voice data can be by the microphones capture of mobile phone.Yet like this sound is captured in (for example when having the lot of background noise) under many situations and is likely suboptimum, and the accurate speech recognition task that also is difficulty in the best.Audio devices can preferably be used for catching voice annotation.
In some instances, revise phone to add special-purpose acquisition equipment, perhaps with the independent bluetooth of telephone communication
TMConnect outer if in the folder formula adapter such function is provided.Regardless of the character of catch mechanism, system and modern mobile phone be integrated to have many other advantages.Phone is connected with the more wide world, this means inquiry to be submitted to other parts of remote search engines or system, and can obtain the copy of document so that store immediately or check.Phone typically has enough processing poweies so that many functions of local ground executive system, and enough memory spaces are so that catch rational data volume.Memory space often also can be expanded by the user.Phone has goodish display and audio devices so that user feedback is provided, and often has the vibrating function that is used for tactile feedback.They also have good power supply.
Perhaps, be apparent that the user of many expections has carried mobile phone.
The capture device that uses with system only needs a kind of mode that catch from the text of the reproduction version of document.As described previously, this is caught and can realize through various methods, and these methods comprise takes pictures perhaps with in some speech key entry keypads to the part of document.This catch can use have image and audio capture capabilities or also the optical scanner of recording of voice note realize.
15.1
Input and output
The 12.1st joint has been described many additional input and the output units that maybe be useful that are used for this equipment.They comprise button, roller and the touch pad that is used to import and display, pilot lamp, the audio frequency that is used to export and sense of touch converter.Sometimes, equipment will merge the many devices in these devices, then merge considerably less device sometimes.Sometimes, capture device can for example use wireless link and another devices communicating that has them (the 15.6th joint), and sometimes, capturing function will merge to (the 15.7th joint) in other such equipment.
15.2
Connectivity
In some instances, equipment is realized the major part of system itself.Yet, in some instances, it often use communicator and PC or other computing equipments and with more wide world communication.
These communicators often be in the conventional data network (for example Ethernet, 802.11 or UWB) or standard peripherals connect network (for example USB, IEEE-1394 (live wire), bluetooth
TMOr infrared) form.When the wired connection used such as live wire or USB, equipment can be through identical connection reception electric power.In some cases, capture device possibly be the conventional peripheral hardware such as the USB memory device at the machine that connects.
At last, in some cases, equipment can " dock " with another equipment, perhaps uses with this equipment or is used for storing easily.
15.3
Buffer memory and other on-line functions
The 3.5th joint and 12.1.4 joint have proposed the topic of opening operation.When capture device have total system function finite subset and not when system other parts are communicated by letter, it is useful that equipment possibly remain, although function available reduces sometimes.Under the simplest level, equipment can write down captive original image or voice data and this and can handle afterwards.Yet; For user's interests, possibly importantly under possible situation, provide about captive data whether possibly be for task on hand enough, whether it can be identified or be identified probably and whether data source later on can be by sign or the feedback that is identified probably.Then, the user will know whether their activity of catching is worth.Even when all the above the unknowns, also still can store raw data, make that the user can quote them afterwards at least.For example, can not discern when catching, can present the image of catching to the user when the OCR process.
For some options in the available option scope are described, minimal optical scanning device is described below and be then characteristic more complete many optical scanning devices.Many equipment occupy the intermediate zone between this two.
15.3.1
SimpleScanner-low side off-line instance
SimpleScanner has and reads the scanner head from the pixel of the page in the time of can moving in the length along line of text.It can detect its moving and write down some information of moving about this along the page.It also has clock, and its permission is added a cover timestamp to each scanning.When SimpleScanner connected, clock and main process equipment were synchronous.When clock cannot be represented actual day, but can confirm the relative time, make main frame can infer actual sweep time, perhaps infer elapsed time between the scanning under the worst situation from it.
SimpleScanner itself does not have the processing power of enough any OCR of execution, but it have really about typical speech length, speech spacing and with some ABCs of the relation of font size.It has some basic pilot lamp; These pilot lamp tell whether scanning input possibly can read; Whether scanner head strides that paper moves too soon, too slow or out of true too, and when it confirms to have scanned enough speech of giving sizing for the document that will identify.
SimpleScanner has USB connector and can be inserted into the USB port on the computing machine, will recharge it at this USB port place.For computing machine, it appears to the USB memory device that the remainder that write down the data file of adding a cover timestamp and system software on it is taken over from this point.
15.3.2
The high-end off-line instance of SuperDevice-
SuperDevice also depends on the operation of connectivity to realize that it is complete, but it has storage and processing on a large amount of plates, and this can help it when off-line, to make better judgement for the data of catching.
When SuperDevice caught text through the image of for example handling the document of being caught by the camera of SuperDevice, the text of catching was delivered to the OCR engine of attempting to discern the text.Some fonts comprise those fonts of the publications of reading at most from the user downloading to equipment so that help to carry out this task, as with user PC on user's spell check dictionary synchronously and thereby comprise the dictionary of many speech that they frequently run into.The speech and the tabulation of phrase that have the typical frequencies of its use also are stored on the SuperDevice, and this can make up with dictionary.SuperDevice can the frequency of utilization statistical data so that help identifying and inform that also when it about catching the judgement of enough amount of text; The most frequently the phrase of Shi Yonging unlikely can be used as the basis of search inquiry.
In addition, SuperDevice is last to have stored the complete index of the nearest interim article of newspaper that the user the most often reads and periodical, as the user recently from network the bookman buy or the recent months user catch the index of the books of anything from it.At last; Storage has the title of thousands of the most popular publications of the data that can be used for system; Make that under the situation that does not have other information the user can catch title and have about whether obtaining the good idea of catching from particular work with electronic form later.
During acquisition procedure, system informs that data that the user catches have enough quality and become possibility with enough character so that when the electronic copy that recovers can to obtain when being connected the information of catching.Often, system indicates known acquisition success and has discerned context in one of index onboard to the user, and perhaps known relevant publication makes its data can use for system, thereby later obtaining should be successful.
SuperDevice rests in the carriage of the live wire that is connected to PC or USB port, and at this some place, except uploading the data of catching, index and other databases are uploaded based on nearest User Activity and new publication on its different plates.SuperDevice also has the device that is connected to wireless public network, cellular network or passes through bluetooth
TMBut with mobile phone communications and thereby at such device time spent and public network communication.In some cases, can wirelessly upgrade index and other databases on the plate.This renewal process can be initiated or automatically initiated by system by the user.
15.4
The characteristic that is used for image capturing
Some characteristics that our present consideration possibly hoped in capture device especially.
15.4.1
Location and optical device flexibly easily
Paper continue one of popular reason be its be easy to therein for example computing machine with in the impracticable or inconvenient various situations.Expection catch the mutual considerable part of user and paper equipment thereby should be easy to use similarly.For the scanner in past, situation is really not so; Even also some heaviness of minimum portable equipment.Those equipment that are designed to contact with the page must keep becoming accurate angle and extreme care ground to move along the length of the text that will scan with paper.This is acceptable when on desk, scanning business report, but then maybe be impracticable when scanning is from the phrase of novel when waiting for train.Operating in maybe be useful in many cases similarly from the capture device based on camera of paper a distance.
Some instances of system use such scanner, and itself and paper scan contiguously, and it replaces lens to use image catheter fiber bundle to be transferred to optical sensor device from the image of the page.Such equipment can be shaped to and allow it to remain on the position of nature; For example, in some instances, the part that contacts with the page is a wedge shape, thereby allows user's hand to move more naturally above the page to be similar to the motion of using e-Pointer.Conduit or directly contact with paper perhaps is close to paper, and can have the replaceable clear tip that can protect the image conduit to avoid possible damage.As already mentioned in the 12.2.4 joint, scanner can be used for from screen scanning and from paper scanning, and most advanced and sophisticated material can be selected to the possibility that reduces the such display of damage.
At last, some instances of equipment will provide during acquisition procedure and feed back to the user, it will be used up through making, sound or tactile feedback when indicate the user move capture device too soon, too slowly, too inhomogeneous or catching drift De Taigao or too low on the row.
15.5
Security, identity, authentication, individualized and charging
As the 6th the joint described in, capture device can be formed for the sign of Secure Transaction, purchase and various other operations and the pith of mandate.Therefore, except this effect required circuit and software, it can merge can be so that its safer different hardware characteristic, for example intellignet card fetch, RFID or key in the keypad of PIN thereon.

The individual uses
16.1
The life library shop
Life library shop (6.1.1 joint) is the Digital Archives of subscriber's any important documents of hoping to preserve, and is the set of the Service Instance of this system.Important books, magazine article, newspaper montage or the like can be kept in the life library shop with digital form.In addition, subscriber's note, comment and notes can be preserved with document.The Internet and world wide web access can be passed through in the life library shop.
System is created and document archives, managerial life library for the subscriber.The subscriber is through catching from the information of document or through otherwise indicating during the subscriber hopes the life library shop of which document storing at him to the life library shop that the subscriber is added this particular document in system's indication.The information of catching typically is the text from document, but also can be bar code or other codes of sign document.System accepts this code and uses it to come the identification sources document.After identifying document, system can store the copy of document in user's the life library shop or store the link that wherein can obtain the source of the document into.
An instance of life library shop system can check whether the authorized subscriber electron gain copies.For example, if the reader catches text or identifier from the copy of the article of the New York Times (NYT), make this article to add reader's life library shop to, life library shop system will verify whether the reader has subscribed to the online version of NYT with NYT so; If the reader allows the copy of article store among his the life library shop account so; If not, the information stores that identifies document so and how to order it is in his life library shop account.
In some instances, system safeguards the subscriber's profile that comprises access privileges information for each subscriber.Document access information can be edited in a number of ways, and wherein two kinds are: 1) subscriber offers life library shop system with document access information with his account name and password or the like; Perhaps 2) life library shop ISP is to the inquiry subscriber's of publisher information, and publisher is authorized to visit life library shop subscriber under the situation of said material and makes response through providing for the visit of electronic copy.If the uncommitted electronic copy that has document of life library shop subscriber, publisher provides price to life library shop ISP so, and this life library shop ISP provides the option of buying electronic document to client then.If like this, life library shop ISP directly pays to publisher and makes out the bill to life library shop client later on, and perhaps life library shop ISP makes out the bill for client's credit card to this purchase immediately.Life library shop ISP will obtain certain percentage or little fixed expense of purchasing price because of promoting this transaction.
File for document in any other library that system can have the archives privilege subscriber's individual library and/or subscriber.For example, when the user caught the text of document from printing, life library shop system can identify the document and the electronic copies thereof of reproduction.After identifying source document, individual library and subscriber that life library shop system can record the information about source document the user have in the colony library of archives privilege.The colony library is the cooperation archives such as document repository, is used for: be the colony that certain project is worked together, academic research personnel colony, group network daily record or the like.
Regular organization activity library in many ways: in chronological order, press theme,,, press ISBN and perhaps press Dewey decimal or the like by publishing type (newspaper, books, magazine, technical papers or the like), where reading, when read by subscriber's interest level.In a kind of replaceable scheme, system can be based on other subscribers how to classify identical document and learning classification.System can advise classification or automatically be user's the document of classifying to the user.
In different instances, can directly note be inserted in the document and perhaps can in independent file, safeguard note.For example, when the subscriber catches the text from newspaper article, the text of catching added brightly this article is archived in his the life library shop.Replacedly, this article and related comment file are archived in together (thereby the document that keeps filing is not modified) in his the life library shop.The instance of system can keep the copy of source document in each subscriber's library, in the main library that many subscribers can visit, keep copy, perhaps remains to the link of the copy that publisher holds.
In some instances, the user is only stored to the modification of document (for example add bright or the like) and in the link of the online version (being stored in other places) of document in the life library shop.System or subscriber when the subscriber obtains document subsequently, these are changed and document combines.
If note remains in the independent file, so source document and comment file are offered subscriber and subscriber and make up their to create document of revising.Replacedly, system made up this two files before these two files being offered the subscriber.In another replaceable scheme, comment file is the covering of document files and can covers on the document through the software in subscriber's the computing machine.
Subscriber's Monthly Payment of life library shop service is so that allow system maintenance subscriber's archives.Replacedly, subscriber's each document payment small charge (for example small amount payment) for storing in the archives.Replacedly, the subscriber is by the archives of each interview expenses payment with access subscribers.Replacedly, the subscriber can the editor library and with life library shop ISP and copyright owner's revenue sharing model on allow other people to visit material/note.Replacedly, life library shop ISP receives the payment (with the revenue sharing model of publisher, wherein life library shop ISP obtains being divided into of publisher's income) from publisher during subscriber's subscription in the life library shop.
In some instances, life library shop ISP serves as intermediary between subscriber and the copyright owner (perhaps copyright owner's agency, for example copyright settlement center claims CCC again) so that be that copyright material promotes render bill and payment.The bill information that life library shop ISP uses the subscriber and other user account informations are to provide this intermediary sevices.Basically, life library shop ISP utilization and subscriber's the relation that is pre-existing in is to allow the representing subscriber to buy copyright material.
In some instances, life library shop system can store the extracts from document.For example, when the subscriber caught the text from paper document, the life library shop was taken passages and is placed in the zone around the text of catching, rather than entire document is archived in the life library shop.This is particularly advantageous when document is longer because keep the situation of raw captured prevented the subscriber again reading documents to find out interesting part.Certainly, can be included in the hyperlink of the whole electronic copies of paper document with the extracts material.
In some instances; System also will be about the information stores of document in the life library shop, these information for example author, publication title, publication date, publisher, copyright owner (perhaps copyright owner's devolution mechanism), ISBN, to the link of the public note of document, read rank or the like.About in this additional information of document some are paper document metadata forms.The third party can create public comment file and visit for the people that are different from themselves (for example the general public).Is favourable to the third party for the link of the comment of document, has strengthened the understanding of subscriber for document because read other users' comment file.
In some instances, system's category files to material.This characteristic allow life library shop subscriber store apace whole classification paper document electronic copies and do not visit each paper document.For example, when the subscriber catches certain text from the copy of national geography magazine, the option that system provides all a back issues to National Geographic to file to the subscriber.All a back issues if the subscriber selects to file, life library shop ISP will verify whether the subscriber is authorized to do like this with national geography association so.If, life library shop ISP can not facilitate the right of buying the set of file national geography magazine between two parties so.

In some instances, the information that appears comprise with the audio frequency that receives in the visually displayable information of the relevance that provides.For example, the audio frequency of reception can be radio broadcasting or the on-the-spot lecture about given theme.The audio conversion of this reception is become text and handle with the not only relevant word of sign with theme, and sign additional word or content that possibly during the process of the audio frequency that receives, occur or that logically derive according to the audio frequency of reception.Therefore, in an example, the audio frequency of reception maybe be with corresponding from the track of current interplanetary travel (Star Trek) collection of drama of replaying on TV.System receives this track, and wherein audio frequency comprises quoting composer Brahms (Bo Lamusi).So system can not only obtain the information relevant with program interplanetary travel, and the acquisition information relevant with Bo Lamusi, for example the biography of Bo Lamusi, he photo, to select by link (or downloaded files) of the musical recording of his composition or the like.
In some instances, system samples so that identify the position in this sequence and/or this sequence to tonic train.For example, system can carry out speech-to-text technology or non-text matches technology when the position in identifier and/or the sequence, discusses to the document of sign text and/or reproduction like this paper.System can use the position of sign to obtain the clean version of tonic train, the transcript of tonic train, mark related with tonic train or the like then, so as the information that the identification audio sequence appears maybe can carry out action with the tonic train content associated.
In some instances, additional information and inequivalence relevant with audio content be not in audio content (for example, it is the transcript or the summary of audio content).On the contrary, it provides enhancing, clarification, enlightenment or the starting point of audio content.In fact; Additional information and system described herein provide the 1:n between audio content and the side information relation; It helps further qualification, clarification, expansion or otherwise strengthens audio content, and can represent the information of any multi-form a plurality of different pages.
Figure 10 shows in response to the audio frequency that receives and receives, analyzes and provide the functional part of relevant information or the set of module.Although be described as the functional module that realizes and carried out by one or more microprocessors (or similar devices) with software substantially, the parts of Figure 10 can for example pass through one group of logic gate (for example field programmable gate array (FPGA)), special IC (ASIC) or the like to be realized with hardware.In addition, be combined into a unit 1000 together although be illustrated as, the one or more parts shown in Figure 10 can externally be realized.For example, most of parts can be realized that wherein one or more modules are realized by one or more server computers by capture device.Therefore, some parts can be installed on mobile device and carry out, and miscellaneous part sends to network or cloud is handled.
Audio frequency receiving-member 1002 for example receives audio frequency through microphone, and the sound signal that receives can be amplified or decay as required.In addition, audio frequency receiving-member 1002 can receive prerecorded audio file or the outside stream send audio sequence that produces or announce.The audio frequency that receives can be from any source, but maybe be particularly useful for abundant in content source, the for example talk show of said abundant in content source, incoming call demonstration, news hour, lecture and symposial, blog or the like.
Speech-to-text parts 1006 convert the spoken words in the audio frequency that receives to text.The speech-to-text parts also can comprise the speech recognition function, wherein what are saying to specific speaker or one group of specific speaker's training system so that attempt to identify the talker and more preferably discern based on known interest, creation tendency and/or other voice of speaker and sound producing pattern.There are many existing text-speech features, for example those text-speech features of Nuance communication common carrier, IBM, Microsoft or the like production.In an example, audio frequency receiving-member 1002 is microphones of reception and amplification of radiocommunication broadcasting, and 1004 pairs of audio frequency low frequencies of Audio Processing parts and high fdrequency component filtering, makes speech-to-text parts 1006 only receive the spoken audio frequency of hoping ideally.The speech-to-text parts become text with spoken audio conversion then, and the text can be stored as text for further processing.
Text analyzing parts 1008 can be created the word index and create the counting of such word so that sequentially identify the word of the most often saying.Search engine is carried out automatic indexation through parsing and storage text and is beneficial to information retrieval fast and accurately.In an example, the text analyzing parts adopt the full-text indexingization of audio frequency of all receptions and conversion so that produce the natural language text file, but system can the operating part text indexization so that the degree of depth of restriction indexation is to reduce the index size.Generally speaking, a purpose for text establishment and storage index is to optimize at the audio frequency of analyzing reception so that speed and performance aspect the generation search inquiry.Do not having under the situation of index, system possibly be each analysis or the inquiry scan text of carrying out, and this will need suitable time and computing power.Can filter word commonly used, for example article (, should), and (stemmed) word that derives from makes to word groupings similar on the grammer (for example, all verb forms that divides into groups are such as " jump ", " jumping ", " jumping ").Extracting stem (stemming) is to be used for stem, base form or the root form of flexion (perhaps deriving sometimes) word yojan for them---be generally the process of the word forms of writing.It is identical with the morphology root of word that stem need not, but only relevant word is mapped to or corresponding to identical stem, even this stem itself is not effective root.The process of extracting stem is being useful aspect the inquiry that is used for search engine aspect the establishment index but also in generation not only.
Inquiry generates the inquiry that parts 1010 acquisitions can be submitted to search engine from the information and the generation of text analyzing parts.In an example, the most frequently used one or more spoken word is transferred to search engine so that the content-related information of the audio frequency of acquisition and reception through network from mobile device during the predetermined amount of time.Inquiry generates parts can generate initial or seed inquiry through automatically using from the word frequency consideration of the natural language statement in the text and the everyday expressions of using boolean's connector and boolean search formula to make up in the certain hour section.
Inquiry generates parts can carry out query expansion or similar techniques.Query expansion is to reformulate seed inquiry to improve the process of the performance of retrieving relevant information.Query expansion relate to the initial query that evaluating system creates (selected what word, for example two minutes at interval in the most frequently used noun or noun phrase) and the information of expanded search inquiry to attempt to obtain to add.Query expansion relates to some technology, for example seek word synonym, seek form (for example to jargon or slang phrase) that all different morphological form of word, search automatically proofread and correct through each word in the inquiry being extracted stem, to the word in original query weighting again and will do not added to original query by the contextual information that original query comprised.
As noted above; Text analyzing parts 1008 and inquiry generation parts 1010 resolve to the contents fragment of representative from the content of the audio frequency that receives with the audio stream of text or reception; Each theme that for example causes during the audio program or the noun mentioned, and in these contents fragments each is with generating one or more inquiries.Then, the relevant information that relevant information processing element 1012 receives and disposal system is retrieved.In an example, this comprises the reception relevant information and it is offered display device so that watched by the user.The daily record of all relevant informations that historical parts 1014 maintenances of relevant information receive based on the inquiry of submitting to.This allows after user for this user time examination relevant information more easily.Therefore, if the user is just listening to radio broadcasting when driving to participate in a conference, all relevant with this program so information can be stored and later on by the user in that the time is watched easily.
The reception and the route of communication and route parts 1016 process informations.As noted above, audio frequency can be received through microphone, perhaps as the audio file that receives through network.Likewise, relevant information can receive on mobile device and show, perhaps is routed to another equipment.Therefore, the user can Request System show so that nigh equipment (for example PC computing machine, wireless photo frame, laptop computer, TV set-top box) is gone up through communication component 1016 route related information.Therefore, communication component can be visited the electronic address of the storage that is used for such equipment so that allow route related information, for example phone number, URL, IP address or the like.In for example superincumbent II of this paper and the III joint the other details about the parts of Figure 10 has been described.
Figure 11 is the routine 1100 that is used to handle the audio frequency of reception.In step 1102, system receives the information based on audio frequency, scene for example as noted above or prerecorded information.In step 1104, the audio frequency that system receives through 1004 pre-service of Audio Processing parts, for example filtering.In step 1106, system for example uses speech-to-text parts 1006 that audio conversion is become text.In step 1108, system carries out action based on the content of the audio stream that receives.As described herein, this action can be taked one of many forms.
Figure 12 is the process flow diagram that the step of carrying out in the step 1108 is shown.In step 1202, system uses for example text analyzing parts 1008 sign search terms.In step 1204, system uses for example inquiry to generate parts 1010 and inquires about or search for.In step 1206, system's (for example through communication and route parts 1016) receives relevant information or content.In step 1208, system's equipment that outputs to sign with relevant information that will receive for example outputs to the equipment of capturing information for demonstration.For example, communication and route parts 1016 and relevant information processing element 1012 are routed to relevant information user's mobile device and user's personal computer.
Figure 13 shows the user interface that is used for showing to the user side information.Display of user interfaces on any display device that system can point out in the above.Relevant information processing element 1012 can generate graph time line 1302, this graph time line by segmentation so that the different content piece in the audio frequency of reception is shown.In the instance of Figure 13, audio frequency extends to 2:30:00 from 2:00:00, represents 30 minutes audio program.Left hand " last one " arrow 1304 and the right hand " next one " arrow 1306 allow the user to point to and click these arrows so that the diagrammatic representation of examination previous and next audio-frequency unit (for example going up and follow-up 30 minutes radio broadcasting).Pointed like text, system becomes represent each theme of causing during the audio program with text file analysis or from the contents fragment of the content of the audio frequency of reception.The one or more inquiries that in these contents fragments each and system generate and the relevant information of system retrieves are corresponding.In each contents fragment each represented by the rectangular segments that shows, its first three in Figure 13, be denoted as 1310,1314 and 1318 respectively.
Relevant information processing element 1012 obtains by historical parts 1014 index of relevant information and is stored in one group of relevant information in the storer.In this example, in response to generating the inquiry that parts 1010 provide, inquiry obtains three pages or three screen relevant informations.The relevant information that provides can change to from the simple link to webpage from one or more pages of website copy, to one or more pages of creating based on the relevant information that obtains significantly.The page of creating can comprise the relevant information that obtains from one or more websites, have montage advertisement, gather the single page the multipage text, on the page of creating, be integrated into picture of unitary part or the like.As shown in Figure 13, each page or screen comprise that sign finds the link or the URL of the address of the relevant information page from it, thereby and allow the user to click this link also to forward this page to.The page 1312 also comprises text and the image that obtains from inquiry.
Likewise, second audio fragment 1314 is corresponding with single page 1316 texts, and the 3rd audio fragment 1318 and six retrieval is corresponding with the content page 1320 of storage, and each content page has link, text and image.Extend the page bottom of piling up from every group and the straight line that converges to the respective audio fragment indicates visually where to pile the page related with each audio fragment.Although not shown, each audio fragment can comprise that the search inquiry of being created by inquiry generation parts 310 is so that help user easier ground to confirm the theme of each audio fragment.Therefore, if the key words in the inquiry is " Bo Lamusi ", related with this inquiry so demonstration audio fragment is by tagging like this.
In order further to help user, the corresponding index 1322 of the relevant information that relevant information processing element 1012 can be created and store.As shown in the figure, the tabulation or the form of the corresponding relevant information of all audio fragments and reception and storage represented in this index.Therefore, first audio fragment then is that 1 (for example inquiry) < described>in the description of this content corresponding to the very first time < time 1 >, then is the list of relevant information < list of relevant information 1>that obtains.For each follow-up audio fragment, in index, find similar clauses and subclauses, for example < time 2 >, < describing 2>and < list of relevant information 2 >.
Replace that kind as shown in Figure 13 to be stored and inspection later on, the audio frequency of reception can side by side receive with its generation, for example during lecture or the broadcasting of on-site wireless electricity, receive, and thereby system can side by side relevant information be provided so that show to the user.In this example, the relevant information that shows to the user can be minimum.For example, radio broadcasting possibly just described the current riot in the world and mention African country's Darfur.System can be provided to about the link of the wikipedia page of Darfur then or obtains the content from this page, but historical parts will be stored additional relevant information for watching later on.Therefore; The user can be for example during radio broadcasting the mobile device through the user show the wikipedia page about Darfur, but the personal computer that moved towards her afterwards on (for example that night) is to watch a plurality of pages about Darfur through historical component stores.
Certainly, between audio frequency that receives and the relevant information of presenting to the user that obtains, possibly there is time delay.In some cases, understand systematicly this time delay and provide this delay of indication maybe great feedback to the user.In some cases, the audio frequency of system buffer reception is with minimize latency, so that make appearing and any information synchronization that appears of audio frequency.
For audio frequency on-the-spot or that receive in real time, the relevant information processing element possibly not have time enough accurately the audio content disambiguation is perhaps assembled audio content, as shown in Figure 13.Too many processing expenditure (the very large environment of noise that for example has a plurality of human speakers and background music) that this possibly adopted when extracting text owing to the capacity of the audio frequency of the treatment limits on the mobile device, time-constrain, reception and audio content wherein, in processing audio or the like.As a result, system can be simply becomes periodically fragment with the audio parsing that receives, two minutes wide fragments for example, and provide with this fragment during the most frequently used word or the related single page relevant information of phrase explained.The user can have the segmentation of the audio frequency that slows down or accelerate to receive and thereby the option of the speed of relevant information is provided to the user.Showing simultaneously at this provides relevant information seldom in instance, because this information maybe be uncorrelated with audio content or inessential for the user.
The user can have to system's input possibly have the chance of the sign of one of some functions.It can command system provides about the more relevant information of the ratio typical case of the content of the audio frequency that receives.Another sign may simply be will be to the bookmark or the visual indicator of user's demonstration.In the instance of Figure 13, can add one of bright audio fragment so that indicate user's sign with red or yellow, perhaps can sign is related with whole audio program itself.
Another sign can with the item associations that identifies in the audio frequency that buy to receive.For example, if radio programming is mentioned books, so the user can to mobile device provide the books that order automatically mentions copy, for example from user's Amazon.com account's input.Another sign can command system about the follow-up article of identical audio content or other medium (for example audio stream) but the time spent send notice and give the user.This will allow the user to follow story and find follow-up incident.
Also can provide sign to carry out other actions.For example; A sign can be given user's (Email, SMS, voice mail or the like) so that indicate the TV programme about said audio content when to be arranged in so that system automatically sends notice, and another sign can be so that system command set-top box or digital video recorder recorded program.
The user can import default and preference.For example, the user can the regulation relevant information from particular source or be in specific format (for example, but, any public TV content related with audio content is provided) when the time spent.
Can adopt the performance of many interchangeable or additional processes with enhanced system.For example, in order further to help Audio Processing, system can help to attempt location " the best " audio version.If the user for example listens to national public radio at special time with during the date, system can visit the file or the audio stream of this audio program at www.npr.org so.According to this audio frequency, system maybe can be more accurate many ground become text with speech conversion.
If system for example have the right to visit maybe be in television broadcasting the video manuscript of available speaker's lip, system can improve the speech-to-text conversion through carrying out the automatic labiomaney that helps to improve the speech-to-text conversion so.
Text analyzing parts 1008 (and/or speech-to-text parts) can analysis context information to carry out better text analyzing (or speech-to-text conversion).Therefore, system can analyze the time related with the audio frequency that receives and should the time and the calendar of calendar or scheduler program compare maybe be relevant with what to identify this audio frequency.If user's calendar shows that in the time that receives audio frequency, the user is is coming and going meeting, system can suppose that the user is just listening to radio in her automobile and when driving to participate in a conference so.This will participate in the calendar formation contrast about the lecture of Mayan literature with showing the user.The text analyzing parts also can obtain to show the positional information that the user is just moving with 60 miles speed per hour, further indicate the user in her automobile.Positional information likewise can be with helping to confirm that the user be positioned at University of Washington, and this can indicate the user in last her Mayan literature class.If conflict, conflicting between the long-range calendar of the local calendar on user's mobile device and other places storage for example, so mobile calendar can be as the criterion (control).
In another example, system can confirm in given time and position that the user should participate in medical lecture according to user's calendar.If timestamp and geographic coordinate or similar metadata indication user are in preset time and predefined position, system has the high probability of user in the medical lecture of participating in her so.As a result, system can adopt medical dictionary to help more preferably speech conversion to be become text.
As noted above, system automatically attempts text disambiguation and sign important content wherein.For example, be right after " impossible " and near the word " task " word " film " if text comprises, system confirms that the speaker is just referring to the high probability of film " impossible task " so.Therefore, inquiry generates parts can obtain the relevant information about film " impossible task ", has near the theater location in the current present position of projection time and user possibly.In fact, system can attempt to accumulate from the content of the audio frequency that receives and apply it to about before the timestamp of the audio frequency of customer location and reception and the vector afterwards or the contextual information of pattern.If the user reaches two hours in her office; Leave her office then with 30 miles average velocity per hour; Then rest on the corresponding position of customer address among the personal phonebook with the user; System has the high probability that the user participates in client's meet so; And thereby the audio frequency that receives be from client's meet, even do not list such meet in the calendar.
The motion of mobile device can be carried out specific action.If the user is reading the books on laptop computer or the digital reading device (for example Amazon Kindle); And understand systematicly the user and move to her automobile and begin to drive from her dwelling house, system can order audio system in the automobile with the audio form books of replaying so.This can be through allowing the local ground of mobile device perhaps from the audio frequency copy of network positions books and through wireless link the head end audio unit that it offers the automobile realized.Replacedly, mobile device can be from the text version converting text-voice of books, and through the loudspeaker/linking bluetooth on the mobile device/audio jack output it or it is offered the head-end unit in the automobile, or the like.System can be for example at the books that the user is reading or article now on the one or more channels or wireless station/satellite channel in user's automobile, automatically the similar context of sensing switches under situation available on the TV programme.
It is in fact relevant with the audio frequency that receives and be the user's interest probability so that help to improve relevant information that the inquiry parts can be realized the hierarchical structure of data query and relevant information search function.Therefore; If books are mentioned in radio broadcasting, inquire about the information that parts can be retrieved relevant information about the author of these books, editorial that this author writes or works are criticized, the announcer provides information (pointing out as top) and provide or generate as the result of program so.The content of Sheng Chenging can be forum, additional call-in message, open forum and other audio-frequency informations to be discussed and the form of the text based information that can obtain through the internet (for example blog, RSS manuscript, push away other versions of books, article or the publication mentioned in the audio frequency of special model or reception) like this.
In a comparable manner, system can help automatically to the user creates model, make the user can announce herself reflection herself about the viewpoint of audio content or the crucial channel of contribution.Therefore, the user can be through blog, push away the spy, dial in, blog or the like automatically delivery system automatically retrieve and by the content of historical component stores.So adopt the different user of this system to connect through myspace, make they can themselves " channel " go up to contribution each other make estimate or ballot, on channel each other interpolation or control information and help for its content reception to much more more vote, less those users that edited by the third party set up certificate or the like.
Point out that as top the best edition of the audio frequency of reception can be attempted to identify by system.If system can not be based on context (for example user's position, user's motion, day the time, calendar or the like) confirm; System can attempt to identify best audio version according to the pattern in the audio frequency so, and said pattern can compare with the pattern in the audio file of storing.The pattern of audio frequency can be represented and mourn in silence and the pattern of the variation of the dynamic range of time, audio frequency or the like, and on behalf of the simple analysis of audio file, it be used for unique basically " signature " of this audio frequency with exploitation.Therefore, need not complicated speech-to-text and handle, and in fact only need the fraction of analyzing audio.According to this signature, system can compare signature and the signature database that calculates, and wherein said database comprises the form of signature and related audio file.If the coupling of acquisition; System can visit the audio file of this weak point then and carry out the speech-to-text conversion or other processing described herein so, rather than attempts to carry out such analysis based on the more audio version that receives of the noise with less fidelity.
