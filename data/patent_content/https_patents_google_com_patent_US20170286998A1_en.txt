Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to affecting display of content, such as advertising, by taking into account negative reactions of users.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources.
- video, audio, and Web pages are accessible over the Internet.
- These resources present opportunities for other content (e.g., advertising or non-advertising content, such as audio, video, or the like) to be provided with the resources.
- a Web page can include slots in which content can be presented. Similarly, such slots can be part of television programming.
- Slots can be allocated to content providers (e.g., advertisers).
- a network can be used to allocate content to the slots based, e.g., on various factors relating to the content and the context in which it is to be presented.
- the content can be allocated based, in part, on keywords input to a system, such as a search engine.
- An auction can be performed for the right to present advertising in a slot. In the auction, content sponsors provide bids specifying amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of their content. Typically, the winning bidder is given the right to present content.
- Some content providers pay based on a positive interaction with content, e.g., based on a cost-per-click (CPC) or a cost-per-conversion (CVR) basis.
- CPC cost-per-click
- CVR cost-per-conversion
- a click in this context, refers to a user selecting content.
- a conversion in this context, refers to an action taken, such as purchasing a product advertised in an ad.
- Described herein are example techniques for affecting display of content which may include receiving a request for content to supplement a response to an input initiated by a first user; outputting first content in response to the request, where the first content includes a control feature that is displayable along with the first content, and where the control feature enables the first user to register a negative reaction to the first content; obtaining information relating to the first content based on the negative reaction; identifying second content having one or more characteristics in common with the first content; identifying one or more second users having one or more characteristics in common with the first user; and using the information relating to the first content in determining whether to provide the second content to the one or more second users.
- the example techniques may include one or more of the following features, either alone or in combination.
- the information relating to the first content may be used t in determining whether to provide the first content or the second content to the first user in the future.
- the information may be used to prevent providing the first content or the second content in the future, and/or the information may be used to limit providing the first content or the second content in the future.
- the control feature may include an interactive control feature to close the first content or to be redirected away from the first content, and/or may include an interactive control feature to provide feedback about the first content.
- the one or more characteristics of the second content may relate to whether: (1) the first content is part of a same distribution campaign as the second content, (2) the first content and the second content are owned or distributed by a same entity, or (3) the first content and the second content direct users to a domain controlled by a same entity.
- the one or more characteristics of the second content may relate to whether: (1) the first content and the second content have a topic in common, or (2) the first content and the second content direct users to a same domain or to domains having similar topics.
- the one or more characteristics of the second content may relate to a relationship of a brand associated with the first content to a brand associated with the second content.
- Identifying one or more second users having one or more characteristics in common with the first user may include identifying elements of a profile for the first user that match elements of one or more profiles for the one or more second users, where the elements relate to demographics associated with the first user and the one or more second users.
- the information relating to the first content may be used in determining whether to provide the second content to the one or more second users in a context, where the context relates to at least one of an aspect of the response to the input and a time at which the first content is to be provided.
- the information may be obtained based also on negative reactions to the first content by other users.
- the information may indicate whether the first content elicits a negative reaction in general, elicits a negative reaction in a particular topical or temporal context, or elicits a negative reaction by users having one or more characteristics in common.
- the systems and techniques described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented as a computer program product that includes instructions that are stored on one or more machine-readable storage media, and that are executable on one or more processing devices.
- the systems and techniques described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented as an apparatus, method, or electronic system that may include one or more processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to implement the stated functions.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example system for distributing content to users over a network.
- FIG. 2 is an example user interface that includes an example content item that provides elements for receiving negative reactions.
- FIGS. 3 a and 3 b are example user interfaces for receiving information about negative reactions.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example network environment.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing an example process for distributing content to users over a network.
- FIG. 6 shows examples of computing devices on which the processes described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented.
- content items presented to users include user interface elements that users can interact with to indicate a negative reaction to the content.
- a user may find a particular advertisement or the product it advertises to be overly repetitive (e.g., the user has seen the ad too many times), irrelevant (e.g., the advertisement has no relation to the context of the page in which it was presented), uninteresting, offensive, etc.
- the user may indicate such a negative reaction by interacting with the user interface element.
- the offending content item may be removed from view, and the user's reaction may be used to reduce the likelihood of this or other similar and potentially offensive content from being presented to the user in the future.
- the suppression of content can improve the individual user's experience by reducing the amount of annoying or offensive content that he or she is exposed to.
- Such suppression of content can also improve the experience of content publishers whose content can include potentially offending or annoying advertisements (e.g., users are less likely to be driven away by offending ads).
- the suppression of content may also increase the revenues provided to content publishers through advertising (e.g., by not wasting advertising space on offending content in favor of content that may be more likely to generate click-through revenue).
- Such suppression can also improve the efficiency of advertising campaigns, since users who react negatively to identified advertisements may be less likely to see them again, thereby possibly reducing the occurrence of paid ad impressions being presented to disinterested users.
- a user may browse a Web page that includes advertising content provided by a content server.
- One of the ads may advertise a steakhouse, but the user may be a vegetarian.
- the ad includes a user control that the user can click to close or otherwise remove the ad.
- This user action sends feedback to the content server to indicate that the user has reacted negatively to the ad.
- the content server may use this information to prevent the steakhouse ad from being presented to the user again.
- the content server may use this information to prevent similar ads from being shown to the user (e.g., ads for hamburgers).
- the content server may use this information to prevent the ad from being presented to other users (e.g., other users how have identified themselves as being vegetarians).
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example system 100 for distributing content to users over a network.
- a user 102 uses a computer device 104 to browse Web content 105 (e.g., Web pages, streaming video, streaming audio) provided by a Web server 106 .
- Web content 105 e.g., Web pages, streaming video, streaming audio
- the Web server 106 sends a request 108 to a content server 110 that hosts a collection of content 112 (e.g., advertisements).
- the request 108 is a request for a content item 114 that is hosted by the content server 110 .
- the content server 110 responds by sending one or more content items 114 to the Web server 106 for inclusion in the Web page 105 that is provided to the computer device 104 for presentation to the user 102 in response to an initial browser input.
- the Web page 105 includes a content item 120 that includes both content information (e.g., the content item 114 , e.g., the advertising message) and one or more user controls.
- content information e.g., the content item 114 , e.g., the advertising message
- the user 102 can click or otherwise select the user controls in the content item 120 to indicate a negative reaction to the content information in the content item 120 .
- Embodiments of content items with user controls, such as the content item 120 are discussed below in the descriptions of FIGS. 2, 3A, and 3B .
- the user's 102 negative reaction and interaction with the user controls causes a user input message 130 to be sent to the Web server 106 .
- the user input message 130 is processed by the Web server 106 to receive, and interpret, the user's 102 negative response.
- the Web server 106 stores information about the user input message 130 in a response index 140 (e.g., in a database). For example, with appropriate permission from the user, the Web server 106 may store a record of the user's 102 negative response, the user's 102 identity or an anonymous identifier, the identity of the content item 120 , the identity of the content item 114 , and/or combinations of these and other appropriate information that may describe the user's reaction to the content item 120 .
- the user input message 130 may include additional information that describes the user's 102 negative reaction and/or the context in which the reaction occurred.
- the response controls may provide user controls with which the user 102 can interact to express the reason for his or her negative reaction.
- the response controls may provide a way for the user 102 to express “I have seen this ad too many times,” “I am not interested in this product, good, or service,” “I find this ad to be offensive”, or any other appropriate reason why the content item 120 was found to be undesirable.
- Such information may be stored in the response index 140 in association with other information descriptive of the user's 102 negative reaction.
- the Web server 106 may use the information stored in the response index 140 for selecting content 112 during future Web page requests. This may be done, e.g., to prevent offending content, or content similar to the offending content, from being presented to the user 102 .
- the word “offending” does not necessarily mean that the content is offensive, but rather only that the user has indicated some disinterest in the content.
- the user may indicate a negative reaction to an advertisement for “ABC Brand chewing gum”, and the Web server 106 can use information collected about the negative reaction to prevent the “ABC Brand chewing gum” advertisement from being presented to the user 102 again.
- the Web server 106 can use the negative reaction to “ABC Brand chewing gum” to prevent similar ads from being presented to the user 102 , such as ads for “XYZ Brand chewing gum,” or “ABC Brand candy bars.”
- the Web server 106 can use the negative reaction to “ABC Brand chewing gum” to prevent ads, such as those described above, from being provided to users who have one or more features in common with the user.
- the system may identify, e.g., based on users' profiles, social networks, or other relevant information that two users have the same interests, fit into the same demographic, have the same likes/dislikes, and so forth.
- the Web server 106 may use the negative reaction to “ABC Brand chewing gum” to prevent ads, such as those described above, from being provided to both users.
- the Web server 106 may reduced the frequency at which such ads are provided, limit the context in which such ads are provided (e.g., to times of day, in conjunction with certain types of content, etc.), and so forth.
- the information stored in the reaction index 140 may include contextual information about the user's 102 negative reaction.
- the time of day, the geographical location, the identity of the computing device 104 , the identity of the network used to transport the user input message 130 , and/or combinations of these and other appropriate contextual information may be stored in association with the user's 102 negative reaction.
- the user may be averse to seeing certain types of content items (e.g., dating Website ads, bar ads, job hunting Website ads) while at work (e.g., the computing device 104 is a work computer, the message 130 was sent from a corporate network, the reaction happened between 9 am and 5 pm).
- the user 102 may have different reactions to the same or similar content under different conditions (e.g., the user is at home or is using a personal device).
- the Web server 106 may use contextual information to determine which of the content items 114 to suppress, and when or where to suppress their delivery to the user 102 . For example, the Web server 106 may provide the content item 114 while the user 102 browses from home, and prevent the content item 114 from being provided to the user 102 at work.
- a user 150 uses a computer device 152 to request Web content 105 from the Web server 106 .
- the Web server 106 identifies the user 150 and determines if the user 150 has one or more characteristics in common with the user 102 . For example, the user 150 may share a common demographic trait, or may have explicit or implicit preferences are similar to those of the user 102 .
- the Web server 106 uses this information and information about the user's 102 negative responses to determine whether the content item 114 should be prevented from being presented to the user 150 or whether presentation of content item 114 should be changed (e.g., limited).
- the Web server 106 determines that the user 102 and the user 150 have similar characteristics, then the user's 102 negative reaction to an advertisement for “Subpar Airlines” can be used to prevent the “Subpar Airlines” ad, or ads similar to it, from being presented to the user 150 .
- FIG. 2 is an example user interface 200 that includes an example content item 210 a and an example content item 210 b that provide elements for receiving negative reactions.
- the user interface 200 is a Web page rendered by a Web browser 202 .
- the content items 210 a - 210 b are rendered as part of the user interface 200 .
- the content items 210 a - 210 b can be advertisements, but in other implementations the content items 210 a - 210 b can be any appropriate form of content (e.g., embedded media, video clips, news articles).
- the content items 210 a - 210 b include content 220 (e.g., advertising messages) and a user control 230 .
- the user control 230 is a user interface element that the user can click or otherwise interact with to express a dislike for the associated content 220 .
- the user may click the user control 230 to close or otherwise hide the content item 210 a or 210 b from view in the user interface 200 .
- the user may click the user control 230 to reload the current Web page or to redirect the user to another Web page. This action may also trigger the transmission of a user input message, such as the user input message 130 of FIG. 1 , to be sent to a Web server (e.g., the Web server 106 ) that provided the content of the user interface 200 .
- a Web server e.g., the Web server 106
- another user control in response to the user clicking the user control 230 , another user control may also be presented to the user in an attempt to collect more information from the user as to why the associated content 220 generated a negative reaction.
- such other user controls may be provided with the original content item and not in response to user input.
- FIGS. 3 a and 3 b are example user interfaces for receiving information about negative reactions.
- FIG. 3A the content item 210 a of FIG. 2 is shown. The user indicates a negative reaction to the content 220 by clicking the user control 230 . In response to this user action, the content item 210 a is replaced by a user control 300 .
- the user control 300 is a collection of user interface elements that invite the user to voluntarily provide additional information as to why the user reacted negatively to the content 220 .
- the user may click a user control 310 a to express that he or she is simply not interested in the product being advertised by the content 220 , click a user control 310 b to express that he or she has seen this or similar content 220 too many times, click a user control 310 c to express that the content 220 was found to be offensive, or click a user control 310 d to express that the content 220 was inappropriate for viewing at that particular place or time.
- Information describing the user's selection is then provided to the hosting Web server as part of a user input message, such as the user input message 130 .
- the user control 300 also includes a user control 310 e.
- the user can click the user control 310 e to indicate that he or she clicked the user control 230 in error.
- clicking the user control 230 the content item 210 a may be restored to its original appearance.
- clicking the user control 310 e may prevent transmission of the user input message 130 .
- clicking the user control 310 e may send a user input message 130 to the hosting Web server, requesting that the Web server remove (e.g., from the response index 140 ) previously submitted negative responses associated with the content 220 .
- a blank field may be incorporated into control 300 , into which the user may type comments free-form.
- FIG. 3B shows another example of how the user control 300 may be implemented.
- a dialog box 350 is presented to the user in response to activation of the user control 230 (although, as noted above, the dialog box may be provided with the original content and not in response to activation of the user control).
- the dialog box 350 includes the user control 300 and the functionality it provides as was described previously.
- the dialog box 350 is superimposed over the content item 210 a or over the user interface 200 of FIG. 2 .
- the dialog box 350 may partly or entirely obscure the user's view of the content 210 a .
- the dialog box 350 may provide visual cues that indicate to which content item the dialog box 350 is associated.
- the dialog box 350 may appear as a cartoon bubble emanating from the content item 210 a .
- the dialog box 350 may be presented in an animation in which the dialog box 350 appear to “fly out” from the content item 210 a in response to activation of the user control 230 .
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example network environment 400 that may be used in the processes described herein for affecting display of content (e.g., advertisements) based on negative reactions to presented content.
- content e.g., advertisements

- data representing the resource 405 can be provided to the user device 406 a for presentation by the user device 406 a .
- User devices 406 can also submit search queries 416 to the search system 412 over the network 402 .
- a request for a resource 405 or a search query 416 sent from a user device 406 can include an identifier, such as a cookie, identifying the user of the user device.
- the search system 412 can access a search index 430 to identify resources 405 in a collection of indexed resources 432 that are relevant to the search query 416 .
- the search system 412 identifies resources 405 in the form of search results 418 and returns the search results 418 to a user device 406 in search results pages.
- a search result 418 may include data generated by search system 412 that identifies a resource 405 that is responsive to a particular search query 416 , and that includes a link to the resource 405 .
- An example search result 418 can include a Web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the Web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the Web page.
- the search index may store, index, and make accessible information about users including, for example, their profiles, social networks (as represented by social graphs) and so forth.
- Content management system 410 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- Content management system 410 also can update a database 424 based on activity of a user.
- the database may be separate, as shown, or part of the search index.
- the database 424 can store a profile for the user which includes, for example, information about past user activities, such as visits to a place or event, past requests for resources 405 , past search queries 416 , other requests for content, social network profiles and connections, Web sites visited, or interactions with content.

- the request for content can include characteristics of one or more “slots” that are defined for the requested resource 405 or search results page.
- the data representing the resource 405 can include data specifying a portion of the resource 405 or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or Web page, in which content can be presented.
- An example slot is an ad slot.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- Information about slots can be provided to content management system 410 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or a search query 416 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 410 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 416 .
- the content management system identifies content, such as advertising, that is associated with keywords that match, or are substantially similar to, the input keywords (e.g., are a variant of the keywords, such as “car” or “cars”). When a match is detected, content management system 410 outputs the corresponding content.
- the processes described herein may be used to serve customized ads based, e.g., on input keywords or other search query content.
- content management system 410 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (referred to as “eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can be eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are associated with user-provided keywords (e.g., terms in the input search query).
- the universe of eligible content items can be narrowed by taking into account other factors, such as the content of previous search queries 416 .
- content items corresponding to historical search activities of the user including, e.g., search keywords used, particular content interacted with, sites visited by the user, etc. may also be used in the selection of eligible content items by the content management system 410 .
- Content management system 410 can select the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource 405 or search results page 418 based, at least in part, on results of an auction. For example, for eligible content items, content management system 410 can receive bids from content providers (e.g., advertisers 408 ) and allocate slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction). The bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource 405 or search results page 418 .
- content providers e.g., advertisers 408
- the bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource 405 or search results page 418 .
- a bid can specify an amount that a content provider is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as an ECPM bid.
- the bid can specify an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
- a content provider can bid for a targeted audience of users.
- one or more of the publishers 409 and/or the content management system 410 may provide one or more audiences of users, where each user in the audience matches one or more targeting criteria, such as matching one or more demographics.
- An audience of users may be represented, for example, as a user list.
- User lists or other representations of audiences may be stored, for example, in the database 424 .
- a bid from a content provider can specify, for example, an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item to a particular audience of users.
- the content management system 410 may, for example, manage the presentation of the content item to users included in a particular audience and may manage charging of the content provider for the impressions and distributing revenue to the publishers 409 based on the impressions.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing an example process 500 for affecting display of content (e.g., advertisements) based on negative reactions to presented content.
- Process 400 may be performed, e.g., by the Web server 108 either alone or in conjunction with the content management system 410 .
- a request for content to supplement a response to an input initiated by a first user is received ( 510 ).
- the user 102 may request Web content 105 from the Web server 106 .
- the Web server 106 requests and receives content 120 (e.g., advertising) from the content server 110 .
- the Web server 106 includes the content 114 in the Web content 105 that is provided in response to the user's 102 request.
- This first content 114 is output ( 520 ) in response to the request.
- the content 120 includes a control feature that is displayable along with the first content.
- the control feature enables the first user to register a negative reaction to the first content.
- the first content can be the content 220 of FIG. 2
- the control feature can be the user control 230 that the user can click to indicate that he or she dislikes the first content.
- the control feature can include an interactive control feature to close the first content or to be redirected away from the first content.
- the user 102 may click the user control 230 to close the content item 210 a or to be directed to another Web page.
- the control feature can include an interactive control feature to provide feedback about the first content.
- the user control 300 may be presented to request additional information from the user 102 .
- the user may be afforded the opportunity to provide such additional information without first clicking on the user control.
- a feature, such as feature 300 of FIG. 3 may be incorporated into the initial content 120 (or 220 ) provided in response to the original request.
- Information relating to the first content is obtained ( 530 ) from the user based on the negative reaction.
- the Web server 106 may obtain the user input message 130 , which was sent in response to the user's 102 negative reaction to the content 114 through interaction with the provided content (e.g., through closing the content, commenting on the content, and so forth).
- obtaining ( 530 ) information relating to the first content can be performed by identifying other negative reactions ( 532 ), determining if other negative reactions correspond to a context ( 534 ), and determining characteristics of other users' negative reactions ( 536 ).
- the information relating to the first content can be used in determining whether to provide the second content to the one or more second users in a context, where the context is related to at least one of an aspect of the response to the input and a time at which the first content is to be provided. For example, a first user may generally not consider his weekend entertainment options on a Monday and reject an advertisement for a movie, but he may not reject movie advertisements on a Friday (e.g., he may be willing to think about going to a movie that night).
- the advertisements share a common context of “movies” or “entertainment”, but the determination of whether to show similar advertisements to other users may be based in part on the day of the week as determined from the first user's responses.
- the information can be obtained based also on negative reactions to the first content by other users.
- the information indicates whether the first content elicits a negative reaction in general, elicits a negative reaction in a particular topical or temporal context, or elicits a negative reaction by users having one or more characteristics in common.
- a particular advertisement may elicit negative reactions from a wide population of users, and based on this information a determination may be made to prevent the ad from being presented to other users.
- a particular advertisement may elicit negative reactions when the ad is provided in a particular type of Web page (e.g., a steakhouse ad in a vegetarian Website) and, based on this information, a determination may be made to prevent the ad from being presented to other users who are browsing similar contextual content.
- a particular advertisement may elicit negative reactions when the ad is provided during a particular time of day, week, season, or year (e.g., dating Website ads on a Monday, swimwear ads in winter, breakfast ads at night, Independence Day ads on July 5) and, based on this information, a determination may be made to prevent the ad from being presented to other users during similar periods of time.
- a particular advertisement may elicit negative reactions from users who have one or more characteristics in common (e.g., the users share a demographic trait, or an explicitly or implicitly determined aversion to a particular topic) and, based on this information, a determination may be made to prevent ad rejected by the first user from being presented to other users who share similar characteristics.
- users' profiles and/or social graphs may be searched to determine whether two users have appropriate features in common.
- second content (e.g., a second advertisement) having one or more characteristics in common with the first content is identified ( 540 ).
- the user 102 may have indicated a negative response to an advertisement for “Acme Brand Automobiles”.
- the Web server 106 my identify advertisements for “XYZ Brand Automobiles” (e.g., both ads are for automobiles) and/or “Acme Brand Boats” (e.g., both ads are for Acme products) has having some features in common with the offending advertisement.
- the one or more characteristics of the second content may relate to whether the first content is part of a same distribution campaign as the second content, the first content and the second content are owned or distributed by a same entity, or the first content and the second content direct users to a domain controlled by a same entity.
- two different ads may both be part of the “Elect Major Bigspender” political campaign, and a negative reaction to one of the ads may be used as an indication that the second ad should also be suppressed for the same, or similar, user.
- the “AAA Advertising Agency” may tend to produce edgy and possibly offending advertisements.
- a user's negative reaction of one of this agencies' ads may be a good indication that the user, or similar users, may also react negatively to the agencies other ads for other products, and that those ads should not be shown to the user either.
- a user's negative reaction to an advertisement may indicate that the user, or similar user, has no interest in any ad for any product produced by an identified company.
- the one or more characteristics of the second content can relate to whether the first content and the second content have a topic in common, or the first content and the second content direct users to a same domain or to domains having similar topics. For example, an ad for “Acme Brand Automobiles” and an ad for “XYZ Brand Automobiles” may both share a topic of “automobiles”. In other example, an ad for the “SuperPen 2000” and an ad for the “Pencil-o-Matic” may both direct users to subdomains of the “writinginstrumentcompany.com” Internet domain, or to two different domains that have been determined (e.g., crawled) as both pertaining to writing instrument products.
- the one or more characteristics of the second content can relate to a relationship of a brand associated with the first content to a brand associated with the second content. For example, an ad for “Acme Brand Automobiles” and an ad for “Acme Brand Boats” may be related to each other through the common “Acme” branding of both advertised products.
- One or more others users having one or more characteristics in common with the first user are identified ( 550 ). For example another user may share a common demographic with the user 102 , or may have had negative reactions that resemble those of the user 102 in the past. In examples such as these and others, the other user may be identified as having one or more characteristics in common with the user 102 .
- identifying ( 550 ) one or more second users having one or more characteristics in common with the first user can include identifying elements of a profile for the first user that match elements of one or more profiles for the one or more second users.
- the profile elements may relate, e.g., to demographics associated with the first user and the one or more second users.
- the user 102 may be known (e.g., from explicitly provided information) to be a man, age 20, who has expressed a negative reaction to an advertisement for the upcoming movie “Cyber Alien Laser War 3”, and his reaction may prevent the ad from being presented to other users who are identified as men, ages 18-30.
- the information relating to the first content is used ( 560 ) in determining whether to provide the second content to the one or more second users. For example, if the user 102 has indicated a negative response to an advertisement for “Acme Brand Motors”, then the “XYZ Brand Automobiles” advertisement may be prevented from being presented to the other user(s).
- the information relating to the first content may be used in determining whether to provide the first content or the second content to the same user in the future. For example, if the user 102 has indicated a negative response to an advertisement for “Acme Brand Motors”, then that response may be used to prevent the “Acme Brand Motors” and/or the “XYZ Brand Automobiles” may be prevented from being presented to the user 102 or the other user in the future.
- the information relating to the first content may be used to limit providing the first content and/or the second content to the first user in the future. For example, a negative reaction by the user 102 to a particular ad may cause the Web server 106 to show that ad to the user 102 less often.
- the second content may be provided in a less favorable position in an auction for providing content to the one or more second users.
- the price of the second content may be increased relative to other content to be provided to the one or more second users.
- an offending advertisement may impose a relatively greater burden upon a Web content provider (e.g., the provider runs a relatively greater risk of driving readers away by presenting them with ads to which they may react adversely). The advertisers behind the offending ads may therefore be asked to pay a relatively higher price, compared to less offending ads, to compensate the Web providers for presenting such ads.

Abstract
Description
- This disclosure relates generally to affecting display of content, such as advertising, by taking into account negative reactions of users.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video, audio, and Web pages are accessible over the Internet. These resources present opportunities for other content (e.g., advertising or non-advertising content, such as audio, video, or the like) to be provided with the resources. For example, a Web page can include slots in which content can be presented. Similarly, such slots can be part of television programming.
- Slots can be allocated to content providers (e.g., advertisers). In some systems, a network can be used to allocate content to the slots based, e.g., on various factors relating to the content and the context in which it is to be presented. For example, the content can be allocated based, in part, on keywords input to a system, such as a search engine. An auction can be performed for the right to present advertising in a slot. In the auction, content sponsors provide bids specifying amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of their content. Typically, the winning bidder is given the right to present content.
- Some content providers, such as advertisers, pay based on a positive interaction with content, e.g., based on a cost-per-click (CPC) or a cost-per-conversion (CVR) basis. A click, in this context, refers to a user selecting content. A conversion, in this context, refers to an action taken, such as purchasing a product advertised in an ad.
- Described herein are example techniques for affecting display of content, which may include receiving a request for content to supplement a response to an input initiated by a first user; outputting first content in response to the request, where the first content includes a control feature that is displayable along with the first content, and where the control feature enables the first user to register a negative reaction to the first content; obtaining information relating to the first content based on the negative reaction; identifying second content having one or more characteristics in common with the first content; identifying one or more second users having one or more characteristics in common with the first user; and using the information relating to the first content in determining whether to provide the second content to the one or more second users. The example techniques may include one or more of the following features, either alone or in combination.
- The information relating to the first content may be used t in determining whether to provide the first content or the second content to the first user in the future. The information may be used to prevent providing the first content or the second content in the future, and/or the information may be used to limit providing the first content or the second content in the future.
- The control feature may include an interactive control feature to close the first content or to be redirected away from the first content, and/or may include an interactive control feature to provide feedback about the first content.
- The one or more characteristics of the second content may relate to whether: (1) the first content is part of a same distribution campaign as the second content, (2) the first content and the second content are owned or distributed by a same entity, or (3) the first content and the second content direct users to a domain controlled by a same entity. The one or more characteristics of the second content may relate to whether: (1) the first content and the second content have a topic in common, or (2) the first content and the second content direct users to a same domain or to domains having similar topics. The one or more characteristics of the second content may relate to a relationship of a brand associated with the first content to a brand associated with the second content.
- Identifying one or more second users having one or more characteristics in common with the first user may include identifying elements of a profile for the first user that match elements of one or more profiles for the one or more second users, where the elements relate to demographics associated with the first user and the one or more second users.
- It may be determined not to provide the second content to the one or more second users based on the information. It may be determined to provide the second content a less favorable position in an auction for providing content to the one or more second users. It may be determined to increase the price of the second content relative to other content to be provided to the one or more second users.
- The information relating to the first content may be used in determining whether to provide the second content to the one or more second users in a context, where the context relates to at least one of an aspect of the response to the input and a time at which the first content is to be provided.
- The information may be obtained based also on negative reactions to the first content by other users. The information may indicate whether the first content elicits a negative reaction in general, elicits a negative reaction in a particular topical or temporal context, or elicits a negative reaction by users having one or more characteristics in common.
- The systems and techniques described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented as a computer program product that includes instructions that are stored on one or more machine-readable storage media, and that are executable on one or more processing devices. The systems and techniques described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented as an apparatus, method, or electronic system that may include one or more processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to implement the stated functions.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

FIG. 6 shows examples of computing devices on which the processes described herein, or portions thereof, may be implemented. - Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Described herein are techniques for affecting display of content (e.g., advertisements, audio, video, Web pages, or the like) based on negative reactions to presented content. In an example implementation, content items presented to users include user interface elements that users can interact with to indicate a negative reaction to the content. For example, a user may find a particular advertisement or the product it advertises to be overly repetitive (e.g., the user has seen the ad too many times), irrelevant (e.g., the advertisement has no relation to the context of the page in which it was presented), uninteresting, offensive, etc. The user may indicate such a negative reaction by interacting with the user interface element. In response, the offending content item may be removed from view, and the user's reaction may be used to reduce the likelihood of this or other similar and potentially offensive content from being presented to the user in the future.
- The suppression of content, such as that described above, can improve the individual user's experience by reducing the amount of annoying or offensive content that he or she is exposed to. Such suppression of content can also improve the experience of content publishers whose content can include potentially offending or annoying advertisements (e.g., users are less likely to be driven away by offending ads). The suppression of content may also increase the revenues provided to content publishers through advertising (e.g., by not wasting advertising space on offending content in favor of content that may be more likely to generate click-through revenue). Such suppression can also improve the efficiency of advertising campaigns, since users who react negatively to identified advertisements may be less likely to see them again, thereby possibly reducing the occurrence of paid ad impressions being presented to disinterested users.
- In a general example, a user may browse a Web page that includes advertising content provided by a content server. One of the ads may advertise a steakhouse, but the user may be a vegetarian. In such an example, the user is likely to be at least uninterested in the ad, if not being outright offended by it. The ad includes a user control that the user can click to close or otherwise remove the ad. This user action sends feedback to the content server to indicate that the user has reacted negatively to the ad. In some examples, the content server may use this information to prevent the steakhouse ad from being presented to the user again. In some examples, the content server may use this information to prevent similar ads from being shown to the user (e.g., ads for hamburgers). In some examples, the content server may use this information to prevent the ad from being presented to other users (e.g., other users how have identified themselves as being vegetarians).

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example system 100 for distributing content to users over a network. Auser 102 uses acomputer device 104 to browse Web content 105 (e.g., Web pages, streaming video, streaming audio) provided by a Web server 106. - The Web server 106 sends a
request 108 to acontent server 110 that hosts a collection of content 112 (e.g., advertisements). Therequest 108 is a request for acontent item 114 that is hosted by thecontent server 110. Thecontent server 110 responds by sending one ormore content items 114 to the Web server 106 for inclusion in theWeb page 105 that is provided to thecomputer device 104 for presentation to theuser 102 in response to an initial browser input. - In its provided form, the
Web page 105 includes acontent item 120 that includes both content information (e.g., thecontent item 114, e.g., the advertising message) and one or more user controls. In its presented form, theuser 102 can click or otherwise select the user controls in thecontent item 120 to indicate a negative reaction to the content information in thecontent item 120. Embodiments of content items with user controls, such as thecontent item 120, are discussed below in the descriptions ofFIGS. 2, 3A, and 3B . - The user's 102 negative reaction and interaction with the user controls causes a
user input message 130 to be sent to the Web server 106. Theuser input message 130 is processed by the Web server 106 to receive, and interpret, the user's 102 negative response. The Web server 106 stores information about theuser input message 130 in a response index 140 (e.g., in a database). For example, with appropriate permission from the user, the Web server 106 may store a record of the user's 102 negative response, the user's 102 identity or an anonymous identifier, the identity of thecontent item 120, the identity of thecontent item 114, and/or combinations of these and other appropriate information that may describe the user's reaction to thecontent item 120. - In some implementations, the
user input message 130 may include additional information that describes the user's 102 negative reaction and/or the context in which the reaction occurred. For example, the response controls may provide user controls with which theuser 102 can interact to express the reason for his or her negative reaction. For example, the response controls may provide a way for theuser 102 to express “I have seen this ad too many times,” “I am not interested in this product, good, or service,” “I find this ad to be offensive”, or any other appropriate reason why thecontent item 120 was found to be undesirable. Such information may be stored in theresponse index 140 in association with other information descriptive of the user's 102 negative reaction. - The Web server 106 may use the information stored in the
response index 140 for selectingcontent 112 during future Web page requests. This may be done, e.g., to prevent offending content, or content similar to the offending content, from being presented to theuser 102. In this context, the word “offending” does not necessarily mean that the content is offensive, but rather only that the user has indicated some disinterest in the content. In an example, the user may indicate a negative reaction to an advertisement for “ABC Brand chewing gum”, and the Web server 106 can use information collected about the negative reaction to prevent the “ABC Brand chewing gum” advertisement from being presented to theuser 102 again. In another example, the Web server 106 can use the negative reaction to “ABC Brand chewing gum” to prevent similar ads from being presented to theuser 102, such as ads for “XYZ Brand chewing gum,” or “ABC Brand candy bars.” In another example, the Web server 106 can use the negative reaction to “ABC Brand chewing gum” to prevent ads, such as those described above, from being provided to users who have one or more features in common with the user. For example, the system may identify, e.g., based on users' profiles, social networks, or other relevant information that two users have the same interests, fit into the same demographic, have the same likes/dislikes, and so forth. In this case, the Web server 106 may use the negative reaction to “ABC Brand chewing gum” to prevent ads, such as those described above, from being provided to both users. - In other examples, rather than preventing ads from being provided to users, the Web server 106 may reduced the frequency at which such ads are provided, limit the context in which such ads are provided (e.g., to times of day, in conjunction with certain types of content, etc.), and so forth.
- By way of example, in some implementations, the information stored in the
reaction index 140 may include contextual information about the user's 102 negative reaction. For example, the time of day, the geographical location, the identity of thecomputing device 104, the identity of the network used to transport theuser input message 130, and/or combinations of these and other appropriate contextual information may be stored in association with the user's 102 negative reaction. For example, the user may be averse to seeing certain types of content items (e.g., dating Website ads, bar ads, job hunting Website ads) while at work (e.g., thecomputing device 104 is a work computer, themessage 130 was sent from a corporate network, the reaction happened between 9 am and 5 pm). Theuser 102, however, may have different reactions to the same or similar content under different conditions (e.g., the user is at home or is using a personal device). - In some implementations, the Web server 106 may use contextual information to determine which of the
content items 114 to suppress, and when or where to suppress their delivery to theuser 102. For example, the Web server 106 may provide thecontent item 114 while theuser 102 browses from home, and prevent thecontent item 114 from being provided to theuser 102 at work. - In another example, a
user 150 uses acomputer device 152 to requestWeb content 105 from the Web server 106. The Web server 106 identifies theuser 150 and determines if theuser 150 has one or more characteristics in common with theuser 102. For example, theuser 150 may share a common demographic trait, or may have explicit or implicit preferences are similar to those of theuser 102. The Web server 106 uses this information and information about the user's 102 negative responses to determine whether thecontent item 114 should be prevented from being presented to theuser 150 or whether presentation ofcontent item 114 should be changed (e.g., limited). For example, if the Web server 106 determines that theuser 102 and theuser 150 have similar characteristics, then the user's 102 negative reaction to an advertisement for “Subpar Airlines” can be used to prevent the “Subpar Airlines” ad, or ads similar to it, from being presented to theuser 150. -
FIG. 2 is anexample user interface 200 that includes anexample content item 210 a and anexample content item 210 b that provide elements for receiving negative reactions. In the illustrated example, theuser interface 200 is a Web page rendered by a Web browser 202. - In this example, the content items 210 a-210 b are rendered as part of the
user interface 200. In some implementations, the content items 210 a-210 b can be advertisements, but in other implementations the content items 210 a-210 b can be any appropriate form of content (e.g., embedded media, video clips, news articles). The content items 210 a-210 b include content 220 (e.g., advertising messages) and auser control 230. - In this example, the
user control 230 is a user interface element that the user can click or otherwise interact with to express a dislike for the associatedcontent 220. In some implementations, the user may click theuser control 230 to close or otherwise hide thecontent item user interface 200. In some implementations, the user may click theuser control 230 to reload the current Web page or to redirect the user to another Web page. This action may also trigger the transmission of a user input message, such as theuser input message 130 ofFIG. 1 , to be sent to a Web server (e.g., the Web server 106) that provided the content of theuser interface 200. - In some implementations, in response to the user clicking the
user control 230, another user control may also be presented to the user in an attempt to collect more information from the user as to why the associatedcontent 220 generated a negative reaction. In some implementations, such other user controls may be provided with the original content item and not in response to user input. - Referring now to
FIGS. 3a and 3b , two examples of such user controls are described.FIGS. 3a and 3b are example user interfaces for receiving information about negative reactions. Referring now toFIG. 3A , thecontent item 210 a ofFIG. 2 is shown. The user indicates a negative reaction to thecontent 220 by clicking theuser control 230. In response to this user action, thecontent item 210 a is replaced by auser control 300. - In this example, the
user control 300 is a collection of user interface elements that invite the user to voluntarily provide additional information as to why the user reacted negatively to thecontent 220. For example, the user may click auser control 310 a to express that he or she is simply not interested in the product being advertised by thecontent 220, click auser control 310 b to express that he or she has seen this orsimilar content 220 too many times, click auser control 310 c to express that thecontent 220 was found to be offensive, or click auser control 310 d to express that thecontent 220 was inappropriate for viewing at that particular place or time. Information describing the user's selection is then provided to the hosting Web server as part of a user input message, such as theuser input message 130. - The
user control 300 also includes auser control 310e. The user can click theuser control 310e to indicate that he or she clicked theuser control 230 in error. In some implementations, by clicking theuser control 230 thecontent item 210 a may be restored to its original appearance. In some implementations, clicking theuser control 310e may prevent transmission of theuser input message 130. In some implementations, clicking theuser control 310e may send auser input message 130 to the hosting Web server, requesting that the Web server remove (e.g., from the response index 140) previously submitted negative responses associated with thecontent 220. In some implementations, a blank field may be incorporated intocontrol 300, into which the user may type comments free-form. -
FIG. 3B shows another example of how theuser control 300 may be implemented. In this example, a dialog box 350 is presented to the user in response to activation of the user control 230 (although, as noted above, the dialog box may be provided with the original content and not in response to activation of the user control). The dialog box 350 includes theuser control 300 and the functionality it provides as was described previously. In the illustrated example, the dialog box 350 is superimposed over thecontent item 210 a or over theuser interface 200 ofFIG. 2 . In some implementations, the dialog box 350 may partly or entirely obscure the user's view of the content 210 a. In some implementations, the dialog box 350 may provide visual cues that indicate to which content item the dialog box 350 is associated. For example, the dialog box 350 may appear as a cartoon bubble emanating from thecontent item 210 a. In another example, the dialog box 350 may be presented in an animation in which the dialog box 350 appear to “fly out” from thecontent item 210 a in response to activation of theuser control 230. - The processes described herein may be implemented in any appropriate network environment, with any appropriate devices and computing equipment. An example of such an environment is described below.
-
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of anexample network environment 400 that may be used in the processes described herein for affecting display of content (e.g., advertisements) based on negative reactions to presented content. - As shown in
FIG. 4 ,network 402 connects various entities, such asWeb sites 404,user devices 406, content providers (e.g., advertisers 408),online publishers 409, television broadcasters 434, and acontent management system 410. In this regard,example environment 400 may include many thousands ofWeb sites 404,user devices 406, and content providers (e.g.,advertisers 408 or other purveyors of content). Entities connected to network 402 include and/or connect through one or more servers. Each such server may be one or more of various forms of servers, such as a Web server, an application server, a proxy server, a network server, or a server farm. Each server can include one or more processing devices, memory, and a storage system. -
Network 402 can represent a communications network that can allow devices, such as auser device 406 a, to communicate with entities on the network.Network 402 can include one or more networks. The network(s) may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) voice calls, Short Message Service (SMS), Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS), or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) messaging, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Personal Digital Cellular (PDC), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), CDMA2000, General Packet Radio System (GPRS), or one or more television or cable networks, among others. For example, the communication may occur through a radio-frequency transceiver. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a BLUETOOTH, WiFi, or other such transceiver. - In
FIG. 4 ,Web sites 404 may include one or more resources 405 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. Anexample Web site 404 a is a collection of Web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. EachWeb site 404 can be maintained by apublisher 409, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns theWeb site 404. - A resource 405 may be any appropriate data that can be provided over
network 402. A resource 405 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 405. Resources 405 can include HypterText Mark-up Language (HTML) pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name a few. Resources 405 can also include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - To enable searching of resources 405,
environment 400 can include asearch system 412, as described below, that identifies resources 405 by crawling and indexing resources 405 provided by the content publishers on theWeb sites 404. Data about the resources 405 can be indexed based on the resource 405 to which the data corresponds. Indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 405 that match input keywords can be retrieved and output. - An
example user device 406 a is an electronic device that is under control of a user and that is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 402. A user device (examples of which includecomputer devices 104 and 152 oFIG. 1 ) may include one or more processing devices, and may be, or include, a mobile telephone (e.g., a smartphone), a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a tablet computer, a network appliance, a camera, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a game console, or a combination of any two or more of these data processing devices or other data processing devices. In some implementations, the user device can be included as part of a motor vehicle (e.g., an automobile, an emergency vehicle (e.g., fire truck, ambulance), a bus). -
User device 406 a can request resources 405 from aWeb site 404 a. In turn, data representing the resource 405 can be provided to theuser device 406 a for presentation by theuser device 406 a.User devices 406 can also submitsearch queries 416 to thesearch system 412 over thenetwork 402. A request for a resource 405 or asearch query 416 sent from auser device 406 can include an identifier, such as a cookie, identifying the user of the user device. - In response to a
search query 416, thesearch system 412 can access asearch index 430 to identify resources 405 in a collection of indexedresources 432 that are relevant to thesearch query 416. As described below, thesearch system 412 identifies resources 405 in the form ofsearch results 418 and returns the search results 418 to auser device 406 in search results pages. Asearch result 418 may include data generated bysearch system 412 that identifies a resource 405 that is responsive to aparticular search query 416, and that includes a link to the resource 405. Anexample search result 418 can include a Web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the Web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the Web page. With appropriate permission, the search index may store, index, and make accessible information about users including, for example, their profiles, social networks (as represented by social graphs) and so forth. -
Content management system 410 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.Content management system 410 also can update adatabase 424 based on activity of a user. The database may be separate, as shown, or part of the search index. With appropriate user permission, thedatabase 424 can store a profile for the user which includes, for example, information about past user activities, such as visits to a place or event, past requests for resources 405, past search queries 416, other requests for content, social network profiles and connections, Web sites visited, or interactions with content. In some implementations, the information indatabase 424 can be derived, for example, from one or more of a query log, an advertisement (“ad”) log, or requests for content. Thedatabase 424 can include, for each entry, a cookie identifying the user, a timestamp, an IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with a requestinguser device 406, a type of usage, and details associated with the usage. - When a resource 405 or
search results 418 are requested by auser device 406,content management system 410 can receive a request for content to be provided with the resource 405 or search results 418. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more “slots” that are defined for the requested resource 405 or search results page. For example, the data representing the resource 405 can include data specifying a portion of the resource 405 or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or Web page, in which content can be presented. An example slot is an ad slot. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. - Information about slots can be provided to
content management system 410. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 410. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 416 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 410 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 416. For example, the content management system identifies content, such as advertising, that is associated with keywords that match, or are substantially similar to, the input keywords (e.g., are a variant of the keywords, such as “car” or “cars”). When a match is detected,content management system 410 outputs the corresponding content. The processes described herein may be used to serve customized ads based, e.g., on input keywords or other search query content. - Based at least in part on data included in a request,
content management system 410 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (referred to as “eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can be eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are associated with user-provided keywords (e.g., terms in the input search query). The universe of eligible content items (e.g., ads) can be narrowed by taking into account other factors, such as the content of previous search queries 416. For example, content items corresponding to historical search activities of the user including, e.g., search keywords used, particular content interacted with, sites visited by the user, etc. may also be used in the selection of eligible content items by thecontent management system 410. -
Content management system 410 can select the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource 405 orsearch results page 418 based, at least in part, on results of an auction. For example, for eligible content items,content management system 410 can receive bids from content providers (e.g., advertisers 408) and allocate slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction). The bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource 405 orsearch results page 418. For example, a bid can specify an amount that a content provider is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as an ECPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. The selected content item can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors. - In some implementations, a content provider can bid for a targeted audience of users. For example, one or more of the
publishers 409 and/or thecontent management system 410 may provide one or more audiences of users, where each user in the audience matches one or more targeting criteria, such as matching one or more demographics. An audience of users may be represented, for example, as a user list. User lists or other representations of audiences may be stored, for example, in thedatabase 424. A bid from a content provider can specify, for example, an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item to a particular audience of users. Thecontent management system 410 may, for example, manage the presentation of the content item to users included in a particular audience and may manage charging of the content provider for the impressions and distributing revenue to thepublishers 409 based on the impressions. -
FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing anexample process 500 for affecting display of content (e.g., advertisements) based on negative reactions to presented content.Process 400 may be performed, e.g., by theWeb server 108 either alone or in conjunction with thecontent management system 410. - In the
process 500, a request for content to supplement a response to an input initiated by a first user is received (510). For example, theuser 102 may requestWeb content 105 from the Web server 106. The Web server 106 requests and receives content 120 (e.g., advertising) from thecontent server 110. The Web server 106 includes thecontent 114 in theWeb content 105 that is provided in response to the user's 102 request. - This
first content 114 is output (520) in response to the request. In this example, thecontent 120 includes a control feature that is displayable along with the first content. The control feature enables the first user to register a negative reaction to the first content. For example the first content can be thecontent 220 ofFIG. 2 , and the control feature can be theuser control 230 that the user can click to indicate that he or she dislikes the first content. - In some implementations, the control feature can include an interactive control feature to close the first content or to be redirected away from the first content. For example, the
user 102 may click theuser control 230 to close thecontent item 210 a or to be directed to another Web page. In some implementations, the control feature can include an interactive control feature to provide feedback about the first content. For example, in response to theuser 102 clicking theuser control 230, theuser control 300 may be presented to request additional information from theuser 102. In some cases, the user may be afforded the opportunity to provide such additional information without first clicking on the user control. For example, a feature, such asfeature 300 ofFIG. 3 may be incorporated into the initial content 120 (or 220) provided in response to the original request. - Information relating to the first content is obtained (530) from the user based on the negative reaction. For example, the Web server 106 may obtain the
user input message 130, which was sent in response to the user's 102 negative reaction to thecontent 114 through interaction with the provided content (e.g., through closing the content, commenting on the content, and so forth). - In some implementations, obtaining (530) information relating to the first content can be performed by identifying other negative reactions (532), determining if other negative reactions correspond to a context (534), and determining characteristics of other users' negative reactions (536). The information relating to the first content can be used in determining whether to provide the second content to the one or more second users in a context, where the context is related to at least one of an aspect of the response to the input and a time at which the first content is to be provided. For example, a first user may generally not consider his weekend entertainment options on a Monday and reject an advertisement for a movie, but he may not reject movie advertisements on a Friday (e.g., he may be willing to think about going to a movie that night). In this example, the advertisements share a common context of “movies” or “entertainment”, but the determination of whether to show similar advertisements to other users may be based in part on the day of the week as determined from the first user's responses.
- In some implementations, the information can be obtained based also on negative reactions to the first content by other users. Here, the information indicates whether the first content elicits a negative reaction in general, elicits a negative reaction in a particular topical or temporal context, or elicits a negative reaction by users having one or more characteristics in common. For example, a particular advertisement may elicit negative reactions from a wide population of users, and based on this information a determination may be made to prevent the ad from being presented to other users. In another example, a particular advertisement may elicit negative reactions when the ad is provided in a particular type of Web page (e.g., a steakhouse ad in a vegetarian Website) and, based on this information, a determination may be made to prevent the ad from being presented to other users who are browsing similar contextual content. In another example, a particular advertisement may elicit negative reactions when the ad is provided during a particular time of day, week, season, or year (e.g., dating Website ads on a Monday, swimwear ads in winter, breakfast ads at night, Independence Day ads on July 5) and, based on this information, a determination may be made to prevent the ad from being presented to other users during similar periods of time. In yet another example, a particular advertisement may elicit negative reactions from users who have one or more characteristics in common (e.g., the users share a demographic trait, or an explicitly or implicitly determined aversion to a particular topic) and, based on this information, a determination may be made to prevent ad rejected by the first user from being presented to other users who share similar characteristics. With appropriate permission, users' profiles and/or social graphs may be searched to determine whether two users have appropriate features in common.
- In this example, second content (e.g., a second advertisement) having one or more characteristics in common with the first content is identified (540). For example, the
user 102 may have indicated a negative response to an advertisement for “Acme Brand Automobiles”. In response, the Web server 106 my identify advertisements for “XYZ Brand Automobiles” (e.g., both ads are for automobiles) and/or “Acme Brand Boats” (e.g., both ads are for Acme products) has having some features in common with the offending advertisement. - In some implementations, the one or more characteristics of the second content may relate to whether the first content is part of a same distribution campaign as the second content, the first content and the second content are owned or distributed by a same entity, or the first content and the second content direct users to a domain controlled by a same entity. For example, two different ads may both be part of the “Elect Major Bigspender” political campaign, and a negative reaction to one of the ads may be used as an indication that the second ad should also be suppressed for the same, or similar, user. In another example, the “AAA Advertising Agency” may tend to produce edgy and possibly offending advertisements. A user's negative reaction of one of this agencies' ads may be a good indication that the user, or similar users, may also react negatively to the agencies other ads for other products, and that those ads should not be shown to the user either. In yet another example, a user's negative reaction to an advertisement may indicate that the user, or similar user, has no interest in any ad for any product produced by an identified company.
- In some implementations, the one or more characteristics of the second content can relate to whether the first content and the second content have a topic in common, or the first content and the second content direct users to a same domain or to domains having similar topics. For example, an ad for “Acme Brand Automobiles” and an ad for “XYZ Brand Automobiles” may both share a topic of “automobiles”. In other example, an ad for the “SuperPen 2000” and an ad for the “Pencil-o-Matic” may both direct users to subdomains of the “writinginstrumentcompany.com” Internet domain, or to two different domains that have been determined (e.g., crawled) as both pertaining to writing instrument products.
- In some implementations, the one or more characteristics of the second content can relate to a relationship of a brand associated with the first content to a brand associated with the second content. For example, an ad for “Acme Brand Automobiles” and an ad for “Acme Brand Boats” may be related to each other through the common “Acme” branding of both advertised products.
- One or more others users having one or more characteristics in common with the first user are identified (550). For example another user may share a common demographic with the
user 102, or may have had negative reactions that resemble those of theuser 102 in the past. In examples such as these and others, the other user may be identified as having one or more characteristics in common with theuser 102. - In some implementations, identifying (550) one or more second users having one or more characteristics in common with the first user can include identifying elements of a profile for the first user that match elements of one or more profiles for the one or more second users. The profile elements may relate, e.g., to demographics associated with the first user and the one or more second users. For example, the
user 102 may be known (e.g., from explicitly provided information) to be a man, age 20, who has expressed a negative reaction to an advertisement for the upcoming movie “Cyber Alien Laser War 3”, and his reaction may prevent the ad from being presented to other users who are identified as men, ages 18-30. - The information relating to the first content is used (560) in determining whether to provide the second content to the one or more second users. For example, if the
user 102 has indicated a negative response to an advertisement for “Acme Brand Motors”, then the “XYZ Brand Automobiles” advertisement may be prevented from being presented to the other user(s). - In some implementations, the information relating to the first content may be used in determining whether to provide the first content or the second content to the same user in the future. For example, if the
user 102 has indicated a negative response to an advertisement for “Acme Brand Motors”, then that response may be used to prevent the “Acme Brand Motors” and/or the “XYZ Brand Automobiles” may be prevented from being presented to theuser 102 or the other user in the future. - In some implementations, the information relating to the first content may be used to limit providing the first content and/or the second content to the first user in the future. For example, a negative reaction by the
user 102 to a particular ad may cause the Web server 106 to show that ad to theuser 102 less often. - In some implementations, the second content may be provided in a less favorable position in an auction for providing content to the one or more second users. For example, the price of the second content may be increased relative to other content to be provided to the one or more second users. For example, an offending advertisement may impose a relatively greater burden upon a Web content provider (e.g., the provider runs a relatively greater risk of driving readers away by presenting them with ads to which they may react adversely). The advertisers behind the offending ads may therefore be asked to pay a relatively higher price, compared to less offending ads, to compensate the Web providers for presenting such ads.

Thememory 664 can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units.Expansion memory 674 may also be provided and connected todevice 650 throughexpansion interface 672, which may include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface.Such expansion memory 674 may provide extra storage space fordevice 650, or may also store applications or other information fordevice 650. Specifically,expansion memory 674 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example,expansion memory 674 may be provide as a security module fordevice 650, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use ofdevice 650. In addition, secure applications may be provided by the SIMM cards, along with additional information, for example, placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, examples of which include those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, for example, the
memory 664,expansion memory 674, memory onprocessor 652, or a propagated signal that may be received, for example, overtransceiver 668 orexternal interface 662. -
Device 650 may communicate wirelessly throughcommunication interface 666, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary.Communication interface 666 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, examples of which include GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 668. In addition, short-range communication may occur, for example, using a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, GPS (Global Positioning System)receiver module 670 may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data todevice 650, which may be used as appropriate by applications running ondevice 650. -
Device 650 may also communicate audibly usingaudio codec 660, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information.Audio codec 660 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, for example, through a speaker, e.g., in a handset ofdevice 650. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating ondevice 650. - The
computing device 650 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as acellular telephone 680. It may also be implemented as part of asmartphone 682, personal digital assistant, or other similar mobile device. - Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language.
