Definitions
- the present disclosure is related to search engine processing logic and, more particularly, to providing a predicted representation of a search result through the use of search engine processing logic.
- Search engines are often used to locate content through search queries. After receiving a search query, the search engine uses certain processing logic to locate relevant content, such as files and web pages and returns a list of search results. Typically, the list of search results are formatted portions of the content that was previously processed and indexed by the search engine using additional processing logic.
- the search engine recognizes the changes and re-processes and re-indexes the content. Therefore, when third-party developers make changes to content, they are unable to determine how a search result of the changed content will be presented until the search engine notices the changes and re-indexes the content. Review of any subsequent changes must then be delayed until the search engine identifies those subsequent changes and re-indexes the site.
- the related art attempts to provide a reduced delay by arranging certain portions of content to approximate a search result.
- the related art systems do not have access to the processing logic of a search engine and, therefore, the approximation may be unreliable and cannot update automatically to reflect alterations in the search engine processing logic.
- aspects of the present disclosure generally relate to a method of generating predicted search results.
- a method including: receiving, from a user device, an identification of content; receiving, by a computing device, the identified content; accessing search engine processing logic; processing the received content using the subset of search engine processing logic, without indexing the received content to be accessed for responding to search queries from the search engine; generating a representation of a predicted search result of the received content based on the processing; and transmitting, to the user device, the representation of the predicted search result.
- the method may further include outputting a tool for identifying content.
- the identification of the content may be received by way of the tool.
- the method may further include: receiving, from the user device, a request to index the content based on the predicted search result; and indexing, in response to the request, the content to be accessed for responding to search queries.
- the receiving the identification of the content may include receiving, from the user device, the identification of the content without initializing a request for the identification.
- the processing may include: creating an isolated environment separated from a production environment of the search engine; and processing the content in the isolated environment.
- the transmitting the representation of the predicted search result may include transmitting the representation of the predicted search result embedded in a mock search query response web page mimicking a query result of the search engine.
- the generating may include generating a plurality of predicted search results corresponding to respective query environments.
- a first predicted search result of the plurality of predicted search results may correspond to a mobile query environment, and a second predicted search result of the plurality of predicted search results may correspond to a non-mobile query environment.
- a system including: a processor; and a memory having stored thereon instructions that, when executed by the processor, control the processor to: receive, from a user device, an identification of content; receive the identified content; access search engine processing logic; process the received content using the subset of search engine processing logic, without indexing the received content to be accessed for responding to search queries from the search engine; generate a representation of a predicted search result of the received content based on the processing; and transmit, to the user device, the representation of the predicted search result.
- the instructions when executed by the processor, may control the processor to receive the identification of the content without initializing a request for the identification.
- the instructions when executed by the processor, may further control the processor to: receive, from the user device, a request to index the content based on the predicted search result; and, in response to the request, index the content to be accessed for responding to search queries.
- the instructions when executed by the processor, may control the processor to process the content by: creating an isolated environment separated from a production environment of the search engine; and processing the content in the isolated environment.
- the instructions when executed by the processor, may further control the processor to: embed the predicted search result in a mock search query response web page mimicking a query result of the search engine; and transmit the mock search query response web page to the user device.
- the instructions when executed by the processor, may further control the processor to generate a plurality of predicted search results corresponding to respective query environments.
- a method including: accessing, by a computing device, a preview tool for previewing search results of a search engine; submitting, by the computing device, a location of content to be processed and indexed using the preview tool; transmitting, by the computing device, the location of the content to a search engine server; receiving, by the computing device, a representation of a predicted search result of the content, the content being processed and indexed as if the content was identified by the search engine without the content being placed in production data of the search engine for responding to search queries; and displaying, by the computing device, the representation of the predicted search result.
- the computing device may initialize the submission of the location of the content.
- the method may further include submitting, by the computing device using the preview tool, a request to index the content based on the displayed representation of the predicted search result, the content being placed in production data of the search engine for responding to search in response to the request.
- the receiving may include receiving a mock search query response web page mimicking a query result of the search engine, the predicted search result being embedded in the mock search query response web page.
- the receiving may include receiving a plurality of predicted search results corresponding to respective query environments.

- FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an illustrative computer system architecture according to an example implementation.
- a search engine provides access to its processing and indexing logic in order to provide a predicted search result of identified content.
- the search engine may provide access to this logic through a software tool, such as a web portal.
- a third-party is able to identify or submit content through the software tool.
- the search engine will process the content as if it was preparing the content for future return of search queries, and provide a predicted search result of the content.
- the search engine will not place the content identified through the software tool in its production data. Thus, a reliable predicted result may be prepared without compromising the integrity of future search results.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a connected system in which one or more examples of the disclosed technology may be implemented. It will be understood that the networked system 100 is provided for example purposes only, and does not limit the scope of the various implementations of the present disclosed systems and methods.
- the networked system 100 may include a user device 110 and a search engine server 120 .
- the user device 110 may be a computing device and may include a personal computer (PC), a mobile computer, a laptop, a desktop, or a Smartphone.
- the search engine server 120 may be a computing device, and may include one or more distinct server machines. An example of a computer architecture that may be used to implement one or more of the user device 110 and the search engine server 120 will be discussed below with reference to FIG. 10 .
- the user device 110 accesses a tool provided by the search engine.
- the tool may be provided through a web portal or a standalone application.
- the user device 110 may identify content or a location of the content.
- the content may be identified by a URL or by a file location, and the content may be a web page, a code snippet, or an application.
- the search engine server 120 may receive the identification of the content from the user device 110 , and may retrieve the content. For example, if the content is identified by a URL, the search engine server 120 may retrieve the content from the URL. As another example, if the content is a file located on the user device 110 , and the user device 110 may transmit the file to the search engine server 120 .
- the search engine server 120 processes and indexes the retrieved content using a subset of its processing logic to produce a predicted search result without placing the processed content in its production data.
- the search engine server 120 may access the same processing logic as that used for preparing and generating search results, but may prevent the processed content from being indexed for future search results.
- the search engine server 120 may isolate the processing of the retrieved content from production data of the search engine server 120 . Thus, a predicted search result may be generated without the content being available for search results.
- the search engine server 120 may reference a code library containing code used to process and index content for future searches. However, the search engine server 120 may not reference the code used for placing the content into production.
- the search engine server 120 may transmit the predicted search result to the user device 110 .
- the user device 110 may display the predicted search result.
- the user device 110 may display an interface for requesting the content to be indexed by the search engine. For example, if the content is identified by a URL, a user of the user device 110 may request that the search engine immediately index the URL.
- the search engine server 120 may receive the request to index the content and proceed with indexing the URL. The request may serve as an approval of the predicted search result, and may bypass the content identifying and crawling logic 210 of the search engine server 120 .
- FIG. 2 provides a block diagram illustrating search engine processing logic according to an example embodiment.
- the search engine server 120 may access processing logic 200 , including content identifying and crawling logic 210 , content processing logic 220 , content indexing logic 230 , and content search and retrieval logic 240 .
- the crawling logic 210 may be used to identify and parse new and changed content.
- the processing logic 220 and the indexing logic 230 may be used to analyze the new and changed content, for example, to produce a reference for future searches and analysis for generating a search result.
- information from content that is processed and indexed is placed into a set of production data for analysis and retrieval in response to search queries.
- the content search and retrieval logic 240 can be used to retrieve and rank content in response to a search request.
- the search engine server 120 may access a subset of the processing logic 200 to generate a predicted search result of identified content. For example, the processing and indexing may be initiated by a user device 110 , and so the search engine sever 120 will not access the content identifying and crawling logic 210 . Similarly, since the identified content is not to be placed in production data at this point, the search engine server 120 may not access all of the indexing logic 230 or the content search and retrieval logic 240 .
- the search engine server 120 may execute the subset of the processing logic 200 in an isolated environment such that the processed content does not impact production data of the search engine.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of a method according to an example embodiment.
- the method may be performed by one or more computing devices, such as the search engine server 120 .
- a computing device outputs 300 a tool for identifying content, for example, to the user device 110 .
- the tool may be embedded in a web page or as part of an application.
- the tool may be configured to receive one or more of a URL, program code, and a file of various file types.
- the computing device receives 310 an identification of the content, and receives 320 the content.
- the computing device may retrieve the content by requesting the content using the URL, or may be provided the content from the user device 110 .
- the computing device accesses 330 a subset of search engine processing logic 200 .
- the subset of search engine processing logic 200 may exclude content identification and crawling logic 210 , some of indexing logic 230 , and the content search and retrieval logic 240 .
- the computing device processes 340 the content using the subset of the processing logic 200 to create one or more predicted search results.
- the processing 340 may be done without placing the content into production data of the search engine. Thus, the content will not be returned as a search result by the search engine.
- the computing device then transmits 350 the predicted search results to the user device 110 .
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of the processing 340 of FIG. 3 according to an example embodiment.
- the processing 340 may include the computing device creating 400 a sandbox environment.
- the sandbox environment may isolate execution of processing logic 200 from the production environment, production data, and indexes of the search engine.
- the computing device may then process and index 410 the content in the sandbox environment, and render 420 the predicted search result.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a method according to an example embodiment. The method may be performed by one or more computing devices, such as the user device 110 .
- a computing device receives 500 a tool for identifying content, for example, from a search engine server 120 .
- the computing device transmits 510 an identification of the content to the search engine server 120 using the tool.
- the search engine server 120 then processes the content using a same search engine processing logic 200 , but does not place the content in a production environment for processing future search queries.
- the search engine server 120 generates a predicted search result from the processing.
- the computing device receives 520 the predicted search result generated by the search engine processing logic 200 , and displays 530 the predicted search result.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a search result preview tool according to an example embodiment.
- the search result preview tool may be accessed via a web page, and the predicted search results may be presented using a web page.
- the search result preview tool provides an input area to input an identification of content.
- the search result preview tool may provide an entry field to enter a URL corresponding to the content.
- a user device 110 may receive commands corresponding to the content identification and transmit the identification of the content to a search engine server 120 using the search result preview tool.
- the search engine server 120 may process the content using search engine logic without adding the content to production data.
- the user device 110 receives predicted search results from the search engine sever 120 through the search result preview tool, and the user device 110 may display the predicted search result.
- the search engine server 120 may generate a plurality of predicted search results corresponding to a plurality of different return types or styles. For example, the search engine server 120 may return a first predicted search result in a first style corresponding to a search result in a mobile environment and a second predicted search result in a second style corresponding to a search result in a non-mobile environment.
- the predicted search results may be included in a mock search results page approximating a search results page of the search engine.
- the user device 110 may display the mock search results page and may simultaneously display the predicted search result in a plurality of styles.
- user device 110 may simultaneously display the first predicted search result corresponding to a search result in a mobile environment and the second predicted search result corresponding to a search result in a non-mobile environment. Both the first and second predicted search result may be displayed in a mobile or non-mobile environment, for example, on the mock search results page.
