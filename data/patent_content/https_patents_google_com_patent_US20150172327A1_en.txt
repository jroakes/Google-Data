Definitions
- the subject technology relates generally to the location-aware and navigational devices.
- Location-aware smart phones and other devices have been integrated with interactive location services to provide users the ability to view their current locations, and the current locations of their friends, on interactive maps. In this manner, a user may load a map on a cell phone to view the current location(s) of the user's friends in real time.
- Location-aware devices may also be integrated with a “check-in” feature that enables a user to select, in real-time, a place of interest near the user's current geographic location to announce to other users (for example, in a social network) where the user is currently located.
- a computer-implemented method may include receiving historical travel data related to a path travelled by a user, determining one or more candidate places of interest along the travelled path based on the historical travel data, providing the one or more candidate places of interest for display to the user, receiving, from the user, one or more selected places of interest, selected from the one or more candidate places of interest, and providing, for display to other users of a social network, a representation of the user and the selected places of interest.
- Other aspects include corresponding systems, apparatuses, and computer program products for implementation of the computer-implemented method.
- a machine-readable medium may include instructions stored thereon that, when executed by a processor, cause a machine to perform a method of displaying a geographically targeted internet offering.
- the method may include receiving a plurality of geographic coordinate readings recorded over a period of time, the plurality of geographic coordinate readings related to a path travelled by a user, determining one or more candidate places of interest based on the plurality of geographic coordinate readings, providing the one or more candidate places of interest for display at a user interface, receiving, from the user interface, one or more selected places of interests, and providing, for display to users of a social network, a representation of the user and the selected places of interest.
- Other aspects include corresponding systems, apparatuses, and computer program products.
- a system may include a processor and a memory.
- the memory may include instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to receive a plurality of coordinate readings related to a path travelled by a user, determine one or more candidate places of interest along the travelled path based on the plurality of coordinate readings, provide the one or more candidate places of interest for display at a user interface, receive, from the user interface, one or more selected places of interest, and provide, for display to other users of a social network, a representation of the user and the one or more selected places of interest.

- a location-aware device for example, a GPS-enabled smart phone
- a check-in feature that enables a user to send an indication (for example, an announcement, message, or the like) to other users in a social network that user is at, or was at, a place of interest (for example, a business establishment) at or near the user's current or past geographic location.
- an indication for example, an announcement, message, or the like
- the user may not required to be at a specific location to perform a check-in. Rather, the subject technology enables the user to perform a check-in to places of interest visited in the past, and to share those places of interest with other users in the social network as if the user had checked in to the places of interest while visiting them.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example system for sharing previously visited locations in a social network according to one aspect of the subject technology.
- a location-aware device 101 for example, a GPS-enabled smartphone
- associated with a first user 102 may be configured, on consent of its user, to record and store historical travel data (for example, a series of geographic coordinates, WiFi scans, cell tower information, or the like) as user 102 imparts on a journey.
- historical travel data for example, a series of geographic coordinates, WiFi scans, cell tower information, or the like
- device 101 may be configured to send (for example, upload, transmit, or the like) the historical travel data to a data manager 103 (for example, software running on device 101 , a remote server, or the like) so that identified places of interest visited during the journey may be shared with one or more second users 104 in a social network 105 .
- a data manager 103 for example, software running on device 101 , a remote server, or the like
- device 101 includes one or more setup screens that enable the user to configure device 101 to temporarily collect historical travel data.
- data is collected for the limited purpose of providing the user the ability to review and select places of interest previously visited by the user, and to perform a “check-in” to one or more selected places of interest after-the-fact.
- Historical travel data is encrypted and then stored for windows of predetermined periods of time (for example, the last 24 hours).
- device 101 may periodically inform the user (for example, by way of a blinking icon on the device's display screen) that the device is collecting historical travel data.
- the setup screens may further enable the user to purge stored data, and/or disable further collection of travel data.
- the historical travel data may include a series of geographic coordinate readings (for example, latitude/longitude, Cartesian coordinates, GPS data, or the like) recorded over a period of time (for example, prior to the user arriving at a current location).
- data manager 103 receives the coordinate readings and determines one or more places of interest visited by the user at specific location points (for example, geographic locations or coordinates) along a travel path based on a predetermined rule.
- the predefined rule may, for example, involve clustering of the geographic coordinate readings to determine identifiable location points where the user spent time (for example, paused for a predetermined duration), determine one or more location points based on a pause in recording for a predetermined duration at a point in the travel path, or the like.
- data manager 103 may, for example, search a repository 106 for known places of interest (for example, businesses, recreation centers, or the like) proximate to the one or more location points (for example, within a predetermined distance).
- repository 106 may include a check-in service integrated with social network 105 (for example, provided by a third party). In this manner, data manager 103 may determine a location point and query the check-in service using the location point to retrieve candidate places of interest as if user 101 was checking in at a current location.
- Candidate places of interest may be further limited by ranking places of interest known to be within a vicinity (for example, a radius) of a location point. In this manner, a higher ranking may be assigned to previously visited places of interest or places of interest similar to those previously visited. For example, if a user typically frequents bars, and a place of interest near a location point may be either a bar or a nearby acupuncture center, the system may determine that the candidate place of interest is more likely to be the bar.
- the number of possible candidate places of interest may be further limited by sweeping a radius around a determined geographic location. Additionally or in the alternative, one or more candidate places of interest may be selected based on a categorization.
- a bar may include a “night” categorization and a hospital may include a “day” categorization. If a geographic location determined from the received coordinates is proximate to both, and the location was visited at night, the bar may be selected as the candidate place of interest.
- Places of interest may include places of interest that other people in the user's social graph have visited, a history of places of interest shared by other users, a predetermined global prominence score given to places of interest along the travel path, past web searches or web pages viewed by the user that are related to places of interest, and the like. Places of interest may also be determined by automatically detecting recognizable markers in photos uploaded to the system (including, for example, geographically encoded location information, recognizable visual marker, or the like).
- data manager 103 may provide the candidate places of interest to a user interface 107 for selection by user 101 .
- the previously described signals used to determine candidate places of interest may merely assist in ranking each candidate place of interest.
- those places of interest having a higher ranking may appear first in a selection list displayed at user interface 107 .
- first user 102 may be presented with places of interest visited during the journey.
- First user 102 may then provide consent to share one or more of those places of interest with other second users 104 in the social network by selection of those places of interest at user interface 107 .
- a representation of the user and the selected (previously visited) places of interest may be provided for display in the social network.
- the representation may include a character description of the one or more selected places of interest together with a user identifier such as the user's name, picture, or other likeness of the user.
- the representation may be a message posted to a message stream, viewable by other users in the user's social graph.
- the representation may include the user's name, picture, or other likeness displayed at one or more geographical locations on a map, together with information about the one or more selected places of interest.
- FIG. 2 depicts a travel path 201 determined from a plurality of example coordinate readings 202 received from a location-aware device associated with a user according to the subject technology.
- a location-aware device (for example, device 602 of FIG. 6 , or the like) may capture geographic position information over a period of time, for example, as the device is moved along travel path 201 .
- the position information may include one or more geographic coordinate readings 202 determined (for example, generated) and/or recorded by the location-aware device over a period of time, with each reading representative of a location of the device at a particular point in time.
- a coordinate reading may be determined by the device at periodic intervals.
- Travel path 201 may be constructed (for example, virtually) based on the location and sequence order of each of coordinates 202 by software (for example, data manager 103 ) running on the location-aware device, or a server, and stored for later use.
- travel path 201 is displayed on an electronic map 203 , which may be displayed by the computing device.
- travel path 201 may not be generated, but, rather, may be merely illustrative of geographic coordinates 202 received from a computing device.
- geographic coordinates 202 may be translated to location points, with each location point representing a potential location where the user visited a place of interest.
- a location point may be determined from a cluster 204 of geographic coordinate readings 202 (for example, two or more points) around a geographic location in travel path 201 .
- Cluster 204 of readings may provide an indication that the user of the device was stationary at a particular geographic location and, potentially, a place of interest.
- the software instructions may generate a location point to represent cluster 204 of geographic coordinate readings.
- a location point may be determined from, for example, one or more geographic locations 205 where the user paused for a predetermined duration along the travel path (for example, from a series of identical or substantially identical coordinate readings over a period of time).
- the subject technology may determine one or more candidate places of interest for each determined location point.
- a candidate place of interest may include a business, a public recreation area (for example, a park, campground, pool, beach, or the like), government building, monument, tourist attraction, amusement park, or the like.
- a list of candidate places of interest may be determined for an area within a predetermined radius about the location point (or received coordinates). The candidate places of interest may then be ranked based on a number of different signals to facilitate determining which one or more of the candidate places of interest the user visited.
- One signal may include a location history of the device, for example, past visits (for example, social media check-ins) to known locations or places. From the location history, the device may determine one or more candidate places of interest at the current location point that corresponds to a place in the user's location history, or places similar to those in the location history. For example, if the user has visited a candidate place of interest in the past, that candidate place of interest may more likely be the place of interest visited at the subject time in question. In another example, each candidate place may be associated with a classification corresponding to what type of place it is. The candidate place may then be evaluated based on the classification of places in the location history.
- a location history of the device for example, past visits (for example, social media check-ins) to known locations or places. From the location history, the device may determine one or more candidate places of interest at the current location point that corresponds to a place in the user's location history, or places similar to those in the location history. For example, if the user has visited a candidate place of
- a confidence score (for example, a normalized value or percentile, or the like) corresponding to each candidate place of interest may be determined based on how many times the user previously visited the candidate place or a place having a classification matching the candidate place of interest. For example, the confidence score may be 0.75 if the user visited the candidate place of interest two out the last three times the user was at the current location point, but 0.5 if the user has never visited the current location point.
- another signal may include places of interest associated with other users related through the user's social graph (“related users”).
- related users may be expected to more likely associate with those places that related users have, for example, visited, endorsed, shared through the social network, or the like.
- the subject technology may retrieve a list of places from respective location histories of the related users, and select places near to the current location point of the user from that list to recommend places. For example, if one or more related users have visited one or more places of interest near the current location point, the algorithm may select places of interest visited more than a predetermined number of times, and assign a confidence score to the selected places based on how many related users visited the candidate place of interest.
- the algorithm may select a predetermined number of places that have been visited (or endorsed or shared) the most by one or more related users (for example, the top three). Where other signals may be non-determinative, the candidate places of interest may be displayed according to the order of their respective rankings.
- Another signal may include the global prominence of places proximate (for example, within a predetermined distance) to the current location point. For example, a globally recognized toy store (for example, FAO Schwartz) may be ranked higher than a small local coffee shop in the same geographic location. In determining between the two places, an algorithm may determine a prominence ranking for each place proximate the current location point. A confidence score may be associated with a place of interest based on the prominence ranking. Where other signals may be non-determinative, the candidate place of interest having the highest prominence ranking may be chosen as the place of interested most likely to be visited by the user.
- a globally recognized toy store for example, FAO Schwartz
- Another signal may include places previously searched for by the user, using for example, an online search engine or search feature implemented by or integrated with a program executed by the device (for example, an operating system).
- the user searches for, and selects, an identifiable place
- the subject technology may store that place in the user's location history (for example, in a local file system or on a server).
- the device may then determine whether a determined location point corresponds to a place of interest stored in the location history.
- a confidence score may be assigned to each identifiable place based on a number of searches for the identifiable place (for example, over a predetermined period of time), the closeness of the search, or the like.
- Another signal may include a classification of businesses proximate a determined location point.
- the classification may include operating hours, a time range of peak traffic, a “morning” or “afternoon” or “evening” designation, or the like. For example, a coffee shop, while open all day and into the evening may have a peak traffic time in the morning. If the current location point is captured near a coffee shop in the morning, and other signals are less indicative of other possible places, the subject technology may provide the coffee shop as a recommendation or place it higher in the list of places recommended to the user for selection. In this example, a predetermined confidence score may be assigned based on how close the current time of day is to the operating hours or peak traffic time of the business.
- Another signal may include location recognition from a digital picture (for example, a photo or video).
- a digital picture for example, a photo or video
- a user may take a digital picture at a time corresponding to the time in which one or more coordinates corresponding to a determined location point were captured.
- the digital picture may be automatically stored in a local file system or remote server at the time it is taken, or uploaded from the device that captured the digital picture at a later point in time.
- the subject technology may process the photo using location recognition software and/or hardware and compared against other photos of known places to determine one or more places that likely correspond to the photo, and then present the determined places of interest to the user for selection.
- Recognition of a place may arise from a visual marker in the photo, for example, a displayed logo, identifiable storefront, or the like.
- the subject technology may also use a geographic location embedded within meta data stored in connection with the photo (for example, embedded in the digital photo file).
- the geographic location may be compared against locations of known places to determine one or more candidate places of interest for presentation to the user.
- a confidence score may be assigned to each candidate place of interest based on how close the recognition software was able to correlate the digital photo to the candidate place of interest, how close the known place of interest is to the geo-location, and/or the like.
- Each candidate place of interest determined by a signal may be associated with a confidence score representative of how likely the candidate place of interest was visited by the user.
- An overall confidence level may then be calculated from an aggregate of confidence scores corresponding to one or more respective signals.
- the confidence level may be a weighted average of the determined confidence scores. For example, each signal may be weighted so that when aggregated with other signals, the confidence scores corresponding to higher weighted signals may be given more weight than confidence scores corresponding to lower weighted signals.
- the confidence level for each candidate place of interest may then be normalized, and the candidate places of interest provided to a user according to their respective confidence levels.
- FIG. 3 depicts an example computing device 301 , including a user interface 302 for selecting previously visited locations, according to the subject technology.
- a selection list 303 of candidate places may be displayed along with a request for a user to select one or more places from the list that the user visited while on a journey.
- each candidate place of interest 304 listed may be associated with a selection box 305 so that the user may select which places were visited and omit other suggestions offered by the system.
- the selection list may be generated for location points collected over a predetermined period of time (for example, last 24 hours) or a period of time since a previous interaction with the user interface, related to a travelled path of the user that does not include the user's current location, or the like.
- user interface 302 may display a graphical map 306 , with one or more location points 307 identified, for example, in a travel path.
- a selection box 308 may be provided for selecting a corresponding location point 307 .
- the system may display (for example, in selection list 303 ) candidate places of interest 304 corresponding to the selected location point.
- location points 307 may be selected directly from graphical map 306 (for example, using a pointing device or touch display).
- computing device 301 may, on being idle for a period of time, display a notification 309 (for example, an alert) to the user, suggesting that the user initiate a command to open the user interface.
- Notification 309 may also be displayed on unlocking the device (for example, unlocking a smart phone before use), opening up a social networking application, or based on other signals of opportunity.
- a push notification may be sent to the computing device.
- the notification may prompt the user to open user interface 302 , or may ask if the user visited one or more place of interest (for example, selected from a list of candidate places of interest displayed by the notification). On selection of a displayed candidate place of interest, further details of the candidate place of interest may be displayed and/or edited by the user.
- a promo widget may be displayed in connection with a web application used by the user (for example, a graphic box on a webpage of a social network, email service, or the like).
- the promo widget may display one or more random text promos asking the user “were you at this place?” If the user selects a text promo or otherwise selects “yes” then the system may automatically check the user into that place of interest. The system may then display another text promo for another candidate place of interest in the previously described list of candidate places of interest. On selection of one or more candidate places of interest (for example, from the previously described list), the system may perform a check-in operation and/or post one or messages to a message stream of a social network, informing other users that the user visited the one or more candidate places of interest.
- FIG. 4 depicts a webpage 401 , including example alternative viewing mechanisms for displaying locations previously visited by a user in a social network, according to the subject technology.
- the previously described selected places of interest may be displayed as one or more messages 402 in a message stream 403 .
- the one or more messages 402 may be displayed in the message stream at a time corresponding to a time that the user visited the place of interest, or, as depicted, may be grouped together, informing users that, for example, the user “visited [Place A], [Place B], and [Place C].”
- webpage 401 (for example, displayed by the social network) may display the selected places of interest in a list view 404 (for example, as a widget).
- the webpage, or list view 404 may display a text-base or graphical timeline that displays user visits (“check-ins”) over time.
- an electronic map 405 may be provided that displays each visited place of interest as an identified location 406 (for example, a spot) on the map.
- electronic map 405 may be associated with an interactive repositionable graphic bar 407 (for example, a time scrubber) that, on a repositioning of the graphic bar by a pointing device, causes electronic map 405 to limit the display of the one or more locations 406 to only places visited during a time period corresponding to a current positioning of the graphic bar.
- the user may use graphic bar 407 to scrub back and forth through time and see which places of interest the user visited at different times. For example, location “2” is displayed in dashed lines to illustrate that it may not be displayed until a user repositions graphic bar 407 to a time period associated with the location.
- webpage 401 may display only one mechanism.
- a social network may display the locations grouped together in a message stream visible on one webpage, but display either the previously described electronic map or list view on one or more other webpages.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example process for sharing previously visited locations in a social network according to one aspect of the subject technology.
- historical travel data related to a path travelled by a user is received.
- the historical travel data may include, for example, position information (including, for example, coordinate readings) recorded by a location-aware mobile computing device (for example, up to, but not including a current location of the user).
- the travelled path may be determined by, or representative of, the historical travel data.
- the historical travel data may be received and processed by software or hardware integrated with the mobile device, or sent by the mobile device and received and processed at a server by software or hardware integrated with the server.
- one or more candidate places of interest along the travelled path are determined based on the historical travel data.
- the one or more candidate places of interest may be determined based on one or more geographic locations along the path where the user paused for at least a predetermined duration (for example, more than five minutes).
- the historical travel data may include a plurality of geographic coordinate readings.
- one or more candidate places of interest may be determined based on a selection of known places of interest proximate to one or more respective clusters of the geographic coordinate readings.
- the candidate places of interest may be determined based on one or more signals, each signal providing an indication that the user visited a respective place of interest
- the one or more candidate places of interest are provided for display to the user.
- a user interface may display the one or more candidate places of interest to the user, and request that the user select one or more of the candidate places of interest.
- one or more selected places of interest, selected from the one or more candidate places of interest is received from the user.
- a representation of the user and the selected places of interest for example, a character description of the one or more selected places of interest together with a user identifier such as the user's name, picture, or other likeness of the user
- a social network for example, in a message stream.
- FIG. 6 is a diagram of an example system 600 and related devices for sharing previously visited locations in a social network according to one aspect of the subject technology.
- System 600 may include one or more servers 601 configured to host an online social network and provide web pages related to the online social network over a network 602 (for example, a local or wide area network, Wi-Fi network, cellular network, the Internet, or the like).
- Servers 601 may be in operable communication (for example, connected over network 602 ) with one or more computing devices 603 or 604 .
- computing device 603 may be a geographically aware mobile device (for example, a smart phone, tablet or notebook computer, personal computer, PDA, or the like).
- Servers 601 may be configured to provide one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) for the integration of mobile-to-web extension applications.
- a social network hosted by servers 601 may include a social check-in application that allows users of the social network to “check in” to a physical place using computing device 603 , and share their location with their friends or contacts.
- Device 603 may be configured with software integrated with the social network, that is configured to perform a check-in by associating one or more specific places of interest (for example, places, businesses or recreational areas, or the like) with a user's current geographic location.
- the software may use a GPS device integrated into the computing device to find the user's current location, and then present to the user for selection a list of places of interest based on the current location.
- Other methods of determining a user's location may include multilateration of radio signals between (several) radio towers of the network and the phone, mobile positioning, signal interpolation, and the like.
- the computing device may send a message (for example, over network 602 ) to servers 601 to supplement the user's current geographic location displayed in the social network with the selected place of interest.
- servers 601 may be configured to provide for display a graphical user interface 605 (for example, user interface 302 ) for communicating with a first user 606 and for selecting previously visited locations.
- User interface 605 may display candidate places of interest determined from a travel path of first user 606 .
- servers 601 may receive a plurality of coordinate readings related to a path previously travelled by a user.

Abstract
A system and method for sharing previously visited locations in a social network includes a location-aware computing device (for example, a smartphone) configured to send, to a server, a historical log of data representative of a path previously travelled by a user. The server may determine one or more candidate places of interest along the previously travelled path based on the historical data, and provide the candidate places of interest to the user for selection. On the user selecting one or more of the displayed candidate places of interest, the server may provide the selected places of interest to a social network for display to other users in the social network, to inform the other users that the user visited those places.
Description
- The subject technology relates generally to the location-aware and navigational devices.
- Location-aware smart phones and other devices have been integrated with interactive location services to provide users the ability to view their current locations, and the current locations of their friends, on interactive maps. In this manner, a user may load a map on a cell phone to view the current location(s) of the user's friends in real time. Location-aware devices may also be integrated with a “check-in” feature that enables a user to select, in real-time, a place of interest near the user's current geographic location to announce to other users (for example, in a social network) where the user is currently located.
- The subject technology provides a system and computer-implemented method for sharing previously visited locations in a social network. According to one aspect, a computer-implemented method may include receiving historical travel data related to a path travelled by a user, determining one or more candidate places of interest along the travelled path based on the historical travel data, providing the one or more candidate places of interest for display to the user, receiving, from the user, one or more selected places of interest, selected from the one or more candidate places of interest, and providing, for display to other users of a social network, a representation of the user and the selected places of interest. Other aspects include corresponding systems, apparatuses, and computer program products for implementation of the computer-implemented method.
- In another aspect, a machine-readable medium may include instructions stored thereon that, when executed by a processor, cause a machine to perform a method of displaying a geographically targeted internet offering. In this regard, the method may include receiving a plurality of geographic coordinate readings recorded over a period of time, the plurality of geographic coordinate readings related to a path travelled by a user, determining one or more candidate places of interest based on the plurality of geographic coordinate readings, providing the one or more candidate places of interest for display at a user interface, receiving, from the user interface, one or more selected places of interests, and providing, for display to users of a social network, a representation of the user and the selected places of interest. Other aspects include corresponding systems, apparatuses, and computer program products.
- In a further aspect, a system may include a processor and a memory. The memory may include instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to receive a plurality of coordinate readings related to a path travelled by a user, determine one or more candidate places of interest along the travelled path based on the plurality of coordinate readings, provide the one or more candidate places of interest for display at a user interface, receive, from the user interface, one or more selected places of interest, and provide, for display to other users of a social network, a representation of the user and the one or more selected places of interest.
- It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized, the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects, all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.
- A detailed description will be made with reference to the accompanying drawings:

FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating an example computing system for sharing previously visited locations in a social network, including a processor and other internal components. - A location-aware device (for example, a GPS-enabled smart phone) may be integrated with a check-in feature that enables a user to send an indication (for example, an announcement, message, or the like) to other users in a social network that user is at, or was at, a place of interest (for example, a business establishment) at or near the user's current or past geographic location. As will be described further, the user may not required to be at a specific location to perform a check-in. Rather, the subject technology enables the user to perform a check-in to places of interest visited in the past, and to share those places of interest with other users in the social network as if the user had checked in to the places of interest while visiting them.
-
FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example system for sharing previously visited locations in a social network according to one aspect of the subject technology. A location-aware device 101 (for example, a GPS-enabled smartphone), associated with afirst user 102, may be configured, on consent of its user, to record and store historical travel data (for example, a series of geographic coordinates, WiFi scans, cell tower information, or the like) asuser 102 imparts on a journey. At the completion of the journey,device 101 may be configured to send (for example, upload, transmit, or the like) the historical travel data to a data manager 103 (for example, software running ondevice 101, a remote server, or the like) so that identified places of interest visited during the journey may be shared with one or moresecond users 104 in asocial network 105. - In one example,
device 101 includes one or more setup screens that enable the user to configuredevice 101 to temporarily collect historical travel data. In this regard, data is collected for the limited purpose of providing the user the ability to review and select places of interest previously visited by the user, and to perform a “check-in” to one or more selected places of interest after-the-fact. Historical travel data is encrypted and then stored for windows of predetermined periods of time (for example, the last 24 hours). During a journey,device 101 may periodically inform the user (for example, by way of a blinking icon on the device's display screen) that the device is collecting historical travel data. The setup screens may further enable the user to purge stored data, and/or disable further collection of travel data. - The historical travel data may include a series of geographic coordinate readings (for example, latitude/longitude, Cartesian coordinates, GPS data, or the like) recorded over a period of time (for example, prior to the user arriving at a current location). In this regard,
data manager 103 receives the coordinate readings and determines one or more places of interest visited by the user at specific location points (for example, geographic locations or coordinates) along a travel path based on a predetermined rule. The predefined rule may, for example, involve clustering of the geographic coordinate readings to determine identifiable location points where the user spent time (for example, paused for a predetermined duration), determine one or more location points based on a pause in recording for a predetermined duration at a point in the travel path, or the like. - On determining one or more location points,
data manager 103 may, for example, search arepository 106 for known places of interest (for example, businesses, recreation centers, or the like) proximate to the one or more location points (for example, within a predetermined distance). In one aspect,repository 106 may include a check-in service integrated with social network 105 (for example, provided by a third party). In this manner,data manager 103 may determine a location point and query the check-in service using the location point to retrieve candidate places of interest as ifuser 101 was checking in at a current location. - Candidate places of interest may be further limited by ranking places of interest known to be within a vicinity (for example, a radius) of a location point. In this manner, a higher ranking may be assigned to previously visited places of interest or places of interest similar to those previously visited. For example, if a user typically frequents bars, and a place of interest near a location point may be either a bar or a nearby acupuncture center, the system may determine that the candidate place of interest is more likely to be the bar. The number of possible candidate places of interest may be further limited by sweeping a radius around a determined geographic location. Additionally or in the alternative, one or more candidate places of interest may be selected based on a categorization. For example, a bar may include a “night” categorization and a hospital may include a “day” categorization. If a geographic location determined from the received coordinates is proximate to both, and the location was visited at night, the bar may be selected as the candidate place of interest.
- Other signals that may be used to determine candidate places of interest may include places of interest that other people in the user's social graph have visited, a history of places of interest shared by other users, a predetermined global prominence score given to places of interest along the travel path, past web searches or web pages viewed by the user that are related to places of interest, and the like. Places of interest may also be determined by automatically detecting recognizable markers in photos uploaded to the system (including, for example, geographically encoded location information, recognizable visual marker, or the like).
- Once a list of candidate places of interest is determined,
data manager 103 may provide the candidate places of interest to auser interface 107 for selection byuser 101. In some aspects, the previously described signals used to determine candidate places of interest may merely assist in ranking each candidate place of interest. In this regard, those places of interest having a higher ranking may appear first in a selection list displayed atuser interface 107. Atuser interface 107,first user 102 may be presented with places of interest visited during the journey.First user 102 may then provide consent to share one or more of those places of interest with othersecond users 104 in the social network by selection of those places of interest atuser interface 107. On receiving fromuser 101 one or more selected places of interest, a representation of the user and the selected (previously visited) places of interest may be provided for display in the social network. For example, the representation may include a character description of the one or more selected places of interest together with a user identifier such as the user's name, picture, or other likeness of the user. In one example, the representation may be a message posted to a message stream, viewable by other users in the user's social graph. In another example, the representation may include the user's name, picture, or other likeness displayed at one or more geographical locations on a map, together with information about the one or more selected places of interest. -
FIG. 2 depicts atravel path 201 determined from a plurality ofexample coordinate readings 202 received from a location-aware device associated with a user according to the subject technology. A location-aware device (for example,device 602 ofFIG. 6 , or the like) may capture geographic position information over a period of time, for example, as the device is moved alongtravel path 201. The position information may include one or more geographic coordinatereadings 202 determined (for example, generated) and/or recorded by the location-aware device over a period of time, with each reading representative of a location of the device at a particular point in time. In some aspects, a coordinate reading may be determined by the device at periodic intervals.Travel path 201 may be constructed (for example, virtually) based on the location and sequence order of each ofcoordinates 202 by software (for example, data manager 103) running on the location-aware device, or a server, and stored for later use. In the depicted example,travel path 201 is displayed on anelectronic map 203, which may be displayed by the computing device. In other aspects,travel path 201 may not be generated, but, rather, may be merely illustrative ofgeographic coordinates 202 received from a computing device. - Once received,
geographic coordinates 202 may be translated to location points, with each location point representing a potential location where the user visited a place of interest. In some aspects, a location point may be determined from acluster 204 of geographic coordinate readings 202 (for example, two or more points) around a geographic location intravel path 201.Cluster 204 of readings may provide an indication that the user of the device was stationary at a particular geographic location and, potentially, a place of interest. In this case, the software instructions may generate a location point to representcluster 204 of geographic coordinate readings. In other aspects, a location point may be determined from, for example, one or moregeographic locations 205 where the user paused for a predetermined duration along the travel path (for example, from a series of identical or substantially identical coordinate readings over a period of time). - The subject technology may determine one or more candidate places of interest for each determined location point. A candidate place of interest may include a business, a public recreation area (for example, a park, campground, pool, beach, or the like), government building, monument, tourist attraction, amusement park, or the like. In some aspects, a list of candidate places of interest may be determined for an area within a predetermined radius about the location point (or received coordinates). The candidate places of interest may then be ranked based on a number of different signals to facilitate determining which one or more of the candidate places of interest the user visited.
- One signal may include a location history of the device, for example, past visits (for example, social media check-ins) to known locations or places. From the location history, the device may determine one or more candidate places of interest at the current location point that corresponds to a place in the user's location history, or places similar to those in the location history. For example, if the user has visited a candidate place of interest in the past, that candidate place of interest may more likely be the place of interest visited at the subject time in question. In another example, each candidate place may be associated with a classification corresponding to what type of place it is. The candidate place may then be evaluated based on the classification of places in the location history. For example, if the user typically frequents bars, and a place of interest may be a bar or a nearby acupuncture center, the system may determine that the place of interest is more likely to be the bar. A confidence score (for example, a normalized value or percentile, or the like) corresponding to each candidate place of interest may be determined based on how many times the user previously visited the candidate place or a place having a classification matching the candidate place of interest. For example, the confidence score may be 0.75 if the user visited the candidate place of interest two out the last three times the user was at the current location point, but 0.5 if the user has never visited the current location point.
- Similarly, another signal may include places of interest associated with other users related through the user's social graph (“related users”). In this regard, a user may be expected to more likely associate with those places that related users have, for example, visited, endorsed, shared through the social network, or the like. The subject technology may retrieve a list of places from respective location histories of the related users, and select places near to the current location point of the user from that list to recommend places. For example, if one or more related users have visited one or more places of interest near the current location point, the algorithm may select places of interest visited more than a predetermined number of times, and assign a confidence score to the selected places based on how many related users visited the candidate place of interest. If multiple places meet a selection criteria, the algorithm may select a predetermined number of places that have been visited (or endorsed or shared) the most by one or more related users (for example, the top three). Where other signals may be non-determinative, the candidate places of interest may be displayed according to the order of their respective rankings.
- Another signal may include the global prominence of places proximate (for example, within a predetermined distance) to the current location point. For example, a globally recognized toy store (for example, FAO Schwartz) may be ranked higher than a small local coffee shop in the same geographic location. In determining between the two places, an algorithm may determine a prominence ranking for each place proximate the current location point. A confidence score may be associated with a place of interest based on the prominence ranking. Where other signals may be non-determinative, the candidate place of interest having the highest prominence ranking may be chosen as the place of interested most likely to be visited by the user.
- Another signal may include places previously searched for by the user, using for example, an online search engine or search feature implemented by or integrated with a program executed by the device (for example, an operating system). When the user searches for, and selects, an identifiable place, the subject technology may store that place in the user's location history (for example, in a local file system or on a server). The device may then determine whether a determined location point corresponds to a place of interest stored in the location history. A confidence score may be assigned to each identifiable place based on a number of searches for the identifiable place (for example, over a predetermined period of time), the closeness of the search, or the like.
- Another signal may include a classification of businesses proximate a determined location point. The classification may include operating hours, a time range of peak traffic, a “morning” or “afternoon” or “evening” designation, or the like. For example, a coffee shop, while open all day and into the evening may have a peak traffic time in the morning. If the current location point is captured near a coffee shop in the morning, and other signals are less indicative of other possible places, the subject technology may provide the coffee shop as a recommendation or place it higher in the list of places recommended to the user for selection. In this example, a predetermined confidence score may be assigned based on how close the current time of day is to the operating hours or peak traffic time of the business.
- Another signal may include location recognition from a digital picture (for example, a photo or video). For example, a user may take a digital picture at a time corresponding to the time in which one or more coordinates corresponding to a determined location point were captured. The digital picture may be automatically stored in a local file system or remote server at the time it is taken, or uploaded from the device that captured the digital picture at a later point in time. The subject technology may process the photo using location recognition software and/or hardware and compared against other photos of known places to determine one or more places that likely correspond to the photo, and then present the determined places of interest to the user for selection. Recognition of a place may arise from a visual marker in the photo, for example, a displayed logo, identifiable storefront, or the like. The subject technology may also use a geographic location embedded within meta data stored in connection with the photo (for example, embedded in the digital photo file). The geographic location may be compared against locations of known places to determine one or more candidate places of interest for presentation to the user. A confidence score may be assigned to each candidate place of interest based on how close the recognition software was able to correlate the digital photo to the candidate place of interest, how close the known place of interest is to the geo-location, and/or the like.
- The previously described example signals are not inclusive, but, rather, other signals may be included in the same or similar manner. Each candidate place of interest determined by a signal may be associated with a confidence score representative of how likely the candidate place of interest was visited by the user. An overall confidence level may then be calculated from an aggregate of confidence scores corresponding to one or more respective signals. In some aspects, the confidence level may be a weighted average of the determined confidence scores. For example, each signal may be weighted so that when aggregated with other signals, the confidence scores corresponding to higher weighted signals may be given more weight than confidence scores corresponding to lower weighted signals. The confidence level for each candidate place of interest may then be normalized, and the candidate places of interest provided to a user according to their respective confidence levels.

FIG. 3 depicts anexample computing device 301, including auser interface 302 for selecting previously visited locations, according to the subject technology. On initiation ofuser interface 302, aselection list 303 of candidate places may be displayed along with a request for a user to select one or more places from the list that the user visited while on a journey. In one example, each candidate place ofinterest 304 listed may be associated with aselection box 305 so that the user may select which places were visited and omit other suggestions offered by the system. The selection list may be generated for location points collected over a predetermined period of time (for example, last 24 hours) or a period of time since a previous interaction with the user interface, related to a travelled path of the user that does not include the user's current location, or the like. - In some aspects,
user interface 302 may display agraphical map 306, with one or more location points 307 identified, for example, in a travel path. Aselection box 308 may be provided for selecting a correspondinglocation point 307. On selection of an identifiedlocation point 307 the system may display (for example, in selection list 303) candidate places ofinterest 304 corresponding to the selected location point. In other aspects, location points 307 may be selected directly from graphical map 306 (for example, using a pointing device or touch display). - When
user interface 302 is not active,computing device 301 may, on being idle for a period of time, display a notification 309 (for example, an alert) to the user, suggesting that the user initiate a command to open the user interface.Notification 309 may also be displayed on unlocking the device (for example, unlocking a smart phone before use), opening up a social networking application, or based on other signals of opportunity. - In one example, a push notification may be sent to the computing device. The notification may prompt the user to open
user interface 302, or may ask if the user visited one or more place of interest (for example, selected from a list of candidate places of interest displayed by the notification). On selection of a displayed candidate place of interest, further details of the candidate place of interest may be displayed and/or edited by the user. In another example, after the user has opted-in to the check-in feature of the subject technology, a promo widget may be displayed in connection with a web application used by the user (for example, a graphic box on a webpage of a social network, email service, or the like). The promo widget may display one or more random text promos asking the user “were you at this place?” If the user selects a text promo or otherwise selects “yes” then the system may automatically check the user into that place of interest. The system may then display another text promo for another candidate place of interest in the previously described list of candidate places of interest. On selection of one or more candidate places of interest (for example, from the previously described list), the system may perform a check-in operation and/or post one or messages to a message stream of a social network, informing other users that the user visited the one or more candidate places of interest. -
FIG. 4 depicts awebpage 401, including example alternative viewing mechanisms for displaying locations previously visited by a user in a social network, according to the subject technology. In one example, the previously described selected places of interest may be displayed as one ormore messages 402 in amessage stream 403. The one ormore messages 402 may be displayed in the message stream at a time corresponding to a time that the user visited the place of interest, or, as depicted, may be grouped together, informing users that, for example, the user “visited [Place A], [Place B], and [Place C].” In another example, webpage 401 (for example, displayed by the social network) may display the selected places of interest in a list view 404 (for example, as a widget). In another example, the webpage, orlist view 404, may display a text-base or graphical timeline that displays user visits (“check-ins”) over time. - In another example, an electronic map 405 (for example, heat map) may be provided that displays each visited place of interest as an identified location 406 (for example, a spot) on the map. In one aspect,
electronic map 405 may be associated with an interactive repositionable graphic bar 407 (for example, a time scrubber) that, on a repositioning of the graphic bar by a pointing device, causeselectronic map 405 to limit the display of the one ormore locations 406 to only places visited during a time period corresponding to a current positioning of the graphic bar. In this regard, the user may usegraphic bar 407 to scrub back and forth through time and see which places of interest the user visited at different times. For example, location “2” is displayed in dashed lines to illustrate that it may not be displayed until a user repositionsgraphic bar 407 to a time period associated with the location. - While the previously described viewing mechanisms are displayed together in the depicted
example webpage 401, it should be understood that many implementations ofwebpage 401 may display only one mechanism. For example, a social network may display the locations grouped together in a message stream visible on one webpage, but display either the previously described electronic map or list view on one or more other webpages. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example process for sharing previously visited locations in a social network according to one aspect of the subject technology. Inblock 501, historical travel data related to a path travelled by a user is received. The historical travel data may include, for example, position information (including, for example, coordinate readings) recorded by a location-aware mobile computing device (for example, up to, but not including a current location of the user). The travelled path may be determined by, or representative of, the historical travel data. The historical travel data may be received and processed by software or hardware integrated with the mobile device, or sent by the mobile device and received and processed at a server by software or hardware integrated with the server. - In
block 502, one or more candidate places of interest along the travelled path are determined based on the historical travel data. For example, the one or more candidate places of interest may be determined based on one or more geographic locations along the path where the user paused for at least a predetermined duration (for example, more than five minutes). In another example, the historical travel data may include a plurality of geographic coordinate readings. In this regard, one or more candidate places of interest may be determined based on a selection of known places of interest proximate to one or more respective clusters of the geographic coordinate readings.

The software may use a GPS device integrated into the computing device to find the user's current location, and then present to the user for selection a list of places of interest based on the current location. Other methods of determining a user's location may include multilateration of radio signals between (several) radio towers of the network and the phone, mobile positioning, signal interpolation, and the like. When a place of interest is selected, the computing device may send a message (for example, over network 602) toservers 601 to supplement the user's current geographic location displayed in the social network with the selected place of interest. - In one aspect,
servers 601 may be configured to provide for display a graphical user interface 605 (for example, user interface 302) for communicating with afirst user 606 and for selecting previously visited locations.User interface 605 may display candidate places of interest determined from a travel path offirst user 606. In the depicted example,servers 601 may receive a plurality of coordinate readings related to a path previously travelled by a user.Servers 601 may then determine one or more candidate places of interest based on the plurality of coordinate readings. The one or more candidate places of interest may then be provided for display atuser interface 605 for display tofirst user 606.First user 606 may select one or more of the candidate places of interest to convey thatfirst user 606 visited the selected places of interest whenfirst user 606 travelled along the travel path. - Computing device 604 (for example a smartphone, GPS navigation device, or personal computer, tablet computer, PDA, a television or other display device with one or more computing devices embedded therein or attached thereto, or other device configured to determine a present location of a user) may provide a second user interface 607 (for example, webpage 401) for displaying locations previously visited by one or more
first users 606. On receiving the previously described selected places of interest from afirst user 606 atuser interface 605,servers 601 may provide user interface 607 a representation offirst user 606 and the one or more selected places of interest. The representation may include, for example, a character-based message displayed in a message stream associated with the social network. - In some aspects, the various connections between
servers 601,computing devices network 602 may be made over a wired or wireless connection. The functionality ofservers 601 may be implemented on a single server or distributed among a plurality of servers or other computing devices. The functionality ofserver 601 may also be included incomputing devices 603 and/or 604 such that an independent server or set of servers is not necessary to carry out the aspects of the subject technology, but, rather, may be implemented by a system of one or more distributed computing devices. -
