Definitions
- This disclosure relates to video encoding and decoding and particularly to video coding using un-equal error protection.
- Digital video streams represent video using a sequence of still images, called “frames.”
- Modern video coding techniques can efficiently compress the video stream for many applications such as video conferencing and streaming through bandwidth-limited communication channels.
- packet loss and error may occur during video bitstream transmission, resulting in errors in decoding the bitstream.
- One aspect of a disclosed implementation is a method for encoding a video stream including a plurality of video frames, each frame including a plurality of blocks.
- the method includes selecting a first block substantially central to a frame and then selecting subsequent blocks in a substantially spiral manner such that each subsequent block adjoins a previously selected block. Selection continues until the selected blocks form a contiguous group of blocks occupying at least a central section of the frame.
- the selected blocks are encoded in an order in which the selected blocks were selected.
- the method applies a first level of error protection to encoded blocks within the central section, and applies a second level of error protection, different than the first level of error protection, to encoded blocks outside the central section of the frame.
- the apparatus includes memory and at least one processor programmed to execute instructions contained in the memory.
- the instructions cause the processor to select a first block substantially central to a frame and then select subsequent blocks in a substantially spiral manner such that each subsequent block adjoins a previously selected block, continue the selecting of subsequent blocks until the selected blocks form a contiguous group of blocks occupying at least a central section of the frame, encode the selected blocks in an order in which the selected blocks were selected, apply a first level of error protection to encoded blocks within the central section, and if any encoded blocks are located outside the central section, apply a second level of error protection, different than the first level of error protection, to the encoded blocks outside the central section.
- Another aspect of a disclosed implementation is a method for decoding a video stream.
- This method includes receiving a bitstream of encoded blocks associated with a frame, and decoding the encoded blocks in an order corresponding to a first block substantially central to the frame, a second block adjacent to the first block, and subsequent blocks adjacent to a previously selected block in a spiral manner. Responsive to data errors affecting decoding of a block of the encoded blocks, the method performs data recovery operations.
- the recovery operations include attempting recovery of data related to the block using a first level of error protection when the block resides within a central section of the frame, the central section of the frame including at least a contiguous set of blocks about a center of the frame, and if the block resides outside the central section, attempting recovery of data related to the block using a second level of error protection, the second level of protection different than the first level, or skipping recovery of the data related to the block.
- the apparatus includes digital data storage and at least one processor programmed to execute instructions contained in the digital data storage.
- the instructions cause the processor to receive a bitstream of encoded blocks associated with a frame and decode the encoded blocks wherein the encoded blocks are encoded in an order corresponding to a first block substantially central to the frame, a second block adjacent to the first block, and subsequent blocks adjacent to a previously selected block in a spiral manner.
- the processor Responsive to data errors affecting decoding of a block of the encoded blocks, the processor performs data recovery by attempting recovery of data related to the block using a first level of error protection when the block resides within a central section of the frame, the central section of the frame including at least a contiguous set of blocks about a center of the frame. If instead the block resides outside the central section, the processor performs one of attempting recovery of data related to the block using a second level of error protection, the second level of protection different than the first level of error protection, or skipping recovery of the data related to the block.

- Digital video is used for various purposes, with some examples including remote business meetings via video conferencing, high definition video entertainment, video advertisements, and sharing of user-generated videos.
- video conferencing high definition video entertainment
- video advertisements and sharing of user-generated videos.
- users obtain higher expectations for video quality; they expect high resolution video even for video transmitted over communications channels of limited bandwidth.
- video encoding and decoding schemes incorporate various compression schemes. These compression schemes generally break the image up into blocks and use one or more techniques to limit the information included in a resulting digital video bitstream for transmission.
- the bitstream once received, can be decoded to re-create the blocks and the source images from the limited information.
- noisy communications channels between an encoder and decoder can corrupt transmitted data, resulting in degraded video performance and a decrease in perceived video quality.
- One way to address this is to trade bit rate for additional error correction information. Even with somewhat less resolution in either spatial resolution or dynamic range, the resultant image can yield a perceived image quality that is greater than if the tradeoff was not made under packet-loss conditions.
- a maximum bit rate for a given communications channel may be determined experimentally or known a priori. The decoder or another component with knowledge of the communications channel can determine the error rate of the communications channel and advise the encoder as to how much bandwidth should be allotted for error correction to assure a desired level of video quality.
- a number of blocks for an image are transmitted and the communications channel error rate is measured on a periodic or other basis. Based on these calculations, a change in B E is made, and hence a change to B IR . While such a scheme typically avoids dropped frames or other synchronization problems, the image degradation caused by reduced bit rate can interfere with perceived image quality, e.g., when the viewer is interested in the portion of the image that is subject to reduced image quality when higher requirements for error correction bandwidth result in reduced bandwidth for the image.
- constant bitrate is utilized to fit channel bandwidth.
- constant bitrate can be difficult to achieve in practice, and it generally calls for the quantization levels to change constantly during the block encoding process for every image in the video sequence.
- One challenge is that due to the limited bit budget, conventional techniques increase quantization levels for the latter-encoded blocks in an image in order to achieve the desired bitrate. This can reduce the picture quality for these latter-encoded blocks, in some cases resulting in uneven image quality when encoding in raster scan order. This uneven quality of the image can be annoying to the viewers.
- Another challenge with noisy communications channels between an encoder and decoder is that portions of the transmitted bitstream can be corrupted or entirely lost, also potentially resulting in degraded video performance and a decrease in perceived video quality.
- an interesting area of an image is defined as a portion of an image that may contain image data of actual or predicted interest to a viewer such as the face of a person talking in a video frame.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic of a video encoding and decoding system 10 in which aspects of the invention can be implemented.
- a transmitting station 12 includes a computer with an internal configuration of hardware including a processor such as a central processing unit (CPU) 14 and a digital data storage exemplified by memory 16 .

- a display 36 is configured to display a video stream.
- Display 36 can be connected to receiving station 30 and can be implemented in various ways, including by a liquid crystal display (LCD), a cathode-ray tube (CRT), organic or non-organic light emitting diode display (LED), plasma display, or any other mechanism to display a machine-readable video signal to a user.
- Display 36 can be configured to display a rendering 38 of the video stream decoded by a decoder in receiving station 30 .
- encoder and decoder system 10 are possible.
- an encoder is implemented in transmitting station 12 and a decoder is implemented in receiving station 30 as instructions in memory or a component separate from memory.
- an encoder or decoder can be coupled to a respective station 12 , 30 rather than be located within it.
- one implementation can omit network 28 and/or display 36 .
- a video stream can be encoded and then stored for transmission at a later time to receiving station 30 or any other device having memory.
- additional components can be added to encoder and decoder system 10 .
- a display or a video camera can be attached to transmitting station 12 to capture the video stream to be encoded.
- the real-time transport protocol is used for transmission of the bitstream.
- RTP real-time transport protocol
- a transport protocol other than RTP may be used, such as an HTTP-based video streaming protocol.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an exemplary video stream 50 to be encoded and subsequently decoded.
- Video stream 50 includes a video sequence 52 .
- Video sequence 52 includes a number of adjacent frames 54 . While three frames are depicted in adjacent frames 54 , video sequence 52 can include any number of adjacent frames.
- a single example of the adjacent frames 54 is illustrated as the single frame 56 .
- single frame 56 can be divided into a series of blocks 58 .
- blocks 58 contain data corresponding to 16 ⁇ 16 pixels in frame 56 , such as luminance and chrominance data for the corresponding pixels.
- Blocks 58 can also be of any other suitable size such as 16 ⁇ 8 pixel groups or 8 ⁇ 16 pixel groups. Unless otherwise noted, the terms block and macroblock are used interchangeably herein.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an encoder 70 in accordance with an implementation.
- Encoder 70 can be implemented, as described above, in transmitting station 12 .
- Encoder 70 encodes an input video stream 50 .
- Encoder 70 has the following stages to perform the various functions in a forward path (shown by the solid connection lines) to produce an encoded and/or a compressed bitstream 88 : an intra/inter prediction stage 72 , a transform stage 74 , a quantization stage 76 , and an entropy encoding stage 78 .
- Encoder 70 may also include a reconstruction path (shown by the dotted connection lines) to reconstruct a frame for prediction and encoding of future blocks.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an encoder 70 in accordance with an implementation.
- Encoder 70 can be implemented, as described above, in transmitting station 12 .
- Encoder 70 encodes an input video stream 50 .
- Encoder 70 has the following stages to perform the various functions in
- encoder 70 includes the following stages to perform the various functions in the reconstruction path: a dequantization stage 80 , an inverse transform stage 82 , a reconstruction stage 84 , and a loop filtering stage 86 .
- Other structural variations of encoder 70 can be used to encode video stream 50 .
- each frame (such as frame 56 from FIG. 2 ) within video stream 50 is processed in units of blocks.
- each block can be encoded using either intra-frame prediction or inter-frame prediction. Inter-frame prediction occurs within a single frame, whereas inter-frame prediction occurs from frame to frame. In either case, a prediction block can be formed.
- intra-prediction a prediction block can be formed from samples in the current frame that have been previously encoded and reconstructed.
- inter-prediction a prediction block can be formed from samples in one or more previously constructed reference frames.
- the prediction block can be subtracted from the current block at intra/inter prediction stage 72 to produce a residual block, also referred to as a “residual.”
- Transform stage 74 transforms the residual into transform coefficients in, for example, the frequency domain.
- block-based transforms include the Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT), the Discrete Cosine Transform (“DCT”), and the Singular Value Decomposition Transform (“SVD”) to name a few.
- the DCT transforms the block into the frequency domain.
- the transform coefficient values are based on spatial frequency, with the DC or other lowest frequency coefficient at the top-left of the matrix and the highest frequency coefficient at the bottom-right of the matrix.
- Quantization stage 76 converts the transform coefficients into discrete quantum values, which are referred to as quantized transform coefficients.
- the quantized transform coefficients are then entropy encoded by entropy encoding stage 78 .
- the entropy-encoded coefficients, together with other information used to decode the block, such as the type of prediction used, motion vectors and quantizer value, are then output to a compressed bitstream 88 .
- Compressed bitstream 88 can be formatted using various techniques, such as variable length coding (VLC) and arithmetic coding.
- the reconstruction path in FIG. 3 can be used to help ensure that both encoder 70 and a decoder 100 (described below with reference to FIG. 4 ) use the same reference frames to decode compressed bitstream 88 .
- the reconstruction path performs functions that are similar to functions that take place during the decoding process that are discussed in more detail below, including dequantizing the quantized transform coefficients at dequantization stage 80 and inverse transforming the dequantized transform coefficients at inverse transform stage 82 to produce a derivative residual block, referred to as a “derivative residual.”
- the prediction block that was predicted at intra/inter prediction stage 72 can be added to the derivative residual to create a reconstructed block.
- Loop filtering stage 86 can be applied to the reconstructed block to reduce distortion such as blocking artifacts.
- encoder 70 can be used to encode compressed bitstream 88 .
- a non-transform based encoder 70 can quantize the residual signal directly without transform stage 74 .
- an encoder 70 may have quantization stage 76 and dequantization stage 80 combined into a single stage.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of decoder 100 in accordance with an implementation of this disclosure.
- decoder 100 can be implemented in receiving station 30 .
- Decoder 100 includes in one example the following stages to perform various functions to produce an output video stream 116 from compressed bitstream 88 : an entropy decoding stage 102 , a dequantization stage 104 , an inverse transform stage 106 , an intra/inter prediction stage 108 , a reconstruction stage 110 , a loop filtering stage 112 and a deblocking filtering stage 114 .
- Other structural variations of decoder 100 can be used to decode compressed bitstream 88 .
- the data elements within compressed bitstream 88 can be decoded by entropy decoding stage 102 to produce a set of quantized transform coefficients.
- Dequantization stage 104 dequantizes the quantized transform coefficients, and inverse transform stage 106 inverse transforms the dequantized transform coefficients to produce a derivative residual that can be identical to that created by inverse transform stage 82 in encoder 70 .
- decoder 100 can use the intra/inter prediction stage 108 to create the same prediction block as was created in encoder 70 .
- the prediction block can be added to the derivative residual to create a reconstructed block.
- Loop filtering stage 112 can be applied to the reconstructed block to reduce blocking artifacts.
- Deblocking filtering stage 114 can be applied to the reconstructed block to reduce blocking distortion, and the result is output as output video stream 116 .
- decoder 100 can be used to decode compressed bitstream 88 .
- decoder 100 can produce output video stream 116 without deblocking filtering stage 114 .
- Blocks are conventionally formed and processed in raster scan order, meaning that a block is formed from the upper left corner of the image by, for example, sixty-four pixels in an 8 ⁇ 8 window starting at the upper left corner of the image.
- the next block is formed by 64 pixels in an 8 ⁇ 8 window located by stepping over eight pixels in the horizontal direction and so forth.
- the next row of blocks is formed by stepping down eight pixels in the vertical direction starting from the upper left corner of the image and then proceeding in the horizontal direction as described above.
- Each row of blocks is formed in a like manner.
- raster scan block schemes do not provide a mechanism to dynamically change error correction/bit rate tradeoffs to provide increased protection for particular regions in a frame.
- This disclosure provides improved image encoding and decoding with dynamic error correction by altering the order in which image blocks are processed and transmitted.
- the most important part of the image frame is the central portion, with the outer edges typically containing less interesting image data.
- An example of this would be images from a video conferencing system, where the images are principally pictures of faces occupying the central portion of the image.
- the residual quantization and coding process starts from the blocks at the center of the image rather than the top-left corner of the image. The subsequent blocks are scanned in a spiral manner. This way, the image quality degradation due to bit budget is applied to the outer part of the image so as to create a visually more pleasant image.
- This approach optionally allows more bit budget to be distributed to the center section of image without concern for the potential image quality problems later.
- designating blocks in this way can allow different levels of error protection to be applied to different parts of the frame.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing processing operations according to an implementation.
- the processing of FIG. 5 is performed by encoder 70 in this implementation and starts by dividing a frame 56 into one or more sections in step 120 .
- intra/inter prediction stage 72 may divide frame 56 into blocks 58 , and then divide/sort blocks 58 into one or more sections for subsequent processing.
- step 120 divides frame 56 by forming a central square section and, if needed, outer sections.
- FIG. 6 is a diagram showing an image frame 56 divided according to the processing of FIG. 5 .
- Frame 56 includes an array of pixels that are formed into 16 ⁇ 9 blocks.
- the pixel array ranges in size from 160 to 1920 pixels along one dimension and from 120 to 960 pixels along the other dimension, while the blocks 58 each includes 16 ⁇ 16 pixels. Smaller or larger arrays and blocks 58 are possible.
- M is equal to 16 and N is equal to 9, so three columns are stripped from the left-most columns to form a first outer or left side section 130 , four columns are striped from the right-most columns to form a second outer or right side section 132 , and the remaining N ⁇ N blocks for a central section 134 .
- a frame may be taller than it is wide and therefore first outer section 130 and second outer section 132 may be respectively at the top and bottom of central section 134 .
- outer sections 130 , 132 are further split into two or more sections each.
- step 122 central section 134 is processed by scanning in a spiral fashion to form an orderly stream of blocks to be encoded.
- the scan starts from the center-most macroblock and proceeds along either a clockwise or a counter-clockwise path.
- N ⁇ N macroblock array index of central portion 134 proceeds from 0 to N ⁇ 1, where (0,0) represents the block at the top-left corner while (N ⁇ 1, N ⁇ 1) represents the block at the bottom-right corner, then the starting macroblock index is calculated by (N/2, (N ⁇ 1)/2), where the division is an integer operation with truncation.
- the scan order can be represented by: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).
- This scan ends at the bottom-right corner.
- the scan order can be represented by (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0).
- This scan ends at the top-left corner.
- the end-point will be the bottom-right corner if N is an odd number, while the end-point will be top-left corner if N is an even number.
- Alternative implementations may include modified spiral scans such as combining a clockwise scan with counter-clockwise scan in the same frame.
- a different starting point rather than a center point at (N/2, (N ⁇ 1)/2) could be selected as long as it is substantially near the center point. Whether the starting point is substantially near the center point could depend on the value of N where larger values of N would better tolerate starting further from the center point.
- the blocks so selected can be encoded as described with respect to the operation of encoder 70 .
- processing advances to step 124 to determine whether frame 56 is square.
- the routine of FIG. 5 then ends. If frame 56 is not square, processing advances to step 126 to process the outer sections before ending the routine of FIG. 5 .
- Some processes can occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other processes from what is depicted and described above. For example, in one implementation, the determination of whether frame 56 is square could be made after dividing frame 56 into blocks but before dividing frame 56 into a central section and outer sections.
- the left strip is scanned and coded first. If the left strip contains multiple macroblock columns, the scanning can start from the inner column first, connecting the last macroblock of the last scanned macroblock in the N ⁇ N central section of the frame. After the left columns are scanned and coded, the columns of macroblocks in the right strip are scanned and coded.
- the start point of the right strip scan can start from its left-most column, from the top to the bottom, and then can proceed from the next column on the right, from bottom to top. This process is repeated until all the macroblocks are scanned and coded.
- the right strip may be scanned first where the spiral scan is a clockwise scan.
- the right strip is scanned and coded first when the scan order is counter-clockwise or the left strip is scanned and coded first when the scan order is clockwise.
- the blocks of the outer strips, whether located on the left and right or the top and bottom can be scanned and coded in different orders after processing the central section.
- the edge strips are scanned from top to bottom from columns closer to the central section to columns closer to the outer edges of the image frame where it is assumed M>N, but other scan patterns are possible.
- the scan could occur from bottom-to-top for the first column and then from top-to-bottom for the next column and so on.
- the scan could occur along each column from top-to-bottom or from bottom-to-top for all blocks of a strip.
- scanning could proceed in like patterns using left-to-right and/or right-to-left scanning of rows.
- Left-to-right and/or right-to-left scanning patterns of rows starting with rows closest to the central section is also an example.
- scanning the columns of top and bottom outer sections in top-to-bottom and/or bottom-to-top patterns is also possible.
- the blocks so selected can be processed in step 126 by being encoded as described with respect to the operation of encoder 70 .
- FIG. 7 is a diagram showing image frame 56 of FIG. 6 with blocks labeled in the order in those blocks are selected for encoding according to an implementation.
- Spiral processing begins with selecting a block in the middle of central section 134 , marked with a “1” in FIG. 7 .
- the next block to be encoded is adjacent to the first block and is marked with a “2”.
- the processing proceeds encoding blocks in a spiral, denoted in FIG. 7 by the numbers on the blocks. As can be seen in FIG. 7 , spiral processing is able to continue until block “81” is reached, exhausting the blocks available in central section 134 . Processing then continues with left side section 130 at block “82”.
- blocks are emitted by traveling down columns from right to left until left side section 130 is exhausted at block “108”. Processing then continues with right side section 132 , beginning at block marked “109” and continuing until the last block “144” is selected and emitted for encoding and subsequent transmission.
- code words can be added in a header to indicate the different scan methods. That is, implementations can indicate to the encoding process whether or not a particular video stream or frame should be encoded using spiral scan or another scan order by keywords or a code embedded in the header for the stream or frame. This code can also be transmitted or stored along with the video stream or frame to indicate to the decoder that a spiral scan or other scan order was used in encoding and/or is to be used in decoding the video stream or frame.
- Selecting image blocks to be encoded and transmitted in a spiral scan order beginning at or near the center of the image frame can facilitate image blocks containing the most important image information can be transmitted first.
- This spiral scan order can be utilized but not necessarily exclusively utilized for quantization control for the residual signals in quantization stage 76 .
- transform coefficients obtained from transform stage 74 are converted into discrete quantum values by application of quantization levels in quantization stage 76 .
- the discrete quantum values may be referred to as quantized transform coefficients.
- the bits allowed for each of these conversions can be controlled by the position of the block in the stream so as to provide more resolution to blocks earlier in the stream and less to those later in the stream.
- a conventional partition technique can be used to code motion vectors and mode.
- a code may also be added to distinguish the different scan approaches for the motion vectors and for the quantization. This code can also be transmitted or stored along with the video stream or frame to indicate to the decoder which of the different scan approaches for the motion vectors, quantization, and the like are to be used in decoding the video stream or frame.
- spiral macroblock scan order described herein can also be applied to a slice or a segment of an image.
- scan pattern can be extended to different regions of an image to apply different error protection levels in accordance with the teachings herein.
- a compressed bitstream including the encoded residuals for the blocks transmitted in the scan order can include, as described above by example, codes indicating the scan order and the partitioning for generating motion vectors and other data used to decode the blocks.
- the data elements within the bitstream can be decoded to produce a set of quantized transform coefficients.
- the quantized transform coefficients are dequantized then inverse transformed to produce a derivative residual that can be identical to that created by inverse transform stage 82 in encoder 70 .
- Header information decoded from the bitstream allows the decoder to create or select the same prediction block as was used in encoder 70 to generate the residual.
- the prediction block is then added to the residual to create a reconstructed block.
- FIG. 8 shows a further aspect of this disclosure.
- FIG. 8 is a flowchart showing encoding with selective error protection according to an implementation.
- the processing of an exemplary frame is discussed, and it may be repeated as needed for all desired frames in the current video sequence or stream.
- the processing is described in the context of the hardware and software components of FIGS. 1 and 3 .
- the processing can be performed by CPU 14 and at least portions of encoder 70 coupled to or within CPU 14 .
- blocks of an image are identified and selected, and then encoding blocks occurs in step 142 .
- CPU 14 identifies and selects blocks according to the spiral scan technique described in detail with respect to FIGS. 5-7 .
- step 140 selects a first block substantially central to a frame, and then selects a second block adjacent to the first block, and then selects subsequent blocks adjacent to a previously selected block in a spiral manner until contiguous blocks of at least a central section of the frame are selected and encoded.
- the central section may include any desired region, such as a rectangle, of the current frame.
- a representative frame 56 is discussed and illustrated in FIGS. 2 , 6 and 7 .
- the central section is fixed so it does not change from frame to frame.
- the extent of the central section may adjust over time according to user input, data transmission speed, occurrence of data transmission errors, predetermined schedule or pattern, or other factors.
- step 142 CPU 14 encodes the identified blocks in an order in which they were selected. Hence, encoding occurs for the central section first and then proceeds to the remainder of the frame. This operation may be carried out according to the encoding techniques explained in detail above. Encoding may further include the application of motion search and/or motion compensation processes. As a further enhancement, motion search and/or motion compensation may be performed selectively. As an example, for encoded blocks within the central section, step 142 may be performed using motion search and/or motion compensation based on data from blocks only within the central section. For blocks outside the central section, step 142 in this example is performed using motion search and/or motion compensation based on data from blocks inside and outside the central section.
- the motion compensation process can in some cases have greater error resiliency for the inner part of the image while having greater coding efficiency for the outer part of the image. This can be achieved by allowing the image data in the outer part of the image to use the inner part of the image for motion search and motion compensation, while not allowing the image data in the inner part of the image to use the outer part of the image for motion search and motion compensation. This can help to prevent errors in the outer region from spreading into the inner region.
- the motion vectors of the macroblocks within the central region are not permitted to go out of the boundary of that region. In this case, correct receipt of the bitstream containing only this region is decodable without the receipt of the other regions. In this example, the outer and likely less important regions will be able to use all the regions for prediction. Therefore, outside the central section, there is no restriction on the motion search region and motion vector range in this implementation. In some cases, this may be an advantage compared to a slice based approach where all slices are treated equally for motion search, motion vectors and other information. Due to the spiral scan, the center section of macroblocks are scanned and coded before the outer section(s) of macroblocks.
- examples of error protection can be utilized depending upon the needs of the available computing resources and other details of the specific application at hand.
- the error protection scheme is coded into the programming of transmitting station 12 .
- the user of transmitting station 12 selects from various error protection schemes programmed into transmitting station 12 .
- the processing of FIG. 8 and/or FIG. 9 negotiates the selection error protection scheme.
- Step 144 implements error protection using the encoder, such as encoder 70 , in the form of forward error correction (FEC) in this example.
- Step 154 implements error protection using the encoder in combination with signaling received from a decoder, such as decoder 100 , in the form of retransmission of lost data in this example.
- the processing may be carried out using one or both of steps 144 and 154 . Additionally, either step is optional.
- Step 144 includes steps 146 , 148 and 150 . These steps can be performed for each block as it is encoded by step 142 , after all blocks have been encoded or any other arrangement that is suitable considering the teachings of this disclosure and the application at hand.
- Step 146 considers a given block or group of blocks or all blocks, and asks whether the block or blocks reside within the designated central section of the current frame.
- the encoder applies a first level of error protection in step 148 . Otherwise, a second level of error protection is applied in step 150 .
- the first and second levels of error protection there are various examples of the first and second levels of error protection.
- the first level of error protection is forward error correction (FEC)
- the second level of error protection is no error protection.
- the first level of error protection is forward error correction (FEC) applied to a first ratio or percentage of encoded blocks
- the second level of error protection includes forward error correction (FEC) applied to a second ratio or percentage of encoded blocks, where the first ratio is greater than the second ratio.
- FEC forward error correction
- forward error correction may be applied to fifty percent of the encoded blocks within the central section and applied to twenty five percent of encoded blocks outside the central section, if any. Further examples of the first and second levels of error protection may be apparent to ordinarily skilled artisans having the benefit of this disclosure.
- step 152 CPU 14 transmits the encoded and optionally error protected bitstream.
- the protection of optional step 154 uses input from a source external to the encoder in order to implement different levels of error protection.
- Step 154 includes steps 156 , 158 , 160 and 162 . These steps may be performed for each lost block, either individually or in a group along with other lost blocks.
- the further operations starting at step 154 are described in context of loss of a single data packet, where a data packet is a portion of the information needed to recreate one or more blocks, for ease of illustration.
- Step 154 starts with a query as to whether any data was lost in the transmission of step 152 .
- lost data in the form of a data packet may be indicated by a signal from receiving station 30 by an identification code of the packet (called “packet ID” hereinafter).
- Packet ID an identification code of the packet
- Lost data can encompass data that is lost in its entirety or is corrupted in part or in its entirety, for example. If there is no lost data in response to the query of step 154 , processing of the current frame is completed.
- Encoder 70 does not need to query decoder 100 as to whether data has been lost. For example, decoder 100 can transmit a signal that data was lost or corrupted upon occurrence that the encoder 70 can check as needed.
- step 158 In the event of lost data, processing advances to step 158 .
- the query in step 158 asks whether the data is associated with a block residing within in interesting region of the frame (e.g. the central section of the frame). If so, error correction is applied using a first level of error protection in step 160 . Otherwise, if the block resides outside the central section, error correction is applied using a second level of error protection in step 162 .
- the first level of error protection includes retransmitting the lost data packet from transmitting station 12 responsive to a request for retransmission from receiving station 30 .
- applying the second level of error protection can, in some cases, involve avoiding any retransmission of lost data.
- lost data is only retransmitted if it corresponds to the area of interest in the frame.
- step 154 when performed, can involve waiting for an input signal before taking action and can be continuously repeated until all frames a video stream are transmitted with a delay to await any possible signals indicating lost data from the last frame.
- a query is performed to determine if the data lost is related to blocks in the central section in step 158 .
- This query can, however, be omitted in certain implementations.
- the signal indicating lost data could include both the packet ID and a bit indicating its status as being in the central section or not.
- the signal for data loss could be sent to transmitting station 12 only when the first level of protection should be applied. In this way, steps 158 and 162 would be omitted.
- a block in the central section has a first level of protection applied to the related data in the form of forward error correction (FEC) at the encoder 70 in step 148 while the second level of protection is no protection in step 150 (e.g., FEC is not applied). Then, if data related to other than the central section is lost, the second level of protection is used in step 162 .
- the first level of protection used in step 160 can be no protection in this example. The opposite could also occur.
- additional steps could be added so that both steps 144 and 154 could occur depending on the severity of the loss (e.g., the number of lost packets, the content of a lost packet, etc.).
- FIG. 9 is a flowchart showing decoding with selective error protection according to an implementation.
- FIG. 9 illustrates the processing of an exemplary frame, and may be repeated as needed for all desired frames in the current video sequence or stream.
- the operations 900 are described in the context of the hardware and software components of FIGS. 1 and 4 .
- the processing can be performed by CPU 32 and at least portions of decoder 100 coupled to or within CPU 32 .
- receiving station 30 receives, or begins to receive, the video stream transmitted by transmitting station 12 .
- Decoder 100 begins to decode the blocks of the received stream in step 172 .
- This operation may be carried out according to the decoding techniques explained in detail above.
- the decoding operation is conducted with reference to the specific order in which macroblocks were scanned, namely, the spiral scanning technique described above.
- decoding may further include selectively conducting motion search and/or motion compensation. Further, one or both of these may be limited to blocks within the central section.
- decoder 100 queries as to whether the received video stream is missing any data from the transmitted video stream. Data may be deemed lost because it is missing or incomplete, because it contains errors preventing proper decoding, or because other flaws are evident. Lost or corrupt data can be identified by comparing received packet IDs, for example, to determine if there are missing packets, or by checking the size or content of a received packet. If there is no lost data, the processing of the current frame ends.
- steps 176 - 180 are discussed in the context of loss of a single data packet, where a data packet is a portion of the information needed to recreate one or more blocks.
- decoder 100 queries as to whether the lost data was associated with a block residing in the area of interest (e.g. the central section) based on, for example, a known frame size, the size (and hence the number) of blocks forming the frame, and the position of the block within the bitstream as compared to other blocks representing the frame.
- the information is encoded into the bitstream in headers associated with the appropriate packets.
- the lack of an FEC packet associated with packet-3 would indicate that the lost data is not associated with the central section.
- the nature and extent of one exemplary central section was described above. If the lost data is related to a block residing in the central section, then error correction based on a first level of error protection is applied at step 178 . Otherwise, error correction based on a second level of error protection is applied at step 180 .
- the first and second levels of error protection used in steps 178 and 180 can vary.
- decoder 100 applies error correction by re-creating a lost centrally-located block using forward error correction (FEC) packets as applied to some or all blocks in the video stream transmitted by transmitting station 12 , while omitting error correction entirely when the block is outside the central section.
- the error correction in step 178 re-creates a block using forward error correction (FEC) packets as generated by a given ratio of blocks in the video stream
- the error correction in step 180 re-creates a block using forward error correction (FEC) packets as generated by a lesser ratio of blocks in the video stream.
- FEC forward error correction
- the error correction in step 178 includes transmitting a signal to transmitting station 12 to retransmit the lost data packet, where the packet ID of the data packet is sent.
- the signal transmitted to can also include a bit or code indicating whether the lost data packet is associated with a block located in the central section.
- the error correction in step 180 can omit a request for retransmission in an example. In an example, retransmission is only performed in an implementation where transmitting station 12 does not apply any forward error correction. In a different example, retransmission is performed even where transmitting station 12 applies forward error correction depending on the data packet lost.
- Processing in FIG. 9 ends when an entire frame is received and decoded.
- FIGS. 8 and 9 were explained in the context of two levels of error protection, these techniques may be applied a greater number of error protection levels.
- this example may be useful in a video conference system or video streaming system.
- a bitstream of an image is divided into three different partitions.
- a first partition contains picture header, motion vectors, quantization information, and other high level information.
- the coding of this partition may be performed using any conventional methods, such as a video compression format where the motion vectors can be coded using predictions and variable length code, for example.
- the motion vector prediction may be performed using spiral scan, a conventional macroblock raster-scan, or another scan pattern.
- a second partition contains the residual coding of macroblocks from the center section of the frame using spiral scan, e.g., as produced by step 142 .
- a third partition contains the residual coding of macroblocks from the outer part of the image using spiral scan, as produced by step 142 .
- an encoder such as encoder 70 , applies a first level of error protection to data associated with a central section of a frame in the form of forward error correction (e.g., at step 148 ) and applies a second level of error protection to the remainder of the frame by omitting forward error correction (e.g., at step 150 ).
- the bitstream such as encoded bitstream 88
- receiving station 30 e.g., in step 152
- transmitting station 12 protects the first and second partitions with forward error correction, e.g., in step 148 , but does not protect the third partition with any forward error correction, e.g., as per step 150 .
- a fifty percent forward error correction is applied to data of the first and second partitions.
- the original bitstreams of these partitions can be combined together, then divided into two different packets of equal length, referred to as packet-1 and packet-2.
- An FEC packet may be generated by an XOR operation of packet-1 and packet-2.
- Ordinarily skilled artisans, having the benefit of this disclosure, will be capable of applying different ratios to the FEC operations.
- a third packet, packet-3 contains the third partition.
- the encoder has total of four packets, namely, packet-1, packet-2, the FEC packet and packet-3.
- packet-1, packet-2, the FEC packet and packet-3 When receiving station 30 receives any two of packet-1, packet-2 and the FEC packet, then the center section of the image can be reconstructed with error protection.
- receiving station 30 correctly receives packet-1 and the FEC packet, while packet-2 and packet-3 are lost. This is equivalent to a fifty percent packet loss. From packet-1 and the FEC packet, receiving station 30 can recover packet-2 according to known techniques, e.g., in step 178 of FIG. 9 . Therefore, the central portion of the frame can be reconstructed without errors. The outer part of the frame can be reconstructed by using the motion vectors in the first partition. Since the residual bitstream of the outer part of the frame is lost, there will be reconstruction errors in the outer part of the frame after decoding when applying the second level of error protection, e.g., decoding without using an FEC packet at step 180 . However, if the outer part of the image has no large movement and the human eye is less sensitive to the outer part of the image, the resultant image can be acceptable.
- receiving station 30 correctly receives packet-2, the FEC packet and packet-3, but loses packet-1.
- application of the first level of error protection e.g., in step 178 , results in recovery of the data in packet-1 using packet-2 and the FEC packet. Since packet-3 was not lost, it is decoded in a conventional way by decoder 100 . As a result, the entire frame is reconstructed to produce the same image as if no data was lost.
- decoder 100 can signal for retransmission of a lost packet or not based on whether the missing packet refers to blocks in a particular section, e.g., the central section. Retransmission can occur either in place of or in addition to the protection described in these examples. In one example, retransmission could occur if packet-1 and packet-2 were lost by signalling encoder 70 to transmit one of the packets, while the other packet is recovered using the retransmitted packet and the FEC packet. Packet-3 could be conventionally decoded.
