- the terms “sensor,” “camera,” or “optical sensor” may be used interchangeably and may refer to device or devices (mono or stereo arrangements) configured to perform 3D image sensing, 3D depth sensing, 2D image sensing, 2D depth sensing (i.e., 2D image and corresponding depth map), machine-readable code scanning, and/or other types of sensing of a physical environment of the device.
- machine-readable code and “machine-readable information” may be used interchangeably to refer to barcodes, text strings recognizable by optical character recognition (OCR) methods, or other machine-readable information.
- OCR optical character recognition
- barcode text strings recognizable by optical character recognition
- text or variations thereof may be used as examples of machine-readable information, and such terms may be interchangeable as well.
- machine-readable information may include one-dimensional (1D) barcodes, 2D barcodes (e.g., QR codes), and/or other types of barcodes.
- machine-readable code may take the form information encoded in a message or image included on a physical object, and sensors described herein may be configured to decode such messages or images so as to extract the encoded information.
- Other examples of machine-readable information are possible as well.
- robot manipulator may be used to describe one or more robotic devices, such as a robotic arm, configured to grab, move, or otherwise manipulate physical objects, such as boxes.
- a robot may grab, manipulate, and move packages (e.g., boxes). For instance, a robot may load/unload packages into/from a truck, load/unload packages onto/from a pallet, or otherwise manage the packages, such as determining locations for the packages to be placed in storage or during processing.
- packages e.g., boxes
- a system configured to implement these scanning methods may not assume human feedback to verify the correct code or text orientation of machine-readable information, nor may it assume nicely aligned packages on a conveyor belt or part of some other apparatus that may be used to quickly and efficiently scan the packages (e.g., a “scanning station”). Instead, the system may use 2D or 3D sensors to identify the orientation and scale to search surfaces for machine-readable codes or text in a given environment that the sensors are viewing.
- An example system may comprise a robotic device, such as a robotic arm, and one or more optical sensors, such as 2D or 3D sensors.
- the robotic arm may be configured to move a physical object through a designated area in space of a physical environment of the system.
- the one or more optical sensors may be configured to determine a location of a machine-readable code on the physical object as the physical object is moved through the designated area in space and, based on the determined location of the machine-readable code, scan the machine-readable code as the physical object is moved through the designated area in space so as to determine information associated with the physical object encoded in the machine-readable code. Then, based on information associated with the physical object encoded in the machine-readable code, the system may determine a respective location in the physical environment at which to place the physical object.
- the information/data encoded in the machine-readable code and associated with the physical object may include the object's size, the object's weight, an identifier as to whether the physical object is to be loaded, unloaded, or put aside, and/or an identifier of a specific location in the physical environment at which to load, unload, or otherwise move the physical object.
- Other information associated with the objects or the robotic device may be encoded in the machine-readable code as well. Such information may enable a robotic device/system to scan the physical object and move it to its desired location in a quick, efficient manner.

- the robotic arm may bring a box through a reading station after or while orienting the box in a certain manner, such as in a manner in order to place the machine-readable code in a position in space where it can be easily viewed and scanned by a camera.
- multiple cameras may be positioned surrounding a designated space such that the robotic arm carrying a physical object will not collide with the cameras.
- the cameras may be configured to all focus on a “sweet spot” for machine-readable code reading in space where barcodes, text, etc. would be sharply in focus when the robotic arm swings the physical objects through the designated space.
- the system's knowledge of where the robotic arm is and capability to time the cameras may ensure that high-quality pictures of the physical object are captured, so as to facilitate quick and accurate scanning.
- the use of depth cameras in such a configuration may help ensure that the system accounts for surface orientations.
- boxes or objects may be automatically organized and placed onto pallets.
- automating the process of loading/unloading trucks and/or the process of creating pallets from objects for easier storage and transport may provide a number of industrial and business advantages.
- automating the process of loading/unloading trucks and/or the process of creating pallets may include the incorporation of one or more robotic devices to move objects or perform other functions.
- a robotic device can be made mobile by coupling with a wheeled base, a holonomic base (e.g., a base that can move in any direction), or rails on the ceiling, walls or floors.
- the base can be an elevated base.
- a system including one or more sensors, one or more computers, and one or more robotic arms.
- the sensors may scan an environment containing one or more objects in order to capture visual data and/or three-dimensional (3D) depth information. Data from the scans may then be integrated into a representation of larger areas in order to provide digital environment reconstruction.
- the reconstructed environment may then be used for identifying objects to pick up, determining pick positions for objects, and/or planning collision-free trajectories for the one or more robotic arms and/or a mobile base.
- boxes will refer to any object or item that can be placed onto a pallet or loaded onto or unloaded from a truck or container.

- the robotic manipulator may be mounted on a different type of movable apparatus or may not be mounted on a movable base at all.
- the robotic manipulator may be mounted at a fixed position within a factory setting.

- FIG. 1B is a functional block diagram illustrating a robotic device 100 , according to an example embodiment.
- the robotic device 100 could include various subsystems such as a mechanical system 120 , a sensing system 130 , a control system 140 , as well as a power supply 150 .
- the robotic device 100 may include more or fewer subsystems and each subsystem could include multiple elements. Further, each of the subsystems and elements of robotic device 100 could be interconnected. Thus, one or more of the described functions of the robotic device 100 may be divided up into additional functional or physical components, or combined into fewer functional or physical components. In some further examples, additional functional and/or physical components may be added to the examples illustrated by FIGS. 1A and 1B .
- the mechanical system 120 may include components described above with respect to FIG. 1A , including a robotic arm 102 , a gripper 104 , a conveyer belt 110 , a (movable or holonomic) cart 112 , and one or more wheels 114 .
- the mechanical system 120 may additionally include a motor 122 , which may be an electric motor powered by electrical power, or may be powered by a number of different energy sources, such as a gas-based fuel or solar power. Additionally, motor 122 may be configured to receive power from power supply 150 .
- the power supply 150 may provide power to various components of robotic device 100 and could represent, for example, a rechargeable lithium-ion or lead-acid battery. In an example embodiment, one or more banks of such batteries could be configured to provide electrical power. Other power supply materials and types are also possible.
- the sensing system 130 may use one or more sensors attached to a robotic arm 102 , such as sensor 106 and sensor 108 , which may be 2D sensors and/or 3D depth sensors that sense information about the environment as the robotic arm 102 moves.
- the sensing system may determine information about the environment that can be used by control system 140 (e.g., a computer running motion planning software) to pick and move boxes efficiently.
- the control system 140 could be located on the device or could be in remote communication with the device.
- scans from one or more 2D or 3D sensors with fixed mounts on a mobile base such as a front navigation sensor 116 and a rear navigation sensor 118 , and one or more sensors mounted on a robotic arm, such as sensor 106 and sensor 108 , may be integrated to build up a digital model of the environment, including the sides, floor, ceiling, and/or front wall of a truck or other container.
- the control system 140 may cause the mobile base to navigate into a position for unloading or loading.
- planar surface information may be extracted from 3D sensors to model walls, floor and/or box faces. After modeling the floor, projection of objects onto the floor plane may enable segmentation of obstacles and/or target objects such as boxes.
- Floor-plane projection can also be used to model the corrugated sides of a container or truck, which may not be accurately modeled as planes.
- sidewall angles, floor plane roll and pitch, and/or distance from side walls can be used to maneuver a mobile base into a container without collisions.
- Use of extended 3D information rather than a single line scan may help make the extraction of navigation information robust.
- the side walls may have a vertical extent that is captured by the 3D sensor. Scanning systems that use a single line of depth information may be slower if they scan vertically and/or less robust because they acquire less information.
- front plane modeling can determine the distance to a next group of objects to pick in truck unloading.
- the robotic arm 102 may be equipped with a gripper 104 , such as a digital suction grid gripper.
- the gripper may include one or more suction valves that can be turned on or off either by remote sensing, or single point distance measurement and/or by detecting whether suction is achieved.
- the digital suction grid gripper may include an articulated extension.
- the potential to actuate suction grippers with rheological fluids or powders may enable extra gripping on objects with high curvatures.
- the gripper could potentially span several boxes or objects and turn on suction for some or all of the covered objects.
- the suction or adhesion devices may be a “digital” grid so that the robotic device can turn on any number of the suction devices as will fit boxes sensed for grabbing.
- the system may notice a seam in the boxes (separation between adjacent boxes) such that suckers can be activated on both sides of the seam to pick up both boxes at once, thereby doubling the throughput.
- the suckers can sense after a certain amount time whether they can successfully grip a surface, after which they may automatically shut off.
- sections of the suckers can fold down to grasp the top of the boxes. For instance, grippers can initially start at full extension and then conform to the surface being gripped.
- the robotic arm can implement a wiggle movement to improve a suction grip.
- the robotic arm can wiggle a box side to side to help segment the box from its surroundings.
- the arm can wiggle upon pick up of the box to avoid jostling other objects.
- the robotic arm may employ a wiggle motion in order to make a firm seal against the object.
- the robotic arm may wiggle the object as the robotic arm is picking up the object so that the box can more gently break friction or overlap contact with other items. This may help avoid a situation where pulling the object up too directly or too quickly causes other items to be tossed into the air.
- cardboard boxes can have concave, convex or otherwise rumpled faces that make it hard for a suction device to adhere to.
- wiggling the suction device as the device makes suction contact may enable a more reliable grip on cardboard boxes and other non-planar objects.
- a few center suction devices can be turned on and the arm can wiggle back and forth as it starts to pull the box out. This may break surface adhesion with other boxes and help to start to pull the box out. Once the box is at least partially pulled out, the box may then be segmented from the other boxes more easily.
- wiggling while picking up an object in clutter may remove other objects from the picked up object, thereby preventing unwanted pick up of surrounding objects.
- segmentation of items may be necessary for successful grasping.
- a smooth surface patch may belong to two separate objects.
- manipulator interaction with the objects may be used to perturb the scene to better segment the objects from each other.
- the natural or forced movement of objects on a conveyor, on a slide, moving in a tote, and/or actively jostled within a tote may be tracked by optical flow, parallax, or time delayed views to calculate stereo depth in order to enhance object segmentation.
- one or more of the sensors used by a sensing system may be a RGBaD (RGB+active Depth) color or monochrome camera registered to a depth sensing device that uses active vision techniques such as projecting a pattern into a scene to enable depth triangulation between the camera or cameras and the known offset pattern projector.
- RGBaD RGB+active Depth
- This type of sensor data may help enable robust segmentation.
- cues such as barcodes, texture coherence, color, 3D surface properties, or printed text on the surface may also be used to identify an object and/or find its pose in order to know where and/or how to place the object (e.g., fitting the object into a fixture receptacle).
- shadow or texture differences may be employed to segment objects as well.
- Control system 140 may include at least one processor 142 (which could include at least one microprocessor) that executes instructions 144 stored in a non-transitory computer readable medium, such as the memory 146 .
- the control system 140 may also represent a plurality of computing devices that may serve to control individual components or subsystems of the robotic device 100 in a distributed fashion.
- memory 146 may contain instructions 144 (e.g., program logic) executable by the processor 142 to execute various functions of robotic device 100 , including those described above in connection with FIGS. 1A-1B .
- Memory 146 may contain additional instructions as well, including instructions to transmit data to, receive data from, interact with, and/or control one or more of the mechanical system 120 , the sensor system 130 , and/or the control system 140 .
- a perception guided robot may utilize a combination of perception together with planning to guide the robot arm to pick up a box and place it where it needs to go.
- FIG. 2A illustrates part of the robotic device from FIG. 1A with a stack of boxes, according to an example embodiment.
- the robotic device may include a robotic arm 102 with a gripping component 104 , sensors 106 and 108 , and conveyer 110 as described above.
- the robotic device could be mounted on a holonomic cart as described with respect to FIG. 1A , could be mounted on a different type of movable apparatus, could be mounted on rails or tracks, or could be stationary.
- the robotic device may be controlled to pick boxes from a stack of boxes 220 containing a heterogeneous mix of shapes and sizes of boxes.
- a virtual environment including a model of the objects in 2D and/or 3D may be determined and used to develop a plan or strategy for picking up the boxes.
- the robot may use one or more sensors to scan an environment containing objects, as shown in FIG. 2B .
- a sensor 106 on the arm may capture sensor data about the stack of boxes 220 in order to determine shapes and/or positions of individual boxes.
- a larger picture of a 3D environment may be built up by integrating information from individual (e.g., 3D) scans. Sensors performing these scans may be placed in fixed positions, on a robotic arm, and/or in other locations. According to various embodiments, scans may be constructed and used in accordance with any or all of a number of different techniques.
- scans can be made by moving a robotic arm upon which one or more 3D sensors are mounted. Feedback from the arm position may provide pose information about where the sensor is positioned and may be used to help with the integration. Alternately, or additionally, scans may be made using one or more 2D sensors, for instance by leveraging motion and tracking key points in the environment. In further examples, scans may be from fixed-mount cameras that have fields of view (FOVs) covering a given field. In additional examples, scans may be visually registered to help with fine pose estimation, potentially giving better integration results.
- FOVs fields of view
- a virtual environment may be built up using a 3D volumetric or surface model to integrate information (e.g., from different sensors). This may allow the system to operate within a larger environment, such as in cases where one sensor may be insufficient to cover a large environment. Such techniques may also increase the level of detail captured, which may help the robotic device perform various tasks. In particular, integrating information can yield finer detail than from a single scan alone (e.g., by bringing down noise levels). This may make possible better object detection, surface picking, or other applications.
- wide-angle environment reconstruction may be performed by sensing an environment and extracting that information into a simplified geometric model of simple mathematical 3D geometric forms (e.g., planes, cylinders, cones, hemispheres, etc.).
- a simplified geometric model of simple mathematical 3D geometric forms e.g., planes, cylinders, cones, hemispheres, etc.
- such techniques may make motion planning easier and/or may make violation of the models (e.g., collisions) easier to detect.
- such techniques may allow a parametric description to extend the environment. For instance, the ground may be treated as a plane that extends behind objects that occlude it.
- planes or other mathematical surfaces in the environment may be extracted in 3D. These known “ideal” surface detections may be combined into a more accurate model of the environment. For instance, planes may be used to determine the full extents of walls (or mathematical description thereof) and other obstacles to avoid collisions and detect where objects of interest are. Also, mathematical representations of objects may be used to look for anomalies such as when person enters into an environment. Such events may violate the ideal model, which may make their detection easier.
- certain objects such as boxes may have simple planar form.
- a metal may have a geometric form of a cylinder and a tire may have a geometric form of a torus.
- Example systems may leverage this trait of certain objects in order model them and/or determine how to motion plan for the objects.
- known templates of certain shapes can be used to refine detected features of objects within the environment that appear to match a particular shape.
- 2D and 3D information may be represented at least in part via one or more facades.
- a facade may be defined as a near-planar construct containing a set of objects, represented as a depth map (e.g., a 2D map of distances as the third dimension). Examples of facades may include the wall of boxes in a truck, the top of a pallet stack containing boxes or other objects, or the top of a bin of jumbled objects.
- a facade may be constructed from boxes, for instance to plan in what order the boxes should be picked up.
- box 222 may be identified by the robotic device as the next box to pick up.
- Box 222 may be identified within a facade representing a front wall of the stack of boxes 220 constructed based on sensor data collected by one or more sensors, such as sensor 106 and 108 .
- a control system may then determine that box 222 is the next box to pick, possibly based on its shape and size, its position on top of the stack of boxes 220 , and/or based on characteristics of a target container or location for the boxes.
- the robotic arm 102 may then be controlled to pick up the box 222 using gripper 104 and place the box 222 onto the conveyer belt 110 (e.g., to transport box 222 into a storage area).
- a facade may be represented as an orthographic projection of 3D surface information. This representation may allow for parsing the facade to determine interesting areas for a particular application. For example, in truck unloading, the upper left corner of the next box to pick may be determined based on a facade representation.
- an orthographic projection of integrated 3D environment may be determined to give a wide-FOV, easily-parsed representation for performing application-related tasks. One such task may be finding the corner or corners (e.g., top left) of a box to pick. Another such task may involve finding good surfaces (e.g., relatively flat and large) for picking objects out of a bin.
- a 3D model of a stack of boxes may be constructed and used as a model to help plan and track progress for loading/unloading boxes to/from a stack or pallet. Any one actual camera view of the facade may suffer from point of view occlusions and perspective distortion. Accordingly, multiple RGBD views via robot arm movements and/or different views from a cart base or fixed locations may be combined to create a single facade of the boxes to be picked.
- the 3D model may be used for collision avoidance.
- planning a collision-free trajectory may involve determining the 3D location of objects and surfaces in the environment.
- a trajectory optimizer may make use of the 3D information provided by environment reconstruction to optimize paths in the presence of obstacles.
- the optimizer may work in real time and may accept many kinds of constraints. As an example of such a constraint, the optimizer may attempt to keep the end effector level throughout the trajectory.
- an environment may be captured as a mesh or set of 3D points.
- a robot arm may be represented as a convex hull of plane segments for quick collision checking. Constant or frequent updating of the environment may allow the robot arm to quickly respond to changes.
- an optimizer may perform frequent continuous collision checking throughout its path.
- An optimizer may accept arbitrary constraints in the form of costs, such as to keep a certain distance away from objects or to approach a goal position from a given angle. Additionally, an optimizer may avoid robot fault conditions by working in joint space, keeping track of windup and choosing goal positions from among multiple inverse kinematics solutions.
- One strategy for motion planning may involve looking ahead several moves to see if the chosen goal joint position will be acceptable for the next move.
- path constraints such as collision avoidance for robotic arms, cameras, cables, and/or other components
- path constraints may be put in a constraint based planning solver and solved for to yield a best path to move the arm for perception.
- the solver may determine a best path for picking up, moving, and placing an object.
- 3D and/or visual sensors may be calibrated to determine their pose with respect to the workspace.
- the calibration may determine their fixed pose in the workspace.
- calibration may determine the offset pose of the sensor from the arm link to which it is attached.
- calibration techniques may allow for the calibration of an arbitrary number of sensors in the workspace. Calibration may involve determining some or all of a variety of parameters and coefficients. For example, calibration may solve for one or more intrinsic parameters such as focal length and image center. As another example, calibration may determine one or more distortion coefficients such as models of radial and tangential distortion. As yet another example, calibration may solve for one or more extrinsic parameters, where the object is in a scene relative to a pattern or other sensors that identified the same pattern in a scene.
- calibration may be performed at least in part by using a calibration pattern, which may be a known set of features in 2D or 3D. For instance, a known pattern of dots may be used, where the distance between each dot and the other dots is known. Calibration may be performed at least in part by collecting multiple different views of an object. In further examples, capturing multiple views of a calibration pattern in different positions may allow for (1) calibration of the one or more coefficients of the camera and/or (2) knowledge of where the camera is relative to the coordinate system established by where the calibration pattern was fixed. In particular embodiments, a camera in the scene may identify a calibration pattern on the robot arm while a camera on the arm identifies a calibration pattern in the scene simultaneously.
- calibration may involve a camera fixed in a scene.
- a calibration pattern may be placed on a robotic arm.
- the robotic arm may be configured to move through the scene as multiple views of the calibration pattern on the robotic arm are collected. This may help to calibrate the camera and/or be useful for relating the coordinate system of the camera to that of the robot. Further, the relation of each device to the other can be determined by each device as the robotic arm moves.
- calibration may involve a camera located on a robotic arm.
- a calibration pattern may be mounted on a wall or table. Then, the camera may be moved around, collecting multiple views of the calibration pattern from different robot or robotic arm positions. When different 3D or 2D views (e.g., 2, 20, 200, etc.) are collected, these views can be used to solve for the calibration relationships.
- the system can determine where it is relative to the coordinate system set based on the location of the calibration pattern in the scene.
- both the calibration pattern and the camera may be movable.
- the calibration pattern may be located on a conveyor belt where the robotic arm may be configured to place boxes. After calibration, the system may determine where the camera was relative to that spot on the conveyor belt.
- nonlinear optimization may be performed in a two-stage process for robust estimation of 3D sensor calibration.
- an initialization may be derived from the relative pose offsets of the target and the sensors.
- a batch bundle adjustment may be used to find the optimal pose of the cameras together with the target points.
- Calibration can be extended to the estimation of robot parameters such as joint lengths and joint angle offsets.
- known, precise, robot motion of the camera over a calibration pattern, or a calibration pattern over a camera may be used to improve calibration results. For instance, information about precisely how the camera moves may be used to obtain more accurate camera calibration. That is, if the camera is moved 50 mm right, the corresponding (perspective projection) amount of movement from the calibration object may be detected. This information may be used to jointly or separately optimize the calibration and tracking parameters.
- a robot can look at its ongoing calibration and move in such a way as to maximize information for better calibration. For example, it can detect that some view areas have not been seen and go to those views.
- a system for the practical manipulation of heterogeneous, categorical items generally from a cluttered collection area to a defined bin.
- the pick location containing the items may not be sensitive to precise object orientation(s) and items may be mixed together.
- the place location for the items may or may not be sensitive to object orientation.
- the pick-and-place regions may be defined as 3D regions acceptable for picking or placing an object, with some tolerance.
- the pick-and-place region may be highly cluttered with similar and/or disparate objects.
- the items may come from or be put into a fixture, such as metal or plastic snaps that hold the sorted item in a particular orientation.
- environment modeling of both the pick-and-place location may be used for intelligent grasp location and motion, as well as event reporting (e.g., when a place region is full or a pick region is empty).
- object bounding volumes may be computed and/or distinguishing features of objects may be found (such as textures, colors, barcodes or OCR).
- objects may be sorted into an assigned destination location by matching against a database of location assignments indexed by object type or object ID. For instance, an object's locations may be derived from reading a barcode, considering the size of the object, and/or by recognizing a particular kind of object.
- a plan for a robotic device may be determined in order to achieve certain configurations of the objects within a target location for the objects.
- the goals for loading/unloading or constructing/deconstructing pallets may be to achieve: 1) a dense packing with minimal air gaps in between boxes, and/or 2) a stable packing that won't easily collapse.
- stability may require that, in general, heavy objects are on the bottom, and light objects are on top.
- pallets may be created in order to avoid non-interlaced column stacks, column leans, or other characteristics of a bad stack.
- the pallet or truck/container may be loaded such that work by human operators in subsequent unloading processes is minimized.
- items may be placed in last in, first out order such that, upon unpacking, the items needed first are on top, the items needed second are one layer down and so on.
- the loading of pallets may be independent of how items flow towards the packing cells.
- the system can handle packages sent in random order or in an order known in advance.
- systems may adapt to changes in the flow of items on the fly.
- one or more boxes may be recorded and buffered by holding the boxes in a temporary storage area where their order can be changed along the way.
- a 2D simulator and/or a 3D simulator may be utilized for truck or container loading/unloading or for pallet loading/unloading.
- the state of a stack of boxes may be captured in the physical world and input into the simulator.
- a variable size queue of boxes from one to all the boxes may be used by a simulator for finding a next box to pick. For example, a queue of 2 boxes or 4 boxes or 10 boxes may be considered by a simulator.
- the simulator may search over the boxes in the queue to find the best box placement by heuristic algorithms and/or by brute force or multi-resolution search.
- the system may increment with increasingly fine placement of boxes around the best sites found in the previously coarser level.
- a physics planner may be used for motion planning in order to move the box efficiently to the determined locations.
- the physical and simulated stacks may be continuously monitored for quality of the stack (e.g., density, stability, and/or order placement). In some examples, the process may be repeated until all the boxes have been placed or the target container can no longer fit in another box.

- causing the robotic manipulator to move the given physical object through the designated area in space may also involve causing the robotic manipulator to move the given physical object through the designated area in space such that the at least one face of the given physical object moves within a particular field of view of the one or more optical sensors. For instance, based on the orientation information and a manner in which the robotic manipulator grasped the given physical object, the robotic manipulator may then move the physical object through the designated area in space so as to best expose the machine-readable code to one or more of the optical sensors.
- the one or more optical sensors may include at least one depth sensors configured to obtain a 3D virtual model of the physical objects to be scanned.
- the one or more optical sensors may use a full or partial 3D capture of at least one surface of a physical object in order to identify whether one or more portions of a machine-readable code are included on the at least one surface.
- a computing device may receive sensor data from multiple depth sensors, where the sensor data is representative of a 3D virtual model of the given physical object.
- the computing device may then identify a machine-readable code from the 3D virtual model and/or from other images taken of the give physical object by the depth sensors or other sensors. For instance, the computing device may be better enabled to rectify a distorted or otherwise incomplete image of the machine-readable code when the computing device can determine how far away each point of the machine-readable code is via a depth camera.
- the computing device may determine dimensions of the given physical object or other characteristics of the given physical object from the sensor data.
- the dimensions or other characteristics may be used by the computing device in order to determine where to move the given physical object to. For example, if the given physical object is small enough to fit between two other physical objects that have already been scanned and had their dimensions determined, the computing device may cause the robotic device to place the given physical object between the two other physical objects. Other examples are also possible.
- the method 300 includes, based on the determined location and further based on a scanning of the machine-readable information by the one or more optical sensors as the at least one physical object is moved through the designated area in space, receiving the data associated with the at least one physical object.
- the computing device may direct the one or more optical sensors to scan the machine-readable information based on the determined location.
- the scanning may comprise, for instance, the one or more optical sensors capturing one or more images of the machine-readable information.
- the computing device may receive, from the one or more optical sensors for instance, scanning information associated with the at least one physical object.
- the computing device may receive the data associated with the at least one physical object directly (i.e., the scanning information may take the form of the data).
- the computing device may first receive scanning information, such as the one or more captured images of the machine-readable information, and then the computing device may determine the data from that scanning information (e.g., from the one or more captured images). Other examples are also possible.
- the one or more optical sensors may focus on the located barcode and scan the barcode to read the data encoded in the barcode.
- the scanning may involve capturing one or more images of the machine-readable information and implementing one or more algorithms to recognize the at least one text string and/or any other data represented by the machine-readable information, such as OCR.
- the computing device can then determine the data associated with the given physical object that includes the machine-readable information (if the computing device has not already received such data).
- the one or more optical sensors may include multiple optical sensors coupled to respective locations surrounding the designated area, such as couple to a platform including the designated area or coupled to other robotic manipulators or mechanisms. Further, the multiple optical sensors may include telephoto lenses, or other equipment enabling the sensors to have a wider angle of view.
- the computing device may determine a focus point in space in the designated area at which to focus the scanning performed by the multiple optical scanners. Then, the computing device may cause the robotic manipulator to orient the at least one physical object while moving the at least one physical object through the designated area in space such that the machine-readable information is scanned at the determined focus point.
- the focus “point” may correspond to an area in space rather than just a single point in space. In this focus area, the machine-readable information may be viewed and scanned in high-resolution in order to facilitate more efficient scanning.
- the computing device may be configured to substantially synchronize the timing of the robotic manipulator moving through the designated area with the timing of the scanning. For instance, in one such example, the computing device may determine a trajectory and a speed at which to move the at least one physical object through the designated area in space. As such, the computing device may cause the robotic manipulator to move the at least one physical object through the designated area in space at the determined trajectory and at the determined speed.
- the computing device may determine respective timing information for each of the one or more optical sensors. For instance, one optical sensor may perform its scanning before another optical sensor performs its respective scanning. To facilitate this, the computing device may determine respective scan times for the one or more optical sensors, based on the determined trajectory, the determined speed, and/or other factors not described herein.
- the computing device may cause the one or more optical sensors to scan the machine-readable information at the determined respective scan times as the at least one physical object is moved through the designated area in space at the determined trajectory and at the determined speed.
- Other examples of timing the movement of the robotic manipulator with the timing of the one or more optical sensors are possible as well.
- the scanning of the at least one physical object may be performed incorrectly, or may result in an incomplete scanning, perhaps due to machine-readable information that is difficult to read.
- the computing device may receive data indicative of an incomplete scanning of the at least one physical object. Then, based on the data indicative of the incomplete scanning and further based on the determined location of the machine-readable information, the computing device may cause the robotic manipulator to move the at least one physical object through the designated area again, perhaps at a different trajectory, a different speed, etc. And, as the robotic manipulator moves the at least one physical object through the designated area, the computing device may cause the one or more optical sensors to rescan the machine-readable information so as to determine the data associated with the at least one physical object in a complete manner.
- the one or more optical sensors may not capture a fully-readable image of the machine-readable information, and thus, the scanning may require additional steps to facilitate a complete and accurate scanning of the machine-readable information.
- the computing device may determine, via the one or more optical sensors, at least one image corresponding to at least a portion of the machine-readable information. Based on the particular view of the machine-readable information in the at least one image, the computing device may modify a scan and/or an orientation of the at least one image. The computing device may then perform various functions. One such function may involve the computing device processing the modified at least one image so as to obtain better resolution for the modified at least one image to facilitate scanning.
- Another such function may involve the computing device comparing the modified at least one image with a predetermined machine-readable information template, such as one or more known (e.g., previously-scanned or similar) barcodes, text strings, etc. For instance, the computing device may look at particular coordinates of the modified at least one image and identify known features of the modified at least one image that substantially match known images.
- a predetermined machine-readable information template such as one or more known (e.g., previously-scanned or similar) barcodes, text strings, etc.
- the computing device may look at particular coordinates of the modified at least one image and identify known features of the modified at least one image that substantially match known images.
- the computing device may determine a remaining portion of the machine-readable information or may otherwise rectify the modified at least one image so as to enable the one or more optical sensors to scan the machine-readable information.
- the computing device may perform this rectification from the image plane to a normalized view by finding fiduciary markings on the image of the barcode.
- a 2D barcode for instance, there may be special locator features to scan for.
- the computing device may look for a patch of high, unidirectional gradients.
- the computing device may use the features in it (e.g., corners boundaries for 1D, feature markers or boundary marks for 2D) to determine a homography (e.g., a mapping of the plane of the feature to the plane of the imager).
- the homography may be used to calculate a rectification from the image view of the barcode to a new view, which removes the perspective distortion of the barcode and scales the barcode to a normalized size.
- This rectified view may be a normalized view in which the information in the barcode appears in a consistent place or pattern, thereby removing the need to perform complex search to find the information.
- the computing device may also use depth information from a depth sensor to find 3D points in the vicinity of the barcode, and from these points, estimate the plane on which the barcode resides. By knowing this plane and the outlines of the barcode, the computing device may then construct a homography to rectify the barcode image to a normalized view.
- the computing device may use pattern matching to find the information in a barcode. For example, to read the code for the numeral “1” in the pattern, the computing device may perform a pattern match of that bar pattern within the found barcode. Pattern matching may be much more efficient when the image object to be matched is presented in a normalized fashion, and correctly oriented and scaled.
- the method 300 includes, based on the data, determining a respective location in a physical environment of the robotic manipulator at which to place the at least one physical object.
- the respective location may be determined based on other factors as well, additionally or alternatively to the data associated with the at least one physical object, such as determined dimensions of the at least one physical object, as noted above.
- the respective location may not be in the physical environment of the robotic manipulator in the sense that the respective location may not be within reach of the robotic manipulator or relatively proximate to the robotic manipulator. For instance, based on information encoded in a given physical object's machine-readable code, the computing device may determine that the physical object must be placed at a given location immediately following the scanning of the object, but may determine another location (or locations) where the object should be placed at some time in the future after the scanning.
- the method 300 includes causing the robotic manipulator to move the at least one physical object to the respective location.
- This function may involve the robotic manipulator releasing or otherwise decoupling the at least one physical object from the robotic manipulator such that the at least one physical object is placed at the respective location.
- the respective location may be, for instance, at a location proximate to a box, at a location on a conveyor belt, or at a location where a given physical object can be decoupled from the robotic manipulator and subsequently coupled to another robotic manipulator, among other possibilities.
- devices other than the robotic manipulator may move the physical object to the respective location. For instance, upon scanning the physical object, the computing device may determine that the physical object may eventually need to be placed somewhere or handled in some specific way by a device that is not within the physical environment of the robotic manipulator. The information encoded in the machine-readable information may facilitate this future placement or general handling of the physical object.
- the method 300 may further involve causing the robotic manipulator to place the at least one physical object at the respective location after a predetermined period of time from the determining of the information associated with the at least one physical object encoded in the machine-readable code.
- the computing device may even determine the period of time after which to eventually cause the robotic manipulator (or other device) to interact with the object. Other examples are also possible.
- FIG. 4A illustrates an example system 400 configured to perform functions of the example method, in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein.

- the four cameras 408 a - d may be movable by one or more robotic devices proximate to the designated area and controlled by a computing device, such as one or more robotic arms, conveyors, and/or other mechanisms coupled to and controlled by the computing device.
- a computing device may dynamically adjust the locations of the four cameras 408 a - d with respect to the designated area (e.g., move closer to or further away from the designated area) and reading station 406 based on a size of a given physical object that is about to enter the designated area (e.g., so as to avoid contact with the given object), based on the location of the robotic arm 402 , and/or based on other information.
- the cameras 408 a - d may be timed and synchronized with the robotic arm 402 so that high-quality images of the box 404 can be captured by the cameras 408 a - d and the barcode 410 can be identified and scanned from those images.
- the computing device may determine whether the cameras 408 a - d were able to capture sufficient enough images of the box 404 for scanning the barcode 410 . If the barcode 410 was successfully scanned, the computing device may direct the robotic arm 402 to place the box 404 at a respective location (not shown). On the other hand, if the barcode 410 not successfully scanned, the computing device may direct the robotic arm 402 to rescan the box 404 .
- the example system 400 may include a conveyor belt or other mechanism used to move the box 404 through the reading station 406 alternatively to or additionally to the robotic arm 402 .

- the cameras 458 a - e may provide a large depth of field such that objects within view of the cameras 458 a - e may stay in focus over a large range of depth. All of the cameras 458 a - e may all be focused around a “sweet spot” (i.e., a point/area of best focus) 460 in space where the box's barcode 462 (or text, or other type of machine-readable information) will be sharply in focus while the robotic arm 452 moves the box 454 through the reading station 456 .
- a “sweet spot” i.e., a point/area of best focus
- the sweet spot 460 may generally be determined a priori, and the computing device may use the sweet spot 460 , along with 3D data associated with the box 454 (e.g., a 3D model) determined by the cameras 458 a - e , to move the box 454 such that the relevant surfaces pass through the sweet spot 460 .
- 3D data associated with the box 454 e.g., a 3D model
- the computing device may plan a trajectory for moving the box 454 through the reading station 456 and time the cameras 458 a - e such that the robotic arm 452 and the cameras 458 a - e are synchronized.

- the computing device may first determining respective locations in a designated area of a physical environment of the system at which to place one or more optical sensors such that the one or more sensors are proximate to the physical object in the designated area.

- the platform 512 may be configured to support the box 506 while the box 506 is scanned by one or more optical sensors, including the other camera 510 , which may be configured to determine a location of the barcode on the bottom of the box 506 and scan the bottom of the box 506 when the box 506 is in the designated area.
- the camera 504 a coupled to the reader 504 , the mirrors 504 b - e , and the additional camera 510 underneath the platform 512 .
- cameras, mirrors, and other sensors may be arranged and manipulated so as to scan all sides of physical objects shaped differently than a six-sided box.
- the image(s) of the machine-readable information captured from a reflection in a mirror may be distorted.
- the system 500 may implement one or more functions to rectify the image(s) for scanning, such as those functions noted above.
- the computing device may approximately pre-compute how a given machine-readable code would look from an angle of a mirror and compensate for the distorted image of the given machine-readable code by either unwarping the distorted image (e.g., modifying a scale, orientation, etc. of the image) and performing template matching, or warping a predetermined template and applying the warped predetermined template to the image.
- the computing device may modify a scale and/or an orientation of at least one image of the machine-readable information, where the at least one image corresponds to at least a portion of the machine-readable information based on a reflection of the machine-readable code in the one or more mirrors.
- the computing device may then make a comparison between the modified at least one image and a predetermined machine-readable information template. Then, based on the comparison, the computing device may determine a remaining portion of the machine-readable information so as to enable the one or more optical sensors to scan the machine-readable information.
- Other functions for rectifying images may be implemented as well, additionally or alternatively to the function just described.
- the system 500 may include multiple robotic manipulators additionally or alternatively to the robotic arm 502 .
- Such robotic manipulators may be used to move other cameras, mirrors, or scanning devices around physical objects in an environment of the system 500 , when the physical objects are moving through the environment of the system (e.g., on a conveyor or other moving platform) and/or when the physical objects are not moving.

- a computing device may implement a barcode algorithm which may comprise one or more operations, some of which are described below.
- the computing device may detect where the barcode 602 is on the box 604 . For instance, if the barcode 602 is a 1D barcode, the stereo cameras 600 may look for groups of high, unidirectional gradients, or other features, as noted above. On the other hand, if the barcode 602 is a 2D barcode, there may be locator features, such as uniquely-identifiable patterns, that can be located.
- the barcode's features e.g., corners boundaries for 1D, feature markers or boundary marks for 2D
- a homography e.g., a mapping of the plane of the feature(s) to the plane of the imager.
- the homography may be used to remove the perspective distortion of a given barcode feature so that it can be read easier (e.g., “warp” the barcode).
- the computing device may implement pattern recognition to look for features that match that of the bar pattern captured in an image by the stereo camera arrangement 600 . That is, to read the code for the numeral “1” in the pattern, the computing device may implement a pattern match of that bar pattern within the found barcode. Steps 606 - 610 shown in FIG. 6 illustrate an example of such a technique.
- the computing device may have a predetermined template of the numeral “1” in the barcode 602 pattern.
- the computing device may warp the template to fit the orientation of the pattern to match an image of the barcode 602 captured by the camera arrangement 600 .
- the computing device may “unwarp” the image of the barcode 602 and search for an unwarped template of a barcode to compare the unwarped image with.
- the barcode 602 barcode may be curved or bent on the surface of the box 604 , and the computing device can either rectify (e.g., “flatten”) the barcode 602 or warp a template before matching with the warped image of the barcode 602 , as shown in step 610 .
- the barcode algorithm described above may be improved or other algorithms not described herein may be implemented so that the computing device knows a general size of the barcode or other machine-readable information it is looking for. This would make barcode detection quicker and more robust, as there would be no need to search through scale, minimize perspective distortion, etc.
