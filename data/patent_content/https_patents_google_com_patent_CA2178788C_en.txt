Abstract
A document search method using a plurality of databases available from one or more servers using one or more search engines. For each database, the number of records is determined and reported, as well as frequency of search query term occurrences or hits, together with identification of database records corresponding to the hits. Reports from a plurality of databases are furnished to a user terminal, a client, where client software computes a relevance score for each record based upon the number of records in the database, the number of records having at least one hit and the number of hits for each record. This local computation from uniform data allows all documents to be ranked consistently as if coming from a s ing le dat abase .
Description
Description Document Retrieval Over Networks Technical Field The invention relates to docurnent searching and retrieval, particularly over networks.
Background Art For more than twenty years, inforrnation services have provided access to multiple databases. For exaniple, Dialog Inforrnation Services, now known as Knight-Rider Information, Inc., provides several hundred databases (a.k.a collections) available to searchers, sorne of the databases contain bibliographic abstracts, while others contain full-text docurnents. A searcher is able to apply a query to one or to a plurality of databases. At the outset, the searcher selects individual databases which are of interest, based on past experience, or selects a group of databases, selected by the inforrnation provider and related to a particular topic.
For exarnple, a searcher might select the topic of patents, a topic for which the inforrnation service has grouped a nurnber of databases specific to patents. When a query is applied to the group of databases, the information service retrieves the number of hits in each database. The searcher then accesses databases of interest to view individual records. This systern was originally designed for librarians and professional researchers who know where to look for desired inforrnation.
As wide area networks, such as Internet, become

When a query is applied to the group of databases, the information service retrieves the number of hits in each database. The searcher then accesses databases of interest to view individual records. This systern was originally designed for librarians and professional researchers who know where to look for desired inforrnation.
As wide area networks, such as Internet, become
- 2 -available, new opportunities in searching have become available, not only to searching professionals, but to lay users. New types of information providers are arising who use public, as well as private, databases to provide bibliographic research data and docunients to users. When a user has an int e rest in a topic, such as pat ent s, Yie rnay not know what resources can be assembled for a search, nor the location of the resources. Since the resources frequently change, a searcher will have less interest in the source of the reply 1.0 cornpared to the relevance of the reply. It has been recognized by others that distributed collections, available over wide area networks, can be treated as a single collection. Each sub-collection is searched individually, and the reports are combined in a single list. It has also been recognized by others that documents can be ranked by search engines in accord with an algorithrn and given a weight, taking into account the nature of a particular collection. Docurnent scores can be norrnalized to obtain scores that would be obtained if individual document collections were merged into a 20 single, unified collection.
One of the problerns that exists in the prior art is that the scores for each document are not absolute, but depend on the stat ist ics of each collection and on the algorithrns associated with the search engines. A second problem which exists is that the standard prior art procedure requires two passes. In a first pass, stat ist ics are col lect ed f roni each search engine in order to cornpute the weight for each query
One of the problerns that exists in the prior art is that the scores for each document are not absolute, but depend on the stat ist ics of each collection and on the algorithrns associated with the search engines. A second problem which exists is that the standard prior art procedure requires two passes. In a first pass, stat ist ics are col lect ed f roni each search engine in order to cornpute the weight for each query
3 term. In a second step, the information from the first step is passed back to each search engine, which then assigns a particular weight or score to each hit or identified document. A third problem that exists is that the prior art requires that all collections use the same search engine.
An object of the invention was to devise a method for searching multiple collections on a single pass, with ranking of documents on a consistent basis so that if the same document appears in two different databases, it would be scored the same when the results are merged. It is not required that the same search engine be used for all collections.
Summary of the Invention The above object has been achieved with a document search and retrieval method which requires each participating search engine server to return statistics about each query term in each of the documents returned. A
final relevance score is then computed at the client end, not the server. In this manner, all relevance scores are processed at the client in the same manner regardless of differences in the search engines.
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method for searching a plurality of databases having a plurality of different operating characteristics which are distributed and accessible to a client through one or more search servers comprising, (a) applying a search query from the client to each server associated with each database, (b) obtaining, at the client from each server, statistics about each database, (c) obtaining, at the client from each server, information about documents resulting from application of the query to the database, (d) computing, at - 3a -the client, a score for each document using said statistics and said information, whereby the computed scores describe the relevance of the documents to the search query and appear applicable to all databases as if the databases were joined into a single database having a single set of operating characteristics.
In accordance with the present invention, there is further provided, a method for searching a plurality of databases having a plurality of different operating characteristics which are distributed and accessible to a client through one or more servers comprising, (a) accessing each database from the client, (b) applying a search query from the client to the server associated with each database, (c) obtaining, at the client, statistics about each database, (d) obtaining, at the client, statistical information about relevant documents resulting from application of the query to the database, (e) computing, at the client, a score for the relevant documents using said statistics and said information, whereby the computed score for a document is independent of the operating characteristics of the database it appears in and indicates the relevance of the document to the search query.
In accordance with the present invention, there is still further provided a method for searching text documents among a plurality of databases, having a plurality of different operating characteristics, in response to a search query, (a) applying a search query to each database, (b) for each database determining a number of records in the database, (c) for each of said databases, applying the search query and recording the number of hits of each search query term and the identification of database records having at least one hit in said number of hits, (d) for each of said databases, and for each query term, counting the - 3b -records having at least one hit, (e) reporting to a user a relevance score of each record with respect to the search query, the relevance score independent of the operating characteristics of the database in which the record was found and computed using the results of steps (b), (c) and (d).
Brief Description of the Drawing Fig. 1 is a block diagram of the system of the present invention.
- ~1 -Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention With reference to Fig. 1, a query, indicated by tlhe query block 11, is forrnulated by a user and applied to a terrninal or client system. The query is electronically transmitted to a network interface 13. The network interface is an information service which has access to sources 17 having databases relating to the subJect of the query. These databases, rnounted on other servers, are sirnultaneously polled over communications channels 15, which may be wide area network links to the sources 17. The Internet is a rnodel for such an arrangement of wide area network links and remote sources. The query is applied to search engines, represented by columns 20, 30, and 40, with each search engine accessing an associated database in block 19. Each search engine rriay have its own operating characteristics, such as Boolean logic, statistical inferences, etc. Each database produces a report containing the number of records, N, in the database, indicated by block 21. Also contained in the report is the number of times each search term occurs in documents responsive to the query. This quantity, NTERM' is indicated by block 23. Thirdly, the report produces a document identification number for each docurnent containing hits, together with the number of occurrences of each search terrn, as indicated by block 25. Frorn this inforrnat ion, a computation is made by the client software, using its own algorithrn, of a score for each docurnent, indicated by block 27. For example, a forniula for computing a score is as follows:
doc score = L tf = idf all terms where t f = nurnber of occurrences of the terin in the docurnent and idf = log N I where N and NTER~I are the sum of N and NTERh1 NTERh1 values reported by all collect ions . The counputed scores are transrnitted to an output buffer, indicated by block 29, which sifts the top M scores from coniputation block 27, which have been requested by the person rnaking the query. Note that only a single pass has been niade throi_igh the cJatabase.
Cornputed scores are treated as absolute values.
In an alternate ernbodirnent, an optional parameter ritay be reported for use in tl--e algorithrn. Block 26 shows that the frequency of the most frequent term in each docurnent is reported for purposes of using a rnore sophisticated ranking formula of the client. Another optional data reduction step is that each searct-i engine rnay cornpute a score for docurnent relevance in the rnanner known in the prior art. Fro-n this data, the search engine rnay preselect up to the top M hits in the database, where M is a maxirnuni number of hits required by the user.
As an example, a search query might involve documents with the words "graphical user-interface". Table 1 below shows a report generated by a search engine which has selected a number of the highest ranking docurnents. This report is returned to the user's client software, where the user applies an algorithm, such as in formula (1) above, using terrn frequency data and docurnent frequency data returned by each search engine. Thus, there is a local calculation of the documerit weight ing fc7r, each query ternr, combining the NTERM
and N (= number of documents) returned from each collection.
Herice, term weight ing is exactly the same as if: the collections had been a single callection, Scoring is totally consistent even if different search engiries participated in ttie search and the same document appearing in 2 different collections will always receive an identical score.
Table 1 N is 65,000 z total number of documents in the collection Doc2D araphival 'use_r-interface 123 3 1 z-= occurences within the 189 5 4 document of the term NTERM 1000 23000 c- number of documents which contain the search term at least once
An object of the invention was to devise a method for searching multiple collections on a single pass, with ranking of documents on a consistent basis so that if the same document appears in two different databases, it would be scored the same when the results are merged. It is not required that the same search engine be used for all collections.
Summary of the Invention The above object has been achieved with a document search and retrieval method which requires each participating search engine server to return statistics about each query term in each of the documents returned. A
final relevance score is then computed at the client end, not the server. In this manner, all relevance scores are processed at the client in the same manner regardless of differences in the search engines.
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method for searching a plurality of databases having a plurality of different operating characteristics which are distributed and accessible to a client through one or more search servers comprising, (a) applying a search query from the client to each server associated with each database, (b) obtaining, at the client from each server, statistics about each database, (c) obtaining, at the client from each server, information about documents resulting from application of the query to the database, (d) computing, at - 3a -the client, a score for each document using said statistics and said information, whereby the computed scores describe the relevance of the documents to the search query and appear applicable to all databases as if the databases were joined into a single database having a single set of operating characteristics.
In accordance with the present invention, there is further provided, a method for searching a plurality of databases having a plurality of different operating characteristics which are distributed and accessible to a client through one or more servers comprising, (a) accessing each database from the client, (b) applying a search query from the client to the server associated with each database, (c) obtaining, at the client, statistics about each database, (d) obtaining, at the client, statistical information about relevant documents resulting from application of the query to the database, (e) computing, at the client, a score for the relevant documents using said statistics and said information, whereby the computed score for a document is independent of the operating characteristics of the database it appears in and indicates the relevance of the document to the search query.
In accordance with the present invention, there is still further provided a method for searching text documents among a plurality of databases, having a plurality of different operating characteristics, in response to a search query, (a) applying a search query to each database, (b) for each database determining a number of records in the database, (c) for each of said databases, applying the search query and recording the number of hits of each search query term and the identification of database records having at least one hit in said number of hits, (d) for each of said databases, and for each query term, counting the - 3b -records having at least one hit, (e) reporting to a user a relevance score of each record with respect to the search query, the relevance score independent of the operating characteristics of the database in which the record was found and computed using the results of steps (b), (c) and (d).

Thirdly, the report produces a document identification number for each docurnent containing hits, together with the number of occurrences of each search terrn, as indicated by block 25. Frorn this inforrnat ion, a computation is made by the client software, using its own algorithrn, of a score for each docurnent, indicated by block 27. For example, a forniula for computing a score is as follows:
doc score = L tf = idf all terms where t f = nurnber of occurrences of the terin in the docurnent and idf = log N I where N and NTER~I are the sum of N and NTERh1 NTERh1 values reported by all collect ions . The counputed scores are transrnitted to an output buffer, indicated by block 29, which sifts the top M scores from coniputation block 27, which have been requested by the person rnaking the query.
