Definitions
- the invention relates to an information management system and method, and more particularly to a system and method for receiving, analyzing, and managing calendar information obtained from a variety of source documents.
- the keyboard-and-screen system presents several advantages.
- the keyboard typically used with computer systems is an inexpensive item to produce. It includes only around 100 key switches, signals from which are encoded and sent to the CPU. Also, it is only slightly modified from the version used on mechanical typewriter keyboards for over a century. Hence, it is familiar to most people. Moreover, typewriter-style keyboards (or variations thereof) are usable to unambiguously input information in most Western languages.
- a keyboard is not an efficient form of input.
- training is required.
- time and effort is necessary to enter information via keyboard, particularly when the information sought to be entered is already evident in a document or some other communication from another.
- they are sensitive to spelling errors, repetitive stress injury (such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis), and inconvenience. Both hands are needed to use a traditional keyboard with any speed.
- the display screens typically used on personal (and other) computer systems have a number of advantages. They are relatively inexpensive. Years of producing television sets and computer monitors have resulted in manufacturing and design efficiencies and improvements in quality.
- CRT-based display screens are still typically bulky, heavy, and energy inefficient. They also produce a relatively large amount of heat.
- CRT displays have not been integrated into many other environments, and computers (and their displays) are usually treated as stand-alone items.
- Other display technologies have been tried, including plasma displays and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), to name two, but have been less successful because of their relatively high cost and low image quality in comparison to CRT displays.
- LCD prices have been dropping in recent years, and such displays are beginning to be found in a variety of applications.
- touch-screen-based systems in which a flat-panel display (such as an LCD) is overlaid with a translucent pressure-sensitive (or other type of touch-sensitive) surface, have been gaining in popularity.
- a flat-panel display such as an LCD
- a translucent pressure-sensitive (or other type of touch-sensitive) surface have been gaining in popularity.
- Such a system allows the user to directly manipulate the information that is shown on the display. For example, various gestures can be made on the surface to copy, move, annotate, or otherwise alter information on the display.
- data input Where there is no keyboard associated with a touch screen, then data must be input via interaction with the touch-sensitive surface. In some cases, this involves handwriting recognition, which is an imperfect and computationally intensive procedure, or some other means, such as “pressing” (with a stylus or fingertip) a visually displayed keyboard, or by special gestural symbols designed for data entry.
- Voice recognition input has also made some progress in recent years.
- voice recognition systems have been used primarily in experimental environments. Typically, error rates were extremely high, and to accomplish real-time recognition, the computational resources required were prohibitively high.
- voice recognition systems are speaker-dependent, and as such require a significant amount of training to attain a satisfactory level of performance and a low enough error rate.
- errors are made (such as in the recognition of homonyms and proper names), it is frequently more convenient to type the corrected word with a traditional keyboard than it is to correct the error by speaking the necessary voice commands and spelling the word for the system. Accordingly, voice recognition shows some promise for the future, but at the present time, is not a practical method of operating and providing input to a personal computer.
- OCR optical character recognition
- kitchen computers or software for general-purpose personal computers to enable kitchen functionality.
- Such kitchen computers usually provide the ability to store recipes, create shopping lists, and take rudimentary notes.
- these kitchen computers use the standard keyboard-and-screen user interface, and are highly limited in function.
- Kitchen computers generally do not have very well-developed document handling or telephony functions.
- PDR personal document readers
- Another class of systems uses what is known as a “paper user interface,” in which commands are conveyed to the system by making marks on paper, which is then scanned.
- a paper user interface in which commands are conveyed to the system by making marks on paper, which is then scanned.
- one category of such devices is able to read free-form ink (or digital) annotations to determine which of several possible editing operations a user wishes to perform on a document. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No.
- Such techniques can also be extrapolated to other media, such as office whiteboards. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,290 to Saund, entitled “Device for Transcribing Images on a Board Using a Camera Based Board Scanner,” and U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,637 to Cass and Saund, entitled “System for Registering Component Image Tiles in a Camera-Based Scanner Device Transcribing Scene Images.”
- An all-electronic system for accomplishing essentially the same result is Tivoli, an electronic collaboration tool that uses Xerox LiveBoard hardware. See Pedersen, E. R., McCall, K., Moran, T. P., and Halasz, F. G., “Tivoli: An electronic whiteboard for informal workgroup meetings,” Proceedings of the InterCHI'93 Conference on Human Factors in Computer Systems. New York: ACM (1993).
- This invention builds upon the limited successes of prior systems in an attempt to create a comprehensive document handling system and method, useful in home and office environments, that is intuitive, easy to use, powerful, and relatively ubiquitous by way of its incorporation into other traditional channels of communication.
- the invention relies upon the recognition and analysis of document genre structure rather than content.
- the document genre guides the extraction of useful information, while reducing the need to recognize and parse each document in its entirety. This reduces errors and computational expense.
- a method for manipulating and managing a calendar includes the steps of receiving data representative of at least a portion of a source document, receiving guidance representative of the source document's genre or structure, analyzing the data, using the guidance to identify an event within the data, extracting a representation of the event from the data, and merging the representation into a database.
- This method is capable of operating with or without user interaction.

- a distributed network for information management and sharing is shown in schematic form.
- the present invention is adapted to facilitate the extraction and use of significant information in documents of many kinds, including (but not limited to) papers, handwritten notes, business cards, e-mail messages, audio messages, and the like, without any appreciable advance knowledge of the content or format of the documents, but with some knowledge of the “genre” or context of the documents.
- the system is adapted for distributed access and either centralized or distributed processing.
- the term “document” refers to any persistent communication or collection of information, whether fixed in a tangible medium (such as a hardcopy) or stored electronically, and whether in machine-readable or human-readable form.
- a document “genre” is a culturally defined document category that guides the document's interpretation. Genres are signaled by the greater document environment (such as the physical media, pictures, titles, etc. that serve to distinguish at a glance, for example, the National Enquirer from the New York Times ) rather than the document text. The same information presented in two different genres may lead to two different interpretations. For example, a document starting with the line “At dawn the street was peaceful . . .
- Two user terminals 110 and 112 each with a flat-panel display, a remote CPU 114 , a traditional personal computer 116 , a telephone device 118 with integrated telephone answering device (TAD) functionality, a document scanner 120 , a fax machine 122 , a printer 124 , and a handwriting input tablet 126 are all coupled to a communications network 128 .
- the network 128 may be any type of known network, such as an Ethernet local-area network (LAN), a wireless LAN (either RF or infrared), a wide-area network (WAN), or even the Internet.
- the network 128 may comprise only the illustrated devices, connected in a peer-to-peer topology, or may include numerous other disparate devices, whether or not designed to operate with the present invention.
- numerous other network topologies and protocols may be used in an implementation of the current invention without departing from its scope.
- the functional interoperation of the illustrated devices will be considered in detail below.
- FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram illustrating the functions performed by the physical components set forth in FIG. 1 .
- the network 128 (FIG. 1) is provided in the form of a bi-directional communications link 210 , to which a central processing unit (CPU) 212 and memory are attached.
- the CPU 212 is adapted to perform most of the invention's processing, but it should be noted that in an alternative embodiment of the invention, processing may be distributed over the network 128 .
- the CPU 212 is attached to a memory 214 , which may be used to store, among other things, genre specifications used in document analysis (explained below), character models used for character recognition, voice models used in speech recognition, and other data used by the system.
- a display 216 is also provided; it may be local to or remote from the CPU 212 , and may be able to decouple from the network 128 for portability (as in a Personal Digital Assistant or PDA).
- An exemplary embodiment of the display 216 will be described in further detail below.
- Long-term storage 218 for the information database of the invention which stores document information for later use, is also provided and connected to the communications link 210 .
- Various input devices are attached to the link 210 , including a keyboard 220 , a pointing device 222 (such as a mouse, trackball, or light pen), a handwriting tablet 224 , and a scanner 226 . These devices are adapted to receive information and transmit it to the CPU 212 for processing.
- An audio interface including a microphone 228 and a loudspeaker 230 , facilitate the entry and use of audio documents (such as recorded memos).
- the microphone 228 and loudspeaker 230 may be integrated into a telephone device 118 or any other convenient apparatus attached to the network 128 .
- a printer 232 is provided for hardcopy output. It should be recognized that the foregoing input and output devices are exemplary only, and numerous other input devices 234 and output devices 236 may be used in accordance with the invention. Moreover, additional processors, such as a recognition processor 238 or any other processor 240 may be used to off-load some of the computational burden from the CPU 212 . It is contemplated that the recognition processor 238 would be used to process audio from the microphone 228 , handwriting from the tablet 224 , or printed documents from the scanner 226 , for example.
- the raw input would be translated to a machine-readable counterpart (e.g., speech would be converted to recognized text via a speech recognition algorithm, handwriting would be converted to recognized text or command gestures via a handwriting recognizer; or printed documents would be converted from a bitmap to text via optical character recognition).
- a machine-readable counterpart e.g., speech would be converted to recognized text via a speech recognition algorithm, handwriting would be converted to recognized text or command gestures via a handwriting recognizer; or printed documents would be converted from a bitmap to text via optical character recognition.
- a database 310 (preferably hosted by the storage 218 and managed by the CPU 212 of FIG. 2) serves as a repository of document information, specifically that information which has been deemed to be significant in documents processed by the system, and is coupled to an input/output subsystem 312 , functionally illustrated in FIG. 2 above.
- the input/output subsystem 312 may include some or all of the display 216 , the keyboard 220 , the pointing device 222 , the handwriting tablet 224 , the scanner 226 , the microphone and speaker 228 and 230 , the printer 232 , other input and output devices 234 and 236 , as well as the logic used to control those devices, including the recognition processor 238 , any other processor 240 , and certain functions of the CPU 212 .
- the input/output subsystem 312 is capable of handling documents 314 , audio messages 316 , and annotations 318 , in accordance with detailed methods set forth below.
- Input to and output from the database 310 are processed by the system with the assistance of guidance provided by a set of genre specifications 320 (preferably stored within the memory 214 of FIG. 2 ).
- the genre specifications 320 provide information on the expected nature, structure, and content of documents handled by the system.
- the genre specifications 320 preferably indicate where certain data items are likely to be found within a document, the format of those data items, and other considerations of utility in the information extraction process.
- the genre specifications preferably indicate how to assemble data from the database 310 into human-readable documents in a manner consistent with what the user expects. The mechanics of this interaction will be considered below with reference to several detailed examples.
- FIG. 4 represents the processes performed in a system adapted to extract appointment and other date/time information from various documents and inputs to the system, and to synthesize a calendar from the information then stored in the database 310 (FIG. 3 ).
- Date and annotation information 410 stored as part of a calendar document, is an input to this method, which begins by receiving the date and annotation information (step 412 ).
- this input can occur in any of a number of ways: by scanning one or more paper documents with a sheet-fed scanner or a scanning pen, by selecting certain e-mail messages or Web pages for processing, or by providing an audio recording of a voice message, for example.
- a collection of one or more source documents is provided to the system. Consequently, the source documents can be, for example, paper or other physical documents, or can also be “raw bits,” such as unrecognized image or speech data, or formatted data, such as ASCII or HTML. Each source document is assumed to represent a genre structure recognizable by the system.
- Each source document is further assumed to contain one or more key pieces of information, each such key being associated with a message that the user (or another person) would find significant.
- the keys can be dates or times, and the messages can be announcements of scheduled events corresponding to these dates or times.
- the source documents are provided to the system in physical rather than digital form.
- the system captures the documents and converts them to digital form.
- a paper document can be optically scanned by a whole page scanner or a scanning pen to produce unrecognized image data, which can then be further converted as by segmentation, optical character recognition (OCR), sketch analysis, and the like.
- OCR optical character recognition
- An audio recording can be digitized and, if the recording contains speech, the speech can be recognized by a speech recognizer.
- the documents may include data in any number of forms, such as textual, graphic, pictorial, audio, or video data. Streaming and static data are both acceptable. The greater the system's ability to accept physical rather than digital documents as input, the better it can integrate seamlessly with everyday practice.
- the genre of the document input is determinate, and is observable by the user.
- the document's genre is used to select a particular input specification 414 , which is used to assist further processing of the input document.
- various means of specifying an input genre are possible; one exemplary method is described below with reference to FIG. 27 .
- the system may be programmed to expect documents having a particular genre. It is also possible for a system according to the invention to attempt to heuristically determine the genre of an input document without further user input. This is particularly possible when documents of different types and genres are being received from different sources (e.g., e-mail messages might usually have a certain genre, while facsimile messages might have a different usual genre).
- a particular input document may represent the genre of calendars.
- the characteristics of this genre are indicated by the selected input specification 414 , chosen from a library of possible genre specifications. While, in general terms, a system according to the invention is able to process many different document genres, it is important to note that a single instance of the system may be equipped to only process a single genre type, such as calendars. Even so, there may be many different kinds of calendars, such as schedules, appointment books, and the like (some of which will be discussed in further detail below), all of which may be defined by a single input specification 414 or, if necessary, by multiple input specifications. For purposes of this discussion, all documents within the calendar genre are considered to have similar structures, including the key information set forth above.
- the input specification 414 is employed to analyze the input (step 416 ) and identify information of interest. This operation may occur automatically (see FIG. 5) or semi-automatically (see FIG. 6) with some user interaction.
- the identified information (which for the calendar genre typically includes at least a date, a time, and an event title) is then extracted and associated (step 418 ) into a record corresponding to a single event.
- the record is then merged (step 420 ) into the database 310 (FIG. 3 ).
- the entire input document (or as much as is available) is merged into the database 310 and is indexed and referenced by its extracted records.
- an exemplary output calendar (see FIG. 12) may contain only a summary of information obtained from one or more input documents. When this is the case, the user can be given the opportunity to “select” an event, thereby revealing further information, possibly including a digitized bitmap of the entire input document from which the event was extracted. This capability provides an useful safeguard, reducing the possibility (and impact) of an error by the system.
- an output specification 422 is selected.
- the output specification identifies and describes the characteristics of the user's desired output genre. For example, the user may wish to create a monthly calendar containing all family events for the month of December, 1998.
- the output specification 422 fully describes the format of that document, but does not contain any of the information from the database 310 . Accordingly, the document is created (step 424 ) from the information in the database 310 and the output specification 422 and is outputted (step 426 ) to the user.
- step 430 the analysis is adjusted (step 430 ), and information is extracted once again.
- this can be accomplished by several means, including but not limited to adjusting the parameters used to perform the analysis, by reverting to alternate choices in a weighted list of possibilities, or by accepting user guidance.
- the database 310 continues to contain full document instances, in addition to the analyzed information derived in steps 416 - 418 .
- the adjustment step 430 is presented herein as occurring after output has been generated, it should be noted that adjustment by any of the means set forth above can occur in any step of the process, for example immediately after character recognition is performed, or before the information is stored in the database.
- FIG. 5 illustrates the process followed by an automatic version of the input analysis aspect of FIG. 4 .
- character recognition step 514 is performed on the input data 512 , if necessary to translate the document into a machine-readable format.
- the portions of interest are identified (step 516 ).
- one method includes simply scanning for numerals, while another method scans for all potentially relevant types of information, such as numerals, names of months, names of days of the week, the phrase “o'clock,” etc.
- the system extracts the necessary dates (step 518 ), times (step 520 ), and event titles and other annotations (step 522 ), and if necessary, the applicable person (step 524 ). Dates and times, in particular, have reasonably well-defined structures that assist the system in identification. These characteristics will be discussed in further detail below (see FIGS. 18, 21 , 22 , and 23 ). In a household or business, names might also be readily identifiable (for example, by checking against a list of valid names).
- FIG. 6 illustrates a semi-automatic version of the input analysis step of FIG. 4, a date 610 , a time 612 , an event title 614 , and a person 616 are all identified by the user. Then, to facilitate extraction and indexing into the database 310 (FIG. 3 ), character recognition 618 is performed on the date 610 , time 612 , title 614 , and person 616 .
- At least one of the foregoing data items may not be present; for example, in a calendar might not include a time for an all-day event.
- the system may allow for the manual input of the omitted data item, or may alternatively continue to operate without it.
- the user identification of the data items 610 - 616 may operate by writing guiding annotations on a hardcopy document (which is then scanned), by using a scanning pen to input data fields in succession, or by any other similar method.
- user identification only requires “pointing at” a particular item; the system then uses character or pattern recognition to determine the extent of the written data field.
- the manual input called for above may be accomplished via a keyboard, handwriting recognition, or simple selection of options via a pointing device, as circumstances require.
- a detailed example of the calendaring system in operation will now be presented. It shows how a user can use one particular input mechanism, in this case a smart scanning pen (one embodiment of which will be discussed in further detail below), to analyze structure and merge calendar data from a variety of document genres.
- a scanning pen is not the only possible means of input. Rather, the scanning pen is used for ease in describing the invention, which deals more with the source documents once they have been acquired.
- the user interacts with a smart scanning pen augmented with a single button or any other user control (one embodiment of which is illustrated in FIG. 24 )—this button, when clicked, indicates to the system that a new appointment is being entered.
- This button when clicked, indicates to the system that a new appointment is being entered.
- the user's primary interaction with the scanning pen once the button has been clicked, is to perform a series of “swipes” with the scanning pen across the surface of the document. Each such swipe yields a bitmapped portion of a text page. This bitmapped portion is then. analyzed and converted to digital text via optical character recognition (either on the pen itself, as part of the transfer to the system, or possibly later in the process by another component of the system), and analyzed with genre-specific heuristics.
- the set of scanned events is transferred from the pen's local storage to the calendar system.
- the scanning pen bears an infrared (IR) transmitter near the end farthest from the scanning tip.
- IR infrared
- the information is transmitted to the host (which must have an IR receiver ready to receive said information).
- IR infrared
- Less exotic solutions are also possible, including but not limited to a docking station or even a serial cable.
- a click of the pen's button is indicated with the symbol CLICK, and a swipe of text is indicated by enclosing the text in double-quotes.
- FIG. 7 An exemplary school schedule is shown in FIG. 7 .
- the structure is of the schedule is self-apparent: it is a schedule of times when something (in this case school) is “on” and times when it is “off”.
- Several additional refinements of this structure are present, including the application to particular subgroups (e.g., grades 1-3) or particular ways of being “off” (e.g., holidays).
- a user wishes to enter the daily dismissal times into the system. Then an exemplary scanning sequence to accomplish this could be:
- the system can determine that the time of the appointment recurs daily—that time, furnished in the third swipe 714 , is 2:45 PM.
- the system treats the second swipe 712 as an annotation for the event, as its data is not recognizable as either a date or a time.
- the system can determine the frequency and day of the second appointment.
- the fifth swipe 718 annotates that appointment, and the sixth and final swipe 720 provides the recurring time.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary program calendar. This type of calendar is similar to the school example above (FIG. 7) in that it sets forth another schedule, this time oriented around the 12-month calendar rather than canonically. Suppose that the user wishes to enter into the system both events for September 816 and 822 and the Chanukah brunch 828 in December. A scanning sequence to accomplish this could be:
- swipes 812 , 814 , and 818 contain date/time information, and are analyzed accordingly. Swipes 810 and 816 don't, and so serve to annotate the event.
- swipe 820 In the second swipe sequence, the only date information is contained in swipe 820 , “20”. This is an incomplete portion of a date, so the month and year are carried over from the previous event. Swipe 822 serves to annotate the event.
- swipes 824 , 826 , and 828 contain the date information. Swipes 810 and 828 contain other information, and so annotate the event. Note that swipe 828 contains both date and annotation information.
- the third calendar type, a snack schedule is shown in FIG. 9 .
- This once again, is similar to the other schedules (FIGS. 7 - 8 ); the difference here is that only one entry is relevant to the user (the date of a particular person's snack assignment).
- the user wishes to enter the October 18 event.
- a scanning sequence to accomplish this could be:
- one swipe 910 contains both date and annotation information.
- the second swipe 912 contains only annotation information. Hence, the event will be entered with a date of October 18, and with an annotation of “Rob Rudy, Snack Schedule.”
- FIG. 10 A fourth calendar type, a web page, is shown in FIG. 10 . This is still a schedule, but one kept primarily in the digital domain (though it can be printed in hardcopy format). Suppose that the user wishes to enter the September 6th event. A scanning sequence to accomplish this could be:
- the second swipe 1012 serves to completely specify the date—the other swipes 1010 and 1014 serve as annotation.
- the user may wish to add additional annotation beyond that already printed on the document—for example, in this case, directions to the school, or which child is on team “B 606 ”, and so forth. This can be either done later in the process through the system's user interface (e.g., one of the terminals 110 or 112 of FIG. 1 ), or, in an alternative embodiment, by allowing the scanning pen to write as well as read—the user writes additional “swipe” text himself.
- the name “Sam” 1016 is handwritten on the calendar.
- a handwritten note like this one can be used to further annotate the record of the September 6 game.
- the scanning pen used to input the other data on the calendar of FIG. 10 is also able to write on a hardcopy document (while simultaneously recording the physical gestures that make up the handwritten note), or to “mark up” a digital document such as a Web page.
- a previously-handwritten note can be scanned and digitized with a swipe of the scanning pen.
- this handwritten information after being converted to a machine-readable format via handwriting recognition or some other means of parsing gestural symbols, is associated with the scanned record and stored in the database 310 (FIG. 3 ).
- the pen When the pen is used to “mark up” a digital document, it should be noted that there is no need for the pen to actually scan any information in the underlying digital document, as the document is already in the digital domain. Rather, it is sufficient for the scanning pen to indicate to the system the location of each swipe, from which the underlying information can be extracted.
- the fifth calendar type a wedding announcement
- FIG. 11 The fifth calendar type, a wedding announcement, is shown in FIG. 11 .
- the user wishes to enter the event into the system.
- a scanning sequence to accomplish this could be:
- Swipes 1114 , 1116 , and 1118 specify the date and time of the event. Swipes 1110 , 11 12 , 1122 , and 1124 serve to annotate the event.
- the address is set forth in swipes 1120 , 1122 , and 1124 —this information can remain part of the annotation or can be extracted by the system as described below. Note that this further information can be displayed in a hierarchical fashion, concealing details until needed.
- the entire announcement of FIG. 11 (or at least an additional portion thereof) is scanned and stored as an image in the database 310 (FIG. 3) in addition to the information extracted and used as an event annotation as set forth above.
- This approach has the advantage that additional information in the document (such as the bride's name, for example) is accessible and can be made available, if necessary, even if it is not expected to be needed at the time the key data items are extracted.
- FIG. 4 An exemplary output calendar based on information derived from FIGS. 7-11 is set forth below. As discussed above, the format of this calendar is described by an output specification 422 (FIG. 4 ), and can be changed dependent on the user's preferences and on the desired level of detail.
- the entries such as the October 18 entry (“Rob Rudy, Snack Schedule”)
- the entire source document is digitized and stored in the database 310 , and is hence available for viewing, for example by selecting a hyperlink associated with the entry in a digital form of the output calendar.
- some of the entries such as the November 9 entry (“Marriage”), have only some of the scanned information visible. In the November 9 entry, for example, the address of the church is omitted.
- the additional annotations may be made available to the user via selectable options.
- some of the events i.e., the events September 6 and November 9) have an associated time. The time is set forth in the manner defined by the output specification 422 (FIG. 4 ); some output calendars may omit this information, if desired.
- the calendar 1210 is of a type that might be displayed on a terminal 110 (FIG. 1 ); it is contemplated that hardcopy calendars, like the one set forth above, would contain more information.
- the calendar 1210 represents a sample monthly calendar for a family that includes at least three family members: John, Henry, and Sylvia. A dental appointment 1212 for John is shown on Dec. 21, 1998.
- the display shows John's name, the event title, “Dentist Appointment,” as well as the time for the appointment, “9:30 a.m.”
- the date is illustrated by the placement of the appointment 1212 on the calendar 1210 .
- a meeting 1214 for Henry is shown on December 11; it has a start time (1:00 p.m.) and an end time (4:00 p.m.).
- two appointments are shown, a first appointment 1216 for Sylvia and a second appointment 1218 for John.
- the symbols “>>>” indicate that more information is available; the additional information may include information on the event title, the time, etc.
- the calendar 1210 is contemplated to be displayed electronically, the user is able to select either appointment 1216 or 1218 to view the additional information. In a hardcopy version of the same calendar, the additional data should be made available.
- the invention also includes a technique for analyzing a streaming data document, such as a voice recording, based on its recognizable genre structure, for example to change the document's form to better match its typical use.
- a streaming data document such as a voice recording
- the application set forth in detail below relates to answering machine or voice mail messages; the document structure is such that certain information in the messages, e.g., names and phone numbers, can be determined.
- the invention allows key information to be summarized, extracted, skipped to, or restructured so it is more useful to the recipient.
- the technique presented herein can be used as a complement to other speech recognition techniques. For example, it can be used to either skip through a long audio stream to the phone number, or it can be used to re-order a message such that the greeting and phone number are at the front of the message, and the message body and closing follow. If used in combination with existing telephone number extraction techniques, it can be applied to messages that have been understood or transcribed, both as a “sanity check” on certain key portions of the message and to bolster the overall accuracy of recognition. More particularly, one could use the inventive technique to localize key information in the document and then apply more sophisticated or time-consuming signal processing to that portion of the document.
- the medium is linear, and can only provide substantially sequential access.
- the inventive technique has the advantage of keeping access to the extracted portion of the message in the same medium in which the message was received (rather than, say, transcribing the message for random access).
- the phone number (or other predictable, genre-specific, information) can also be preserved in the caller's own voice, an aspect of the audio stream that provides the recipient with significant non-transcribable information.
- the genre structure makes it easy for the caller to interact with the device (this is evident in the ubiquity of basic message structure—it is easy to remember a time when phone messages varied quite a bit more), but this same structure makes it inconvenient for the recipient's use beyond the first listening. For example, long phone messages are frequently kept around just to preserve the phone numbers they contain (which are short and often located at the end of the message).
- the document structure is only partly determined by the genre: it is largely free-form. No preset or exact form is required by this aspect of the invention.
- audio content 1310 (typically a digitized data stream in any known format, such as pulse code modulation) is received (step 1312 ) by the system.
- this audio content can be received from a telephone device, a recording in a telephone answering device, a dedicated memorandum recorder, or from other sources.
- the audio message is then analyzed (step 1314 ) to identify its constituent parts. This can be performed in real time (e.g., as the message is being received), or after the message has been stored.
- voice recognition is performed on the message to isolate and identify all spoken words. Techniques for accomplishing this, including methods employing Hidden Markov Models, are well known in the art.
- the model used for voice recognition may be a general-purpose recognition model with a large vocabulary, or preferably may simply be able to identify a limited vocabulary of numerals and “cue words” (such as “at,” “is,” “am,” “name,” “number,” etc.).
- the analysis step simply identifies the pauses and some distinctive cue words in the message; this can be accomplished via simpler and less computationally-intensive pattern recognition techniques.
- the message analysis step is facilitated by guidance 1315 .
- guidance 1315 is provided in the form of a model or specification for typical voice messages. It should be noted that guidance 1315 is provided even when the message analysis step (step 1314 ) is fully automatic—guidance is inherent in the programming (including but not limited to an algorithm and voice model) that is able to recognize a vocabulary of spoken words, or in the preferred embodiment of the invention, pauses and cue words.
- a name (step 1316 ) and a telephone number (step 1318 ) are identified.
- some messages might not contain either item of information, but useful messages (from the standpoint of the invention) will contain both.
- information need not be solely derived from the audio message.
- an audio message on an office voice-mail system may have a message header accessible as digital data, containing the speaker's name and telephone extension. Similar information, or at least a telephone number, can also be derived from “Caller ID” data provided by the telephone system.
- the guidance 1315 is also useful in the identification steps (step 1316 and 1318 ), as it includes, in a preferred embodiment, models of the useful data expected to be found in a voice message, including information on the format (e.g., FIG. 18) and location (e.g., FIG. 14) of the data.
- the mechanics of the identification process, as well as some examples, will be described below.
- pointers to the data are stored with the audio message (step 1320 ). These pointers facilitate the ability to seek to desired portions of the message. For example, the need to call back an individual might not be apparent until a lengthy message has been entirely played. Using traditional voice mail systems, it can be inconvenient to go back and listen to the caller's name and number again, which may be somewhere in the middle of the message. However, when there are pointers to the callers name and number, commands can be provided to allow the user random access to certain points within the message (e.g., the portions when the caller's name and number are spoken).
- a command is received by the system (step 1324 ).
- This command may be to play the entire message (step 1326 ), to play only the caller's name (step 1328 ), or to play only the caller's number (step 1332 ).
- voice recognition technologies and the techniques presented herein are not infallible, so facilities are provided (steps 1330 and 1334 ) to have the system re-analyze the message (e.g., by adjusting parameters, selecting an alternate choice, or accepting user input, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 4) if the wrong portion of the message was chosen.
- the message and its pointers may be stored as part of the database 310 (FIG. 3 ); however, if full recognition has not been performed, it is likely that the system will not be able to index the information in any meaningful way without user intervention.
- Either the message as a whole, with pointers to interesting data, can be stored in the database, or only the name and number (for example, after the user has verified their correct extraction) can be selected for merger into the database.
- the extracted number can be dealt with in at least three different ways: it may be saved as a full audio stream (much as pen computers save unrecognized handwriting) and remain a transient form annotating the particular message; it may be saved to the database (with all or part of the greeting to identify the caller); or it can be recognized as numbers, and merged into the appropriate organizing construct (such as a calendar or electronic address book).
- This technique can also be used as an accelerator—a key on the phone keypad may be used to skip directly to the embedded phone number in a long message. In this scheme, not only does the audio stream remain unchanged; it also remains in the same medium for access.
- the extracted number is to become part of the recipient's less transient information base, it may be appropriate to use audio cues in the voice mail structure to attempt to extract the caller's name.
- This process again, may be automated, using heuristics that rely on the message genre and conventional structure (“Hi this is . . . returning your call”, for example), as well as a phonetic list of known names (with their spelled-out equivalents).
- a telephone message typically includes a salutation or greeting 1412 (e.g.
- message analysis can take place automatically, semi-automatically, or mostly manually.
- the words of the message are recognized (step 1510 ), isolated (step 1512 ), and stored (step 1514 ) as a transcription.
- Each transcribed word (which, in the case of a limited-vocabulary recognition model, might not be all of the words in the original message) is correlated with its position in the audio message.
- a Hidden Markov Model voice recognition method can be used to accomplish this.
- gaps or pauses within the message are identified (step 1610 ), cue words are identified (step 1612 ), and the positions of the cue words are stored (step 1614 ).
- names and phone numbers follow the cue words, so each candidate cue word can then be further considered to determine whether useful information follows.
- user input 1710 is received (step 1712 ), indicating the positions of interesting data. For example, the user may press a “number” button when he hears a phone number being spoken, and a “name” button when he hears the caller's name being announced.
- These manually-generated cues are associated with positions in the message (step 1714 ), and stored (step 1716 ). It should be noted that the positions of manually generated cues may be automatically adjusted backward in time to the nearest silent pause of a particular duration, since a user might not recognize a phone number and press the “number” button, for example, until it is nearly complete.
- Um I called because I'm looking for a book that was checked out to somebody who I believe was a summer student who was working with you—he gave your name—in 19-96. Um. Flavio Azevedo and the name of the book is “Doing with images makes symbols” by Alan Kay. Um. We are anxious to get it back and of course I suspect the worst. Again. I'm at 5-9-0-8. Talk to you later. Thanks. Bye.
- the messages follow a general form, as discussed above.
- Second, messages may lack any part of the general form, but usually are recognizable instances of the genre.
- Third, phone numbers embedded in the messages are close to the end and seldom contain noises like “umm” or “uhh”. They are usually strings of numbers, spoken quickly, sometimes with internal pauses. Many are of a known length. In three of the example messages, the phone numbers are signaled by “at”. A relatively small number of other cues may also be used, such as “that's” or “number.”
- the messages may contain other unambiguous clues about the kind of phone number found within: for example, the messages may contain a structured header which enables you to distinguish between internal and external messages. Finally, if the messages contain structured headers, the headers will remove some common types of numerical information from body (i.e. time and date). If they do not, the time and date are probably in the greeting, rather than after the body.
- Some of the complications we can observe from these examples include: messages which contain no phone number (e.g., example 5); phone numbers which are corrected or self-interrupted (“4-1-5—so I'm local—5-5-5-0-8-6-4”); and messages containing other numerical information (“Reloaded with 4-1-3”). Moreover, some phone numbers are of unpredictable length (some extensions are two to five digits long, and some international calls may come in).
- a well-formed telephone number 1810 often has the following characteristics, as illustrated in the model of FIG. 18 .
- the well-formed telephone number 1810 typically begins with a cue 1812 , such as “I'm at,” “my number is,” or simply “at” or “is. ” Following the cue, the U.S. area code 1814 is presented, if necessary. Then, frequently there is a pause 1816 , followed by the three-digit exchange prefix 1818 , another pause 1820 , and the remaining four digits 1822 of a seven-digit telephone number. Then, when there is a phone extension, another pause 1824 is frequently present, followed by another cue 1826 (such as “extension” or “room number”) and the extension 1828 .
- a document whether in physical or digital form, has a genre, which exists only within and relative to a social context.
- the notion of genre can be generalized, and in so doing, powerful new computational systems can be created.
- a collection of pre-existing input documents that includes documents from a plurality of different genres and potentially from a variety of different media.
- Each document in the collection includes various pieces of information.
- some coherent subset of these pieces of information, distributed across the various genres may form a consistent and coherent genre on its own, which can be synthesized and merged into a new document.
- This new document is of use to a particular user (or groups of users) for a particular purpose, typically at a particular time.
- the ways in which the pieces are combined can be a function of the reader(s), purpose, and time.
- this new document has its own genre, and the way in which the pieces of information are combined into the new document depends on that genre.
- This generalization and new conceptualization allows the consideration of a database system.
- a database system would facilitate the automated or semi-automated recognition of the appropriate pieces of significant information in input documents, extract these pieces from the documents, and merge or synthesize them into a unified computational representation or database.
- the computational representation can then be used to generate (re-present) an output in human-readable form (e.g., a digital display or physical printout) of a new document.
- human-readable form e.g., a digital display or physical printout
- the genre of the new document is the same whether that document is expressed in its (intermediate) computational representation or its (final) human-readable representation. Both of these are localized representations, in that all the significant information pieces have been conveniently gathered into one place, either digital or physical.
- At least one characteristic distinguishes a distributed-genre document from the raw materials that constitute its inputs.
- the inchoate form of the new output document includes not only some set of identified pieces of information still resident in multiple input documents, but also a “glue” that holds them together so that together, they provide a distributed representation of a new document (that can later be transformed into a localized representation).
- the “glue” consists of two main components, namely, social context and computation.
- a social context is defined by the intended reader(s), audience, or users of the output document, the purpose(s) for which it is being constructed, and the time at which it is being constructed. Additionally, social context is provided by the socially-constructed input and output document genres, which shape the intermediate distributed document genre, much as the dimensions of an input space and an output space affect the character of a matrix or tensor that transforms between the two spaces.
- the social context provides significant computational constraints.
- the human reader can provide hints, directives, and other guidance to the computational system of the invention.
- This information reflects the human's social context.
- the computational system includes models, heuristic algorithms, and/or other programming concerning input and output document genres and the relationships that allow information from certain input genres to be re-used in certain output genres.
- the human-provided guidance specific to the task at hand, and the largely pre-programmed description of genres, can provide an effective way to turn the user's understanding of social context into something that the system can process. This process is discussed in further detail below.
- a distributed genre document therefore includes several things beyond the “raw material” of the identified portions in the input documents. It also includes: a specification of input genres, output genres, and a mapping of information between these; a further explication of social context, specific to the user and task at hand; and a computational engine, suitably programmed, that has the capacity to represent all of the above. Only with all these things, taken together, does the distributed genre document emerge. In sum, the notion of distributed genre arises when a distributed collection of information derived from multiple diverse source documents is bound together in a meaningful way through computations representing social context.
- Each of these input documents comes from its own distinct genre; however, when the distributed genre formed by the calendar information found in each document is considered, a distributed genre is defined.
- the ultimate goal when analyzing this particular distributed genre might be to produce an integrated, up-to-date, full-month calendar incorporating all and only the events that household members plan to attend (see, e.g., FIG. 12 ).
- the collection of source documents is transformed from a jumble of raw source materials into a coherent, distributed-representation output document having a distributed genre via the interconnection provided by social context and by the human or computerized processing taking place in that social context.
- the social context is established by the particular group of readers in this household and by the purposes for which and timing with which they will use their new calendar, as well as by the (socially and culturally defined) genres of the input and output documents.
- the computation here takes advantage of and is facilitated—even enabled—by this social context.
- the computational system recognizes which portions of the input document are significant and how they fit together to make up the output document by taking into account:
- Time and other circumstances surrounding the computation itself notably including the date and perhaps other state variables, such as the geographic location or the content of the system's most recent calendar-type outputs.
- the intermediate distributed genre arises during the process of identifying dates and other useful information from the input documents. Soon thereafter, the computational system begins to form a localized, more unified output document, whose genre is the output genre specified by the user.
- An after-work networking opportunity yesterday evening has produced a fresh stack of business cards on the worker's desk, which may be scanned with a business card-scanner.
- Some of the business cards include Web site addresses.
- the worker browses the Web sites, follows a few links, and discovers more addresses worth including in the letter, like the one on the Web page belonging to a long-lost college classmate who's now a distinguished professor.
- a printed announcement received in this morning's mail brings news of an old acquaintance whose firm has merged with another firm, resulting in a new email address.
- the printed announcement is too large for the business-card scanner and is of the wrong document genre besides. It will need to be scanned separately on a flatbed scanner or digital copier.
- a colleague calls the worker from a cellular phone. As it turns out, the colleague is the passenger in a car whose driver has been meaning for some time to extend a dinner invitation to the worker. The colleague relays the driver's invitation, together with his email address, verbally to the worker, who transcribes the email address longhand on an ordinary piece of paper.
- a good many addresses of interest come from previously received email messages. Extracting the addresses is not as easy as one might suppose. While many of the addresses can be detected simply by examining the “From” header field of the messages, others cannot. Indeed, useful addresses can and do appear anywhere in an email message, including the main text, all headers, and signature lines. Furthermore, address formats may be inconsistent. For example, one system may format its email addresses with the human-readable name preceding the Internet name, the latter being enclosed in angle brackets. Another system may leave this information out, showing only the Internet name.
- the challenge for the computational system is to produce, from these disparate inputs, a single output document (namely, the worker's change-of-address message) that has all and only the desired addresses, preferably in a single, consistent format, placed in the “To” header field of the outgoing message.
- a single output document namely, the worker's change-of-address message
- Duplicate addresses should be eliminated, and no one inadvertently left out.
- the combined collection of electronic address book(s), digitally scanned business cards, old email messages and so forth is a collection of input documents in various genres and original media. Each contains one or more pieces of information to be recognized and extracted and merged by the system into an output document of specified genre for a particular user and purpose.
- the computational system reviews the various input documents together with the specification of the desired output genre and a set of hints or guidelines from the user, and identifies the relevant pieces of information from the input documents (as discussed in detail below). Again, as in the first example, the system also looks to the characteristics of the input genres and the relationships between these genres and the specified output genre to facilitate its task.
- a distributed-genre intermediate document is established across the input documents as the system begins to put together the output document (or, alternatively, as part and parcel of the construction of the output document). Eventually, the system constructs a unified computational representation of the new document, from which the output document can, in turn, be generated.
- the method of receiving and processing documents in various input genres is set forth in FIG. 19 .
- a collection of input documents (or any type of content 1910 at all) is input into and received by the system (step 1912 ).
- the input is then analyzed (step 1914 ), either automatically or semi-automatically (with user input) to identify the document's genre, thereby determining what information in the document may be significant. Exemplary automatic and semi-automatic methods for extracting information such as dates, times, addresses, and telephone numbers are discussed above.
- guidance 1915 is provided in the form of a set of models or specifications for all expected types of input documents. These models, templates, or specifications can be pre-coded, or alternatively, can be trained (e.g., with a Hidden Markov Model) on the basis of repeated user input choices.
- the guidance 1915 is provided even when the input analysis step (step 1914 ) is fully automatic; the requisite user input may have been provided earlier and used to shape genre models, or may be essentially hard-coded into the system. Moreover, in either case, the guidance 1915 represents the social context of the input documents.
- the significant information in the input documents is recognized in a manner consistent with the notion of the intermediate, distributed genre document as has been described.
- the genres of the input documents are considered, and stored information (e.g., models, heuristics, statistics, etc.) about their respective characteristics and their relations to the specified output genre are employed to help direct the analysis.
- stored information e.g., models, heuristics, statistics, etc.
- the nature of the output genre, user- or task-specific guidance, and various other factors may also be considered, such as the current time, date, and other state variables.
- the analysis process may require more information if the problem to be solved is insufficiently constrained.
- the significant information is then isolated and extracted (step 1916 ), and stored in (or “merged into”) a database (step 1918 ).
- the “significant information” is all discernable information in a source document; any and all information might be used in an output document of unknown genre.
- the generation of output is illustrated in connection with the flow chart of FIG. 20 .
- the generation of output involves re-presenting the unified computational representation (in the database) to the user as a human-readable document, either physical or digital, in a specified output genre.
- a human-readable document either physical or digital
- there is just one output document drawn from a potentially large number of input documents.
- there could be more than one output for example, it might be beneficial to generate, for example, a set of related calendar printouts, one for each person in a group, each one slightly different according to the individual recipient.
- the process begins by receiving (step 2010 ) a command 2012 indicating a request for an output document.
- This command 2012 identifies a particular desired output genre specification (step 2014 ) selected from a group of possible genre specifications 2016 .
- the information from the database required to construct the output document is extracted (step 2018 ), and a document consistent with the selected genre specification is generated (step 2020 ) and presented to the user.
- FIG. 22 illustrates a typical written or spoken time 2210 .
- An hour 2212 (1 through 12 in civilian time; 0 through 23 in military time) is followed by either an optional colon (:) and a number specifying minutes 2216 , or the phrase “o'clock.” 2214 .
- AM AM
- PM PM
- FIG. 23 shows a typical location 2310 ; this format is followed by the wedding invitation of FIG. 11.
- a cue 2312 such as “at,” is followed by a place name 2314 (e.g., “Saint Andrew's Episcopal Church”), an optional address number 2316 (e.g., “ 13601 ”), a street name 2318 (e.g., “Saratoga Avenue”), an optional suite or apartment 2320 (not applicable in FIG. 11 ), an optional city 2322 (e.g., “Saratoga”), and an optional state 2324 (“California”).
- place name 2314 e.g., “Saint Andrew's Episcopal Church”
- an optional address number 2316 e.g., “ 13601
- street name 2318 e.g., “Saratoga Avenue”
- an optional suite or apartment 2320 not applicable in FIG. 11
- an optional city 2322 e.g., “Saratoga”
- an optional state 2324 (“Californ
- the power and accuracy of the extraction can be increased.
- the possible input domain for a system according to the invention can also be greatly enhanced. Users today live in a world in which their information changes constantly; it can become out-of-date very rapidly. Moreover, users cannot control, and sometimes cannot even predict, the form or forms in which new information will arrive. In contrast with traditional relational databases, with their rigidly specified forms of input and carefully controlled data entry performed by dedicated workers, users of the present invention are generalists who live in a world of dynamic (and socially constructed) information that they must manage, but do not control.
- the present invention does not attempt to automate the entire process of producing the distributed genre document.
- the user will often need to provide considerable guidance to the computer about what is most important in a given input document.
- some automation is welcome, because the busy people who will use this technology at home and in the workplace often suffer from information overload. They want and deserve some labor-saving help.
- An automatic dishwasher still requires manual loading and unloading of the dishes, yet it can be a tremendous timesaver over hand washing. So, too, a semi-automated document analysis/synthesis system is worthwhile for the present invention.
- the techniques involve marking up the input documents: a human makes marks by hand in a way that the computational system can process automatically with little or no further human intervention thereafter.
- the contemplated approaches include, but are not limited to:
- Filtering By choosing which documents are to be presented to the system, the user filters the universe of documents and hence bounds the problem space and exerts an initial rough control over the system. Further analysis can operate semi-automatically.
- a paper calendar could be automatically synchronized with an online calendar.
- the calendar is first printed on paper. Over time, the paper is annotated with cross-outs for deleted appointments, arrows for moved appointments, and handwriting for new appointments. The paper copy can then be re-scanned, and re-synchronized with the electronic version.
- annotations for a given day are extracted, analyzed (via handwriting recognition), and inserted into an electronic calendar, which can then be re-printed if desired.
- the simpler tasks of moving and deleting appointments do not require recognition, just mark extraction as described in the '073 patent.
- Pen-based annotation At least two different user-pen interaction techniques can guide the system. First, either by using different pens, or by using different modes of a single pen (e.g. a pen which can use multiple colors), uses can use different forms of ink (either physical or virtual) to distinguish different forms of information, similar to how a highlighter is traditionally for some types of information and pencil for others. Second, by using a scanning pen, users can directly indicate which portions of the document have information of interest. The temporal order in which the lines are scanned, and the context of annotations made by the pen between such scans, can further guide the system. An example of this mode of operation is described in detail above, with particular reference to FIGS. 7-11.
- Modeling As discussed above, various models of extractable document types can be prepared and used, with the appropriate model being chosen via pattern-based recognition. Generally speaking, models can either be of highly stylized document forms, or may specify genre structure.
- FIG. 24 A block diagram illustrating the functional components of such a pen 2410 is set forth as FIG. 24 .
- a device includes an on-board processor 2412 , a data interface 2414 (such as an infrared or RF wireless link), an optical scanning head 2416 , manually operable controls 2418 (such as at least one push-button), a visual feedback mechanism 2420 (such as an indicator light or display screen), optionally an audio or tactile feedback mechanism 2422 , and on-board storage 2424 .
- a pen 2510 includes a traditional pen-shaped body 2512 , a bidirectional infrared transceiver 2514 , a scanning head 2516 , a push-button 2518 , and a display screen 2520 .
- the display screen 2520 is operable to confirm with the user at least two items of information: (a) recognized text under the scanning head 2516 , and (b) the pen's current mode.
- a scanning pen can be used to extract multiple items of information from a printed calendar, including an event title, a date, and a time. Different events are indicated by pressing the button 2518 .
- the scanning pen's mode comes into play as follows: after the button is pressed, the “resets” to expect a new batch of information.
- the various information items need not be scanned in any particular order, and can be identified by the system by virtue of the differing characteristics of the different data types.
- the pen may enforce a particular order to the fields to be entered (e.g., title first, then date, then time), and such requirements.can be indicated on the display screen 2520 .
- the system may be expecting information from a different genre, such as a business card.
- a display of the pen's mode can be used to indicate to its user both the expected genre of the input and the particular data items to be input, either collectively or in sequence.
- manual mode changes can be brought about by scanning a digital code printed in a mode book (FIG. 27 ).
- the screen 2520 is 1 to 2 inches in diameter. In this configuration, it is possible to read the screen as the pen 2510 is used to scan text on a printed page.
- the pen's mode is indicated by colored indicators, and scanned text is displayed on the screen as scrolling text.
- At the center of the screen is the current field of view; text already scanned appears to the left (or right, if a line is scanned from right to left).
- input is stored in the pen's storage 2424 until a command (such as holding down the button 2518 ) indicates that the data should be transmitted to the database 310 .
- the command to transmit may be initiated by the database 310 , rather than the user.
- FIG. 26 A scanning pen 2610 with an alternative form factor is illustrated in FIG. 26 .
- This version has a card-shaped body 2612 (preferably the size and shape of a credit card), a scanning head 2616 at one corner, and a button 2618 along its top edge.
- a display screen 2620 is situated on one side of the rectangular body; it is typically not visible while text is being scanned, but can be easily viewed when the pen 2610 is lifted from the paper.
- the pen also has multiple input buttons 2622 , capable of facilitating mode changes or command entry.
- a mode book 2710 usable to manually alter a scanning pen's mode, is illustrated in FIG. 27 .
- the mode book 2710 includes a plurality of mode cards 2712 , each of which contains at least one scannable data field operative to change the pen's mode or enter a command.
- Each scannable data field comprises machine-readable information (e.g., a bar code, a two-dimensional glyph code, or easily-recognizable text) and a human-readable label.
- the illustrated mode card 2712 includes nine data fields: a “begin date” field 2714 and a “begin time” field 2716 , an “end date” field 2718 and an “end date” field 2720 , a “location” field 2722 , a “description” (or title) field 2724 , and three command fields, to set a reminder 2726 , mark an event as urgent 2728 , or confirm existing information 2730 .
- the mode book 2710 is used as follows. If a user has been using his scanning pen 2410 to read business cards, for example, the system expects to receive data representative of a person's identity, office address, phone number, etc. However, if the user wishes to start inputting calendar information, there is no simple way to indicate that using simply the scanning pen. It is possible to use one or more input buttons to change the mode, but that method can be tedious and subject to error. Instead, using the mode book 2710 , the user locates the mode card 2712 pertaining to the calendar genre, and runs the scanning pen over the selected field, such as “begin date” 2714 . This indicates to the system that both a genre change and a mode change should occur.
- mode changes and genre changes are indicated and confirmed to the user by either audible or tactile feedback.
- audible beep codes or the like can be used to indicate that (a) the calendar genre is presently active, and (b) the system expects to receive a “begin date” next.
- unique tactile sensations implemented either by vibrating the pen body (as in a pager with a silent alarm) or by causing the scanning head 2416 to move in a manner simulating a texture on the paper being scanned, can express similar information to the user. Accordingly, the user need not look at the display screen 2520 or 2620 to confirm each and every mode change.
- FIG. 28 An exemplary interactive parasitic user terminal 2810 is illustrated functionally in FIG. 28 .
- the terminal 2810 includes at least an on-board processor 2812 , an imaging display 2814 , a data interface 2816 , and a power interface.
- Other features of the system which may be incorporated into the terminal 2810 include an input interface 2820 with buttons 2822 , a touchscreen 2824 , and a handwriting stylus 2826 , and an audio interface 2830 with an audio input 2832 and an audio output 2834 .
- the terminal has a low profile, and is adapted to be mounted to a wall, host appliance (such as a refrigerator), or other vertical surface.
- a host appliance such as a refrigerator
- the kitchen, and particularly the refrigerator is a common household meeting place. This is evidenced by the common practice of posting shopping lists, notes, and other documents to the refrigerator (or a nearby bulletin board) with magnets or push pins. Accordingly, there are advantages realized in placing a user terminal at a location where an entire family is likely to see messages, notes, and calendars. However, it should be recognized that other components of the system are more advantageously located elsewhere.
- a parasitic display terminal 2910 is mounted in cooperation with (and in an alternative embodiment, is structurally integral with) a specially adapted refrigerator 2912 .
- the refrigerator includes a power supply line 2916 running through the door, via a hinge, to the refrigerator's power source.
- This power supply line 2916 is coupled to the power interface 2818 of the terminal 2910 via a socket in the door of the refrigerator 2912 , which may also provide structural support to the terminal 2910 , or alternatively by an inductive coupler well known in the art.
- the terminal 2910 derives its power from the host refrigerator 2912 .
- the terminal 2910 is physically mounted to a host appliance, namely the refrigerator 2912 , no data interface is made directly between the host 2912 and the terminal 2910 . Accordingly, the terminal 2910 has no ability to display or otherwise indicate the status of its host, unless the host has the separate capability of transmitting its status to the remote CPU 212 (FIG. 2 ), which then passes information to the terminal 2910 .
- the primary purpose of the terminal 2910 is to provide user interaction with the system of the invention.
- a display screen 2920 , a stylus 2922 , a directional navigation pad 2924 , selection buttons 2926 , command entry buttons 2928 , and an audio interface are also present; these features are optional to the terminal, and are well known in the art.
- FIG. 30 An alternative version of the terminal is shown in FIG. 30 as a wall-mounted terminal 3010 .
- This terminal while otherwise similar to the version illustrated in FIG. 29, is physically mounted to a wall 3012 .
- a power supply line 3016 is coupled to a typical household power outlet 3018 .
- power can be received by the terminal 3010 either via an outlet, which may also provide structural support, or inductive coupling.
