- One or more third-party content providers may also use the content selection service to provide third-party content in conjunction with content from any number of first-party providers.
- the content selection service may dynamically select which third-party content is presented in conjunction with a first-party provider's content. For example, a first-party webpage may display different third-party content during different visits to the webpage.
- the content selection service may determine which third-party content is to be provided based on any number of factors (e.g., whether the third-party content and first-party content relate to the same topic). For example, a third-party advertisement for golf clubs may appear on a webpage devoted to reviews of golf resorts.
- the content selection service may also conduct a content auction to select the third-party content to be provided from among the various third-party content providers.
- third-party content selected by a content selection service may be interactive.
- the third-party content may be a playable video or audio file.
- the third-party content may be a clickable image (e.g., a hotlinked image) or hotlink configured to direct a web browser to an associated webpage when the image or hotlink is selected.
- the content selection service may receive an indication of the interaction. For example, the content selection service may receive an indication that a device clicked on a third-party image and was redirected to the third-party content provider's website.
- a content selection service may use data indicative of interactions with third-party content in a number of ways.
- the content selection service may allow third-party content providers to bid in an auction based on whether a user interacts with the selected content. For example, a third-party content provider may place a bid in the auction that corresponds to an agreement to pay a certain amount of money if a user interacts with the provider's content (e.g., the provider may agree to pay $3 if the user clicks on the provider's content).
- the content selection service may also use content interaction data to determine the performance of the first-party provider's content. For example, users may be more inclined to click on third-party content on certain webpages over others. Auction bids to place third-party content may be higher for high-performing websites, while the bids may be lower for low-performing websites.
- the user may be provided with an opportunity to control which programs or features collect such information, the types of information that may be collected (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, a user's current location, etc.), and/or how third-party content may be selected by a content selection service and presented to the user.
- Certain data such as a device identifier, may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters) used by the content selection service to select third-party content.
- a device identifier may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information about its corresponding user can be determined from it.
- a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a precise location of the user cannot be determined.
- location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a precise location of the user cannot be determined.
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content selection service.
- a content selection service may be configured to allow a third-party content provider to create one or more campaigns, such as an advertising campaign.
- the third-party content provider may set any number of parameters that control how and when the third-party content provider participates in a content auction.
- a campaign may include a bid amount on behalf of the content provider for use in a content auction.
- Other parameters may include selection parameters that control when the bid amount is used (e.g., whether or not the third-party content provider participates in a particular content auction).
- Selection parameters may include, but are not limited to, a set of one or more search keywords, a topical category, a geographic location of the client device on which the third-party content will be presented, or the type of client device on which the third-party content will be presented.
- a content selection service may suggest a bid amount to a third-party content provider that uses location-based selection parameters in content auctions.
- the suggested bid amount may be a bid modifier value that adjusts the auction bids of the provider based on the location of the client device. For example, the content selection service may suggest that an advertiser bid 25% more than his or her base bid if the device that would receive the advertisement is located within a mile of the advertiser's retail establishment.
- the suggested bid modifier value may be based on certain information received by the content selection service.
- the suggested bid modifier may be based in part on the likelihood of a patron completing a transaction after entering the physical establishment of the content provider, the average amount of a completed transaction in the establishment, the base bid amount used by the content provider, and/or the expected return on investment (ROI) of the content provider.
- the content selection service may generate multiple bid modifiers based on a probability of a user visiting the establishment of the third-party content provider.
- the content selection service may generate a suggested bid modifier of +25% to an advertiser's base bid if the client device is located within one mile of the establishment, a bid modifier of +20% if the client device is located between one and five miles of the establishment, etc.

- Content selection service 104 may be configured to allow third-party content providers to specify parameters as part of an account to control how and when the provider participates in content auctions.
- An account of a provider may include any number of bid-related parameters, such as a minimum bid amount, a maximum bid amount, a target bid amount, or one or more budget amounts (e.g., a daily budget, a weekly budget, a total budget, etc.).
- a bid amount may correspond to the amount the third-party provider is willing to pay in exchange for their content being presented at client device 102 .
- the bid amount may be on a cost per impression or cost per thousand impressions (CPM) basis.
- a bid amount may correspond to a specified action being performed in response to the third-party content being presented at a client device.
- a bid amount may be a monetary amount that the third-party content provider is willing to pay, should their content be clicked on at the client device, thereby redirecting the client device to the provider's webpage.
- a bid amount may be a cost per click (CPC) bid amount.
- the bid amount may correspond to an action being performed on the third-party provider's website, such as the user of client device 102 making a purchase. Such bids are typically referred to as being on a cost per acquisition (CPA) or cost per conversion basis.
- CPC cost per click
- An account created via content selection service 104 may also include selection parameters that control when a bid is placed on behalf of a third-party content provider in a content auction. If the third-party content is to be presented in conjunction with search results from a search engine, for example, the selection parameters may include one or more sets of search keywords. For example, the third-party content provider may only participate in content auctions in which a search query for “golf resorts in California” is sent to a search engine.
- Other parameters that control when a bid is placed on behalf of a third-party content provider may include, but are not limited to, a topic identified using a device identifier's history data (e.g., based on webpages visited by the device identifier), the topic of a webpage or other first-party content with which the third-party content is to be presented, a geographic location of the client device that will be presenting the content, or a geographic location specified as part of a search query.
- a selection parameter may designate a specific webpage, website, or group of websites with which the third-party content is to be presented. For example, an advertiser selling golf equipment may specify that they wish to place an advertisement on the sports page of an particular online newspaper.
- content selection service 104 may be configured to suggest a location-based bid modifier to a third-party content provider.
- a bid modifier refers to any adjustment value used by content selection service 104 to adjust an auction bid of a third-party content provider based on the location of the device to which the provider may send content.
- the bid modifier may be, for example, a percentage or dollar amount adjustment to the base auction bid of the content provider.
- content selection service 104 may present a bid modifier as part of a finalized bid amount (e.g., the service may present the modified bid amount to the provider).
- content selection service 104 may suggest that a third-party advertiser increase his or her auction bids by 75% for devices that are located within a certain range to the physical store of the advertiser.
- a location-based bid modifier may be used in conjunction with another location-based auction parameter.
- one auction parameter may control whether or not the provider even places a bid in a content auction (e.g., no bid may be submitted if the subject client device is outside of a predefined range to the provider's establishment), while a bid modifier value may control the submitted auction bid when the device is within the defined range.
- an advertiser may specify to content selection service 104 that he does not want to advertise to users that are located more than one hundred miles outside of San Francisco and may use a location-based bid modifier to increase his auction bids if a given user is within one mile of the advertiser's restaurant.
- Content selection service 104 may determine a location-based bid modifier using information received about the business of a third-party content provider.
- the received information may include, for example, data indicative of the physical location of the provider's establishment, the average transaction amount at the establishment, the likelihood of a visitor to the establishment completing a transaction, and/or the expected ROI of the provider from placing advertisements.
- content selection service 104 may calculate a location-based bid modifier based on the following calculations:
- A is the average transaction amount for the content provider's establishment
- p is the probability of a visitor to the establishment completing a transaction
- ROI is the expected ROI of the provider by placing an advertisement
- Expected_Revenues refers to the expected transaction amount of an average visitor to the establishment
- Cost is the final cost of the advertisement to the provider.
- ROI A * ⁇ p ( 1 + ⁇ ) ⁇ Bid which gives the following calculation for the bid modifier ( ⁇ ) that may be used by content selection service 104 :
- Content selection service 104 may present the calculated bid modifier to the third-party content provider as a suggestion (e.g., the provider may elect or decline the use of the suggested bid modifier).
- the calculated bid modifier may be suggested as part of a finalized bid amount. For example, instead of suggesting that a provider increase his or her base bid of $1 by 50%, content selection service 104 may alternatively suggest an increased bid amount of $1.50.
- content selection service 104 may take into account the likelihood of a user visiting a physical establishment when calculating a suggested bid modifier. For example, content selection service 104 may use the above calculation for the bid modifier ( ⁇ ) if there is a 100% probability of the user of client device 102 visiting the establishment of the third-party content provider (e.g., the location of client device 102 corresponds to the location of the establishment). However, as the user's location begins to differ from that of the establishment, the likelihood of the user visiting the establishment may also decrease. In one implementation, content selection service 104 may calculate one or more bid modifiers as a function of a travel value (r) as follows:
- BidM(r) is the bid modifier as a function of a travel value r.
- a travel value may be any value that represents spatio-temporal relationship between the location of a client device and a physical establishment of a third-party content provider.
- the travel value may correspond to a direct distance between the establishment and the client device (e.g., measured as the crow flies), a travel distance between the client device and the establishment (e.g., the distance along a path that may be traveled by the client device to arrive at the establishment), an estimated travel time, or any other measure quantifying a relationship between the location of a client device and the location of an establishment of a third-party content provider.
- Content selection service 104 may request information regarding the maximum travel value associated with the establishment of a third-party content provider. In other words, content selection service 104 may prompt a third-party content provider for the maximum distance or time that a potential customer would be willing to travel to the provider's establishment. For example, a potential customer of a build-it-yourself furniture outlet may be willing to travel up to sixty miles to visit the outlet, whereas a potential customer of a fast food restaurant may be willing to travel ten miles at maximum.
- Content selection service 104 may use the determined value of ⁇ to calculate the probability of a user visiting the establishment from any location relative to the establishment. In some implementations, content selection service 104 may use a discrete function to model the probability of a visit to the establishment. For example, content selection service 104 may determine the travel values corresponding to the 95%, 80%, 65%, 50%, 35%, 20%, and 5% probabilities of a visit and use these to determine ranges of travel values. In one example, users located within one mile of the establishment may be assigned a 95% probability of visiting the establishment, users located between one and five miles of the establishment may be assigned an 80% probability of visiting the establishment, etc.
- Content selection service 104 may provide one or more bid modifier values to a device associated with a third-party content provider as suggestions. For example, content selection service 104 may suggest the maximum bid modifier given the provider's responses and adjust the bid modifier downward for client devices located outside of a certain distance range (e.g., devices located within one mile of the provider's establishment may receive the maximum adjusted auction bid). In another example, content selection service 104 may present multiple bid adjustment values corresponding to different travel value ranges for review by the third-party content provider. In one implementation, content selection service 104 may automatically assign the generated bid adjustment value to the account of the third-party content provider.
- a third-party content provider specifies to content selection service 104 that a prospective customer is typically willing to travel up to sixty miles to visit the provider's physical store.
- content selection service may assign a minimum probability of a visit to this distance.
- content selection service 104 may assign a minimum probability of a visit to the store of 5% if a device is located sixty or more miles from the store.
- Content selection service 104 may also use these values to model the probability of a visit if a device is located within sixty miles of the store.
- ⁇ * [ A * ⁇ p ROI * ⁇ Bid - 1 ]
- A is the average transaction amount for the content provider's store
- p is the probability of a visitor to the establishment completing a transaction
- ROI is the expected ROI of the provider by placing an advertisement
- Bid refers to the base bid used by the provider.
- the bid modifier ⁇ * may represent the percentage increase to the provider's base bid amount for a device that has the highest probability of visiting the provider's store.
- content selection service 104 may discretize the exponential decay function to generate discrete bid modifiers based on a device's distance to the provider's store.
- content selection service 104 may adjust the provider's bid amounts upwards using one of the bid modifiers calculated above.
- Electronic display 116 is in electronic communication with processor 112 which causes visual indicia to be displayed on electronic display 116 .

- First-party webpage 206 may be devoted to one or more topics.
- first-party webpage 206 may be devoted to the local weather forecast for Freeport, Me.
- a content selection server such as content selection service 104 , may analyze the contents of first-party webpage 206 to identify one or more topics.
- content selection service 104 may analyze text 208 and/or images 210 - 216 to identify first-party webpage 206 as being devoted to weather forecasts.
- webpage data for first-party webpage 206 may include metadata that identifies a topic.
- content selection service 104 may select some of the content presented on first-party webpage 206 (e.g., an embedded image or video, etc.) or in conjunction with first-party webpage 206 (e.g., in a pop-up window or tab, etc.). For example, content selection service 104 may select third-party content 218 to be included on webpage 206 .
- one or more content tags may be embedded into the code of webpage 206 that defines a content field located at the position of third-party content 218 . Another content tag may cause web browser 200 to request additional content from content selection service 104 , when first-party webpage 206 is loaded.
- Such a request may include one or more keywords, a device identifier for client device 102 , or other data used by content selection service 104 to select content to be provided to client device 102 .
- content selection service 104 may select third-party content 218 for presentation on first-party webpage 206 .
- one or more content tags included in the webpage code for webpage 206 may cause web browser 200 to report location information to the content selection service as part of a content selection request.

- web browser 200 may relay location information to content selection service 104 via an API of a navigation program executed by client device 102 .
- web browser 200 may itself determine the location of client device 102 (e.g., web browser 200 may be configured to access location-determining hardware of client device 102 ).
- the location information reported by web browser 200 may be a network address or network access point that is used by content selection service 104 to determine a location of client device 102 .
- content selection service 104 may use a received IP address or a known WiFi hotspot to identify the location of client device 102 .
- Content selection service 104 may select third-party content 218 (e.g., an advertisement) by conducting a content auction, in some implementations. Content selection service 104 may also determine which third-party content providers compete in the auction based in part on account parameters set by the providers. For example, only content providers that specified a topic that matches that of webpage 206 , an interest category of a device identifier accessing webpage 206 , or a location associated with client device 102 may compete in the content auction. Based on bidding parameters for these third-party content providers, content selection service 104 may compare their bid amounts, quality scores, and/or other values to determine the winner of the auction and select third-party content 218 for presentation with webpage 206 .
- third-party content 218 e.g., an advertisement
- a location associated with client device 102 may be used by content selection service 104 to determine which third-party content providers participate in a content auction and/or to determine the bids of the auction participants.
- a third-party content provider may not even submit an auction bid if the location of client device 102 is outside of a specified geographic area (e.g., an advertiser may specify that he only wishes to advertise to devices located in California).
- the submitted bid may be a function of a location-based bid modifier (e.g., a base bid may be adjusted upward if the user is located in or near the establishment of the content provider).
- a bid modifier may be adjusted based in part on a travel value that defines a relationship between the location of client device 102 and a physical establishment of the content provider (e.g., a travel time, a travel distance, etc.). For example, content selection service 104 may generate a higher bid on behalf of a content provider if client device 102 is close to provider's establishment than if client device 102 is farther away from the establishment. In other words, one or more location-based bid modifiers may be used to determine the auction bid submitted on behalf of a third-party content provider for the ability to place content in the location of third-party content 218 .
- client device 102 is located several blocks away from the physical establishment, “The Local Burger Stand,” which is located at 3 Main Street.
- proprietor of the restaurant has created an account with content selection service 104 to advertise the restaurant.
- the proprietor of the restaurant accept a suggested bid modifier value that increases his auction bids by 50% for client devices that are located within half of a mile of the restaurant.
- the resulting auction bid may then be used by content selection service 104 to determine that the proprietor of the restaurant has won the content auction and select third-party content 218 (e.g., an advertisement for the restaurant) for presentation on webpage 206 .
- third-party content 218 e.g., an advertisement for the restaurant
- content selection service 104 may provide third-party content 218 directly to client device 102 .
- content selection service 104 may send a command to client device 102 that causes client device 102 to retrieve third-party content 218 .
- the command may cause client device 102 to retrieve third-party content 218 from a local memory, if third-party content 218 is already stored in memory 114 , or from a networked content source.
- any number of different pieces of content may be placed in the location of third-party content 218 on first-party webpage 206 .
- one user that visits first-party webpage 206 may be presented with third-party content 218 and a second user that visits first-party webpage 206 may be presented with different content.
- content selection service 104 may select content for display with first-party webpage 206 in a manner similar to that of third-party content 218 .
- content selected by content selection service 104 may be displayed outside of first-party webpage 206 .
- content selected by content selection service 104 may be displayed in a separate window or tab of web browser 200 , may be presented via another software application (e.g., a text editor, a media player, etc.), or may be downloaded to client device 102 for later use.
- client device 102 may access a first-party search engine via network 106 by executing a web browser 200 .
- the search engine may provide search results for display by client device 102 within a stand-alone application.
- a navigation application executed by client device 102 may include a search feature that allows search results from the search engine to be presented within the application.
- the first-party search engine accessed by client device 102 may provide a webpage 300 to client device 102 that is configured to allow for searches and search results to be updated on the fly.
- webpage 300 may include a search field 302 that receives a search query and webpage 300 may also display search results obtained using the query.
- search field 302 may be displayed separately from the search results (e.g., search field 302 and the search results may appear on different webpages, screens, etc.).
- Search field 302 is generally configured to receive one or more search terms to be searched by the search engine.
- the search term “restaurants” may be entered into search field 302 and used to search for links to online resources devoted to restaurants.
- a search query may be entered into search field 302 via a touch screen display, keyboard, a microphone (e.g., via voice recognition), or another user interface device of client device 102 .
- the search engine may retrieve any number of links to websites or other online services regarding the query. For example, the search engine may retrieve the URLs of websites devoted to the topic of restaurants and provide them as hyperlinks 308 , 310 on webpage 300 as search results. In some implementations, the search engine may maintain an index of keywords used on webpages or other resources. Search results may then be ordered by the search engine based on the relevancy of the indexed webpages relative to the search query. A summary of the webpage or other resource may also be provided on webpage 300 by the search engine. For example, hyperlink 310 may have an associated description 312 that gives more detail about the linked webpage. Since hyperlinks 308 , 310 are presented as search results based solely on their relevancy to the search query, they may be considered first-party content.
- webpage 300 may also include third-party content 304 selected by content selection service 104 .
- Third-party content 304 may be, in one example, a hyperlink 306 to a third-party content provider's website.
- Third-party content 304 may also identify itself as being third-party content, such as including a notification that the hyperlink is a paid link.
- Other forms of third-party content that may be presented in conjunction with search results may include a location (e.g., the location of the nearest restaurant to client device 102 ) or links to perform online actions, such as playing a piece of media content.
- Content selection service 104 may conduct a content auction to select third-party content 304 .
- content selection service 104 may first determine which third-party content providers are to compete in a content auction. For example, only third-party content providers that specify the search term “restaurants” may participate in the content auction.
- Another parameter may also be used to control which third-party content providers participate in the auction includes the geographic location of client device 102 . Such a geographic location may correspond to a particular city, zip code, state, country, or other area. For example, a third-party advertiser located in Great Britain may only be interested in advertising to client devices located there and not in the United States of America.
- a location-based bid modifier may be used by content selection service 104 to generate a content auction bid on behalf of a third-party content provider.
- the bid modifier may adjust a base bid of a third-party content provider up or down based on a travel value that relates the location of client device 102 to a physical establishment of the content provider. For example, a base bid amount of $1 may be adjusted by +50% (e.g., to a final bid of $1.50) if client device 102 is within one mile of the nearest establishment of the third-party content provider. In another example, the base bid amount may be adjusted upward if client device 102 is determined to be within five minutes travel of the provider's physical establishment.
- third-party content 304 may be an advertisement for the restaurant, “The Local Burger Stand” if the bid modifier used by the proprietor of the restaurant and the distance between client device 102 and the restaurant are such that the proprietor has won the content auction.
- process 400 includes receiving data indicative of a likelihood of a patron of a physical establishment completing a transaction (step 402 ), receiving an average transaction amount for the establishment (step 404 ), receiving an expected ROI (step 406 ), receiving a base auction bid amount (step 408 ), calculating a content placement cost for an average transaction (step 410 ), determining a location-based auction bid modifier (step 412 ), and providing the bid modifier for display (step 414 ).
- Process 400 may be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as content selection service 104 shown in FIG. 1 .
- process 400 allows a third-party content provider, such as an advertiser, to determine a location-based bid modifier for use in a content auction.
- process 400 includes receiving data indicative of a likelihood of a patron of an establishment completing a transaction at the establishment (step 402 ).
- a transaction may be any form of action performed by a visitor to the establishment that is desired by the third-party content provider.
- a transaction may be, but is not limited to, a patron of the establishment making a purchase, signing a lease agreement, signing up for a marketing list, signing up for a membership, voting, donating blood, or performing any other action that may be desired by the third-party content provider.
- an online advertiser may specify to a content selection service that, on average, 80% of the visitors to the advertiser's physical store complete a purchase.
- the received likelihood may correspond to any time period or multiple time periods, in various implementations.
- the received likelihood of a completed transaction may be an overall average for the content provider or for a specific time period.
- the likelihood of a completed transaction at the establishment may be higher during a holiday or sales event than during other time periods.
- multiple likelihood values may be received corresponding to the different time periods.
- the received data may include the raw data used by content selection service 104 to calculate the likelihood value such as the raw number of visitors to the establishment and the number of completed transactions.
- process 400 includes receiving data indicative of an average transaction amount for the establishment (step 404 ).
- An average transaction amount may be a dollar amount associated with a completed transaction or any other amount that quantifies the value of a completed transaction to the third-party content provider. For example, a furniture retailer may specify that the average transaction amount at her retail location is $2,500 while the proprietor of a hamburger stand may specify that the average transaction amount at his restaurant is $5.
- process 400 includes receiving data indicative of an expected ROI (step 406 ).
- the specified ROI may correspond to a difference between an amount spent by a content provider to place third-party content and an expected transaction amount that resulted from the placement.
- the specified ROI may correspond to the following:
- ROI Expected_Revenues Cost
- Expected_Revenues is an expected transaction amount that would result from a placement of third-party content and Cost is the cost of the placement. For example, if an advertiser spends $0.50 to place an advertisement and the advertisement results in a $5 purchase, the ROI of the provider is $4.50.
- the expected transaction amount may be based on an average transaction amount for the establishment combined with a probability of a patron of the establishment completing a transaction.
- process 400 includes receiving data indicative of a base auction bid amount (step 408 ).
- the base bid amount may correspond to a bid amount that a content provider is willing to pay to place content on a client device, regardless of the location of the client device. For example, a content provider may be willing to pay $1 to place an advertisement on a mobile device, regardless of the location of the mobile device.
- Another location-based content selection parameter may also control whether or not the base bid amount is even submitted on behalf of a content provider.
- a content provider may set a parameter that specifies that advertisements are to be provided to devices located in California only and a base bid of $1 to advertise to devices in California, regardless of their proximity to the provider's establishment.
- the base bid amount may take into account other non-location based content selection parameters.
- the base bid amount may correspond to an amount an advertiser is willing to bid if the client device is a mobile device that runs a particular operating system.
- process 400 includes calculating a content placement cost for an average transaction (step 410 ).
- the content placement cost may correspond to the amount of money that a third-party content provider agrees to pay a content selection service for the ability to provide the provider's content to a client device.
- the content placement cost may be a content auction bid amount used by the content selection service to select the provider's content for placement at a client device.
- the content placement cost may be calculated using the data indicative of the likelihood of a completed transaction, the average transaction amount, and the expected ROI received in steps 402 - 406 .
- the content placement cost may be calculated by solving the following:
- Cost A * ⁇ p ROI
- A is the average transaction amount for the content provider's establishment
- p is the probability of a visitor to the establishment completing a transaction
- ROI is the provider's expected ROI for providing third-party content via the content selection service.
- process 400 includes determining a bid modifier (step 412 ).
- a bid modifier ( ⁇ ) may be determined using the cost calculated in step 410 as follows:
- ⁇ Cost Bid - 1
- Cost is the ROI-dependent cost
- Bid is the base auction bid received in step 408 .
- the bid modifier is location-based in that it assumes a 100% probability of the user visiting the physical establishment (e.g., the user is already located in or near the establishment). For example, assume that the average transaction at an establishment is $5, that 90% of visitors to the establishment complete a transaction, that the advertiser has an expected ROI of $4, and that the advertiser wishes to place a base bid of $1. In such a case, the actual cost of a content placement to the advertiser is $1.125 and the bid modifier is 0.125 or 12.5%. In other words, the advertiser should increase her base bid by 12.5% (e.g., for a final bid amount of $1.125) to achieve her expected ROI.
- process 400 includes providing the bid modifier for display (step 414 ).
- the bid modifier determined in step 412 may be provided to a computing device associated with the third-party content provider.
- the content selection service may suggest that a content provider increase his or her base bids by 12.5% for certain devices.
- the content selection service may prompt the provider to accept the bid modifier before using the calculated value.
- the content selection service may automatically use the bid modifier in future content auctions and provide a notification to the content provider.
- a bid modifier calculated via process 400 may correspond to a client device that has a 100% probability of visiting the physical establishment of the content provider.
- the bid modifier determined via process 400 may be used for client devices that are located in or near the establishment.
- the bid modifier calculated via process 400 may be adjusted further based on a travel value.
- one or more bid modifier values may be calculated by multiplying the bid modifier from process 400 by a probability that a user will visit the provider's establishment. The probability of a visit may be a function of the amount of travel time to the establishment by the device, the distance along a path separating the device and the establishment, a direct distance separating the establishment and the device, or any other travel value that relates the location of the device to the location of the establishment.
- the probability of a visit to the establishment may be modeled using a discrete, exponential decay function. For example, the probability of a user visiting the physical establishment of a third-party content provider may be treated as 100% within one mile of the establishment, 80% if the user is between one mile and five miles of the establishment, etc., up to a maximum travel value threshold specified by the third-party content provider.
- a client device may be located within a predefined travel value range to multiple establishments of the content provider.
- the content selection service may determine a bid modifier for each of the establishments within the travel value range and select the highest bid modifier for use. For example, assume that the client device is located five miles away from the nearest restaurant of the content provider and twenty miles away from the next closest restaurant of the provider. Also, assume that the content provider specifies that a typical user is willing to drive up to 50 miles to eat at one of the provider's restaurants. In such a case, the calculated bid modifier for the closer restaurant may be higher and the selection service may use the modifier to generate the finalized auction bid.
- the content selection service may select the establishment with the lowest travel value for analysis. In yet another implementation, the content selection service may take into account other factors in the comparison, such as whether the user typically visits one of the two establishments, drives by one of the two establishments, etc.
- a client device may be located at location 504 and a physical establishment may be located at location 502 .
- the client device located at location 504 may report its location to a content selection service as part of a content selection request.
- client device 102 shown in FIG. 1 is located at location 504 .
- client device 102 may provide data indicative of location 504 to content selection service 104 as part of a request for third-party content.
- a content selection service may determine a travel value using the location data received from the client device located at location 504 .
- the travel value may be any value that relates locations 502 and 504 .
- the travel value may be a function of a radius 506 (e.g., a direct distance value) separating locations 502 and 504 .
- the travel value may be a distance along a path 508 that separates locations 502 and 504 .
- path 508 may correspond to the path that the user located at location 504 may actually travel to arrive at the establishment located at location 504 .
- Path 508 may be determined as a shortest path or may also take into account other factors, such as one-way streets, traffic, and other such factors that may affect how a user is likely to travel to location 502 .
- the content selection service may determine a mode of transportation for the client device and use this information to determine path 508 . For example, the content selection service may determine that the client device is traveling in an automobile based on its velocity and/or location (e.g., in the middle of the street). Other forms of transportation that may be determined by the content selection service may include walking, public transportation (e.g., busses, trains, etc.), or the like.
- the travel value determined by the content selection service may be a travel time relating locations 504 and 502 .
- the content selection service may estimate the amount of time that it would take an automobile at location 504 to travel along path 506 to arrive at the establishment located at location 502 .
- the travel value may be based in part on a determined mode of transportation (e.g., walking vs. driving, etc.) and/or other factors that may affect the travel time (e.g., traffic, detours, etc.).
- the content selection service may use a travel value that relates locations 504 and 502 to determine a probability of the user located at location 504 visiting the physical establishment located at location 502 after viewing third-party content associated with the establishment.
- content selection service 104 shown in FIG. 1 may determine the probability of the user of client device 102 located at location 504 visiting the restaurant at location 502 after viewing an advertisement for “The Local Burger Stand.”
- the visit probability may be modeled as a decay function, such as an exponential decay function, a linear decay function, or any other decay function in which the probability of a visit decreases as the travel value increases.
- the decay function may also be a discrete function in which ranges of travel values are assigned the same visit probability.
- the visit probability may be 80% if the client device at location 504 is between ten and twenty miles away from location 502 .
- a visit probability determined by a content selection service may be used by the service to determine a bid modifier. For example, assume that the service has calculated a bid modifier of +20%, assuming that the client device is located at location 504 (e.g., the user is already in the establishment). Thus, the calculated bid modifier may be at a maximum since there is a 100% probability of the user visiting the establishment. However, if the location of the client device does not match that of the physical establishment of the content provider, or is outside of a certain range, the content selection service may adjust the bid modifier using the visit probability. For example, assume that the travel distance along path 508 is 0.75 miles and that the associated probability of a visit at this distance is 85%.
- the content selection service may adjust the maximum bid modifier downward to reflect the lower probability of a visit.
- an interface screen 600 may prompt a user associated with a third-party content provider for certain information used to determine a suggested bid modifier.
- 600 may be used to modify an account of the third-party content provider with a content selection service.
- Interface screen 600 may include one or more inputs 602 for the location or locations of the content provider's physical establishments. For example, “The Local Burger Stand” may be located at 3 Main Street, Anywhere U.S.A. In other implementations, interface screen 600 may employ other input mechanism to receive multiple locations. For example, interface screen 600 may include multiple input boxes, a selectable map, a mechanism to upload a file (e.g., a text file, spreadsheet, or other file containing establishment locations), or other inputs to enter the locations of a content provider's physical establishments.
- a file e.g., a text file, spreadsheet, or other file containing establishment locations
- Interface screen 600 may include an input 612 configured to receive a maximum travel value.
- interface screen 600 may also include an input 614 configured to receive a travel value type, if the content selection service supports multiple travel values.
- the third-party content provider may specify via inputs 612 , 614 that a typical user is willing to travel up to ten miles to the provider's physical establishment located at 3 Main Street.
- Other example travel value types that may be selected via input 614 may include, but are not limited to, direct distances, distances along a travel path, travel times, or the like.
- the content selection service may use the inputs received via inputs 602 , 612 , and 614 to model a probability of a user visiting the location specified via input 602 .
- the travel value received via input 612 may be associated with a minimum visit probability
- the location received via input 602 may be associated with a maximum visit probability
- one or more probabilities there between may be modeled as a function of the travel value.
- Interface screen 600 may include various inputs 604 - 610 that request information regarding the business of the third-party content provider.
- input 604 may be configured to request an average transaction amount at the physical establishment specified via input 602 .
- Input 606 may be configured to receive a value that represents the likelihood of a visitor to the establishment completing a transaction (e.g., a probability or other value).
- Input 608 may be configured to receive a base bid amount that the third-party content provider wishes to use for devices located outside of the maximum travel value specified via input 612 .
- Input 610 may be configured to receive an expected ROI of the third-party content provider that would result from the placement of the provider's third-party content.
- Interface screen 600 may include an input 618 configured to cause the content selection service to calculate one or more bid modifiers, when selected.
- interface screen 600 may display a set 620 of one or more bid modifiers that are based in part on the data received via inputs 604 - 610 .
- the content selection service may use a visit probability function to determine multiple bid modifier values.
- a discrete visit probability model may have probabilities corresponding to different distance ranges in set 622 shown on interface screen 600 . The visit probabilities associated with the different travel ranges in set 622 may be used to determine overall bid modifiers 624 - 634 that are functions of the travel distances.
- bid modifier 624 may correspond to the maximum visit probability (e.g., the user may be the most likely to visit the establishment when located within a mile of the establishment).
- bid modifier 634 may indicate that the base bid amount specified via input 608 is suggested for use when the client device is located more than ten miles from the physical establishment. For example, the content provider may still wish to advertise to users located outside of the maximum travel distance, but only use a base bid amount since the advertisement is unlikely to prompt the user to visit the establishment immediately.
- bid modifiers 624 and 634 may be any number of other bid modifiers that represent a sliding scale of visit probabilities that vary with the travel distance.
- bid modifier 626 may correspond to an 80% visit probability while bid modifier 632 may correspond to a 10% visit probability.
- Bid modifiers 624 - 634 may be processed in a number of ways by the content selection service.
- the content selection service may automatically apply bid modifiers 624 - 634 to the entire account of the content provider, a campaign of the content provider, a content group (e.g., one or more pieces of third-party content) of the content provider, or to a specific piece of third-party content of the provider.
- the content selection service may allow the third-party content provider to confirm the use of one or more of bid modifiers 624 - 634 .
- the content provider may elect to use bid modifier 624 when the client device is located within one mile of the provider's establishment, but may elect not to use bid modifiers 626 - 630 at all.
- only bid modifier 624 may be presented to the third-party content provider and interface screen 600 may indicate that the bid modifier will be adjusted downward as the travel value increases.

Abstract
Description
where A is the average transaction amount for the content provider's establishment, p is the probability of a visitor to the establishment completing a transaction, ROI is the expected ROI of the provider by placing an advertisement, Expected_Revenues refers to the expected transaction amount of an average visitor to the establishment, and Cost is the final cost of the advertisement to the provider. The cost of a content placement may be defined as follows:
Cost=(1+β)Bid
where Bid is the base auction bid used by the content provider (e.g., an auction bid that the provider wishes to use when a device is outside of a given range to the provider's establishment) and β is a location-based bid modifier value. Thus:
which gives the following calculation for the bid modifier (β) that may be used by content selection service 104:
where BidM(r) is the bid modifier as a function of a travel value r. In general, a travel value may be any value that represents spatio-temporal relationship between the location of a client device and a physical establishment of a third-party content provider. In various implementations, the travel value may correspond to a direct distance between the establishment and the client device (e.g., measured as the crow flies), a travel distance between the client device and the establishment (e.g., the distance along a path that may be traveled by the client device to arrive at the establishment), an estimated travel time, or any other measure quantifying a relationship between the location of a client device and the location of an establishment of a third-party content provider.
P(r)=e −λr
where r represents the travel value associated with the establishment and λ is an unknown parameter. In other words,
P(r)=P(10)=0.05=e −λ10
P(distmax)=e −λ*dist
where distmax is the maximum distance specified by the content provider and 5% is the minimum probability of a visit to the store as a function. Solving for λ gives the following:
BidM(r)=β*P(r)=β*e −λr =β*e −r*0.499
where β* is the bid modifier for a device that is within the closest distance to the store.
where A is the average transaction amount for the content provider's store, p is the probability of a visitor to the establishment completing a transaction. ROI is the expected ROI of the provider by placing an advertisement, and Bid refers to the base bid used by the provider. In other words, the bid modifier β* may represent the percentage increase to the provider's base bid amount for a device that has the highest probability of visiting the provider's store. Continuing the example,
BidM(r)=β* if 0<r≦1
BidM(r)=0.8β* if 1<r≦4
BidM(r)=0.65β* if 4<r≦9
BidM(r)=0.5β* if 9<r≦14
BidM(r)=0.35β* if 14<r≦21
BidM(r)=0.2β* if 21<r≦32
BidM(r)=0.15β* if 32<r≦60
BidM(r)=0 if 60<r
Thus, if
where Expected_Revenues is an expected transaction amount that would result from a placement of third-party content and Cost is the cost of the placement. For example, if an advertiser spends $0.50 to place an advertisement and the advertisement results in a $5 purchase, the ROI of the provider is $4.50. In some implementations, the expected transaction amount may be based on an average transaction amount for the establishment combined with a probability of a patron of the establishment completing a transaction.
where A is the average transaction amount for the content provider's establishment, p is the probability of a visitor to the establishment completing a transaction, and ROI is the provider's expected ROI for providing third-party content via the content selection service.
where Cost is the ROI-dependent cost and Bid is the base auction bid received in
