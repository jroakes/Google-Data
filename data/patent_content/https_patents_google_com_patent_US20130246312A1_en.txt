- This document describes methods, processes and systems for providing information, including a label that identifies an estimated size and/or price associated with a data transfer of a resource.
- a label that identifies an estimated size and/or price associated with a data transfer of a resource.
- the responsive search results can include size estimate labels.
- the labels for example, can provide the user with a size estimate and/or a price estimate.
- the estimates can indicate to the user a relative size or cost associated with a transfer of data if the user selects the search result, thus causing the corresponding resource to be downloaded to the user's phone.
- Size estimates can be absolute (e.g., an actual numbers of bytes or bits), relative (e.g., “small,” “medium” or “large”), or presented in other ways.
- Price estimates can be based on the size estimates and may vary depending on the user's phone and/or data plan, the time of day, the location of the user, and other factors. Based on the information presented, the user may decide whether or not to select a particular search result, e.g., if downloading the corresponding resource is worth the estimated price (or is affordable by the user). Users can use the size estimate labels to control costs, e.g., down to the penny (or the user's local currency).
- the size estimate labels may not be presented with the search results, but the information may be made available to the user automatically or upon user initiation.
- the user can use a control on the user device to prompt the display of the label information (e.g., the user may hover over the search result, and the corresponding size estimate label can be displayed).
- the user can select a particular search result, and instead of automatically downloading the resource, a size estimate label can be presented to the user. In this example, the user can make a choice, based on the displayed information, whether or not to proceed with the download.
- the information labels can be provided in other situations where data is attempted to be loaded in, for example, a metered data network.
- the information label can be presented in conjunction with the selection of a resource on a page or with any request for data over the metered data network.
- an information label can be provided as part of the contents that are displayed to a user, where labels can be provided for each reference to a resource (e.g., a link on a page).
- a sacheting system can be used, e.g., to remove financial uncertainty for the user.
- a third party e.g., a content provider
- the guaranteed rates can be realized by arranging with carriers to establish set rates for transmission to users associated with the carrier, e.g., to effectively bundle rates for large groups of users.
- a spot market opportunity can be supported. For example, if a carrier's traffic is underutilized, estimates for traffic to be transferred over the network associated with the carrier can be lowered automatically, e.g., so as to encourage data transfers in the network.
- estimated sizes and prices mentioned herein are described using examples of data transfers in the form of downloads of resources, other data transfers are also within the scope of this disclosure.
- the same or different sizes and prices can be associated with re-publishing content, such as if the user decides to share content with other users.
- the user can be presented with a label associated with re-publishing the content and can make the decision to re-publish or not based on the estimated price.
- third-party sponsors can sponsor organic content page downloads that are free to the user, e.g., removing any financial concerns that the user may have about being able to afford the airtime or bandwidth costs of accessing the content over a metered network. For example, such organic content pages that are free for downloading by the user can be marked with a zero-cost label and/or highlighted in some other way.
- the third-party sponsors can target specific countries, user groups and/or content types. For example, a private foundation may be interested in sponsoring public health content to certain groups of people in Africa or other regions.

- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- the content management system 110 can generate search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- the search results page can include, for example, additional information in the form of one or more labels related to a size and/or price associated with accessing a noted resource.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- the environment 100 can include plural data stores.
- a data store of historical data 123 can store, for each resource 105 that has been downloaded within the environment 100 , the size of the resource (e.g., in bytes or bits).
- the size information can be stored each time a user selects a search result 118 , thereby initiating the download of the associated resource 105 .
- resources 105 can change over time in size and content, some implementations of the historical data 123 can store the size of the most recently-loaded version of the resource 105 , an average size of the last few downloads (e.g., the last 2-10), or some other representative size.
- a data store of data plans 121 can include information about each user's rate information, which can include, for example, a price per N bytes of downloaded resources and/or air time.
- the data plans 121 can be assembled from information provided through partnerships or arrangements with various carriers or any other service providers that provide access to resources 105 by users.
- the environment 100 can include a proxy system 130 that operates within a metered data network 140 to provide (and track the delivery of) content according to agreed-upon rates.
- the proxy system 130 can include plural engines.
- a size engine 122 can determine an estimated size for a particular resource, e.g., by using past download size information for the resource in the historical data 123 or by loading the resource in real time.
- a price engine 124 can use the estimated size to determine an estimated price associated with the download.
- the price that is determined for each user can be based on information for that user in the data plans 121 .
- a label engine 126 can generate labels using size information from the size engine 122 and price information from the price engine 124 .
- the label engine 126 can generate a label that indicates uncertainty about the size and price.
- a message engine 128 can generate any needed messages that can, for example, be provided with price estimate labels that the user sees.
- the proxy system 130 can use information from a delivery system 150 to provide labels.
- Example delivery systems 150 include phone, Internet and broadband providers and/or carriers.
- the price engine 124 can match an estimated size (e.g., determined by the size engine 122 ) with information from the user's data plan 121 to determine an estimated price of the download.
- the label for a 59 kb resource e.g., estimated using historical information
- can include corresponding and/or proportional size and price estimates e.g., “59 kb. (about 1 GH ⁇ airtime)”.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect or use the personal information (e.g., information about a user's account).
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram of an example system 200 for providing a label with a search result that indicates an estimated size of a data transfer of a corresponding resource.
- labels 204 a and 204 b can provide size information 206 for the data transfer of each resource associated with search results 118 a and 118 b , respectively.
- the size information 206 can include, for example, an estimated price (e.g., in the user's local currency) of a data download or access, an estimated size (e.g., in bits or bytes) of the corresponding resource, or some combination of price- and size-related information.
- the search results 118 a and 118 b for example, can be provided to the user device 106 by the content management system 110 in response to the query 116 , as described above.
- the estimate of the size and/or price can include determining a size based at least in part on historical data 123 . For example, if the resource associated with the search result 118 a has in the past averaged 58 Mbytes of data, then the size engine 122 can use this information in estimating a size for any subsequent download. In some implementations, the price engine 124 can use the estimated size to determine an estimated price associated with the download. The label engine 126 can use either or both of the size and price estimates to generate the labels 204 a and 204 b.
- the proxy system 130 can use information from the delivery system 150 to provide labels.
- the price engine 124 can match an estimated size (e.g., determined by the size engine 122 ) with information from the user's data plan 121 to determine an estimated price of the download.
- labels 204 a and 204 b can provide size information 206 for the data transfer of each resource associated with search results 118 a and 118 b , respectively.
- the size information 206 can include, for example, an estimated price (e.g., in local currency) of a data download or access, an estimated size (e.g., in bits or bytes) of the corresponding resource, or some combination of price- and size-related information.
- the search results 118 a and 118 b can be provided to the user device 106 by the content management system 110 in response to the query 116 , as described above.
- the message engine 128 can generate messages that can be provided with the size information 206 provided to the user. For example, if the user's data plan and current usage indicate that the user is approaching (or has exceeded) a threshold, then the message engine 128 can generate an informational message that is also displayable on the user device 106 . In some implementations, messages can be displayed in a search results area or can otherwise be available (e.g., as an additional alert icon that is displayed with the size information and that, when hovered over or selected, displays a message to the user). In some implementations, messages displayed to the user can identify the user's current charges and/or remaining data transfer capacity for a current time period.
- FIG. 2B shows an example presentation of a label 204 c that is presented after a resource is selected but before the resource is optionally loaded.
- search results 118 c and 118 d when initially displayed on the user device 106 , may not include estimated size information.
- the size information e.g., the label 204 c
- the size information is presented after the user elects to load the resource (e.g., by clicking on or otherwise selecting the search result 118 ).
- a warning screen or prompt can be presented to the user in response to selection of a resource which includes the size/price information. Additional selection or default action/inaction may be required in order to initiate the load of the resource.
- the size information is presented if the user uses a control, such as a control that is activated when a cursor hovers over the search result 118 c .
- a control such as a control that is activated when a cursor hovers over the search result 118 c .
- Other controls are possible.
- the size information can be presented, by including the label 204 c in a popup 208 .
- Search result 118 d shows an example search result for which the user has not yet selected the resource.

- search results 304 a - 304 c include labels 308 a - 308 c corresponding to increasing data transfer sizes (e.g., 59, 172 and 1435 kb).
- the labels 308 a - 308 c include size components 310 a - 310 c and price components 312 a - 312 c , respectively.
- the price components 312 a - 312 in this example indicate an estimated price associated with the corresponding data transfer of the associated resource that the user can initiate (e.g., if the user believes the data transfer is worth the cost).
- prices associated with downloading data can be displayed in a local currency.
- a local currency For example, if the user is currently located in Ghana (e.g., as determined from global positioning system (GPS) capabilities of the user device), then the price component 312 a can indicate an estimated price of “about 1 GH ⁇ airtime” (e.g., expressed in Ghana Cedi).
- the currency or currencies in which estimated prices are displayed to the user can be a preferred currency of the user, the user's currency-of-record associated with a phone or data plan, or some user-configurable one or more currencies.
- Price estimates associated with the other search results 304 b and 304 c can be greater, e.g., “about 3 GH ⁇ airtime” for 172 kilobytes of data and “about 27 GH ⁇ airtime” for 1435 kilobytes of data.
- the information provided in price components 312 a - 312 c is slightly different than the price components described with reference to FIG. 3A .
- absolute price values e.g., 1, 3 and 27 GH ⁇ of airtime
- general descriptions or categories are used.
- the price components 312 a - 312 c can indicate that the expected prices associated the downloading the resources are categorized as “low,” “medium” or “high cost to download,” respectively.
- the way in which the size components 310 a - 310 c and the price components 312 a - 312 c are presented can change (e.g., by using color-coding or other techniques) based on the relative size and/or price.
- the size component 310 a and the price component 312 a for the smaller resources can be displayed in blue or green (e.g., indicating a smaller price), and increasingly hotter colors (e.g., shades of yellow and red) can be used to display size components and price components of increasingly larger resources.
- Color-coding such as described in this example can be used with other size components and price components described herein. Sizing or other means of emphasis of the information can also be used to reflect relative size/cost of the transfers.
- the information provided in price components 312 a - 312 c is slightly different than the price components described with reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B .
- the price components 312 a - 312 c in this example include bar graphics, where the length of the darkened area of the bar can indicate a relative expected size/price, e.g., substantially proportional to the size of the bar.
- color-coding can be used, e.g., by using cool colors (e.g., blues and greens) for the bars associated with smaller expected prices, and red for the bars associated with larger expected prices.
- the bar graphic can include label markings “small” and “large” to provide a measure of scale.
- price components 312 a - 312 c include a download icon 314 .
- Other icons can be used.
- the price components 312 a - 312 c in this example omit the bar graphics shown in FIG. 3C but still include general categories of small, medium and large.
- price components 312 a - 312 c include coin symbols, where the number of coin symbols varies and is substantially proportional to estimated sizes/prices of the corresponding downloads.
- the price components 312 a associated with 59 kb includes one coin symbol
- the price components 312 b and 312 c include two and four coin symbols, respectively.
- Other symbols, icons or graphics can be used.
- the coin symbols can include abbreviations or other indicators of the user's local currently.
- the actual estimated prices can also be shown.
- partial or fractional coin symbols can be used, e.g.
- the number of coin symbols can correspond to a geometric progression of prices, e.g., with one coin representing one GH ⁇ , two coins representing N GH ⁇ (where N>2), three coins representing N*N GH ⁇ , and so on. In this example, hovering over the coin symbols can cause the actual price to be displayed.
- FIGS. 3A-3E show example labels that are displayed within search results
- the same labels or different labels can be provided when a resource is selected or otherwise presented.
- any of the labels or different labels can be presented when the user selects the search result or any presented resource, providing the user with an option to complete the data transfer after being presented with the associated size/price information.
- FIG. 3F shows an example user settings screen 330 for specifying how transfer size labels are used.
- the user settings screen 330 can appear upon user selection of an option available on user device 106 f , or at initial system start-up or initialization of a device.
- the user settings screen 330 can include an explanation 332 that describes how the transfer size labels work.
- the explanation 332 can describe how the settings, based on user preferences, may affect whether and how labels such as the labels 308 a - 308 c are to be displayed with search results or other presentations of resources or data transfer opportunities, as well as whether popups or other controls such as the popup 208 are used.
- the user settings screen 330 can include a show settings area 334 , e.g., that includes check boxes, radio buttons or other controls for specifying when transfer size/price labels should appear.

- the access plan can be of the form of a data plan or a combined voice and data plan.
- Estimating an aggregate amount can include determining a first time period, determining a number of subscribers that have opted in to using bulk pricing, and estimating data usage by the number of subscribers in the first time period.
- data rate labels can be provided at or in association with data requests received from, for example, a mobile device.
- a spot market can be created by the delivery system (where there conventionally is only a fixed market) for the delivery of data to consumers in the metered network.
- a capacity auction platform can be created to enable carriers to sell excess capacity at floating prices.
- the delivery system can use historical information about data consumption at price points to discern a single or group of user's individual price sensitivity curve. Using the price sensitivity curve information, the delivery system can determine, for example, price sensitive users and how specific changes in price at a specific time will drive changes in usage.
- a mechanism for surfacing these carrier offers can use data rate labels. Users will not need to submit a bid; instead, rate labels for price-sensitive users will automatically change (downward or upward), thereby embodying the offer from the carrier and stimulating or effectively pricing consumption.
- the delivery system can provide tools for carriers, such as the ability to set a target utilization rate, or specific price bands for specific times of the day, to determine the carrier's offers. Based on these targets, the delivery system can adjust the data rate label price estimates in order to drive toward a targeted consumption goal for a given time period.

Description
- This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/612,901, filed Mar. 19, 2012 and U.S. application Ser. No. 13/422,164, filed Mar. 16, 2012.
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet.
- Some users employ mobile devices to access information on the Internet. In some circumstances, users may be sensitive to costs associated with access to Internet resources. For example, users that access Internet resources using a metered network (e.g., a mobile network having data rate charges or restrictions) may be less likely to access resources because of uncertainties in the cost.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for providing the search results. The method comprises receiving a query from a client device. The method further comprises responsive to the query, identifying, using one or more processors, search results including one or more resources. The method further comprises for at least one resource of search results, determining, using the one or more processors, a size of a data transfer required to access the one resource. The method further comprises providing the search results to the client device including providing a label associated with the one resource indicative of the size.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The label can include an estimate of the size based at least in part on historical data associated with the one resource. The label can include an estimate of the size based at least in part on prior loads of the one resource. The label can include an estimated size based at least in part on a retrieval of the one resource by a proxy prior to transmission of data associated with the one resource responsive to the query. The label can include a size estimate and a descriptor of a relative size of the transfer. The descriptor can include a slider ranging from small to large associated with the estimated size. The descriptor can reflect a particular category within a range of possible categories that are attributable based on the size estimate. The particular category can be a size selected from the group comprising small, medium, or large sized data. The descriptor can include a description of a category of resource. The category of resource can be a category selected from the group comprising video, images, audio, flash content, applications including embedded applications, rich content, fonts or scripts. The label can be a price associated with the data transfer. The price can be an amount that will be charged by a carrier for transferring the size of data in accordance with a data plan associated with a user of the client device. The price can include an indication of a current price that will be charged. The price can include an indication of a price that will be charged to load the data at a time in the future. The label can include plan usage data. The plan usage data can indicate an amount of data loaded in a given time period. The plan usage data can indicate an amount of remaining data that can be loaded in a given time period after loading the one resource. The method can further comprise determining a price charged by a delivery system associated with the client device that is used to present the one resource based at least in part on the size. Providing the search results to the client device can include providing the search results and label to a mobile device. Providing the search results to the client device can include providing the search results and the label to a tablet computing device. The label can be visible when the search results are provided. The label can be visible upon user selection of a hover control for the one resource. The label can be visible upon user selection of a link associated with the one resource, the label indicative of a size of a link resource associated with the link. The query can be a voice request.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for providing labels including estimates of data transfer sizes. The method comprises receiving, through a browser, a request for loading a resource. The method further comprises, prior to loading the resource, determining, using one or more processors, a size of a data transfer to load the resource. The method further comprises presenting information, including a label, related to the size to the user prior to loading the resource.

The label can include an estimate of the size based at least in part on prior loads of the resource. The label can include an estimated size based at least IN part on a retrieval of the resource by a proxy prior to transmission of data associated with the resource responsive to the request. The label can include a size estimate and a descriptor of a relative size of the transfer. The descriptor can include a slider ranging from small to large associated with the estimated size. The descriptor can reflect a particular category within a range of possible categories that are attributable based on the size estimate.

- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for providing estimates of data transfer sizes. The method comprises receiving, at a proxy, a request for a resource from a client device. The method further comprises determining, using one or more processors, a size of a data transfer required to complete the request.

- This document describes methods, processes and systems for providing information, including a label that identifies an estimated size and/or price associated with a data transfer of a resource. For example, if a user enters a search query on a mobile device (e.g., a cell phone, a tablet computing device, or some other device), the responsive search results can include size estimate labels. The labels, for example, can provide the user with a size estimate and/or a price estimate. The estimates can indicate to the user a relative size or cost associated with a transfer of data if the user selects the search result, thus causing the corresponding resource to be downloaded to the user's phone. Size estimates, for example, can be absolute (e.g., an actual numbers of bytes or bits), relative (e.g., “small,” “medium” or “large”), or presented in other ways. Price estimates can be based on the size estimates and may vary depending on the user's phone and/or data plan, the time of day, the location of the user, and other factors. Based on the information presented, the user may decide whether or not to select a particular search result, e.g., if downloading the corresponding resource is worth the estimated price (or is affordable by the user). Users can use the size estimate labels to control costs, e.g., down to the penny (or the user's local currency).
- In some implementations, the size estimate labels may not be presented with the search results, but the information may be made available to the user automatically or upon user initiation. In some implementations, the user can use a control on the user device to prompt the display of the label information (e.g., the user may hover over the search result, and the corresponding size estimate label can be displayed). In some implementations, the user can select a particular search result, and instead of automatically downloading the resource, a size estimate label can be presented to the user. In this example, the user can make a choice, based on the displayed information, whether or not to proceed with the download.
- While reference is made to search results, the information labels can be provided in other situations where data is attempted to be loaded in, for example, a metered data network. For example, the information label can be presented in conjunction with the selection of a resource on a page or with any request for data over the metered data network. In addition, an information label can be provided as part of the contents that are displayed to a user, where labels can be provided for each reference to a resource (e.g., a link on a page).
- In some implementations, a sacheting system can be used, e.g., to remove financial uncertainty for the user. For example, a third party (e.g., a content provider) can guarantee that the estimated rates displayed to the user will be honored. The guaranteed rates can be realized by arranging with carriers to establish set rates for transmission to users associated with the carrier, e.g., to effectively bundle rates for large groups of users.
- In some implementations, a spot market opportunity can be supported. For example, if a carrier's traffic is underutilized, estimates for traffic to be transferred over the network associated with the carrier can be lowered automatically, e.g., so as to encourage data transfers in the network.
- While estimated sizes and prices mentioned herein are described using examples of data transfers in the form of downloads of resources, other data transfers are also within the scope of this disclosure. For example, the same or different sizes and prices can be associated with re-publishing content, such as if the user decides to share content with other users. In this example, the user can be presented with a label associated with re-publishing the content and can make the decision to re-publish or not based on the estimated price.
- In some implementations, third-party sponsors can sponsor organic content page downloads that are free to the user, e.g., removing any financial concerns that the user may have about being able to afford the airtime or bandwidth costs of accessing the content over a metered network. For example, such organic content pages that are free for downloading by the user can be marked with a zero-cost label and/or highlighted in some other way. In some implementations, the third-party sponsors can target specific countries, user groups and/or content types. For example, a private foundation may be interested in sponsoring public health content to certain groups of people in Africa or other regions.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for delivering content. Theexample environment 100 includes acontent management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers),content publishers 109, and thecontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 andcontent publishers 109. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones and tablet devices), set-top boxes, television sets, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in anindexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 can, for example, access the indexedcache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can generatesearch results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from thesearch system 112. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. As described above, the search results page can include, for example, additional information in the form of one or more labels related to a size and/or price associated with accessing a noted resource. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. - In some implementations, the
environment 100 can include plural data stores. For example, a data store ofhistorical data 123 can store, for eachresource 105 that has been downloaded within theenvironment 100, the size of the resource (e.g., in bytes or bits). In some implementations, the size information can be stored each time a user selects asearch result 118, thereby initiating the download of the associatedresource 105. Becauseresources 105 can change over time in size and content, some implementations of thehistorical data 123 can store the size of the most recently-loaded version of theresource 105, an average size of the last few downloads (e.g., the last 2-10), or some other representative size. - In some implementations, a data store of data plans 121 can include information about each user's rate information, which can include, for example, a price per N bytes of downloaded resources and/or air time. In some implementations, the data plans 121 can be assembled from information provided through partnerships or arrangements with various carriers or any other service providers that provide access to
resources 105 by users. - In some implementations, the
environment 100 can include aproxy system 130 that operates within a metereddata network 140 to provide (and track the delivery of) content according to agreed-upon rates. Theproxy system 130 can include plural engines. For example, asize engine 122 can determine an estimated size for a particular resource, e.g., by using past download size information for the resource in thehistorical data 123 or by loading the resource in real time. Aprice engine 124 can use the estimated size to determine an estimated price associated with the download. In some implementations, the price that is determined for each user can be based on information for that user in the data plans 121. Alabel engine 126 can generate labels using size information from thesize engine 122 and price information from theprice engine 124. In some implementations, if no size/price information is available, then thelabel engine 126 can generate a label that indicates uncertainty about the size and price. In some implementations, amessage engine 128 can generate any needed messages that can, for example, be provided with price estimate labels that the user sees. - In some implementations, the
proxy system 130, including its plural engines, can use information from adelivery system 150 to provide labels.Example delivery systems 150 include phone, Internet and broadband providers and/or carriers. Using information provided bydelivery systems 150, for example, theprice engine 124 can match an estimated size (e.g., determined by the size engine 122) with information from the user'sdata plan 121 to determine an estimated price of the download. In one example, if a user in Ghana has a data plan that charges one Ghana Cedi for a download of 100 kb or less, then the label for a 59 kb resource (e.g., estimated using historical information) can include corresponding and/or proportional size and price estimates (e.g., “59 kb. (about 1 GH¢ airtime)”). - For situations in which the systems discussed here collect or use personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect or use the personal information (e.g., information about a user's account). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.

FIG. 2A is a block diagram of anexample system 200 for providing a label with a search result that indicates an estimated size of a data transfer of a corresponding resource. For example, labels 204 a and 204 b can providesize information 206 for the data transfer of each resource associated withsearch results size information 206 can include, for example, an estimated price (e.g., in the user's local currency) of a data download or access, an estimated size (e.g., in bits or bytes) of the corresponding resource, or some combination of price- and size-related information. The search results 118 a and 118 b, for example, can be provided to theuser device 106 by thecontent management system 110 in response to thequery 116, as described above. - In some implementations, the estimate of the size and/or price can include determining a size based at least in part on
historical data 123. For example, if the resource associated with thesearch result 118 a has in the past averaged 58 Mbytes of data, then thesize engine 122 can use this information in estimating a size for any subsequent download. In some implementations, theprice engine 124 can use the estimated size to determine an estimated price associated with the download. Thelabel engine 126 can use either or both of the size and price estimates to generate thelabels - In some implementations, the
proxy system 130, including its components, can use information from thedelivery system 150 to provide labels. For example, theprice engine 124 can match an estimated size (e.g., determined by the size engine 122) with information from the user'sdata plan 121 to determine an estimated price of the download. - For example, labels 204 a and 204 b can provide
size information 206 for the data transfer of each resource associated withsearch results size information 206 can include, for example, an estimated price (e.g., in local currency) of a data download or access, an estimated size (e.g., in bits or bytes) of the corresponding resource, or some combination of price- and size-related information. The search results 118 a and 118 b, for example, can be provided to theuser device 106 by thecontent management system 110 in response to thequery 116, as described above. - In some implementations, the
message engine 128 can generate messages that can be provided with thesize information 206 provided to the user. For example, if the user's data plan and current usage indicate that the user is approaching (or has exceeded) a threshold, then themessage engine 128 can generate an informational message that is also displayable on theuser device 106. In some implementations, messages can be displayed in a search results area or can otherwise be available (e.g., as an additional alert icon that is displayed with the size information and that, when hovered over or selected, displays a message to the user). In some implementations, messages displayed to the user can identify the user's current charges and/or remaining data transfer capacity for a current time period. -
FIG. 2B shows an example presentation of alabel 204 c that is presented after a resource is selected but before the resource is optionally loaded. For example, search results 118 c and 118 d, when initially displayed on theuser device 106, may not include estimated size information. In some implementations, the size information (e.g., thelabel 204 c) is presented after the user elects to load the resource (e.g., by clicking on or otherwise selecting the search result 118). In some implementations, a warning screen or prompt can be presented to the user in response to selection of a resource which includes the size/price information. Additional selection or default action/inaction may be required in order to initiate the load of the resource. In some implementations, the size information is presented if the user uses a control, such as a control that is activated when a cursor hovers over thesearch result 118 c. Other controls are possible. For example, the size information can be presented, by including thelabel 204 c in apopup 208.Search result 118 d, for example, shows an example search result for which the user has not yet selected the resource. -
FIGS. 3A-3E show example devices 106 a-106 e displayingsearch results 304 that include transfer size labels of various kinds For example, referring toFIG. 3A ,search results 304 a-304 c (e.g., provided in response to a query 306) include labels 308 a-308 c corresponding to increasing data transfer sizes (e.g., 59, 172 and 1435 kb). In this example, the labels 308 a-308 c include size components 310 a-310 c and price components 312 a-312 c, respectively. The price components 312 a-312 in this example indicate an estimated price associated with the corresponding data transfer of the associated resource that the user can initiate (e.g., if the user believes the data transfer is worth the cost). - In some implementations, prices associated with downloading data can be displayed in a local currency. For example, if the user is currently located in Ghana (e.g., as determined from global positioning system (GPS) capabilities of the user device), then the
price component 312 a can indicate an estimated price of “about 1 GH¢ airtime” (e.g., expressed in Ghana Cedi). In some implementations, the currency or currencies in which estimated prices are displayed to the user can be a preferred currency of the user, the user's currency-of-record associated with a phone or data plan, or some user-configurable one or more currencies. Price estimates associated with theother search results - Referring to
FIG. 3B , the information provided in price components 312 a-312 c is slightly different than the price components described with reference toFIG. 3A . In this example, instead of using absolute price values (e.g., 1, 3 and 27 GH¢ of airtime), general descriptions or categories are used. For example, the price components 312 a-312 c can indicate that the expected prices associated the downloading the resources are categorized as “low,” “medium” or “high cost to download,” respectively. - In some implementations, the way in which the size components 310 a-310 c and the price components 312 a-312 c are presented can change (e.g., by using color-coding or other techniques) based on the relative size and/or price. For example, the
size component 310 a and theprice component 312 a for the smaller resources can be displayed in blue or green (e.g., indicating a smaller price), and increasingly hotter colors (e.g., shades of yellow and red) can be used to display size components and price components of increasingly larger resources. Color-coding such as described in this example can be used with other size components and price components described herein. Sizing or other means of emphasis of the information can also be used to reflect relative size/cost of the transfers. - Referring to
FIG. 3C , the information provided in price components 312 a-312 c is slightly different than the price components described with reference toFIGS. 3A and 3B . For example, the price components 312 a-312 c in this example include bar graphics, where the length of the darkened area of the bar can indicate a relative expected size/price, e.g., substantially proportional to the size of the bar. In some implementations, color-coding can be used, e.g., by using cool colors (e.g., blues and greens) for the bars associated with smaller expected prices, and red for the bars associated with larger expected prices. In some implementations, the bar graphic can include label markings “small” and “large” to provide a measure of scale. - Referring to
FIG. 3D , price components 312 a-312 c include adownload icon 314. Other icons can be used. The price components 312 a-312 c in this example omit the bar graphics shown inFIG. 3C but still include general categories of small, medium and large. - Referring to
FIG. 3E , price components 312 a-312 c include coin symbols, where the number of coin symbols varies and is substantially proportional to estimated sizes/prices of the corresponding downloads. For example, theprice components 312 a associated with 59 kb includes one coin symbol, while theprice components - While the examples in
FIGS. 3A-3E show example labels that are displayed within search results, the same labels or different labels can be provided when a resource is selected or otherwise presented. For example, any of the labels or different labels can be presented when the user selects the search result or any presented resource, providing the user with an option to complete the data transfer after being presented with the associated size/price information. -
FIG. 3F shows an example user settings screen 330 for specifying how transfer size labels are used. For example, the user settings screen 330 can appear upon user selection of an option available onuser device 106 f, or at initial system start-up or initialization of a device. In some implementations, the user settings screen 330 can include anexplanation 332 that describes how the transfer size labels work. For example, theexplanation 332 can describe how the settings, based on user preferences, may affect whether and how labels such as the labels 308 a-308 c are to be displayed with search results or other presentations of resources or data transfer opportunities, as well as whether popups or other controls such as thepopup 208 are used. - In some implementations, the user settings screen 330 can include a
show settings area 334, e.g., that includes check boxes, radio buttons or other controls for specifying when transfer size/price labels should appear. For example, a “Show transfer sizes with search results”option 336 a, if selected, can enable the display of transfer size labels, such as the labels 308 a-308 c described above with reference toFIG. 3A-3E . In another example, a “Do not show transfer sizes”option 336 b, if selected, can disable the display of all transfer size labels. Other user-selectable options can also exist. - In some implementations, the user settings screen 330 can include a search results filter
area 338, e.g., that includes check boxes, radio buttons or other controls for specifying how search results are to be filtered based on the transfer size of the corresponding resources. For example, a “Show all web pages”option 340 a can allow all search results to appear in the search results (e.g., search results 304) that are displayed in response to a query (e.g., the query 306). A user may select this setting, for example, to display all search results regardless of the estimated price of a data download if the user were to click on or otherwise select the search result. In some implementations, an “Only show small and medium pages”option 340 b can allow the user to limit the search results to the less expensive estimated price related resources (e.g., preventing high-price pages). In some implementations, an “Only show small pages”option 340 c can allow the user to limit search results that are shown to the least expensive category of expected prices. In some implementations, additional controls can be provided by which a user can specify an absolute monetary amount as the threshold amount, e.g., to prevent the display of search results for which downloading the resource would exceed that threshold amount. For example, a cost-conscious user in Ghana may set the threshold at 3 GH¢ to limit search results displayed to those having an estimated price of “about 3 GH¢ airtime” or less. In some implementations, informational controls such as acontrol 342, if selected, can provide information to the user as to how the user settings are set and how they operate. - In some implementations, the user settings screen 330 can include additional controls. For example, a
save control 344 can be selected by the user to save any settings and/or inputs made on theuser settings screen 330. A “Restore Default Settings” control 346 can be used to reset the checkboxes and other settings to a default value, e.g., that accompany theuser device 106 f upon initial receipt by the user. In some implementations, a “Select Display Currency . . . ” control 348 can be used to specify (e.g., using a list or a pop-up) the one or more currencies in which the user wishes to have labels 308 a-308 c displayed (e.g., in a local currency and/or currencies designated by the user). -
FIG. 3G shows an example alert settings screen 350 for setting alerts corresponding to page-load cost amounts. For example, the user can use the alert settings screen 350 to identify a threshold cost for which the system will notify the user prior to loading a page costing more than the threshold cost. In this way, the user can control and track costs of loading more expensive pages. - The alert settings screen 350 can include an
introductory description 352 that explains how the interface works and what happens when expensive pages are about to be loaded. The user can use athreshold cost control 354 for setting the threshold cost for receiving notifications, e.g., including controls allowing text entry of the threshold cost, controls for incrementing/decrementing the threshold cost, and/or other types of controls. Action controls 356 can provide the user with the ability to reset a default threshold cost, confirm the current settings, cancel changes to the current settings, and/or perform other actions.Additional controls 358 can include links, for example, that allow the user can use to add currency amounts to the user's account, view privacy information associated with using the system, and call or interface with customer support or other help functions. -
FIG. 4A is a flowchart of anexample process 400 for providing a label with a search result that indicates an estimated size of a data transfer of a corresponding resource. Theprocess 400 can be performed by thecontent management system 110 and/or the proxy system 130 (and/or its components).FIGS. 1 , 2A and 3A-3E are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 400. - A query is received from a client device (402). For example, the
content management system 110 can receive thequery 116 from any of theuser devices 106 a-106 e. The query can originate, for example, from a browser on a mobile user device (e.g., a cell phone, a tablet computing device, or some other device) operated by a user in a remote part of Africa (e.g., Ghana). - In some implementations, the query can be initiated by the user as a voice request. Other prompts for information can be manually or automatically activated. For example, a feature phone can include a rudimentary menu with predefined search categories (e.g., weather, scores, prices, etc.). When the user activates one of these menus, the application can conduct a request using the predefined information. The entire sequence of user selections and intermediate results can be price-labeled as well. For example, if the user's selection is a weather category, each weather-related option presented to the user can have an estimated size and price, such as an option to display today's forecast. Once that selection is made by the user, additional price-labeled options can be presented, such as along with the display of the current weather information for any other resource referenced on a page that includes the requested weather information.
- In some implementations, the query can be initiated as a result of the user employing an interactive voice response (IVR) system. For example, the user in Africa can call into the IVR system and either navigate to pre-recorded information (e.g., weather, sports scores, etc.) or use a voice-driven system to ask a question or perform a search. The use of an IVR system can also have associated prices, e.g., prompting the user with the price before presenting the information.
- Responsive to the query, search results are identified including one or more resources (404). As an example, the
content management system 110 can provide the search results 304. - For at least one resource of search results, a size of a data transfer required to access the one resource is determined (406). For example, the
size engine 122 can determine an estimated size for the resource. Further, theprice engine 124 can determine a corresponding estimated price, and thelabel engine 126 can generate a label indicative of the estimated size and/or estimated price. - The search results are provided to the client device including providing a label associated with the one resource indicative of the size/price (408). As an example, the
search results 304 a-304 c can be provided to the any of theuser devices 106 a-106 e (e.g., the user's mobile device in Africa), including the labels 308 a-308 c. As a result, the user in Ghana can see size and/or price estimates that apply to the potential data transfer (e.g., downloading of each of the resources) corresponding to thesearch results 304 a-304 c. - The labels 308 a-308 c can include, for example, size estimates (e.g., size components 310 a-310 c) and a descriptor of a relative size of the transfer (e.g., the bar graphics and/or small/medium/large annotations described with reference to
FIGS. 3C-3D ). For example, the descriptor can include a slider ranging from small to large, where the position of the slider is associated with the estimated size. Each descriptor can reflect a particular category (e.g., small, medium, or large) within a range of possible categories that are attributable based on the size estimate. - In some implementations, descriptors can identify a category of resource associated with the search result, e.g., as a way for the user to gain knowledge of the type of resource that may contribute to its corresponding size. For example, the descriptor can identify the resource as including one or more of the categories of video, images, audio, flash content, applications including embedded applications, rich content, fonts and/or scripts.
- In some implementations, the label includes an estimate of the size based at least in part on historical data associated with the one resource. For example, the
size engine 122 can accesshistorical data 123 to determine the size of the resource that was reported or recorded the last time (or previous times) that the resource was downloaded. In some implementations, size can include (or be an average of) multiple sizes corresponding to multiple downloads of the same resource. As a result, the label can include an estimate of the size based at least in part on prior loads of the one resource. - In some implementations, the label includes an estimated size based at least in part on a retrieval of the one resource by a proxy prior to transmission of data associated with the one resource responsive to the request. For example, instead of accessing information about prior loads of the resource, the
proxy system 130 can retrieve the resource and determine its size (e.g., before the user elects to download the resource). - In some implementations, the label can include a price associated with the data transfer. For example, the price can be the price that the user in Africa would be charged by the user's phone carrier for transferring the size or amount of data in accordance with a user's data plan with the phone carrier. In some implementations, the price identified in the label can be the current price, e.g., for an immediate download of the resource. In some implementations, the price can include an indication of a price that will be charged to load the data at a future time. For example, the label that the user sees can identify a price for downloading the resource later, e.g., during off-peak hours or some other identified time. In some implementations, the label that is presented to the user can include plan usage data, e.g., indicating an amount of data loaded in a given time period (e.g., “You have loaded 987 kb of data so far this month, costing 32 GH¢ of airtime”). In some implementations, the label that is presented to the user can indicate an amount of remaining data that can be loaded in a given time period after loading the one resource (e.g., “If you load this resource, you will still have 17 GH¢ of airtime left for the month”).
- In some implementations, the price associated with the data transfer can be the price charged by the delivery system 150 (e.g., the user's phone carrier) associated with the client device that is used to present the one resource based at least in part on the size. For example, the price that the user sees can be the price that will be charged under the user's data usage plan.
- In some implementations, if the user selects a search result and the corresponding resource is downloaded, that resource can include multiple embedded links. In some implementations, each of the embedded links can be augmented to include a label that is visible, for example, upon user selection of a link associated with the resource. For example, after the user selects a link, the label that is displayed can indicate a size of a link resource associated with the link (e.g., including the cost of the user downloading the resource).
-
FIG. 4B is a flowchart of anexample process 420 for providing a label indicating an estimated transfer size of a resource after it is selected but before it is loaded. Theprocess 420 can be performed by thecontent management system 110 and the proxy system 130 (and/or its components).FIGS. 1 and 2B are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 420. - A request is received through a browser for loading a resource (422). For example, referring to
FIG. 2B , the request can occur when the user selects thesearch result 118 c. In some implementations, the request can be a voice request. For example, the request can be initiated as a result of the user employing an interactive voice response (IVR) system. For example, the user in Africa can call into the IVR system and either navigate to pre-recorded information (e.g., weather, sports scores, etc.) and make a selection of an option. - In some implementations, if the user is using a feature phone, the request can be a selection from a rudimentary menu with predefined search categories (e.g., weather, scores, prices, etc.). When the user activates one of the menu options, the application can initiate a request using the predefined information.
- Prior to loading the resource, a size of a data transfer to load the resource is determined (424). As an example, the
size engine 122 can determine an estimated size for the resource. Further, theprice engine 124 can determine a corresponding estimated price, and thelabel engine 126 can generate a label indicative of the estimated size and/or estimated price. - Information that includes a label and is related to the size is presented to the user prior to loading the resource (426). As an example, referring to
FIG. 2B , the size information can be presented in apopup 208 using thelabel 204 c. In some implementations, thelabel 204 c can include, for example, size estimates and a descriptor of a relative size of the transfer (e.g., the bar graphics and/or small/medium/large annotations described with reference toFIGS. 3C-3D ). For example, the descriptor can include a slider ranging from small to large, where the position of the slider is associated with the estimated size. Each descriptor can reflect a particular category (e.g., small, medium, or large) within a range of possible categories that are attributable based on the size estimate. In some implementations, descriptors can identify a category of resource associated with the search result, e.g., video, images, audio, flash content, applications including embedded applications, rich content, fonts and/or scripts. Other categories are possible. - In some implementations, the label includes an estimate of the size based at least in part on historical data associated with the one resource, e.g., as determined by the
size engine 122 usinghistorical data 123 corresponding to prior loads of the resource. In some implementations, the label includes an estimated size based at least in part on a retrieval of the one resource by a proxy prior to transmission of data associated with the one resource responsive to the request. For example, theproxy system 130 can retrieve the resource and determine its size in real time. - In some implementations, the label can include a price associated with the data transfer, such as the price that the user would be charged by the user's phone carrier for the data transfer, e.g., based on rates associated with the user's data plan. In some implementations, the price identified in the label can be the current price for an immediate download or a price that would be charged to load the data at a future time. In some implementations, the label that is presented to the user can include plan usage data, e.g., indicating an amount of data loaded in a given time period and/or an amount of remaining data that can be loaded in a given time period after loading the one resource.
- In some implementations, the price associated with the data transfer can be the price charged by the delivery system 150 (e.g., the user's phone carrier). For example, the price that the user sees can be the price that will be charged under the user's data usage plan if the user downloads the resource.
- In some implementations, if a search result is downloaded that includes one or more embedded links, each embedded link can include or be associated with a label that is visible, for example, upon user selection of a link. For example, after the user selects a link, the label that is displayed can indicate a size of a link resource associated with the link (e.g., including the cost of the user downloading the corresponding resource).
-
FIG. 4C is a flowchart of anexample process 440 in which a proxy provides an estimated size for a data transfer of a resource. For example, theprocess 440 can be used for resources associated with browsers (e.g., the cost of downloading resources associated with search results that are responsive to a query), email systems (e.g., the cost of downloading a full email message that corresponds to an email subject/header displayed in an inbox), or any other resource that can be transferred within a metered data network. Theprocess 440 can be performed by thecontent management system 110 and the proxy system 130 (and/or its components).FIGS. 1 and 2B are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 440. - A request is received at a proxy for a resource from a client device (442). For example, referring to
FIG. 2B , the proxy system 130 (e.g., in combination with the content management system 110) can receive a request for the resource associated with thesearch result 118 c. - A size of a data transfer required to complete the request is determined (444). The
size engine 122, for example, can determine an estimated size of the resource, e.g., based at least in part onhistorical data 123, as described above. - An estimate is provided to the client device that is an estimate of a size of a data transfer required to complete the request prior to exposing the client device to data charges resulting from transfer of data associated with the request (446). For example, the proxy system 130 (e.g., in combination with the content management system 110) can provide the estimated size to the
user device 106. - In some implementations, providing the estimate can include determining a size based at least in part on data received from the resource when the proxy requests a load of the resource. For example, the
proxy system 130 can use information in the resource to determine an estimated size, e.g., by examining the resource's size using file size utilities or by determining the size by loading or pre-loading the resource. Providing the size estimate, for example, can occur prior to delivery of data associated with the resource to the client device. - In some implementations, the
process 440 can further include additional operations of passing the request from the proxy to the resource; receiving data from the resource responsive to the request; determining a size associated with one or more resources referenced in the received data; and providing size data associated with the one or more referenced resources along with the received data to the client device. For example, theproxy system 130 can obtain and estimate size for the requested resource (e.g., web page A) then estimate the size of additional resources associated with any links in the resource (e.g., web pages X, Y and Z referenced by the web page A). Theproxy system 130 can then provide four estimated sizes, one size for each of the web pages A, X, Y and Z. - In some implementations, the
process 440 can further include additional operations of passing the request from the proxy to the resource; receiving data from the resource responsive to the request; and determining a size of the data transfer from the resource based on the received data. For example, theproxy system 130, without obtaining the resource, can request of the resource to either identify its size or provide information by which theproxy system 130 can estimate its size. - As described above, data rate labels based on a size of the data transfer can be provided to a client device prior to the commencement of the download of the data. The price estimates provided in association with the data rate labels can be guaranteed by a service, such as the service that provides the price information. For example, a service can make an advance purchase of data bandwidth or a purchase guarantee with a carrier for a bulk volume of data bandwidth. The purchased data bandwidth can be resold with or without markup, such as to individual users on an a la carte basis. The service can accordingly pass on bulk pricing to the user, while allowing carriers to reduce uncertainty and risk regarding consumption volume, which can enhance their ability to forecast and plan for capacity increases and other capital expenditures. The service can provide solutions (e.g., software) to enable this inter-mediation, including allowing users to use their voice balance rather than maintain a separate voice and data balance. Forecasts of expected consumption can be made on a per user basis through user-specific models based on past individual and community consumption patterns.
- One example of a method for providing the guaranteed cost delivery service includes receiving, by a processor, a request for data from an application on a metered data network. The request for data can be a request from a mobile handset for data from a resource that is transferred to the mobile device by a carrier. The user may have a contract with the carrier for voice or data services. In some implementations, the transaction contemplated herein includes a separate agreement with delivery service to engage in the bulk pricing. In some implementations, users can separately sign up for the delivery service. Some or all data transfers to/from the user device can be governed by the separate agreement.
- Prior to transferring the data, the delivery service can determine a size of an associated data transfer to satisfy the request. The delivery system can, for example, do this as described above, such as by loading the data to a proxy or evaluating historical information associated with prior loads of the data. The delivery system can present information including price information to be charged by a carrier for transmission of the data based on the size. The price information can reflect an estimated cost to the user.
- Upon receiving a confirmation to transfer the data, the price estimate can be honored by the delivery system. To facilitate such, the delivery system can estimate an aggregate amount of data that subscribers will consume in a time period, and establish a bulk price with the carrier for the aggregate amount. Honoring the estimate can include debiting a user's access plan associated with the carrier an amount equal to or less than the estimated price.
- The application request can originate from an application executing on a mobile device. The metered data network can be a wireless network. The request for data can be a request from a browser for a resource. The price information can include an estimated cost in a local currency.
- The access plan can be a voice plan and debiting the estimated price can include debiting an amount in a local currency against a balance kept in the local currency for voice communications in the metered data network. Alternatively the access plan can be of the form of a data plan or a combined voice and data plan.
- Estimating an aggregate amount can include determining a first time period, determining a number of subscribers that have opted in to using bulk pricing, and estimating data usage by the number of subscribers in the first time period.
- As described above, data rate labels can be provided at or in association with data requests received from, for example, a mobile device. In some implementations, a spot market can be created by the delivery system (where there conventionally is only a fixed market) for the delivery of data to consumers in the metered network. In some implementations, a capacity auction platform can be created to enable carriers to sell excess capacity at floating prices. The delivery system can use historical information about data consumption at price points to discern a single or group of user's individual price sensitivity curve. Using the price sensitivity curve information, the delivery system can determine, for example, price sensitive users and how specific changes in price at a specific time will drive changes in usage. A mechanism for surfacing these carrier offers can use data rate labels. Users will not need to submit a bid; instead, rate labels for price-sensitive users will automatically change (downward or upward), thereby embodying the offer from the carrier and stimulating or effectively pricing consumption.
- In some implementations, the delivery system can provide tools for carriers, such as the ability to set a target utilization rate, or specific price bands for specific times of the day, to determine the carrier's offers. Based on these targets, the delivery system can adjust the data rate label price estimates in order to drive toward a targeted consumption goal for a given time period.

FIG. 4D shows example displays that include last activity of the user. For example,statistics 450 can include a current balance (e.g., $4.89) for the user and the cost of a last activity (e.g., $0.03). Costs and balances can be presented (to the user) and use one or more of a currency specified by the user, the currency of the user's data plan, and/or a local currency (e.g., based on the user's current location). Other ways of presenting the user's current balance and last activity can be used. -
FIG. 4E shows a table 458 of example guaranteed rates. For example,rates 460 can be guaranteed for a user for each of variouscorresponding content types 462 and units 464 (e.g., per page, per minute viewed, per minute used, or other rates). The rates can be semi-floating rates for individual downloads (e.g., for search results) and based on content type. Example content types include webpages of various sizes, images, video and other content (e.g., social content, email, etc.). Guaranteed pricing can be based oncontent type 462, e.g., instead of or in addition to the size considerations and factors described above. For example, data plans can be established where downloading a medium-sized page costs X, downloading a one-minute video costs Y, and other downloads of various content types and sizes have other different rates. Rates can be defined and/or presented to users using one or more of a currency specified by the user, the currency of the user's data plan, and/or a local currency (e.g., based on the user's current location). -
FIG. 4F shows anexample environment 468 for compressing information before it is provided to a user device. For example, atstep 1, a client browser 470 (e.g., on the user device 106) can provide a request to a proxy server 472 (e.g., the proxy system 130). The request can be, for example, a request for a resource (e.g., such as a request for a web page, an application, a request for a search result or other resource). Atstep 2, the proxy server 472 can forward the request to aweb server 474 and receive content responsive to the request. Atstep 3, instead of providing the requested content directly to theclient browser 470 in a non-compressed state, the proxy server 472 can obtain a compressed version of the data from acompression engine 476. In some implementations, the proxy server 472 can determine whether compression is required, then forward the content for compression if necessary. In some implementations, compression can be optional depending, for example, on constraints associated with the system or on timing constraints associated with the received request. For example, content that is less than a predetermined size may not be compressed as they are deemed too small. In some implementations, thecompression engine 476 can be a third party engine, associated with the proxy server 472 or included in the proxy server 472. In some implementations, the content for potential compression can be evaluated, and only compressed is sufficient benefit will result. Benefits can include both cost and/or timing benefits. Atstep 4, the proxy server 472 can provide the compressed content to theclient browser 470. -
FIG. 5 is a block diagram ofcomputing devices 500, 550 that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. Computing device 500 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 550 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, tablet computing devices, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be exemplary only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document. - Computing device 500 includes a processor 502,
memory 504, astorage device 506, a high-speed interface 508 connecting tomemory 504 and high-speed expansion ports 510, and alow speed interface 512 connecting tolow speed bus 514 andstorage device 506. Each of thecomponents memory 504 or on thestorage device 506 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 516 coupled tohigh speed interface 508. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices 500 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 504 stores information within the computing device 500. In one implementation, thememory 504 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, thememory 504 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 504 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. - The
storage device 506 is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device 500. In one implementation, thestorage device 506 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, thestorage device 506 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 504, thestorage device 506, or memory on processor 502. - The
high speed controller 508 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 500, while thelow speed controller 512 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is exemplary only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 508 is coupled tomemory 504, display 516 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 510, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 512 is coupled tostorage device 506 and low-speed expansion port 514. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. - The computing device 500 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a
standard server 520, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of arack server system 524. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as alaptop computer 522. Alternatively, components from computing device 500 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such asdevice 550.
