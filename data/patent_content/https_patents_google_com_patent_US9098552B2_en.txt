Definitions
- This specification relates to scoring images that are related to entities.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, for example, webpages, images, audio files, and videos.
- a variety of search engines are available for identifying particular resources accessible over the Internet. For example, digital images that satisfy a user's informational need can be identified by an image search process in which keywords or other data are processed to identify collections of digital images. Each image is identified to the user by an image search result.
- the image search result also references a landing page, which is a web page resource that includes the image resource represented in the image search result.
- Search results generated by a search engine are generally ranked and presented to a user in an ordered list of search results.
- the rankings may be based on how the search engine determines the relevance of resources specified by the search results to a particular query issued by the user.
- a very common entity that people search for is a person.
- users use search engines to identify images associated with a particular person.
- the images associated with the particular person may vary in size, shape, and content.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying a plurality of images associated with a particular person, each image being included in one or more resources; obtaining, for each of a plurality of resources that each include one of the plurality of images, a quality score for the resource, the quality score representing a quality of the resource with respect to the quality of other resources; for each of the plurality of images: generating an image resource quality score from one or more of the quality scores of one or more of the resources that include the image; identifying a set of similar images from the plurality of images, each similar image having a measure of similarity to the image that meets a similarity measure threshold; generating an image score based on image resource quality scores of one or more of the resources that include the similar images relative to image resource quality scores of the resources that include each of the plurality of images; and generating an image authority score based on the image resource quality score and the image score.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured
- the method may further comprise ranking each of the plurality of images according to the image authority scores; selecting a highest ranking image from the ranked images; and providing a user device with data that causes the highest ranking image to be displayed.
- the quality score for each resource may be determined independent of the content of the resource.
- the image resource quality score for each image may be an average of the quality scores of each resource that includes the image.
- the image resource quality score for each image may be a highest quality score of the quality scores of each resource that includes the image.
- the set of similar images may be a proper subset of the plurality of images.
- Each of the plurality of images may include a face detected by one or more facial recognition processes.
- Each measure of similarity to the image may be based on a comparison of a portion of the image that includes a face to a portion of the similar image that includes a face, and wherein the portion of the image is less than the whole image and the portion of the similar image is less than the whole similar image.
- the image score for the image may be further based on a facial recognition confidence score, the facial recognition confidence score indicating a confidence that the image includes one or more facial features.
- the image score for the image may be further based on a portrait score, the portrait score indicating a degree to which a bounding box that defines an area including the face included in the image matches selected bounding box feature values.
- Authoritative images, or high quality images can be identified based on their inclusion in multiple resources that are of high quality and based on the identification of similar images that are also included in other resources of high quality.
- comparing image resource quality scores for similar images to image resource quality scores of dissimilar images provides a relative measure of image quality that can be used to select images that have a high degree of authority with respect to an entity relative to the authority of other images with respect to the same entity. Images with a relatively high authority with respect to an entity may be more likely to satisfy a user's informational need than images that have a relatively low authority with respect to the entity.
- images with high image scores for an entity are likely to be visually representative, clear and distinguishable from other images related to that entity.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which images related to entities are scored.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example data flow in which images related to entities are scored.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example data flow in which images related to entities are scored.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process in which images related to entities are scored.
- the systems and methods disclosed herein identify, for a particular entity that is a subject of a search, an authoritative image of the entity.
- Images that are associated with a particular entity, such as a person, and that are included in resources are identified.
- a search engine may, in response to receiving a query related to the particular person, identify images associated with the particular person and corresponding web pages that include those images. For each resource that includes one of the images, a quality score is obtained that represents the quality of the resource with respect to the quality of other resources.
- an image resource quality score is generated from the quality scores of each resource that includes the image. Similar images are identified, and an image score for the image is generated based on the quality scores of the resources that include the similar images relative to the quality scores of the resources that include the images identified as associated with the particular person. Based on the image resource quality score and the image score, an image authority score is generated for the image. Image authority scores are used to rank images with respect to a person.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which images related to entities are scored.
- a computer network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects publisher resources 104 , user devices 106 , and the search system 108 .
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of publisher resources 104 and user devices 106 .
- a resource 104 is any data that can be provided by a publisher over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).
- Each resource 104 is maintained by a publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the resource 104 .
- the search system 108 identifies the resources by crawling the publisher resources 104 and indexing the resources provided by the publishers.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in a resource index 110 .
- the search system 108 also indexes and, optionally, caches images in an image index 112 .
- the user devices 106 submit search queries 114 to the search system 108 .
- the search queries 114 are submitted in the form of a search request that includes the search query.
- the search system 108 uses the resource index 110 and/or the image index 112 to identify resources and/or images that are relevant to the queries.
- the search system 108 identifies the resources in the form of search results 116 and returns the search results to the user devices 106 in search results page resource.
- a search result is data generated by the search system 108 that identifies a resource and/or image that satisfies a particular search query, and includes a resource locator for the resource.
- An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text and/or an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- the search results 116 are ranked based on scores related to the resources and images identified by the search results, such as information retrieval (“IR”) scores, resource quality scores, image resource quality scores, image scores, image authority scores, and/or a separate ranking of each resource or image relative to other resources or images (e.g., an authority score).
- IR information retrieval
- the search results are ordered according to these scores, which are discussed in further detail below, and provided to the user device according to the order.
- the user devices 106 receive the search results pages and render the pages for presentation to users.
- the user device 106 requests the resource or image identified by a resource locator included in the selected search result.
- the publisher of the resource receives the request for the resource/image from the user device 106 and provides the resource/image to the requesting user device 106 .
- the resource index 110 may include data indicating authority scores, quality scores, and click-through rates of resources.
- the image index 112 may include, for example, data indicating image quality scores, image authority scores, image resource quality scores, facial recognition confidence scores, portrait scores, image click-through rates, and resources that include the images.
- the queries 114 submitted from user devices 106 may be stored in query logs.
- Click data for the queries and the resources referenced by the search results may be stored in click logs.
- the query logs and the click logs define search history data that include data from and related to previous search requests.
- the click logs define actions taken responsive to search results provided by the search system 108 .
- the query logs and click logs can be used to map queries submitted by the user devices to resources that were identified in search results and the actions taken by users.
- the click logs and query logs can thus be used by the search system 108 to determine information related to the queries submitted by the user devices, such as the actions taken in response to the queries or how often the queries are submitted. This information, in turn, may be used by the search system 108 to determine one or more of the aforementioned metrics and scores used to rank resources and/or images.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example data flow 200 in which images related to entities are scored.
- the data flow 200 depicts the generation of image authority scores for images of people.
- the image authority scores are then used in search operations.
- the image authority scores may be used to select a “headshot” image of a particular person.
- the image resource quality score for an image is based on quality scores of resources that include the image.
- the search system 108 may identify images in the image index that are associated with George Washington.
- the images may include, for example, famous paintings of George Washington, images of currency that depict George Washington, George Washington's presidential portrait, and other portraits of George Washington.
- Data identifying each of the images of George Washington may also indicate the web pages on which the images may be found. Some images may be found on many different web pages, and some images may only be found on a single web page.
- Each quality score for a resource represents a quality of the resource with respect to the quality of other resources.
- the quality of a resource may be measured by any suitable metric or combination of metrics.
- quality of a resource may be measured by user ratings, click-through rates (e.g., number of selections of search results referencing the resource with respect to a particular query or multiple queries), and/or a number and type of links to the resource from other resources.
- the quality score for each resource is determined independent of the content of the resource.
- the quality score for a web page may be based on the number and type of links to the web page from other web pages.
- Metrics and combinations of metrics for a resource may be compared to corresponding metrics associated with other resources in order to determine relative quality among a group of resources.
- the search system 108 generates image resource quality scores for each of the identified images 204 .
- the image resource quality score for an image is generated from at least one of the quality scores of the resources that include the image.
- the image resource quality score for an image is the highest quality score of the resources that include the image.
- an average of multiple quality scores may be used to generate the image resource quality score.
- quality scores for a subset of the resources that include the image may be used to generate an image resource quality score, such as the resources with the top 5 or 10 quality scores.
- an image resource quality score for a particular image of George Washington may be the quality score of the highest ranking resource that includes that particular image.
- a particular image of George Washington may be found on 20 different web pages.
- the search system may obtain the quality scores for the 20 different web pages and calculate an average of the 20 quality scores. This average may be used as the image resource quality score for the particular image of George Washington.
- the image resource quality scores are used, in part, to determine an image score for each image.
- the search system 108 identifies, for each identified image 204 , a set of similar images. For each image, each similar image has a measure of similarity to the image that meets a similarity measure threshold.
- an image similarity system 210 generates similarity measures 212 for the identified images 204 .
- the search system 108 may generate the image similarity measures.
- the set of similar images identified for each image may be subset of the identified images, e.g., the similarity measure threshold may be used to limit the number of images identified as similar.
- the similarity measures may be generated based on relevance measures of the image and the other images to a particular entity, label, or query. For example, at a high level, an image relevance model may be trained for a query by first selecting training images that are relevant to that query. Thereafter, an image relevance model for each query is learned. Differences between image relevance scores of images with respect to a particular query or entity may be used to determine image similarity.
- the search system 108 generates an image score for the image.
- the image score is based on the image resource quality scores of at least one of the resources that include at least one similar image relative to image resource quality scores of the resources that include each of the identified images.
- An example formula for calculating an image score for an image is as follows:
- an image score may be obtained for each identified image of George Washington. Assume 1000 images of George Washington were identified by the search system as related to George Washington. An image score for a particular image of the 1000 images may be calculated by taking a first sum of all image resource quality scores of images identified as similar to the particular image, and dividing that first sum by a second sum of all image resource quality scores for the 1000 images.
- the formula provided above is an example formula, and other suitable formulas may be used to generate an image score for an image.
- the number of similar images may be used to generate an image score for an image. For example, assume again that there are 1000 images of George Washington identified by the search system. If a first image has 100 images that are similar to the first image, the image score for the first image may be 100. If a second image has 20 images that were identified as similar to the second image, the image score for the second image may be 20. In some implementations, the image score is based on the number of similar images relative to the total number of images identified as related to the particular person. For example, the image score for an image of a particular person may be the number of its similar images divided by the total number of images identified for the particular person. Using the previous example, the first image would have an image score of 0.1 (100/1000), while the second image would have an image score of 0.02 (20/1000).
- the image score for an image is further based on a facial recognition confidence score that indicates a confidence that the image includes a face.
- the facial recognition confidence score may be produced by any suitable facial recognition process, such as the facial feature detection process described above.
- the image score may be multiplied by the facial recognition confidence score.
- the image authority scores for images are stored in an index, such as the image index 112 or a separate index for entities, and the search system 108 ranks each of the identified images 204 according to the image authority scores.
- the rankings may be used to determine which image or images should be provided in a response to a request for an image related to the person 202 associated with the identified images. For example, the highest ranking image for a particular person may be selected as the most authoritative image for the particular person. The highest ranking image may then be provided to a user device that requested an image related to the particular person.
- the search system 108 may provide data that causes the particular portrait headshot of George Washington to be displayed on the user device.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example data flow 300 in which images related to entities are scored.
- the example data flow 300 may take place in a search system that identifies top ranked images, such as the search system 108 .
- the data flow 300 may be performed in two separate pipelines, such as a resource pipeline 320 and an image pipeline 330 . Separate pipeline processing is described in more detail below.
- resource scores 302 are obtained for resources that include images related to the given person.
- the resource score for each resource indicates a content-dependent relevance of the resource to the given person.
- resource scores may be obtained for resources that are determined to be relevant to a particular person.
- the resource score for an image may take into account, for example, the quality of the web page that includes the image or the web site that hosts the image and quality of the content on the web page—such as the quality of the text, images, videos, or advertisements on the web page.
- resource quality scores 304 are obtained.
- the resource quality scores are content independent measures of resource quality.
- the resource quality score for a web page that includes an image may depend on a query-independent measure of web page quality or the quality of the web site that hosts the web page.
- the example search system performs facial detection 308 on the images included in the resources with the top N resource quality scores 306 . Any suitable facial recognition process may be used. After facial detection 308 is performed, neighbor scores, facial recognition confidence scores, and portrait scores are generated for each image included in a resource with one of the top N resource quality scores. Using the neighbor scores, facial recognition confidence scores, and portrait scores 310 , the example search system generates image scores 312 for each image included in the resources with the top N resource quality scores.
- Image authority scores 314 are generated for images based on the resource scores 302 and the image scores 312 .
- image authority scores are based on the resource quality scores 304 and the image scores 312 .
- the search system 108 may multiple the resource score for an image by the image score for the image to obtain an image authority score.
- the top X images 316 are selected based on the image authority scores 314 .
- the search system 108 may select the top 10 images from the 1,000 images for which image scores were obtained.
- the top X images may be stored in a data store, such as the image index 112 or a separate entity or person index.
- each pipeline may be run synchronously. For example, if run synchronously, the resource pipeline 320 will wait for the image pipeline 330 to finish before generating image authority scores 314 .
- each pipeline may be run asynchronously. For example, the resource pipeline may generate image authority scores 314 using previous image scores. Whether the example data flow is performed synchronously or asynchronously may depend, for example, on available resource and/or the frequency with which an example search system updates the various scores obtained in the example data flow 300 .
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 in which images related to entities are scored.
- the process 400 may be implemented by a data processing apparatus, such as the search system 108 .
- the process 400 identifies images associated with a particular person ( 402 ). Each identified image is included in one or more resources.
- the process 400 generates, for each image, an image resource quality score from the quality scores of the resources that include the image ( 406 ).
- the image resource quality score for an image may be the highest quality score of the resources that include the image.
- the image resource quality score for an image may be an average of the top N quality scores of the resources that include the image.
- the process 400 identifies, for each image, a set of similar images from the images ( 408 ). Each similar image has a measure of similarity to the image that meets a similarity threshold. Any suitable image similarity process may be used to identify sets of similar images, and in some implementations, only the portion of an image that includes a face is used to identify sets of similar images.
- the process 400 generates, for each image, an image score based on image resource quality scores ( 410 ).
- the image score is based on image resource quality scores of one or more of the resources that include similar images relative to image resource quality scores of the resources that include each of the plurality of images.
- the image score is based on a facial recognition confidence score that indicates a confidence that the image includes a face.
- the image score is based on a portrait score that indicates the degree to which a bounding box that defines an area including a face included in an image matches certain bounding box feature values.
- the process 400 generates, for each image, an image authority score based on the image resource quality score and the image score ( 412 ).
- the image authority score for an image may be a sum of the image's image resource quality score and image score.
- the image authority score may be based on a product of the image's image resource quality score and image score.
