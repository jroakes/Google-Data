Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to content presentation.
- Advertisers provide content such as advertisements in different forms in order to attract consumers.
- An advertisement (“ad”) is a piece of information designed to be used in whole or part by a user, for example, a particular consumer.
- Ads can be provided in electronic form. For example, online ads can be provided as banner ads on a web page, as ads presented with search results, or as ads presented in a mobile application.
- An advertising system can include an ad in a webpage, for example, in response to one or more keywords in a user search query input to a search engine. If a user selects the presented ad (e.g., by “clicking” the ad), the user is generally taken to another location associated with the ad, for example, to another, particular web page.
- Content such as advertisements can be allocated through an auction process. For example, advertisers can provide bids specifying amounts that the advertisers are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their advertisements.
- an auction can be performed and advertisement slots (e.g., locations on a web page or within a mobile application) can be allocated to advertisers according to their bids.
- advertisement slots e.g., locations on a web page or within a mobile application
- the advertisement slot can be allocated to the advertiser that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or an advertisement quality measure).
- a highest auction score e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or an advertisement quality measure.
- the advertisement slots can be allocated to a set of bidders that provided the highest bids or have the highest auction scores.
- This specification describes technologies relating to content presentation.
- the method includes the actions of computing an exposure interval of a content segment, identifying at least two advertisements that are candidates to be provided within an advertising slot of the content segment, wherein a first of the at least two advertisements is associated with a cost per time unit (CPT) bid and a second of the at least two advertisements is associated with a non-CPT bid, determining, using an amount of the CPT bid, an amount of the non-CPT bid, and the exposure interval, whether a first amount of expected revenue from providing the first of the at least two advertisements in the advertising slot is greater than a second amount of expected revenue from providing the second of the at least two advertisements in the advertising slot, and, in response to determining that the first amount of expected revenue is greater than the second amount of expected revenue, providing the first of the at least two advertisements in the advertising slot.
- CPT cost per time unit
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods for setting a bid type.
- the method includes the actions of processing, with a processor executing code, at least one advertisement to compute a target exposure interval, determining a bid type for association with the at least one advertisement based on the target exposure interval, and, responsive to a selection of the advertisement in an auction on the basis of the bid type, providing the at least one advertisement within a webpage.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example content presentation system.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system for improved ad deployment.
- FIG. 3A is an exemplary screenshot reflecting an exemplary webpage.
- FIG. 3B is an exemplary screenshot reflecting another exemplary webpage.
- FIG. 3C is an exemplary screenshot reflecting yet another exemplary webpage.
- FIG. 4A is a flow chart of an example process for deploying ads.
- FIG. 4B is a flow chart showing further aspects of an example process for computing an exposure interval of a content segment.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process setting a bid type.
- FIG. 7 shows an example of a computing device and a mobile computing device that can be used in connection with computer-implemented methods and systems described in the present specification.
- ads associated with various bid types can be deployed across content segments (such as webpages or portions thereof) in a manner that improves or optimizes the revenue such ads (and their associated bids) generate for the content publishers on whose webpages the ads are presented.
- bid types are bids which are monetized as a function of the time (e.g., per second, per minute, etc.) that the associated ads are exposed to/viewable by website viewers/users.
- Determinations of the ad (or ads) to deploy within a particular content segment or segments can be computed with reference to the associated bid type(s) and an exposure interval of the content segment (reflecting the amount of time the content segment is expected to be exposed to/viewable by a user).
- the exposure interval can be further computed or refined with respect to a particular group or demographic. In processing an exposure interval with the bids associated with various ads, a determination of which ad is expected to generate a greatest amount of revenue within a particular content segment can be identified.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing an example content presentation system 100 .
- one or more advertisers 102 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and log ad information in an advertising management system 104 .
- advertising other forms of content, including other forms of sponsored content, can be delivered by the system 100 .
- the ads can be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text-only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one or more of any of such components, etc.
- the ads can also include embedded information, such as links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more publishers 106 can submit requests for ads to the system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending ads to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on, or association with, one or more of the publisher's content items (e.g., web properties).
- Example web properties can include web pages, television and radio advertising slots, or print media space.
- Other entities can provide usage information to the system 104 , such as, for example, whether or not a conversion (e.g., a purchase or other interaction including, for example, a request for driving directions to a location associated with an ad, navigating to the location associated with the ad, or walking to the location associated with the ad) or a click-through related to an ad (e.g., a user has selected an ad) has occurred.
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to ads that have been served.
- a user may opt in or opt out of allowing user behavior to be recorded, measured, or observed.
- identifiers associated with each user may be anonymized so that the identity of each user is not provided to the advertiser.
- the system 104 can perform financial transactions, for example, crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- a network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 102 , the system 104 , the publishers 106 , and the users 108 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof
- One example publisher 106 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the content server can submit a request for content such as ads to a content server such as an advertisement server in the system 104 .
- the ad request can include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request can also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content
- a category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- the content server or a client browser can combine the requested content with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 .
- the combined content and ads can be sent/rendered to the users 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can transmit information about the ads back to the content server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM)
- search service can receive queries for search results.
- the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and can be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search service can submit a request for ads to the system 104 .
- the request can include a number of ads desired. This number can depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, and/or a variety of other factors. In some implementations, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for ads can also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information can include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.
- the content management system 104 includes an auction process to select ads from the advertisers 102 .
- the advertisers 102 can be permitted to select, or bid, an amount the advertisers are willing to pay for each presentation of or interaction with (e.g., click of) an ad, e.g., a cost-per-click amount an advertiser pays when, for example, a user clicks on an ad.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay for each click of an ad based on a keyword, e.g., a word or words in a query.
- Other bid types can also be used. Based on these bids, ads can be selected and ranked for presentation.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the users 108 that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid ads and presumably neutral search results.
- one or more publishers 106 can submit requests for ads to the advertising management system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending ads to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property.
- the advertising management system can provide sports-related ads to the publisher 106 .
- the requests can instead be executed by devices associated with the user 108 , e.g., by the execution of a particular script when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device.
- an ad push model is used to provide ads from advertisers 102 .
- ads can be pushed to idle screens (e.g., of a mobile devices or particular applications) based on particular criteria (e.g., the user's location).
- publisher 106 is a mobile application developer.
- a mobile application is an application specifically designed for operation on a mobile device (e.g., a smart phone).
- the mobile application can also include ads positioned within the content of the mobile application. Similar to publishers 106 , the ads can be received from the system 104 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device).
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system 200 for improved ad deployment.
- an advertiser 102 A- 102 N (referred to collectively as advertisers 102 ) can submit one or more ads 210 A- 210 N (also known as “creatives”) (referred to collectively as ads 210 ) to an ad system 204 , and such ads 210 are stored in an ad repository 202 .
- Each ad (e.g., ad 210 A) includes one or more words, phrases, web links, and/or any other such element and/or component (e.g., images, video, audio, etc.) that are provided to one or more users 108 (e.g., banner ads, text-only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, etc.).
- one or more keywords are associated with one or more creatives in order to enable the identification and selection of pertinent ads for display to a user based on one or more search queries received from the user.
- ads 210 are described herein as referring to individual ads, in certain implementations ads 210 can refer to groups of ads, such as ad groups, campaigns, and/or categories.
- Ad system 204 can also include an ad presentation manager 260 .
- the ad presentation manager 260 can identify ads in the ad repository 202 to present to a user 108 , for example based on various criteria such as keywords in a search query, web page content, context, location, ad financials (e.g., cost per impression).
- ad presentation manager 260 can identify one or more ads 210 associated with one or more keywords that are similar and/or identical to the search query provided by the user, and such creatives can be provided to the user in any number of ad formats.
- the ad system 204 can interact with a search system, for example presenting ads alongside search results.
- the ad system 204 can interact with content publishers, for example, providing ads to publishers or users for presentation along with web content, e-mail, or other content.
- Ad system 204 can also include one or more ad logs 212 .
- Ad log 212 can track and store one or more performance metrics that reflect the performance or success of a particular ad. For example, for a given ad, ad log 212 can track the ‘click through rate,’ reflecting the percentage of users presented with a creative that click on or otherwise select the presented content, though it should be understood that any number of other performance metrics can be similarly tracked (e.g., conversion rate), as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
- ad system 204 can include an ad deployment improvement engine 206 .
- the ad deployment improvement engine 206 can process a content segment such as a webpage, in order to determine one or more ads to be deployed within the content segment. It should be understood that ad deployment improvement engine 206 can process any number of elements and/or components of various ads, content segments, publishers, advertisers, users, and/or bid types, in order to compute and/or generate such determinations. It should also be understood that in some implementations ad deployment improvement engine 206 can include one or more processors configured by code to implement the functionality of the ad deployment improvement engine that is being described.
- Ad system 204 can also include one or more bid types 230 .
- a particular bid type can reflect one or more ways or methods in which an advertiser 102 can elect to provide to an advertising auction, and subsequently to pay for the serving of a particular ad 210 by ad system 204 .
- Examples of such bid types 230 include: cost per impression (referred to herein as “CPM”) bid 232 , whereby an advertiser bids a specified amount for an instance of display/serving of an ad to a user 108 (irrespective of the length of time that the ad is viewable and/or any subsequent interaction with the ad), cost per click (referred to herein as “CPC”) bid 234 , whereby an advertiser bids a specified amount for an instance of user interaction with the ad, such as a click by the user on the ad, and/or cost per time unit (referred to herein as “CPT”) bid 236 , whereby an advertiser bids a specified amount per time unit (such as seconds, minutes, etc.) that an ad is displayed to and/or viewable by a user.
- CPC cost per click
- CPT cost per time unit
- bid types 232 - 236 are merely exemplary, and that other ad bid types can be similarly employed, such as bids based on conversion rates, as are known to those or ordinary skill in the art.
- bid types 230 can be associated with one or more ads 210 .
- ad 210 A can be associated with a particular CPM bid 232 (e.g., a bid to pay up to $0.02 per impression) while ad 210 N can be associated with a particular CPT bid 236 (e.g., a bid to pay up to $0.005 per second).
- bids such as CPM bids and CPC bids can be characterized as being non-CPT bids, on account of the fact that their respective bids are not implemented as a function of time.
- Ad system 204 can also include one or more advertiser accounts 240 .
- Each individual advertiser account (not shown) corresponds to advertising funds associated with a particular advertiser 102 . Funds are deducted from such accounts upon the successful serving of one or more ads on behalf of a particular advertiser, such as in the manner described in detail herein.
- one or more publishers 106 can be in communication with ad system 204 through network 110 .
- publishers 106 can maintain content exposure data 250 with respect to the content (e.g., one or more websites, webpages, blogs, media files, etc.) provided by the publisher, thought it should be understood that in other implementations such content exposure data 250 can be similarly maintained by another entity, such as ad system 204 .
- Examples of content exposure data 250 include one or more metrics that reflect the time and/or degree that users 108 engage with the content provided by publishers 106 , such as particular areas, regions, and/or pages of a particular website.
- an exemplary screenshot 300 is provided, reflecting an exemplary webpage 302 provided by publisher 106 to user 108 .
- the webpage 302 includes an embedded video 310 with a duration of 15 minutes, and two ad slots 304 and 306 .
- Ad slots refer to areas within a webpage that are designated or reserved for the display of ads. It can be appreciated that ads 210 are deployed in the respective ad slots 304 , 306 .
- FIG. 3B depicts an exemplary screenshot 320 of another exemplary webpage 322 .
- This webpage provides a brief reference to a hyperlink 330 to another webpage, as well as two ad slots 324 and 326 within which ads 210 are respectively deployed.
- users 108 on average, are likely to spend relatively less time viewing the webpage shown in FIG. 3B (consisting primarily of a hyperlink to another site) than the webpage shown in FIG. 3A (consisting primarily of a 15 minute embedded video), and the results of this discrepancy can be reflected in the content exposure data 250 maintained for each respective page.
- deploying ads associated with various bid types across the different webpages can serve to improve and/or optimize the advertising revenue generated by each webpage, as described in greater detail herein.
- FIG. 3C depicts an exemplary screenshot 340 of yet another exemplary webpage 342 .
- content such as hyperlinks 330 , embedded video 310 , and ads 1-2 are viewable, other content such as blog 350 and ad 3 are not viewable without scrolling the page down.
- certain content segments e.g., embedded video 310
- deploying ads associated with different bid types in proximity to the respective content segments can serve to improve and/or optimize the advertising revenue generated by the page as a whole, as described in greater detail herein.
- FIG. 4A is a flowchart of an example method 400 for deploying ads.
- the method 400 can be performed by a processor executing instructions in a computer-readable storage medium.
- the method 400 can be performed by the ad system 204 of FIG. 2 .
- An exposure interval of a content segment is computed ( 410 ).
- a content segment can be a webpage (e.g., the webpage 302 as depicted in FIG. 3A ), while in other implementations the content segment can be a portion of a webpage (e.g., segment 360 in FIG. 3C , reflecting the portion of webpage 342 containing media/video content 310 ).
- an exposure interval can be measured as a function of time, such as 15 seconds, five minutes, etc.
- the referenced exposure interval/average exposure interval can be computed/refined with respect to one or more user profiles or user types. That is, it can be appreciated that users among a first demographic (e.g., between the ages of 18-25) can relate to various content segments differently than users among a second demographic (e.g., between the ages of 55-65). For example, users between the ages of 18-25 can, on average, spend more time engaging with video/media content as compared to text content, while users between the ages of 55-65 can, on average, spend more time engaging with text content as compared to video/media content.
- a first demographic e.g., between the ages of 18-25
- a second demographic e.g., between the ages of 55-65
- users between the ages of 18-25 can, on average, spend more time engaging with video/media content as compared to text content
- users between the ages of 55-65 can, on average, spend more time engaging with text content as compared to video/media content.
- a particular content segment e.g., a content segment containing an embedded video
- a user profile/demographic can be provided by a user (such as through user profile information composed/provided by the user), while in other implementations such a user profile/demographic can be generated based on user behavior that has been observed (though it should be understood that in some cases a user may opt in or opt out of such an observation, and in some cases, identifiers associated with each user may be anonymized, as referenced above).
- a content segment can be analyzed to identify one or more elements of the content segment ( 412 ).
- elements include media content (such as an embedded video or audio file or stream), text content (such as a blog post or article), a hyperlink, and/or aspects of such elements.
- the HTML code corresponding to/underlying a particular webpage e.g., webpage 302 depicted in FIG. 3A
- a portion of a webpage e.g., segment 360 in FIG. 3C
- elements such as media/video content 310
- different elements of a content segment can be associated with fixed exposure intervals (e.g., media/video content is ascribed a five minute exposure interval, blog posts/articles are ascribed a two minute exposure interval, hyperlinks are ascribed a five second exposure interval, etc.), while in other implementations certain aspects of such elements can dictate/suggest a particular exposure interval to be ascribed to the pertinent content segment.
- the finite duration of media/video content e.g., 15 minutes, as shown in FIG. 3A
- some function thereof e.g., 50% of the total duration of the media/video content
- the number of words in a blog post or article can dictate/suggest the referenced exposure interval (e.g., each 50 words of a blog post/article is equivalent to one minute of an exposure interval). It can be appreciated that by computing an exposure interval based on elements of a content segment, a determination can be made regarding the exposure interval of the content segment, even in scenarios where there are no previous exposure instances (such as those referenced at 410 ) or in scenarios where such previous exposure instances are not statistically significant.
- exposure intervals such as those computed based on the various elements within a content segment, can be said to be projected exposure intervals, as they reflect a projected exposure interval that can be computed even in scenarios where little or no historical data exists and/or is available.
- two or more advertisements that are candidates to be provided within an advertising slot of the content segment can be identified ( 420 ).
- one of the advertisements can be associated with a CPT bid and another of the advertisements can be associated with a non-CPT bid.
- ad 210 A can be associated with a particular CPM bid 232 (e.g., a bid to pay up to $0.02 per impression) while ad 210 N can be associated with a particular CPT bid 236 (e.g., a bid to pay up to $0,005 per second).
- advertisers 102 can participate in an auction whereby the advertisers can bid various monetary amounts, with the highest/winning bid (optionally in combination with the relevance of the particular ad, as referenced above) entitling the advertiser to serve their ad to a user.
- an auction process can yield a CPM bid of up to $0.05 per impression, a CPC bid of up to $0.15 for per click, and/or a CPT bid for up to $0.01/second.
- Each respective bid in the auction can be processed with an exposure interval (such as the exposure interval computed at 410 ) in order to determine which advertisement (and its associated bid) is likely to yield the most revenue.
- an advertisement associated with a CPM bid yields $0.05 of advertising revenue for the publisher, while deploying an advertisement associated with a CPT bid yields $0.04 of advertising revenue ($0.01/second ⁇ 4 seconds)—thus, an ad associated with a CPM bid is preferable to an ad associated with a CPT bid in such a content segment.
- an ad associated with a CPT bid yields $0.06 of advertising revenue ($0.01/second ⁇ 6 seconds), while an ad associated with a CPM bid yields $0.05 of advertising revenue—thus, an ad associated with a CPT bid is preferable to an ad associated with a CPM bid under such circumstances.
- ad associated with a CPC bid can also be accounted for (that is, considered with respect to determining the ad associated with a particular bid type to deploy within a particular content segment) by converting the CPC bid into an equivalent metric.
- CPC bid e.g., $0.15
- CTR predicted/average click-through rate
- the referenced associations of a particular ad with a particular bid type can include a distribution of one or more ads having various respective bid types (e.g., CPC, CPT, etc.) within one or more content segments.
- content segment 360 containing media/video content 310 and ad 2
- a first exposure interval e.g., six seconds
- a second content segment 370 containing hyperlinks 330 and ad 1 within the same webpage 342 can have a second exposure interval (e.g., four seconds).
- ad slot 346 of content segment 360 e.g., ad 2
- an ad associated with a CPT bid is likely to yield the greatest amount of advertising revenue when deployed in this ad slot
- ad slot 344 of content segment 370 e.g., ad 1
- an ad associated with a CPM ad is likely to yield the greatest amount of advertising revenue when deployed therein.
- advertising revenues can be maximized across the various content segments (when compared to a deployment ads associated only with CPM bids or ads associated only with CPT bids).
- One or more ads are provided in one or more advertising slots ( 440 ).
- the ads can be provided in response to a determination that an ad associated with one bid type is expected to generate a greater amount of revenue than an ad associated with another bid type (e.g., with respect to a particular ad slot included within a particular content segment), such as in the manner described at 430 .
- the one or more ads can be provided/deployed within a content segment in a manner that optimizes projected revenues generated by the one or more ads, such as in the manner described above.
- the manner in which the ads are deployed can, in certain implementations, be based on an exposure interval, such as the exposure interval computed at 410 .
- providing/deploying ads within a content segment can include providing a suggested arrangement of the ads within the content segment.
- the publisher of website 342 (as depicted in FIG. 3C ) can be presented with one or more suggestions of various arrangements of ads (and their respective associated bid types), such as those referenced above. The publisher can then choose to deploy such suggestions, edit/modify them, and/or reject them.
- various ads can be provided/deployed in a manner that accounts for a user profile of the particular user to whom the ads are being deployed. That is, as referenced above at 410 , it can be appreciated that users from different groups and/or demographics can have different interests and can interact with/view webpages and ads differently. As such, having identified a user as having a particular profile, ads can be deployed in a manner that accounts for such an identification (e.g., deploying ads having associated bid types in a manner that improves or optimizes revenue generation on account of observed or predicted tendencies about other members of the same group/demographic, such as exposure intervals with regard to various content segments, as described herein).
- An association of one or more of the ads is selectively converted from one bid type to another bid type ( 450 ). That is, it can be appreciated that the particular advertising objectives of an advertiser can change and/or be dependent upon various budgetary considerations. Moreover, it can be further appreciated that certain bid types, such as CPT bids, can entail a degree of unpredictability with respect to the specific amount an advertiser will be charged for a particular impression of an ad associated with such a bid (as this charge is ultimately determined by the actual amount of time during which a user is exposed to the ad).
- CPT bids CPT bids
- a certain budgetary threshold e.g., an advertising account of an advertiser falls below a certain threshold, such as a defined amount or a percentage of an original account balance
- the association of one or more ads of a particular advertiser can be converted from one bid type to another bid type.
- a certain threshold such as a defined amount or a percentage of an original account balance
- an advertiser can potentially increase the predictability of the number of advertising impressions that will be achieved with the remaining advertising account balance (in light of the fact that, in the case of an association with a CPT bid, longer impression periods will deplete the account balance sooner and provide fewer total impression instances). It should also be noted that such a conversion (e.g., converting the association of a particular ad from a CPT bid to a CPM bid) can be achieved using the principles referenced above (at 430 ) with respect to determining which ad is expected to generate the greatest amount of revenue on the basis of a particular bid associated with the ad and a computed exposure interval.
- a monetization rate of a bid is progressively adjusted ( 460 ). That is, it can be appreciated that in a scenario where an ad associated with a cost per time unit (CPT) bid is deployed, the amount that the advertiser ultimately pays for a particular instance of deployment of the ad is variable, depending on the amount of time that a user views/is exposed to the ad. It can also be appreciated that in many cases the utility/value of the viewing of the ad by the user diminishes as time goes on. As such, in some implementations the monetization rate (for example, the amount the advertiser pays per time unit) of such CPT bids can be progressively adjusted as time goes on.
- CPT cost per time unit
- a CPT bid can be configured to charge a first rate (e.g., $0.01/second) for a first time period (e.g., the first 10 seconds of ad exposure) and a second rate (e.g., $0.005/second) for a second time period (e.g., the following 10 seconds).
- a monetization cap can be imposed on a CPT bid, representing a maximum value that an advertiser can be charged for a single impression (e.g., $0.20). In doing so, the advertiser can be protected from significant charges in scenarios where a user maintains an instance of a page having an ad associated with a CPT bid for a lengthy period of time.
- the monetization rate can be optionally configured to increase as time goes on (e.g., in the case of a video ad where the ongoing viewing of the advertisement is of increasing value to the advertiser).
- the monetization rate of a CPT bid can be progressively adjusted based elements of the content segment within which the associated ad is deployed. For example, in the case of a video ad, there can be certain points within the video that are of greater value/importance to the advertiser than others (e.g., points where a particular product or feature is shown). It can be further appreciated that such points can be flagged or otherwise designated by the advertiser, in a manner known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
- certain points/segments of such a video advertisement can be monetized at one rate, while other points/segments of the same video can be monetized at a different rate, owing to the differences in importance/value between the various points/segments.
- various ads can be configured to be monetized only if/when the ad is within view of a user.
- Ad 3 is not immediately viewable to the user upon arrival at webpage 342 . Indeed, in certain scenarios the user may never be exposed to Ad 3 (such as if the user leaves the site or otherwise remains idle without scrolling down).
- Ad 3 is associated with a CPT bid
- the ad can be configured to charge the advertiser only when Ad 3 is viewable to the user, such as when the user scrolls down webpage 342 .
- a timer response for maintaining the exposure time for ads associated with CPT bids
- a timer can effectively pause until the ad returns to view.
- ads associated with CPT bids such principles can be similarly applied to other ads, such as ads associated with CPM bids (e.g., an impression is only counted if the ad is actually within view of a user for some period of time).
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an example method 500 for setting a bid type.
- the method 500 can be performed by a processor executing instructions in a computer-readable storage medium.
- the method 500 can be performed by the ad system 204 of FIG. 2 .
- An ad can be processed to compute a target exposure interval ( 510 ). It should be understood that a target exposure interval is an ideal or desired time duration for the ad to be presented to/viewable by a user. In certain implementations, the content of one or more of the ads can be analyzed in order to compute a target exposure interval.
- FIG. 6 depicts exemplary ads 210 and 210 B. It can be appreciated, with reference to FIG. 6 , that ad 210 A (“Buy insurance now!”) is considerably shorter (that is, contains fewer words) than ad 210 B (“Get an instant quote . . . Click here for more!”).
- the target exposure interval (that is, the ideal amount of time to display the ad) of ad 210 A is likely to be significantly less than the target exposure interval of ad 210 B (in light of ad 210 A having relatively fewer words than ad 210 B and thus requiring relatively less time for the advertising message to be imparted to a user viewing the ad).
- the content of an ad can be analyzed and the target exposure interval can be computed as a function of the number of words in an ad.
- every three words in an ad can be defined to be equivalent to one second of a target exposure interval—thus, ad 210 A of FIG.
- the content type of one or more of the ads can be analyzed/considered in order to compute a target exposure interval.
- certain types of ads e.g., flash ads, interactive ads, etc.
- other types of ads e.g., text ads, banner ads, etc.
- An bid type for association with the at least one ad can be determined based on the target exposure interval ( 520 ). That is, having determined (such as at 510 ) the target exposure interval for a particular ad, the target exposure interval can be processed in a manner substantially similar to that described in detail above at 430 , whereby various bid types can be processed with the target exposure interval in order to determine which bid type is likely to yield the most revenue when associated with a particular ad.
- One or more ads can be deployed as within a webpage ( 530 ).
- the ad can be deployed in response to a selection of the ad, such as on the basis of a bid type associated with the ad. That is, having determined a bid type to associated with a particular ad (such as at 520 ), the ad can be deployed to a user, substantially in the manner described in detail above at 440 .
