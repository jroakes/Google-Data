Embodiment
Some embodiments disclosed herein can be applied to access limited document.It is " to access as used in this article
Limited document " is contrasted with publicly accessible document (for example, the public can be via WWW free access), and is
The addressable electronic document of limited users group.In some embodiments, can the logging on authentication based on limited users group,
Based on only document can be limited, and/or based on other technologies come will be right to limited users group via the access that dedicated network accesses
The access for accessing limited document is restricted to limited users group.It is that " access of user is limited document " is as used in this article
Limited one or more that is user can only being accessed and can alternatively being specified by user or otherwise controlling
The access of other users group access is limited document.Only user can be accessed as following for example, the access of user is limited document
Function：Be stored locally on the computing device by user's control, can be via the appropriate logging on authentication of user via one or more
A computer application access etc..For example, the Email of user can be can only being stepped on to user via the appropriate of user for user
The access that record voucher accesses is limited document.Moreover, for example, the heterogeneous documents stored in storage system based on cloud of user can
Be user only can to user via user appropriate logging on authentication access access be limited document.It is alternatively possible to it is based on
Express authorization is carried out to make one or more of heterogeneous documents heterogeneous documents via one or more computer applications by user
Can also be to limited other users group access.Moreover, for example, because be locally stored on the computing device of user user by
Document is limited, so being locally stored on the mobile phone of user, tablet, desktop computer, and/or other computing devices various
Document can be that the access of user is limited document.
Using user interactive data (for example, clicking rate) with the specific publicly accessible search knot to ad hoc inquiry
Fruit document carries out ranking.For example, user interactive data can indicate：For particular search query, in response to particular search query
Specific publicly accessible search result document there is clicking rate for particular search query, the clicking rate is considerably beyond sound
Should be in any other publicly accessible search result document of particular search query.Based on this instruction, for specific search
Inquiry, compared with the publicly accessible search result of other responses can by with specific publicly accessible search result document
Corresponding search result rank obtains more notable (for example, being provided for significantly more presenting).
However, be directed to use with user interactive data carries out ranking with the publicly accessible search result for ad hoc inquiry
Various technologies cannot be applied to various documents and/or desired performance cannot be provided.For example, various skills cannot be applied
Limited document (for example, accessing the limited document of user's submission inquiry) and/or various publicly accessible documents are accessed to various
(for example, in response to inquiring about, not having and/or have the publicly accessible document of relatively small number of interaction).
As an example, it is assumed that be that user submits search inquiry to search for the personal email of user, it is and more
A respond with e-mails (that is, the access of user is limited document) is identified as in response to search inquiry (for example, Email includes
With the matched one or more lexical items of one or more of search inquiry lexical item).It can be the situation of following item：It can not ring
Should in other users and/or the prior searches of user present in respond with e-mails one or more (for example, all) and/or
Interact.For example, specific e-mail can be in response to only send to user and have in previous search inquiry
There is user previously without interactive Email.Therefore, any user associated with specific e-mail can be not present
Interaction data, reproduces and is directed to use with user interactive data to carry out ranking to publicly accessible search result, but to specific
Email carries out the inoperative various technologies of ranking.
As another example, it is assumed that be user submit search inquiry, with search can be to the visit of limited users group access
Ask the corpus of limited document, and multiple response documents are identified as the response to search inquiry.Can be the feelings of following item
Condition：Can be not responsive to previous submit of search inquiry and present (for example, all) one or more in response document and/or with
It is interacted, and/or one or more in response document ring may be presented in response to previous submit of search inquiry
Answer document and/or only interacted with its minimum.Accordingly, in response to search inquiry, can be not present related to this document
Enough user interactive datas of connection, reproduction are directed to use with user interactive data to arrange publicly accessible search result
Name, but the inoperative various technologies of ranking are carried out to this document.
As another example, it is assumed that be user submit search inquiry to search for the corpus of publicly accessible document,
And multiple response documents are identified as in response to search inquiry.It can be the situation of following item：Search can be not responsive to look into
That askes previously submits and (for example, whole) one or more in response document is presented and/or interact, and/or
Have responded in previous submit of search inquiry present in response document one or more (for example, all) and/or only with its
Minimum interacts.Accordingly, in response to search inquiry, the enough user mutual associated with this document may be not present
Data, reproduce and are directed to use with user interactive data to carry out ranking to publicly accessible search result, but to this document
Ranking is carried out not work various technologies.
This specification presents various technical characteristics, which is directed to use with the text of the document in response to inquiry
Shelves feature and the query characteristics alternatively inquired about determine for presenting and the presentation characteristic of the corresponding search result of document, and
And in response to the inquiry, there is provided search result using characteristic is presented to be presented.It is associated with file characteristics and/or query characteristics
Measurement be determined for present characteristic.Measurement can be based on being interacted by corresponding user with the passing of other documents,
One or more of other documents and document sharing the document feature, wherein, a number of other documents are each different from document
(and alternatively, in these documents with different from each other).Alternatively need not with particularly for accessing appointing for limited document
What in the case of the reference of passing interaction, and made using this measurement in the limited document of definite access based on interactive correlation
When the passing interaction that can participate in.In some embodiments, other documents include but not limited to：Themselves accesses and is limited
Document.
In some embodiments, the presentation characteristic with the corresponding search result of document in response to inquiry is being determined
When, generation is for the inquiry calculation of correlation for accessing limited document, and the inquiry calculation of correlation is used to determine that characteristic is presented.At that
In some in a little embodiments, inquiry calculation of correlation is based between the query characteristics of inquiry and the file characteristics of document
The measurement of passing interaction.Each in measurement can be based on when in response to one or more inquiry in query characteristics
Corresponding to for feature is inquired about and corresponding user during other documents is presented and has one or more document spy in file characteristics
The quantity of the passing interaction of other documents of sign.
As an example, it is assumed that be that user submits looking into for " books O/No. " using Email search interface
Ask.May search for user is individually the corpus of the Email of the limited document of access of user, and can be identified as
To multiple respond with e-mails of the response of inquiry.Specific response Email can come from " store@
Exampleurl.com ", can include the theme of " confirmation of order 1A2B3C ", and can include that there is identification to be purchased by user
The main body and purchase details (for example, purchase date, Shipping Address, delivery date, expense) of the content for the certain book bought.
It cannot be in response to the inquiry in other users and be interacted by other users and specific response Email (that is, due to spy
Provisioning response Email is personal to user, and other users are inaccessible by)-and cannot potentially be in response to
Interacted in the inquiry of user by user and specific response Email.However, still it can utilize described herein
Technology, with based on the passing friendship between the query characteristics of inquiry " books O/No. " and the file characteristics of specific e-mail
Mutual measures to determine the inquiry calculation of correlation of specific e-mail.
For example, when being presented those its in response to the corresponding inquiry with n-gram (n-gram) " books order "
, can be based on multiple users with including that " store@exampleurl.com " are simultaneously in From (from) field during its Email
And Subject (theme) field include " confirming an order [#] " (wherein, [#] be instruction letter and/or digit strings
Placeholder) the number of interaction of Email determine the first measurement.Moreover, for example, when in response to n-gram " book
The corresponding inquiry of nationality order " and when those other Emails are presented, can based on multiple users with From fields
Including " store@exampleurl.com " and the friendship for including in Subject fields the Email of " acknowledgement of orders [#] "
Mutual number determines the second measurement.Can be based on the first measurement, the second measurement and alternatively other similar definite measurements
To generate inquiry calculation of correlation.For example, inquiry calculation of correlation can be summation, average value, median or the other statistics of measurement
Combination.
Inquiry calculation of correlation is determined for the presentation characteristic for specific response Email.For example, it can utilize
Inquiry calculation of correlation is directed to the initial score of specific response Email to change (for example, based in inquiry and specific electron postal
The scoring of matched degree between part), and using the scoring with relative to other respond with e-mails to specific electron postal
Part carries out ranking (for example, alternatively, the initial score changed based on those Emails).For example, ranking can be utilized
With determine provided in response to inquiry corresponding search result for present when by first with that respond with e-mails,
To determine the presentation order (or other display high-lightings) for search result, and/or determine for the additional of search result
Or alternative presentation characteristic.
In some embodiments, generation for document inquiry it is uncorrelated measure, and additionally or alternatively,
The inquiry is uncorrelated to be measured for determining that characteristic is presented.In some in those embodiments, inquire about independent measurement and be based on working as
Corresponding user and one or more in the file characteristics with document when other documents are presented in response to corresponding inquiry
The measurement of the passing interaction of other documents of file characteristics, wherein, those inquiries include but not limited to：Do not include in query characteristics
Those any inquiries.Accordingly, in response to the inquiry with query characteristics, inquiring about uncorrelated measure can be provided with document
The instruction of the overall popularity of the document of feature, however inquire about calculation of correlation provide the document with file characteristics by joyous
The instruction for degree of meeting.
In some embodiments, the inquiry degree of correlation of document can be generated based on query characteristics-file characteristics model
