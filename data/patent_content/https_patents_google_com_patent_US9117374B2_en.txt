Definitions
- the disclosed implementations relate to the field of media display generally and in particular to automatically generating interactive media content.
- Media content providers have significant motivation to increase user interest and engagement with the media content they provide. Increased user engagement generally results in greater exposure for the media content. Greater exposure and user engagement results in increased revenue for the provider of that media content.
- User engagement can be increased by changing the content of the media to be more visually or intellectually appealing.
- user interest in media content can also be increased by changing the viewer experience without altering the content of the media content. For example, displaying the media content on a larger display, at a higher resolution, or in a three dimensional format. By increasing the visual appeal of the content user engagement may be increased.
- Video games for example, are interactive and produce greater engagement with users than passive viewers of television programs. Trivia games are a popular type of interactive games that engage users and allow them to compete with other users or against themselves.
- a method for automatically generating quiz questions is disclosed.
- the method is performed on a server system having one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors.
- the server system receives, from a client system, media information associated with media content displayed on a display associated with the client system.
- the server system analyzes the received media information to determine one or more keywords associated with the media information.
- the server system retrieves one or more facts based on the one or more determined keywords.
- the server system then automatically generates a quiz question based on the one or more retrieved facts.
- the server system transmits the generated quiz question to the client system for display.
- a server system for automatically generating quiz questions includes one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs to be executed by the one or more processors.
- the one or more programs comprise instructions for receiving, from a client system, media information associated with media content displayed on a display associated with the client system.
- the one or more programs further include instructions for analyzing the received media information to determine one or more keywords associated with the media information.
- the one or more programs further include instructions for retrieving one or more facts based on the determined one or more keywords.
- the one or more programs further include instructions for automatically generating a quiz question based on the one or more retrieved facts.

- One strategy for increasing user engagement is to provide interactive features to the user.
- One such interactive feature is a trivia game that is displayed to one or more users of one or more client systems concurrently with media content displayed on the screen.
- the trivia questions themselves are automatically generated based on information related to the media content displayed on a client system. By only generating questions associated with the displayed media content the trivia game increases user engagement in the media content instead of distracting the user from becoming engaged with the displayed media content.
- the questions are automatically generated by a server system located remotely from the client system that is displaying the media content.
- the server system will receive information concerning the currently displayed piece of media from the client system. This information includes identification of the piece of media content and a description of the content of the piece of media content. Some implementations will also include the genre, plot points, cast list, and a closed captioned textual representation of all the spoken dialogue in the piece of media content.
- the server system analyzes the information received from the client system to determine specific keywords associated with the displayed content. For example, the server system may determine, based on the text associated with the dialogue in the media content, that the characters on a television show are discussing pineapples. Based on analyzing this text the server system may determine that “pineapple” is a currently relevant keyword.
- the server system uses the determined keywords to generate quiz questions related to the currently displayed media content.
- the server system uses the determined keyword to retrieve facts related to the keyword. For example, for a determined keyword of “pineapple,” the server system retrieves the fact “The Philippines is the largest producer of pineapples in the world.”
- the facts are retrieved from a database of facts stored at the server system.
- the facts are retrieved from a third party database remote from the server system. In this case, the third party database is stored and maintained by a third party, unrelated to the organization that operates the server system.
- the server system then sends the determined keyword to the third party database and receives from the third party database, one or more facts associated with the keyword.
- the server system uses the retrieved facts to automatically generate quiz questions.
- the server system analyzes the retrieved facts to determine what portion of the facts is most suitable to be used as an answer and what portion is most appropriate for creating a quiz question.
- the server system employs simple analysis methods, such as identifying proper nouns, numbers, measurement quantities, or more general nouns in the text of the fact to use as an answer for a quiz question. For example, a fact may be analyzed to identify a proper noun by comparing each word in the fact against a list of known proper nouns. The server system then determines the category of the answer and identifies reasonable alternatives. For example, when the server system analyzes the fact, “The Philippines is the largest producers of pineapples in the world” it may identify “Philippines” as a proper noun and select it as the answer to a quiz question. The server system then determines that “Philippines” is a country name.
- the server system is able to identify reasonable alternatives such as “Brazil,” “Columbia”, and “Sri Lanka.”
- Reasonable alternatives may be determined from a database of categories such as countries, dates, animals, and fruits. Each category in the database would include a list of possible alternatives for answers that fall into that category.
- the server system retrieves facts from a fact database in which the facts are already preprocessed, such that the fact itself indicates the portion of the facts that are suitable for answers to quiz questions and will include a list of reasonable alternatives from which the server system may choose.
- the server system then creates a quiz question by rephrasing the fact as a question and listing the original answer and the determined alternatives in a randomly determined order.
- the server system transmits the created quiz questions to one or more client systems.
- a created question can be transmitted to any client system currently viewing the media content to which the quiz question is related. For example, if the quiz question is based on a specific episode of the television program, “Community,” the server system then is able to transmit the created quiz question to any client system currently displaying the same specific episode of the television program “Community” and participating in the quiz game.
- many client systems that are displaying the same media content at the same time (such as a broadcast television program) with at least one user participating in the quiz game will all display the same created quiz questions.
- a user in the vicinity of the client system that is displaying the generated questions received from the server system responds to the quiz question by transmitting an answer to the client device.
- the user's chosen answer can be transmitted to the client system via a number of well established methods such as a remote control device, a mobile phone with an appropriate application, or a controller for a video game system.
- the client system then transmits the user's selected answer to the server system.
- more than one user interacts with a particular client device and responds to displayed quiz questions.
- the client system receives answers from each user who is playing the quiz game and transmits those answers to the server system, either individually as they are received or as a group once answers from each user are received.
- each respective user of the quiz game may opt to allow the system to maintain a user profile for the respective user.
- the client system then maintains user profiles for each user currently playing the game that opts to allow it and records each answer given by the user.
- users log into the server system to play the quiz game and the results of each play session are recorded in user profiles stored on the server system.
- the server system receives user selected answers from at least one client device.
- the user selected answers are analyzed to generate a score.
- the score is generated by determining whether the answer selected by a particular user matches the correct answer (based on the fact used to automatically generate the quiz question.)
- a score is determined by determining whether answer selected is correct and determining how quickly the answer is selected by the user. A user who answers correctly quickly is awarded a higher score than a user who selects correct answer more slowly.
- the score also takes into account the order in which the answers are received, allocating the highest score to the user who submits the first correct answer and lower scores to users who submit correct scores subsequently.
- the generated scores are sent to one or more client system, such that each respective client system receives at least the scores associated with the users in the vicinity of the respective client system.
- the client systems display the scores received from the server system.
- more than one score is transmitted to the client system for display and the scores are ranked in order from the highest score to the lowest score.
- the server system transmits the scores associated with all users in the local client system environment for a particular client system for display on that particular client system. In this way, when multiple users in the same client system environment participate in the quiz game all the scores and relative ranks will be easily displayable and comparable on the client system.
- the server system sends the scores of all users currently participating in the quiz game to a client system for display and thus allows users at a particular client system to compare their scores and ranking against the scores and rankings of all the other users participating in the quiz game.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a client-server environment 100 in accordance with some implementations.
- the client-server environment 100 includes a client system 102 which is part of a user environment 108 and a server system 120 which are connected through a network 110 .
- the client system 102 - 1 includes a display 106 - 1 .
- the user environment 108 - 2 includes an input device 104 - 2 and a display 106 - 2 associated with the client system 102 - 2 but not integrated into the client system 102 - 2 .
- the input device 106 - 2 can be any device capable of receiving input from user and transmitting that input to the client system 102 - 2 .
- Possible input devices include remote controls, a smart phone with an application which enables the user to submit data to the client system, a video game controller, or a tablet computer.
- the server system 120 includes a reception module 122 , a data analysis module 124 , a question generation module 126 , a scoring module 128 , a transmission module 130 , and a fact database 132 .
- the network 110 includes any of a variety of networks, including local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), wireless networks, wired networks, the Internet, or a combination of such networks.
- a client environment 108 - 1 includes a client system 102 - 1 .
- the client system 102 - 1 includes an incorporated display 104 - 1 .
- the client environment 108 - 2 includes a client system 102 - 2 , a display 104 - 2 , which is associated with the client system 102 - 2 but is not integrated into the client system 102 - 2 , and an input device 106 - 2 , which may be directly connected to the client system 102 - 2 or is not directly connected and communicates with the client system 102 - 2 through wireless transmission.
- the input device 106 - 2 is used to transmit input from a user to the client system 102 - 2 .
- the associated display 104 - 2 is configured to display media in the vicinity of the user of the client system 102 - 2 .
- the client system 102 transmits media information 112 concerning the media currently being displayed on the display 104 to the server system 120 .
- the media information 112 may include metadata for the displayed media, including the name of the piece of media content, genre information, cast information, theme or topic information, and information concerning specific scenes or events.
- the media information 112 includes the text of all spoken or displayed content during a piece of media content.
- the client system 102 then receives generated quiz questions 116 from the server system 120 . The client system 102 then displays the received generated quiz question 116 on the display 104 associated with the client system 102 .
- any participating user in the client environment 108 is able to select an answer to the generated quiz questions 116 and transmit that answer 112 to the client system 102 through an input device 106 .
- the client system 102 then transmits selected answers 112 from one or more users in the client environment 108 participating in the quiz game to the server system 120 .
- the client system 102 receives scores 118 from the server system 120 .
- the score 118 associated with a particular user represents whether the answer selected by the user was the correct answer, based on information stored at the server system 120 .
- the score also represents how quickly the user responded to a particular question. For example, in some implementations a quiz question is displayed for 60 seconds on the display 104 . If a user submits a correct answer in the first 30 seconds, they receive 10 points. If a user submits a correct answer after the first 30 seconds but before the quiz question is no longer displayed the user would receive 5 points. Users who submit an incorrect answer or submit an answer after the quiz question is no longer displayed receive no points.
- the received scores 118 include a relative ranking of each participating user's cumulative score relative to the cumulative scores of at least some of the other users currently participating in the quiz game. Then the scores are displayed in order of cumulative score, the highest cumulative score displayed first or at the top and the lowest cumulative score being displayed last or at the bottom. In this way, users participating in the quiz game can easily judge their performance in the quiz game in relation to the performance of other users.
- the server system 120 includes a reception module 122 , a data analysis module 124 , a question generation module 126 , a transmission module 128 , a fact database 130 , and a scoring module 132 .
- the reception module 122 receives communications from the network 110 , including but not limited to media information 112 and user selected answers 114 from client systems 102 .
- the reception module receives this information and sends it either to the data analysis module 124 , in the case of media information 112 , or the scoring module, in the case of user selected answers 114 .
- the data analysis module 124 receives media information routed to it by the reception module 122 .
- the data analysis module 124 analyzes the media information 112 it receives to determine specific keywords.
- the keywords are nouns which relate to a topic relevant to media content currently being displayed on a display 104 currently in the proximity of the user.
- the data analysis module 124 retrieves a fact related to the identified keyword from a fact database 130 .
- the fact database 130 randomly chooses a fact from a list of facts associated with the determined keyword. The received fact is then sent to the question generation module 126 .
- the question generation module 126 receives a fact from the data analysis module 124 .
- the question generation module 126 uses the received fact to generate a quiz question.
- generating a quiz question involves several steps.
- the question generation module 126 determines the portion of the fact to use as the answer to the quiz question.
- the fact itself is formatted so as to identify an appropriate topic to use as an answer a quiz question.
- the received fact may be “Han Solo: the character played by Harrison Ford in the 1977 hit ‘Star Wars.’”
- the fact is formatted to identify “Han Solo” as an appropriate answer for the question.
- the question generation module 126 must analyze the fact to determine an appropriate answer for a new quiz question.
- the answer to the quiz question may be a proper noun, an otherwise distinctive non-proper noun, a date, a number, a unit of measurement, or another easily testable answer.
- the quiz generation module 126 may select “Harrison Ford,” “Han Solo,” or “Star Wars”, or the date 1977 as the answer and then build a quiz question that uses the selected section as the answer.
- the question generation module 126 determines all possible candidates that may be used as an answer to a quiz question and then randomly selects one of the determined possible candidates.
- the question generation module 126 includes heuristics that enable the question generation module 126 to determine, from a given fact, the portions of a fact that are appropriate topics for quiz questions.
- the question generation module first breaks the fact into several portions, each portion including a single word, a short phrase (e.g. a name or a title), a number, a date, or other grouping.
- the question generation module 126 determines a category or type for the respective portion of the fact. For example, the respective portion “Sep. 15, 1978” would be identified as a date, and the word “banana” would be identified as a fruit.
- the question generation module 126 selects one of the respective portions as the answer for the quiz question based on the identified category of each portion.
- the question generation module 126 determines reasonable alternatives to the determined answer to the quiz question. For example, if the selected answer is a date, the question generation module 126 determines reasonable date alternatives. The question generation module 126 then places the answer and the determined alternatives in a randomized order. The question generation module 126 passes the generated quiz question to the transmission module 128 .
- the transmission module 128 receives a generated question from the question generation module 126 .
- the transmission module 128 then sends the generated question to the client system 102 for display.
- the server system 120 includes a scoring module 132 .
- the reception module 122 receives user selected answers 114
- the user selected answers 114 are sent to the scoring module 132 .
- the scoring module 132 compares the user selected answers 114 to the correct answer stored by the server system 120 and generates a score 118 based on this comparison.
- the generated score 118 is higher for users that submit correct answers quickly and lower for users that submit correct answers slowly.
- the users participating in the quiz game are ranked based on their respective scores, either for a single question or a cumulatively for the entire game.
- the transmission module 128 receives scores and rankings for one or more users from the scoring module 132 and transmits the scores 118 and rankings to the client system 102 for display.
- the server system 120 includes a fact database 130 .
- the fact database 130 receives a request from the data analysis module 124 for a fact associated with a specific keyword.
- the fact database 130 stores a large number of facts associated with specific words.
- the fact database 130 randomly selects a fact from the list of all facts associated with the received keyword.
- the fact database 130 retrieves facts for the same keyword in a specific order, to avoid repeatedly asking similar quiz questions.
