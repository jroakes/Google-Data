Detailed Description
SUMMARY
The present disclosure relates generally to providing more information about entities to the general population. These entities may be, for example, businesses, and in particular, entities associated with geographic locations. The speaker of the entity is identified and selected based on the location history. For example, a speaker may provide information about an entity to the public through a user-to-entity communication channel. The communication between the user and the speaker may be reported for analysis by the entity owner.
The speaker can be identified by analyzing the location history report. For example, a user of the mobile device may authorize the location report. For a particular entity, a user reporting a location corresponding to the particular entity may be identified. For example, the reported location may indicate a predetermined approximate time spent by a particular user at the entity location, daily, weekly, monthly, etc., or a predetermined number of times the user accesses the entity location over a period of time. In this regard, individuals who are not necessarily employees of an entity may be identified, thereby expanding the scope of potential sources of information. Additionally or alternatively, the current location of the potential speaker may be evaluated in terms of a location report from the mobile device. Such information may be useful in determining current conditions at the entity location, such as current network or environmental (e.g., temperature, lighting, etc.) conditions.
The speaker may be verified or unverified. Authenticated speakers may include, for example, users having affinity with an entity, such as users approved by the entity owner as having a particular status or authority. Such authenticated speakers may have higher authority to perform explicit tasks that do not require additional authentication by the entity owner than non-authenticated speakers. For example, a verified speaker can respond to questions regarding product availability. For example, an unverified speaker may include a user who has knowledge of the entity but is less germane than an authenticated speaker. An unverified speaker may be authorized to perform some type of task, but not others. For example, an unverified speaker may be authorized to respond to questions about the time of operation of the entity, but not to the availability of the product. Some or all of the actions of an unverified speaker may require an audit by the entity owner or by the verified speaker, which may be performed separately for each request, or in bulk.
Some requests may be filtered to authenticated speakers while other requests are sent to both authenticated and non-authenticated speakers simultaneously, or only to non-authenticated speakers. For example only, user calls regarding later pickup of a subscribed product may be filtered to one or more authenticated speakers, and requests regarding physical hours of operation may be sent to each. Such filtering may be performed based on, for example, keywords, identifiers embedded in the request (e.g., a determination of where to send the request by a category selected by a user submitting the request), or by any of a variety of other criteria.
The entity of the individual may have a number of speakers, wherein the speakers are verified, unverified, or some combination of the two. In some examples, the request may be sent to all speakers, and only speakers with the appropriate rights may respond. In other examples, the request may be sent to only one or some of the authenticated or non-authenticated speakers, and if no response is received within a predetermined time, the request may be sent to the other speakers. In some examples, the speaker's effort to provide information to the public may be compensated.
The user may communicate with the speaker through any of a variety of communication channels. For example, a dedicated chat channel may be provided by an application (such as a mapping application, shopping application, search application, etc.). The request received over the communication channel may include any of a variety of types of requests, such as a question seeking information about a particular entity or items available at a particular entity, a request to hold a particular item in inventory at a particular entity, a request to reserve a seat if the entity is a restaurant, and so forth.
In some examples, the information provided by the speaker may be provided automatically by the speaker's device. For example, a request received over a communication channel may query for availability of wireless network access at a particular location. In response, the speaker's device currently or previously at the location may report the signal strength of the wireless network available at the particular location. Such an automatic response may be provided with any information for detection by the speaker's device, such as weather, connectivity, noise level, busy level, lighting, etc.
In some examples, the communication channel may be accessed by a search engine. For example, if a user asks a speaker if there is an inventory of a particular product at a particular entity, the search engine may use the answer to provide such information in response to future search requests. The business owner may also access the communication channel of its particular entity, e.g., oversee and correct the information provided about that entity. Entity owners may always have visibility into the activities of the speaker, some of which may result in the posting of static content that may be edited afterwards by the owners. For example, if a speaker provides inventory data by taking a photograph of a product at a store, the data may flow to an inventory management tool that an entity owner may use to both review and edit the data. For other types of speaker contribution, such as question-and-answer contribution, the entity owner may review the answers individually or in batches before or after sending to the requesting user. The entity owner may provide guidance to the speaker on how to respond to the request.
In some examples, a report of the communication between the user and the speaker may also be provided to the entity owner. The entity owner can use this information to better understand the type of offline support to be implemented. For example, if a user frequently inquires about the time of operation of an entity, the entity owner may make this information available on his website. The report may further describe to the entity owner how the speaker activity translates into traffic at the entity, such as online purchases by clients at the physical location of the entity, and the like.
By identifying the entity speaker and setting up the communication channel, the user can easily be able to receive answers to questions without extensive searching. Further, the entity may improve the services provided to the customer by improving information sharing. Even entities without websites can provide current, accurate information to users through speakers.
Example System
FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 including a computing device for performing aspects of the present disclosure. The system 100 includes various client computing devices 160-167, 170-174 communicatively coupled to the server computing device 110 over the network 150. Client computing devices 160-167 can be associated with a particular entity 105. For example, client device 160 may be associated with an owner of entity 105, while devices 161-167 are selected to function as speakers of entity 105, as described in further detail herein. The client devices 170-174 in this example represent users of the general public. Requests such as questions, subscriptions, etc. for entity 105 may be received at client devices 160-167 from client devices 170-174 over network 150. In this regard, one or more of the client devices 160-167 associated with entity 105 may receive requests over network 150 and provide responses to client devices 170-174.
Client computing devices 160-167, 170-174 may include any of a variety of types of devices capable of communicating over a network. By way of example and not limitation, such devices may include smartphones, cameras with wireless network access, notebook computers, smartwatches, tablets, head mounted displays, gaming systems, and the like. Each client computing device may include, for example, a user input device (such as a camera, microphone, joystick, button, touch screen, etc.), and may include, for example, a display such as an LED, LCD, plasma screen, projector, etc.
The server computing device 110 may actually include a plurality of processing devices in communication with each other. Server computing device 110 is described in further detail below in conjunction with fig. 2.
Database 140 may be accessed by server 110 and client computing devices 160-167, 170-174. Database 140 may include, for example, information associated with an entity, such as entity 105. Such information may include, for example, map information, inventory information, images, and the like. In some cases, the image may be stored with metadata that provides information about the image. Such metadata may include, for example, date and time of capture, location, camera settings, tags or identifications corresponding to targets in the image, and so forth.
The network 150 may be, for example, a LAN, WAN, the Internet, etc. The connection between the device and the network may be wired or wireless.
Fig. 2 shows further details of components in the example system 100. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the disclosure or the usefulness of the features described herein. Each of the server computing devices 110 may contain one or more processors 220, memory 230, and other components typically found in general purpose computing devices. The memory 230 of each computing device 110 may store information accessed by the one or more processors 220, including instructions 234 that may be executed by the one or more processors 220.
Memory 230 may also include data 232 that may be retrieved, manipulated, or stored by the processor. The memory may be of any non-transitory type capable of storing information accessible by the processor, such as a hard disk drive, memory card, ROM, RAM, DVD, CD-ROM, writable memory, and read-only memory.
The instructions 234 may be any set of instructions that are executed directly (such as machine code) or indirectly (such as scripts) by one or more processors. In this regard, the terms "instruction," "application," "step," and "program" may be used interchangeably herein. The instructions may be stored in an object code format for direct processing by a processor or in any other computing device language, including scripts or a collection of separate source code modules that are interpreted or pre-compiled as needed. The functions, methods and routines of the instructions will be explained in more detail below.
The data 232 may be retrieved, stored, or modified by the one or more processors 220 according to instructions 234. For example, although the subject matter described herein is not limited by any particular data structure, data may be stored in computer registers, as tables or XML documents with many different fields and records, in relational databases. The data may also be formatted in any computing device readable format, such as, but not limited to, binary values, ASCII, or Unicode. Furthermore, the data may contain any information sufficient to identify the relevant information, such as numbers, descriptive text, proprietary codes, pointers, references to data stored in other memories, such as other network locations, or information used by the function to calculate the relevant data.
The one or more processors 220 may be any conventional processor, such as a commercially available CPU. Alternatively, the processor may be a dedicated component, such as an application specific integrated circuit ("ASIC") or other hardware-based processor. Although not required, one or more of the computing devices 110 may include specialized hardware components to perform specific computing processes, such as image matching, image editing, object recognition, or perform other processes faster or more efficiently.
While fig. 2 functionally shows the processor, memory, and other elements of computing device 110 in the same block, the processor, computer, computing device, or memory may in fact comprise multiple processors, computers, computing devices, or memories, which may or may not be stored in the same physical housing. For example, the memory may be a hard disk drive or other storage medium located in a different housing than computing device 110. Thus, references to a processor, computer, computing device, or memory are to be understood to include references to a collection of processors, computers, computing devices, or memory that may or may not operate in parallel. For example, computing device 110 may include a server computing device operating as a load balancing server farm, distributed system, or the like. However, while some of the functions described below are illustrated as occurring on a single computing device having a single processor, various aspects of the subject matter described herein may be implemented by multiple computing devices, e.g., communicating information over network 150.
Each of the computing devices 110, 160, 170 may be located at a different node of the network 150 and may be capable of directly and indirectly communicating with other nodes of the network 150. Although only a few computing devices are depicted in fig. 2, it should be appreciated that a typical system may include a large number of connected computing devices, each different computing device located at a different node of network 150. The network 150 and intermediate nodes described herein may be interconnected using various protocols and systems such that the network may be part of the internet, world wide web, a particular intranet, a wide area network, or a local area network. The network may utilize standard communication protocols such as ethernet, wiFi and HTTP, protocols proprietary to one or more companies, and various combinations of the foregoing. Although certain advantages are obtained when sending or receiving information as described above, other aspects of the subject matter described herein are not limited to any particular manner of information transmission.
By way of example, each of the computing devices 110 may include a network (web) server capable of communicating with the storage system 140 and the computing devices 160, 170 via the network 150. For example, one or more of the server computing devices 110 may use the network 150 to send and present information to users on a display, such as display 265 of computing device 160. In this regard, the computing devices 160, 170 may be considered client computing devices and may perform all or some of the features described herein.
Each of the client computing devices 160, 170 may be configured similar to the server computing device 110 with one or more processors, memories, and instructions as described above. Each client computing device 160, 170 may be an individual computing device for use by a user and have all components typically used in connection with individual computing devices such as a processor 262, memory (e.g., RAM and internal hard drive) storing data 263 and instructions 264, a display 265, and user input 266. The client computing device may also include a camera 267 for recording video streams and/or capturing images, a speaker, a network interface device, and all components for connecting these elements to one another. The client computing device 160 may also include a location determination system, such as GPS 268. Other examples of the location determination system may determine the location based on wireless access signal strength, images of geographic objects (such as landmarks), semantic indicators (such as light or noise levels).
While the client computing devices 160, 170 may each comprise a full-sized individual computing device, they may alternatively comprise mobile computing devices capable of wirelessly exchanging data with a server over a network such as the internet. By way of example only, the client computing device 160 may be a mobile phone or device such as a wireless-enabled PDA, tablet, netbook, smartwatch, head-mounted computing system, or any other device capable of obtaining information via the internet. For example, a user may input information using a keypad, a microphone, using visual signals of a camera or a touch screen.
As with memory 230, storage system 140 may be any type of computerized storage capable of storing information accessed by server computing device 110, such as a hard drive, memory card, ROM, RAM, DVD, CD-ROM, writable memory, and read-only memory. Additionally, the storage system 140 may comprise a distributed storage system, wherein data is stored on a plurality of different storage devices physically located in the same or different geographic locations. As shown in fig. 1, storage system 140 may be connected to computing devices via network 150 and/or may be directly connected to any of computing devices 110.
The storage system 140 may store data corresponding to particular entities, such images, and other information.
The one or more processors 220 may identify and select one or more client devices from the general population to act as speakers of the entity 105. For example, the one or more processors 220 may automatically identify and select a device based on location information associated with the device. The protection measures will be put in place to ensure that the user privacy is protected. For example, a user may need to explicitly authorize a location report to be considered a candidate that may be a speaker. Further, in some examples, in addition to enabling location reporting, the user may also need to download a particular application or other software and agree to terms of use. The user will be provided with the option to add their device as a speaker service or delete a speaker service at any time, e.g. set the location reporting mode on the device to "off". Additional provisions are made for further protection of privacy and security. For example, additional terms include anonymization of individual identifiable information, aggregation of data, filtering of individual information, encryption, hashing or filtering of individual information to delete individual attributes, time constraints of information storage, or constraints of data usage or sharing. In some embodiments, some or all of the requests may be manually reviewed in addition to, or in lieu of, these automated privacy and security measures.
Upon selection of the device as a speaker service, a request to act as a speaker for a particular entity may be sent by the one or more processors to the device for approval by the user. When the request is accepted, the user may act as an unverified speaker. In some cases, authentication of the user may be requested by the user or one or more processors so that if the user is authenticated, there may be more extensive rights to respond to the request on behalf of the entity. In such examples, the user or one or more processors may send a verification request to the owner of entity 105. The speaker device may need to approve the information included in the authentication request. In some examples, the speaker may be provided with an option to edit, add, or delete any information included in the verification request.
A secure channel may be established between the speaker devices 161-167 and any of the client devices 170-174 requesting information about the particular entity 105. In some examples, data sent over the secure channel may be encrypted in some cases, and access to the secure channel may be restricted to users meeting predetermined criteria. The communication channel may be used to connect one user with one speaker, multiple users with multiple speakers (for entity 105), multiple users with multiple speakers (for multiple entities), or any combination thereof. Additional protection may be implemented to further protect the privacy of all users communicating over the channel, or users otherwise associated with the entity or the public. For example, requests made to the speaker may be automatically or manually filtered to filter requests for individual information or other inappropriate requests. In some cases, a user submitting one or more improper requests may be prevented from further use.
Fig. 3 shows an example of selecting candidate devices to serve as speakers for a particular entity 105. Entity 105 corresponds to a particular geographic location, such as entity 105 maintaining a physical address or geographic coordinates of a storefront, headquarters, warehouse, etc. A plurality of devices 310-321, each device authorizing a location report, each of which may report a location near a particular geographic location corresponding to entity 105. For example, each of the plurality of devices 310-321 may report at least one location within a predetermined distance of a particular geographic location over a given period of time. However, only some of these candidate devices may be selected as speakers. For example, the selection may be based on the frequency of access to a particular geographic location and/or the time spent at a particular geographic location during one or more accesses. For example only, if the entity 105 is a coffee shop, the device 314 may have accessed the coffee shop once for about 20 minutes, while the device 315 may access the coffee shop four days per week for about 3 hours. In this example, device 315 is more likely to be selected as a speaker because the user of device 315 is more likely to possess information about the coffee shop than the user of device 314. Other criteria for selecting a speaker may include, for example, a change in access time, a change in device type, or a change in various other types of information. Some other mechanisms of selecting a speaker may include identifying the following users: leaving a comment on the entity, uploading a photograph related to the entity, posting information about the entity on the web, making a positive contribution to the entity or a particular type of entity in a geographic area, etc. In the example shown, devices 310, 315, and 317 are selected to act as speakers for entity 105.
Fig. 4 shows examples of communications between one or more processors 110 and a selected speaker device 310, and between one or more processors 110 and a device 160 belonging to an owner of a particular entity. The one or more processors 110 send a first request 402 to the selected user device 310, e.g., asking whether the user of the device 310 would like to become a speaker of enterprise a. According to some examples, device 310 may include an interface that relays first request 402 to a user, such as by presenting the first request as text on display 415. It should be understood that the interface shown in fig. 4 is merely an example, and that any of a variety of types of interfaces are possible.
The user of the device 310 may send a first response 404 back to the one or more processors 110, e.g., through an interface. For example, the interface may include one or more response buttons 421, 422 for effectively responding to the first request. In other examples, the response may be entered through other mechanisms, such as by typing, voice commands, and the like. In this example, the option for the user to view more information about the speaker acting as enterprise A is presented as information button 423. Such additional information may include, for example, an explanation of why device 310 was selected, a description of what was required to function as a speaker, information about enterprise a, or any other information.
If the user of device 310 agrees to act as a speaker, in some examples, a second request 406 may be sent from one or more processors 110 to device 160 belonging to the owner of enterprise A. The second request 406 may ask the entity owner whether to authenticate the user device 310 as a speaker. The second request may include, for example, additional information, such as information related to the device 310, a reason for selecting the device 310, an operator of the device 310, or any other information. The entity owner may access this information by, for example, selecting interface button 443. Other options for responding through the interface may include, for example, response buttons 441, 442. Similar to the interface presented on device 310, it should be understood that many variations of the interface and responsive inputs are possible.
The entity owner may send a second response 408 indicating whether the device 310 is authenticated. If device 310 is not authenticated, device 310 may still be authorized to assume the speaker of enterprise A. However, if device 310 is not authenticated, the request type of device 310 may be limited, while authenticated devices may more widely access requests from users of the general population. The authenticated device may additionally or alternatively have broader rights to respond to requests without supervision by the entity owner or another entity.
Once the user of the selected client device agrees to act as a speaker, the selected client device may provide information about a particular entity to an information site (such as a search engine results page associated with the particular entity) or directly to user devices in the general population. In either case, the entity owner may oversee the communication sent on behalf of the particular entity and, in some cases, edit the communication before it is sent. Further, the entity owner may receive a report of the request and the provided response received over the communication channel. The report may direct the entity owner to add what type of information to his website or other marketing material.
Fig. 5 illustrates an example of a speaker device submitting information to an entity such as an information site. For example, search engine results list 505 includes a map portion 510 and an information portion 520. For example, list 505 may be displayed on a client device in response to a request for information related to enterprise A. The information request may include, for example, an address, an entity name, a general geographic area, an entity type, and the like.
Map portion 510 may include a description of geographic objects at a particular geographic location. For example, geographic objects may include roads, buildings, landmarks, statues, street signs, and the like. The target may be depicted, for example, in a road map, an aerial image, a street level image, or the like. Map portion 510 may also depict a marker 512, such as enterprise a, corresponding to the requested location. The marker 512 identifies the location of the requested location relative to other objects depicted in the map portion. The indicia 512 may be depicted in any of a variety of shapes and forms. In addition, tag 514 may identify a tag 512 corresponding to enterprise A.
The information section 520 provides further information concerning enterprise a. Such information may include user input controls 522, 524, 526, enabling the user to take predetermined actions. The predetermined action may be, for example, calling the phone number of enterprise a, requesting navigation information from enterprise a, or submitting a request to enterprise a. Examples of such requests may be questions related to business hours, questions related to price or availability of a product or service, requests for a predetermined product or service, or any other type of request. Such a request may be sent to one or more of the speaker devices 310, 315, 317, and the speaker devices 310, 315, 317 may provide a response. The response may be provided directly to the requestor, displayed elsewhere in the information section 520 or the list 505, or both.
The information section 520 may also include text 528, such as a list of business hours for enterprise A. In the example of fig. 5, text information 528 is incomplete because business hours are not listed. Accordingly, the speaker devices 310, 315, 317 may provide a response that includes the missing information. The speaker devices 310, 315, 317 may be verified or unverified.
According to some examples, information provided by the speaker device may be automatically detected by the speaker device. For example, information about business hours of an entity may be determined based on when the speaker device is present at the location and disappeared from the location.
The entity owner of enterprise a may review the submitted response before the response is used to generate updated list 555. For example, the responses may be sent individually or in batches to the user devices 160 belonging to the entity owner. The owner may review the submitted response and approve, reject, edit, or otherwise manipulate the information. For example, as shown in fig. 5, the owner may approve the response from the devices 310, 317, but reject the response from the device 315. This may be because the response from device 315 is incorrect, incomplete, or otherwise inaccurate. However, the response from the devices 310, 317 may be completely or partially accurate and thus approved. For example only, device 310 may submit Monday to Saturday hours of business A, while device 317 submits Sunday hours of business A. Such information is shown in text 558 of updated list 555. However, it should be understood that submitted information may be shown anywhere in list 555 or in any form (e.g., text, graphics, charts, ratings, etc.) in any type of information site or application. While in the above example the submitted information is approved before updating the information site, in other examples the submitted information may be approved later and the updated site may be updated again if desired.
In other examples, only verified devices may be permitted to submit information to update the information site, or may automatically reject non-verified submissions. In contrast to an unverified device, permissions for a verified device may depend on the type of information submitted, the destination of the submitted information, or any other parameter. For example, an authenticated device may be permitted to submit information such as business hours, while an unauthenticated device may be permitted to submit information such as current latency at an entity. Although fig. 5 shows information provided to the search result list, in other examples, the information may be provided to other applications, such as a scheduling application, a ride service application, a game, or any of a variety of other applications.
Fig. 6 shows other examples in which a request is received from a user device in the general public and a response is provided directly to the user device by one or more speaker devices. In this example, user device 172 submits a request 602 to entity 105, such as "do you sell lottery? ". The request may be received by one or more selected speaker devices, categories of speaker devices (e.g., verified or unverified), or all speaker devices 161-167. For example, the request 602 may be parsed automatically at the server to determine which speaker devices should receive the request. The determination may include, for example, identifying a particular keyword or key phrase in the request, and identifying a particular speaker device designated to receive the request (including the identified keyword or key phrase). As another example, the speaker may be selected to receive the request based on other information, such as the current location of the speaker device. For example, if the request seeks the current latency of the entity, the speaker device currently at the entity may be selected to receive the request. In some examples, the request may be received simultaneously by all speakers 161-167 of a particular entity. In other examples, the request may be sent to a selected subset of speakers of a particular entity. For example, a round-robin algorithm may be used to rotate the speaker receipt requests to keep balance, or speakers with faster response may be prioritized.
Any of the speaker devices 161-167 can send a response 604 on behalf of the entity. For example, response 604 may be "yes, we sell lottery," or response 604 may specify which lottery games the entity 105 sells lottery. According to some examples, once the first speaker device sends a response 604, the remaining speaker devices may be notified that the request 602 has been answered. For example only, the interface on the speaker device prompting the response may disappear. According to some examples, if response 604 is provided by unverified speakers 164-167, the response may be reviewed and approved by verified speakers 161-163 prior to transmission to client device 172. The verified speaker can be approved by the entity owner. An unverified speaker may choose itself based on the speaker's own actions.
According to some examples, information supplied by the speaker device may be automatically detected by the speaker device. For example, detection of available products may be performed based on detection of RFID identification, or whether a restaurant provides lunch or dinner may be determined based on a detected restaurant lighting level. In other examples, the automatically detected information may include information about current network or environmental conditions. In some examples, the speaker device may automatically, optionally provide for responding to queries involving such information without speaker participation.
Although only one entity 105 is shown in the example of fig. 6, in other examples, user device 172 may send requests to multiple entities at a given time. For example, the request 602 may be sent to a speaker of a plurality of different entities within a predetermined geographic area or distance from the client device 172. In this regard, the client device 172 may receive a plurality of responses, which the user of the client device 172 may compare. For example, a response sent on behalf of the speaker to each entity may be presented on the client device 172 along with information associated with the entity (such as entity name, address, phone number, etc.).
The entity owner of each entity may receive reports relating to information sent over the communication channel. For example, the report may identify each request received, specify what the request was, the date and time of the request, the frequency of repeated requests, or too many other information. For example, such other information may include a response time for each speaker, an identification of the highest ranked contributor, information identifying particularly valid unverified speakers, and so forth. However, to maintain privacy, information related to the client device receiving the request or the user of such client device will be omitted or anonymous from the report. The information in the report may provide an opportunity for the entity owner to understand the type of information that the client is seeking and adapt the entity or the entity's advertisement to such a request.
Example method
In addition to the operations described above and shown in the drawings, various operations will now be described. It should be understood that the following operations need not be performed in the exact order described below. Rather, the various steps may be processed in a different order or simultaneously, and steps may also be added or omitted.
Fig. 7 illustrates an example method 700 of establishing a communication channel between at least one user and at least one entity using a speaker. The method may be performed by, for example, a remote server or other computing device. The method may or may not be initiated by a request from the user for information about the entity.
In block 710, location information is received from a plurality of mobile computing devices authorizing location reporting. For example, mobile device settings may be set to provide their location and thus considered potential candidates to serve as speakers. The user can change the settings at any time. In other examples, the user may download an application to the mobile device to act as an entity speaker. The application may require the user to agree (such as through a terms of service agreement) to authorize the location report.
In block 720, an individual is identified, wherein the individual corresponds to a particular entity. An individual may be identified based on the received location information. For example, if a mobile device accesses a particular entity one or more times within a predetermined period of time, the mobile device may be identified as a potential candidate to act as a speaker. Alternatively or additionally, potential candidates that may act as speakers may also be identified based on current location information. These individuals need not be existing employees nor have other preexisting relationships with the entity to be identified as candidate speakers.
In block 730, one or more identified individuals are selected to act as speakers for the particular entity. For example, an individual may be selected based on any of a variety of criteria, such as the time spent at an entity, the number or frequency of accesses to the entity, and so forth. The selected individuals may receive a request to act as a speaker who may accept the request through the mobile device. Some speakers may be authenticated by the entity owner. Such a verified speaker can perform a wider range of activities on behalf of the entity.
In block 740, a communication channel is established between the selected speaker and a plurality of users, such as users in the general public. The user and the speaker may exchange information about the entity over a communication channel. For example, a user may request information about an entity, such as a price or availability of a product or service, or request to subscribe to a product or service. The user may also request technical information, such as current environmental or network conditions, identified by the mobile communication device associated with the speaker. For example, a user may wish to know whether an entity provides Wi-Fi connectivity, or may wish to know the temperature in the vicinity of the entity. The speaker may provide a response on behalf of the entity, thereby reducing the burden on the entity owner and reducing possible response time delays. The response may be provided by an action of the individual acting as the speaker or automatically by a mobile communication device associated with the speaker. Any number of speakers may be selected for a particular entity, and the number of speakers may be determined by the entity owner. As the number of selected speakers increases, and the number of speakers who are likely to see the request and thus be able to respond quickly increases, the response time per request may decrease. The communication channel may be a secure channel in which access to the channel is restricted to authorized or registered users.
The above examples are advantageous at least in that they provide a mechanism for users to quickly receive and compare types of information that may not be available on a typical web site. Furthermore, the techniques described herein provide for communication with entities without websites. Using these techniques, information about entities may be updated frequently, providing an improved user experience.
The above alternative examples are not mutually exclusive, unless otherwise stated, but may be implemented in various combinations to achieve unique advantages. Since these and other variations and combinations of the above-described features can be utilized without departing from the subject matter defined by the claims, the description of the above embodiments should be taken by way of illustration rather than by way of limitation. Moreover, the provision of examples described herein and terms of words such as "such as," "including," etc. should not be construed as limiting the claimed subject matter to a particular example; rather, the examples are intended to illustrate only one of many possible embodiments. Furthermore, the same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.
