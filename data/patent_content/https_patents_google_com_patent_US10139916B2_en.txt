Definitions
- Small-screen computing devices continue to proliferate, such as smartphones and computing bracelets, rings, and watches. Like many computing devices, these small-screen devices often use virtual keyboards to interact with users. On these small screens, however, many people find interacting through virtual keyboards to be difficult, as they often result in slow and inaccurate inputs. This frustrates users and limits the applicability of small-screen computing devices. This problem has been addressed in part through screen-based gesture recognition techniques. These screen-based gestures, however, still struggle from substantial usability issues due to the size of these screens.
- optical finger- and hand-tracking techniques have been developed, which enable gesture tracking not made on the screen. These optical techniques, however, have been large, costly, or inaccurate thereby limiting their usefulness in addressing usability issues with small-screen computing devices.
- This document describes techniques and devices for wide-field radar-based gesture recognition. These techniques and devices can accurately recognize gestures that are made in three dimensions, such as non-screen or “in-the-air” gestures. These in-the-air gestures can be made from varying distances, such as from a person sitting on a couch to control a television, a person standing in a kitchen to control an oven or refrigerator, or centimeters from a computing watch's small-screen display.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example environment in which wide-field radar-based gesture recognition can be implemented.
- FIG. 2 illustrates the wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system and computing device of FIG. 1 in detail.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example method for determining signal elements for a gesture.
- FIG. 4 illustrates gestures made and signal elements determined based on those gestures.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example method enabling wide-field radar-based gesture recognition using the signal elements determined at FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 6 illustrates example type-specific and type-independent gesture managers, including example type-specific hardware abstraction modules.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an example of gestures made and signal elements determined using type-specific hardware abstraction modules.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an example computing system embodying, or in which techniques may be implemented that enable use of, wide-field radar-based gesture recognition.
- This document describes techniques and devices enabling wide-field radar-based gesture recognition. These techniques and devices enable a great breadth of gestures and uses for those gestures, such as gestures to use, control, and interact with various devices, from smartphones to refrigerators.
- the techniques and devices are capable of providing a wide radar field that can sense gestures using relatively small radar systems, even those that can be included within small devices. Furthermore, these techniques need not track and reconstruct points of a human action to determine gestures, which has various advantages described below.
- FIG. 1 is an illustration of example environment 100 in which techniques using, and an apparatus including, a wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 may be embodied.
- Environment 100 includes two example devices and techniques for using wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 , in the first, wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 - 1 provides a radar field of intermediate size to interact with one of computing devices 104 , desktop computer 104 - 1 , and in the second, wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 - 2 provides a radar field of small size to interact with computing watch 104 - 2 .
- Desktop computer 104 - 1 includes, or is associated with, wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 - 1 . These devices work together to improve user interaction with desktop computer 104 - 1 . Assume, for example, that desktop computer 104 - 1 includes a touch screen 108 through which display and user interaction can be performed. This touch screen 108 can present some challenges to users, such as needing a person to sit in a particular orientation, such as upright and forward, to be able to touch the screen. Further, the size for selecting controls through touch screen 108 can make interaction difficult and time-consuming for some users.
- wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 - 1 which provides radar field 106 - 1 enabling a user's hands to interact with desktop computer 104 - 1 , such as with small or large, simple or complex gestures, including those with one or two hands, and in three dimensions.
- desktop computer 104 - 1 such as with small or large, simple or complex gestures, including those with one or two hands, and in three dimensions.
- a large volume through which a user may make selections can be substantially easier and provide a better experience over a flat surface, such as that of touch screen 108 .
- wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 - 2 which provides radar field 106 - 2 , which enables a user to interact with computing watch 104 - 2 from a near distance, enabling finger, hand, and arm gestures.
- user selections can be made simpler and easier than a small screen of a small computing device, such as that of computing watch 104 - 2 .
- Wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition systems 102 can interact with applications or an operating system of computing devices 104 , or remotely through a communication network by transmitting input responsive to recognizing gestures. Gestures can be mapped to various applications and devices, thereby enabling control of many devices and applications. Many complex and unique gestures can be recognized by wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition systems 102 , thereby permitting precise and/or single-gesture control, even for multiple applications. Wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition systems 102 , whether integrated with a computing device, having computing capabilities, or having few computing abilities, can each be used to interact with various devices and applications.
- FIG. 2 which illustrates wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 as part of one of computing device 104 .
- Computing device 104 is illustrated with various non-limiting example devices, the noted desktop computer 104 - 1 , computing watch 104 - 2 , as well as smartphone 104 - 3 , tablet 104 - 4 , computing ring 104 - 5 , computing spectacles 104 - 6 , and microwave 104 - 7 , though other devices may also be used, such as home automation and control systems, entertainment systems, audio systems, other home appliances, security systems, netbooks, and e-readers.
- computing device 104 can be wearable, non-wearable but mobile, or relatively immobile (e.g., desktops and appliances).
- wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 can be used with, or embedded within, many different computing devices or peripherals, such as in walls of a home to control home appliances and systems (e.g., automation control panel), in automobiles to control internal functions (e.g., volume, cruise control, or even driving of the car), or as an attachment to a laptop computer to control computing applications on the laptop.
- radar fields 106 can be invisible and penetrate some materials, such as textiles, thereby further expanding how the wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 can be used and embodied. While examples shown herein generally show one wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 per device, multiples can be used, thereby increasing a number and complexity of gestures, as well as accuracy and robust recognition.
- Computing device 104 includes one or more computer processors 202 and computer-readable media 204 , which includes memory media and storage media. Applications and/or an operating system (not shown) embodied as computer-readable instructions on computer-readable media 204 can be executed by processors 202 to provide some of the functionalities described herein. Computer-readable media 204 also includes gesture manager 206 (described below).
- Computing device 104 may also include network interfaces 208 for communicating data over wired, wireless, or optical networks and display 210 .
- network interface 208 may communicate data over a local-area-network (LAN), a wireless local-area-network (WLAN), a personal-area-network (PAN), a wide-area-network (WAN), an intranet, the Internet, a peer-to-peer network, point-to-point network, a mesh network, and the like.
- LAN local-area-network
- WLAN wireless local-area-network
- PAN personal-area-network
- WAN wide-area-network
- intranet the Internet
- peer-to-peer network point-to-point network
- mesh network and the like.
- Wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 is configured to sense gestures. To enable this, wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 includes a radar-emitting element 212 and an antenna element 214 .
- radar-emitting element 212 is configured to provide wide-field radar in contrast to narrow-beam-scanning radar fields.
- a large contiguous field is used, rather than a beam-scanning field.
- the reflections in that field can then be received by one or multiple antennas.
- This reflection signal includes many signals and signal elements, and therefore may be referred to as a reflection signal or a set of reflection signals, but in both cases multiple signal elements are included.
- a large radar field and large-field reflections are received at one receiver but the signal received is processed by digitally breaking up the received reflections. The broken-up signals are then analyzed separately. This can be referred to as beam stealing though no beams are actually formed in the large radar field.
- Other digital processing may be used, such as phase arrays in which fields of different phases are admitted, each for analysis of the reflection signals.
- multiple fields are used but from different directions or having other differences, such as different frequencies or phases, and which can be received by one or multiple dedicated receivers (e.g., antenna elements 214 ).
- these fields include numerous kinds of radar fields, such as those from continuous wave and pulsed radar systems, and may exclude phased antenna arrays.
- Pulsed radar systems are often of shorter transmit time and higher peak power, and include both impulse and chirped radar systems. Pulsed radar systems have a range based on time of flight and a velocity based on frequency shift. Chirped radar systems have a range based on time of flight (pulse compressed) and a velocity based on frequency shift.
- Continuous wave radar systems are often of relatively longer transmit time and lower peak power. These continuous wave radar systems include single tone, linear frequency modulated (FM), and stepped FM types. Single tone radar systems have a very limited range based on the phase and a velocity based on frequency shift. Linear FM radar systems have a range based on frequency shift at a velocity also based on frequency shift. Stepped FM radar systems have a range based on phase or time of flight and a velocity based on frequency shift. While these five types of radar systems are noted herein, others may also be used, such as sinusoidal modulation scheme radar systems.
- FM linear frequency modulated
- Radar fields provided by these types of radar systems vary from a small size, such as zero or one or so millimeters to 1.5 meters, or an intermediate size, such as about one to about 30 meters.
- antenna element 214 is configured to receive and process reflections of the radar field to provide large-body gestures based on reflections from human tissue caused by body, arm, or leg movements, though smaller and more-precise gestures can be sensed as well.
- Example intermediate-sized radar fields include those in which a user makes gestures to control a television from a couch, change a song or volume from a stereo across a room, turn off an oven or oven timer (a near field would also be useful), turn lights on or off in a room, and so forth.
- Radar-emitting element 212 can instead be configured to provide a wide radar field from little if any distance from a computing device or its display, including radar fields that are a full contiguous field in contrast to beam-scanning radar field. Examples are illustrated in FIG. 1 with radar fields 106 .
- Radar-emitting element 212 can be configured to provide the wide-field radars of the various types set forth above.
- Antenna element 214 is configured to receive reflections of, or sense interactions in, the radar field. In some cases, reflections include those from human tissue that is within the radar field, such as a hand or arm movement.
- Antenna element 214 can include one or many antennas or sensors, such as an array of radiation sensors, the number in the array based on a desired resolution and whether the field is a surface or volume.
- the field provided by radar-emitting element 212 can be a three-dimensional ( 3 D) volume (e.g., hemisphere, cube, volumetric fan, cone, or cylinder) to sense in-the-air gestures, though a surface field (e.g., projecting on a surface of a person) can instead be used.
- Antenna element 214 is configured, in some cases, to receive reflections from interactions in the radar field of two or more targets (e.g., fingers, arms, or persons) and provide a composite signal.
- Example radar fields 106 are illustrated in FIG. 1 in which a user may perform complex or simple gestures with his or her arm, body, finger, fingers, hand, or hands (or a device like a stylus) that interrupts the radar field.
- Example gestures include the many gestures usable with current touch-sensitive displays, such as swipes, two-finger pinch, spread, rotate, tap, and so forth.
- Other gestures are enabled that are complex, or simple but three-dimensional, examples include the many sign-language gestures, e.g., those of American Sign Language (ASL) and other sign languages worldwide.
- ASL American Sign Language
- a few examples of these are: an up-and-down fist, which in ASL means “Yes”; an open index and middle finger moving to connect to an open thumb, which means “No”; a flat hand moving up a step, which means “Advance”; a flat and angled hand moving up and down; which means “Afternoon”; clenched fingers and open thumb moving to open fingers and an open thumb, which means “taxicab”; an index finger moving up in a roughly vertical direction, which means “up”; and so forth.
- gestures that can be sensed as well as be mapped to particular devices or applications, such as the advance gesture to skip to another song on a web-based radio application, a next song on a compact disk playing on a stereo, or a next page or image in a file or album on a computer display or digital picture frame.
- wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 also includes a transmitting device configured to transmit a reflection signal to a remote device, though this need not be used when wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 is integrated with computing device 104 .
- the reflection signal can be provided in a format usable by a remote computing device sufficient for the remote computing device to determine the gesture in those cases where the gesture is not determined by wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 or computing device 104 .
- radar-emitting element 212 can be configured to emit microwave radiation in a 1 GHz to 300 GHz range, a 3 GHz to 100 GHz range, and narrower bands, such as 57 GHz to 63 GHz, to provide the radar field. This range affects antenna element 214 's ability to receive interactions, such as to follow locations of two or more targets to a resolution of about two to about 25 millimeters. Radar-emitting element 212 can be configured, along with other entities of wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 , to have a relatively fast update rate, which can aid in resolution of the interactions.
- wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 can operate to substantially penetrate clothing while not substantially penetrating human tissue. Thus, a person wearing gloves or a long sleeve shirt that could interfere with sensing gestures with some conventional techniques, can still be sensed with wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 .
- Wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 may also include one or more system processors 218 and system media 220 (e.g., one or more computer-readable storage media).
- System media 220 includes system manager 222 and hardware abstraction module 224 .
- System manager 222 can perform various operations, including determining a gesture based on the reflection signal, mapping the determined gesture to a pre-configured control gesture associated with a control input for an application associated with touch screen 108 , and causing transceiver 216 to transmit the control input to the remote device effective to enable control of the application (if remote). This is but one of the ways in which the above-mentioned control through wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 can be enabled. Operations of system manager 222 are provided in greater detail as part of methods 300 and 500 below. Hardware abstraction module 224 is part of an alternative embodiment described in FIGS. 6 and 7 below.
- FIGS. 1 and 2 act and interact, are set forth in greater detail below. These entities may be further divided, combined, and so on.
- the environment 100 of FIG. 1 and the detailed illustrations of FIG. 2 illustrate some of many possible environments and devices capable of employing the described techniques.
- FIGS. 3 and 5 depict methods enabling wide-field radar-based gesture recognition.
- Method 300 determines signal elements that can be used to enable determination of a gesture from a later-received reflection signal having the signal elements.
- Method 500 determines a gesture from reflection signals based on signal elements associated with the gesture.
- method 300 builds, through many iterations, a database of signal elements associated with particular gestures. In effect, method 300 learns from reflected signals that a particular gesture is being performed. Method 300 may do so for each of the various different types of radar systems, though in an alternative embodiment set forth following methods 300 and 500 , hardware abstraction layers for each of those radar systems can be developed to permit a hardware-independent gesture manager.
- system manager 222 may cause radar-emitting element 212 of wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 to provide (e.g., project or emit) one of the described radar fields noted above.
- a first set of reflection signals caused by a first interaction of a first human action performing a gesture within the radar field is received.
- This set of reflection signals represents a first time period during which the first human action interacts with the radar field.
- the reflection signals include signal elements other than those caused by the gesture being performed. This can intentionally be part of the learning process by providing, in some cases, one object and motion that is relatively consistent, with other objects and motions that are inconsistent. This may aid in the learning process described below.
- a second set of reflection signals caused by a second interaction of a second human action performing the gesture within the radar field is received.
- This second set of reflection signals represents a second time period during which the first or second human action interacts with a radar field.
- method 300 receives a second set of reflection signals, though as shown in the dashed arrow in FIG. 3 , the techniques may perform operations with many different persons, iterations of the same gesture, and so forth to better understand the signal elements associated with gestures being made.
- the first and second sets of reflection signals are analyzed to determine a signal element common to both sets of the reflection signals.
- analyzing the multiple reflection signals determines the signal element common to both of the reflection signals. This can be performed by breaking the reflection signals into many signal elements and determining which of the signal elements correspond to both the first interaction and the second interaction for the same gesture. This is somewhat simplified, as iterations of many gestures being performed may be needed to accurately determine the signal elements that correspond to the gesture, such as 50, 100, or even hundreds of iterations.
- this analysis is not based on tracking points or elements of a human action, such as determining particular points and orientation of those points, reconstructing the action, then determining how the body part moves or changes in order to determine the gesture being performed.
- the signal element is associated with the gesture effective to enable a later received reflection signal caused by another interaction by a different (or same) human action to be associated with the gesture.
- these determined signal elements are stored in association with the gesture performed.
- FIG. 4 shows three different gestures being performed, one at a time with multiple iterations, to determine the signal elements associated with the gesture.
- the gestures illustrated include a hand wave gesture 402 , a first shake gesture 404 (an American Sign Language (ASL) gesture for “Yes”), and a pinch finger gesture 406 .
- ASL American Sign Language
- hand wave gesture 402 is performed multiple times, with multiple reflection signals 408 being received by antenna element 214 .
- Antenna element 214 passes the reflection signals to gesture manager 206 , which performs the analysis described for operation 308 .
- first shake gesture 404 is performed multiple times, with multiple reflection signals 410 being received by antenna element 214 .
- Antenna element 214 then passes the reflection signals to gesture manager 206 , which determines signal elements for first shake gesture 404 .
- pinch finger gesture 406 is performed multiple times within the radar field, at which point reflection signals are received by antenna element 214 , which passes these to gesture manager 206 .
- Gesture manager 206 determines signal elements for the pinch finger gesture 406 .
- Each of these recorded signal elements can later be used to determine gestures performed in real-life rather than as part of determining gestures themselves, though a feedback loop enabling continued improvement of the signal elements is also contemplated based on accuracies or inaccuracies of gesture recognition performed by users in their normal course of life.
- signal elements determined for the gesture can be refined based on other signal elements associated with other gestures.
- signal elements determined for the gesture can be refined based on other signal elements associated with other gestures.
- method 300 is performed for each of the three gestures shown in FIG. 4 , resulting in three different determined signal elements.
- These different signal elements can be used to refine each other.
- one set of signal elements are determined for first shake gesture 404 and a second set of signal elements are determined for pinch finger gesture 406 .
- the first set and the second set can be analyzed and compared, and, based on this, the weight of various signal elements can be decreased or increased.
- the signal elements may be reduced in weight or removed. If dissimilar, increased. If unique, also increased.
- the signal elements determined for the third gesture—hand wave gesture 402 can also be used to refine either or both the signal elements for the other gestures.
- Method 500 determines a gesture from reflection signals based on signal elements associated with the gesture. Thus, the single elements determined at method 300 are used to determine gestures at method 500 .
- a radar field is provided, such as the wide radar fields noted above.
- wide-field radar-based gesture recognition system 102 includes radar emitting element 212 , antenna elements 214 , and system manager 222 .
- Radar emitting element 212 provides a wide radar field.
- a reflection signal is received.
- antenna element 214 receives a reflection signal based on some interaction with the provided radar field. This reflection signal is passed to system manager 222 for analysis.
- signal elements from within the reflection signal are determined. This can be performed in the numerous different manners described above and below. Both type-independent and type-specific gesture managers can be used.
- signal elements of the received reflection signal are compared with known signal elements for known gestures.
- These known signal elements are those provided by the process performed at method 300 noted above.
- a wave gesture 402 is illustrated.
- the user performs the gesture within the radar field, which is within some number of centimeters or even a meter or two of the radar field provided by the radar system of the computing watch, and which causes a reflection signal to be received by the antenna element.
- This reflection signal is analyzed by system manager 222 , which includes access to the signal elements known to be associated with various gestures. System manager 222 compares these and determines that the signal elements of the reflected signal and known signal elements correspond.
- the gesture made is determined based on the correspondence between the signal elements and the known signal elements for the corresponding gesture.
- system manager 222 determines that the user has performed a wave gesture.
- the gesture is passed to an application or operating system.
- This application or operating system can be the active operating system for the entity to which it is passed, can be based on manners known in the art for passive gestures. Concluding the ongoing example, the application or operating system receives the wave gesture and responds accordingly.
- gesture manager 206 may determine for which application or device the gesture is intended. Doing so may be based on identity-specific gestures, a current device to which the user is currently interacting, and/or based on controls through which a user may interaction with an application. Controls can be determined through inspection of the interface (e.g., visual controls), published APIs, and the like.
- feedback is provided.
- This feedback can be responsive to the gesture recognition failing or succeeding. Assume that the user performs the wave gesture in this example and that it was not recognized as a wave gesture. Assume also that the user indicates this or otherwise it is determined that the gesture was not properly recognize, such as the user continuing to perform the gesture until a wave gesture is recognized.
- System manager 222 passes this failure to gesture manager 206 or an entity associated therewith, so that set of known signal elements can be altered or improved for recognizing wave gestures.
- successful gesture recognition can be provided to improve recognition by gesture manager 206 .
- method 300 or 500 operates on a device remote from the device being controlled.
- the remote device includes entities of computing device 104 of FIGS. 1 and 2 , and passes the gesture through one or more communication manners, such as wirelessly through transceivers and/or network interfaces (e.g., network interface 208 and transceiver 216 ).
- This remote device does not require all the elements of computing device 104 —wide-field radar-based gesture-recognition system 102 may pass reflection signals sufficient for another device having gesture manager 206 to determine and use the gesture.
- Operations of methods 300 and 500 can be repeated, such as by determining for multiple other applications and other controls through which the multiple other applications can be controlled.
- Methods 500 may then indicate various different controls to control various applications associated with either the application or the actor.
- the techniques determine or assign unique and/or complex and three-dimensional controls to the different applications, thereby allowing a user to control numerous applications without having to select to switch control between them.
- an actor may assign a particular gesture to control one software application on computing device 104 , another particular gesture to control another software application, and still another for a thermostat or stereo. This gesture can be used by multiple different persons, or may be associated with that particular actor once the identity of the actor is determined.
- gesture manager 206 can determine the signal elements for each gesture based on the radar system being used. Thus, if there are substantial differences between radar fields between those performed for method 300 and later radar fields provided by other radar systems or similar radar systems that have substantial differences in the reflected signals, the accuracy of a gesture recognition may suffer. This can be countered, however, by tailoring each set of signal elements for each gesture to the radar system being used.
- a hardware abstraction layer is built for each of the different radar systems obviating, to a large extent, the need to have different gesture managers or different signal elements for each gesture, though these hardware abstraction layers are each trained in a manner similar to methods 300 .
- FIG. 6 shows a specific type of radar-based gesture recognition system 602 and a type-specific gesture manager 604 .
