Description
The present application is a divisional application of the invention patent application of which the application date is 2016, 12 and 09, the application number is 201680088365.1, and the invention name is "use of an image as a search query is promoted".
Technical Field
The present description relates to simplifying the use of search engines.
Background
Typically, a user is able to request information by entering a query into a search engine. The search engine is capable of processing the query and of providing information for output to a user in response to the query. Some users are limited in their ability to interact with a computer, including their ability to input search queries into a computer.
Disclosure of Invention
According to some innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification, a computing device allows for a simplified user interface to a search facility. In particular, the computing device allows the user to be able to provide query images and user click locations as search queries, such as photographs from surrounding users with selected regions of interest. In response to the system receiving the query image and the user click location, the system applies a visual recognition technique to the received query image to identify one or more entities in the received query image. The visual recognition result is improved by using the user click position. For example, visual recognition results may be used to enhance input to the backend recognizer and may be used to rank the obtained recognition results. The system provides information about one or more of the identified entities in response to receiving the query image and the user click location.
By allowing the search query to take the form of an image and a user click location, the user interface can allow text entry that types the search query without using a keyboard or another text entry mechanism such as voice recognition. This can allow the interface to be used by the following categories of users: users (including young children) who cannot otherwise easily use search engines, users with limited fine motor control, users without voice capability, and the like. It can also allow the interface to be used by users in situations where text-based input may be difficult or impossible, such as in cold environments where the user wearing gloves on their hands prevents them from using a text-entry device, such as a virtual or small-sized keyboard, on their mobile device.

Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs, recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods. A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of installing software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof on the system that in operation causes the system to perform the actions. The one or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or acts by virtue of including instructions that when executed by the data processing apparatus cause the apparatus to perform the acts.

The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular embodiments to realize one or more of the following advantages.
Image recognition systems and processes can be computationally expensive because effectively recognizing objects or text in an image can involve searching through a large database of descriptors, or processing the image using a deep neural network (e.g., a convolutional neural network). Furthermore, image recognition systems often have limited resources.
As described in this specification, a system that implements visual recognition using a user click location allows a visual recognition engine to effectively apply visual recognition resources (such as a neural network or other image classification component) to areas of an image of interest to a user. The system has indicated to the user that areas of the image that are important or interesting are allocated and apply more processing power while other areas of the image are allocated and apply less processing power. The system may thus enable higher quality recognition in areas of the image that the user has indicated as important or interesting. Furthermore, the computational resources and time required by the visual recognition system may be reduced because the system is not required to apply high processing to the complete image. Furthermore, the system may achieve a higher level of accuracy when answering a user query because the system is able to filter out irrelevant objects from the query image and analyze objects relevant to the user query.
The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

Detailed Description
The present specification describes systems for providing information (e.g., suggested search queries) based on image-based queries. When performing a visual search, a user of the user device may open a camera viewfinder or photo from a gallery on the device to select an input query image. The user may click on the region of interest in the input image. The location of the user click may be communicated to the system with the input query image as part of an image search request.
The system is capable of receiving an input query image and a user click location and processing the received input query image based on the received user click location to generate a processed query image. The system may identify one or more entities associated with the processed query image and provide information biased toward one or more entities in close proximity to the user's click location.
FIG. 1 depicts an example query image 100, an example user click location 106, and an example search results page 110 for the example query image 100 and the example user click location 106. For example, the example search results page 110 may be provided by the system in response to receiving and processing the example query image 100 and the user click location 106.
The example query image 100 depicted in fig. 1 is a representative photo query image. For example, the example query image 100 may represent a photograph taken by the user 104 using the user device 102. In other examples, the example query image 100 may represent a photograph received or otherwise accessed by the user 104 at the user device 102. In some implementations, the example query image 100 may represent another type of image received, obtained, or accessed by the user 104 at the user device 102. For example, the image may represent a thumbnail or other image found on a website accessed by the user device 102, or an image obtained from an application running on the user device 102.
The example query image 100 may include one or more image features. The one or more image features include image features or entities that may be identified by the image recognition system. For example, in the example query image 100 depicted in fig. 1, the one or more image features include "building," city landscape, "" cucumber, "" tower bridge, "or" london eye. Other image features may include other objects or entities, such as trees, cars, bodies of water, or people. In some cases, the example query image 100 may include portions of text that may be recognized by the image recognition system, for example, as text in a guidepost name or poster.
The example user click location 106 includes an area of the example query image 100 that has been selected by the user 104 of the user device 102. For example, the user device 102 may include a touch screen device (e.g., a smart phone), and the user click location 106 may represent that the user has clicked or otherwise selected to indicate a particular region of interest in the region. In some cases, the user click position 106 may be defined by coordinates (x, y) representing the center of the user click. In other cases, the user click position 106 may be defined by another form of context (e.g., manually entered coordinates) indicating the position. As depicted in fig. 1, the user 102 has clicked or selected an area 106 focused on "cucumber".
The example query image 100 and the user click location 106 may be received by the user device 102 and processed using a system (e.g., the system 200 of fig. 2 below) for providing information for output in response to receiving the query image and the user click location to provide information for output regarding one or more entities identified in the query image. Information about one or more entities identified in the query image may be biased toward entities identified in the query image as being in close proximity to the user click location 106.
As depicted in fig. 1, the information about the one or more entities identified in the query image includes an example search results page 110, the example search results page 110 including a search box 112, a plurality of example representative search queries 114, search results 116 related to the entities identified in the query image, and a knowledge card 118. The example search results page 110 is merely representative, and the information provided for output regarding one or more entities identified in the query image may include less or greater amounts of information in various representations.
The example search results page 110 includes a search box 112 in which a user may type a search query. The search box may be configured to receive a search query entered directly from a user, or may be configured to provide one or more representative search queries in response to receiving a search query image and a user click location (e.g., query image 100 and user click location 106). As depicted in fig. 1, the search box includes three representative search queries "how tall the cucumber is" related to the entity "cucumber" that is determined to be in close proximity to the user click location 106? "what architectural style is a cucumber? "and" who owns the cucumber? ".
The example search results page 110 further includes a listing of search results 116 and a knowledge card 118. The knowledge card 118 provides general information about the entity "cucumber", such as the size, age, and address of the building. A knowledge card has been provided for display in the example search results page 110, for example in response to identifying the entity "cucumber" as in close proximity to the user click location 106 of the query image 100. The list of search results 116 provides search results in response to a representative search query "cucumber". Providing information about one or more entities associated with the query image in response to receiving the query image and the user click location is described in more detail below with reference to fig. 2, 3, and 4.
FIG. 2 depicts a system 200 for providing information about one or more entities for output in response to receiving a query image and a user click location. In short, the system 200 is capable of receiving query images (such as photographs taken by a user), and user click positions. The system 200 can process the received query image and identify one or more entities associated with the processed query image. The system can provide information regarding the identified one or more entities associated with the processed query image as an output to the user.
The system 200 includes a user device 202, a query engine front end 220, an image processing module 240, a recognition engine 250, and a knowledge engine 260. In some cases, one or more components of system 200 may be included in user device 202. In some cases, the components of system 200 can each communicate over one or more networks, such as one or more LANs (local area network, local area networks) or WANs (wide area network, wide area networks), or can communicate over one or more other wired or wireless connections.
During operation (a), the query engine front end 220 receives data encoding a query image entered by a user and a user click position. For example, the user 204 can provide a photograph (e.g., photograph 100) at the user device 202 as a query image along with the user click location (e.g., user click location 106). The user click location may include coordinates of the location as specified by the user, for example, by a finger click on a screen of the user device or by other means. The data encoding the query image and the user click location may be received by the query engine front end 220. In some implementations, the query engine front end 220 can receive data encoding the user input query image and the user click location over one or more networks, or over one or more other wireless or wired connections.
The user device 202 may be a mobile computing device, such as a mobile phone, smart phone, personal digital assistant (personal digital assistant, PDA), music player, electronic book reader, tablet computer, wearable computing device, laptop computer, desktop computer, or other portable or stationary computing device. The user device 202 can feature a microphone, keyboard, touch screen, or other interface that enables the user 204 to enter a query at the device and specify a click location. For example, the user device may be a touch screen smart phone configured to detect a click position of the user. In some implementations, the user 204 can provide the query at an interface presented or accessible from the user device 202. For example, the user 204 can type a query at a search engine accessible at the user device 202, at a database accessible at the user device 202, or can provide a query and click location at any other interface characterized by search capabilities (e.g., at a social network interface). The user 204 can provide a query at the user device 202 by selecting or submitting an image that the user wants to search for, or by providing a video sample of the content that the user wants to search for.
The data representing the query image and click location entered by the user 204 can be received by the query engine front end 220 in a single data packet or in multiple data packets. The data may be received further simultaneously or the data may be received separately at different times.
In some implementations, the data representing the query image can include data representing a portion of the query image surrounding the user click location and data representing a remaining portion of the query image. For example, the user device 202 may be configured to transmit data representing a portion of the query image surrounding the user click location at a high resolution and transmit data representing the remainder of the query image at a lower resolution.
Based on receiving data encoding the query image and click position entered by the user, the query engine front end 220 can send the data to the image processing module 240. During operation (B), the image processing module 240 can receive data representing a user-entered query image and a click location and process the user-entered query image based on the user click location to generate a processed query image.
The image processing module 240 may process the received query image based on the user click location in order to enhance input to the recognition engine 250, for example, to improve recognition results obtained by the recognition engine 250. In some implementations, the image processing module 240 can be configured to crop the received query image based on the user click location. For example, the image processing module 240 may receive data representing the photograph 100 and the click location 106. The image processing module 240 may then crop the photograph 100 based on the user click location 106 by using a cropping engine to process the photograph 100. In some implementations, the image processing module 240 may include a content-aware cropping algorithm and may crop the received query image by executing the content-aware cropping algorithm on the query image. In some implementations, the image processing module 240 can include an object detection neural network and can process the query image using the object detection neural network to generate a cropped received query image. In some implementations, the image processing module 240 may be configured to apply fixed size cropping to the received query image around the user click location, e.g., the image processing module 240 may apply fixed size cropping to the photograph 100 around the user click location 106, resulting in a majority or all of the image comprising the building "cucumber". In further embodiments, the system may apply multiple cuts around the user click location. For example, the system may process the query image using an object detection neural network that identifies a plurality of objects in the query image and may crop the image around each identified object to generate a plurality of cropped images.
In some implementations, the image processing module 240 can include a plurality of optical character recognition (optical character recognition, OCR) engines, for example, a plurality of neural networks or other classifiers. The image processing module 240 may detect one or more regions of text, e.g., one or more lines of text, in the received query image by running one or more of the engines on the query image to process the received query image using the OCR engine. For example, the image processing module 240 may detect one or more lines of text, select an area of text (e.g., a fixed-size area) around the user click location, and process the selected area using the first OCR engine to identify a first portion of text in the query image. The image processing module 240 may further process the remaining text in the processed query image using a second OCR engine. In some implementations, the OCR engine may have different processing capabilities. For example, the second OCR engine may be less expensive to run than the first OCR engine, e.g., the second OCR engine may include a shallower neural network than the first OCR engine.
In some implementations, the image processing module 240 may be configured to process the received query image based on the user click location by defining a region of interest around the user click location. For example, the image processing module 240 may define a region of interest in the photograph 100 around the user click location 106, with the result that most or all of the defined region of interest includes the building "cucumber".
During operation (C), the image processing module 240 may send data representing the processed query image to the query engine front end 220, which in turn may send the data to the recognition engine 250. During operation (D), the recognition engine 250 can receive data representing the processed query image and can recognize one or more entities associated with the processed query image.
For example, in some implementations, the recognition engine 250 can receive data representing processed query images, the data including query images that have been cropped based on the user click location. In these cases, the recognition engine 250 can identify one or more entities associated with the cropped query image. In some implementations, the recognition engine 250 may include one or more neural networks, e.g., one or more deep neural networks trained for image classification, and one of the neural networks may be used to process the received cropped query image to identify one or more entities in the cropped image.
In some implementations, the recognition engine 250 can further receive data representing a received query image (e.g., the photograph 100), and can process the received query image using one of the neural networks to identify one or more entities in the received query image. For example, the recognition engine 250 may use a shallower neural network (e.g., a neural network requiring less processing power) to process the query image than the neural network used to process the processed query image. The recognition engine 250 may combine the one or more entities identified in the cropped query image and the query image. For example, the recognition engine 250 may process the photograph 100 using a shallow neural network to identify one or more entities including "buildings," bridges, "" cities, "or" skyscrapers. In addition, the recognition engine may process the processed query image including the cropped version of the photograph 100 surrounding the user click location 106 using the deep neural network to identify one or more entities including "gherkin" or "london". As another example, the recognition engine 250 may process the processed query image using a neural network having a first number of output categories and process the received query image using a neural network having a second number of output categories, wherein the first number is greater than the second number. For example, continuing with the example above, the second number of output categories may include entity tags such as "building" or "city", while the first number of output categories may include more specific entity tags such as "cucumber" or "london".
As described above, in some implementations, the image processing module 240 may process the received query image by running one or more OCR engines on the query image to detect one or more regions of text, e.g., one or more lines of text, in the received query image. In these cases, the recognition engine 250 may identify one or more entities associated with the processed query image by analyzing the detected text and identifying one or more entities included in the detected text.
As described above, in some implementations, the image processing module 240 may process the received query image based on the user click location by defining a region of interest around the user click location. In these cases, the recognition engine 250 may process the processed query image by using the descriptor matching engine to identify one or more entities that identify one or more entities associated with the processed query image. For example, the system may process the processed query image using a descriptor matching engine by extracting a higher density of descriptors in the defined region of interest than other regions in the processed query image.
In some implementations, the recognition engine 250 may identify one or more entities in the received query image by processing the received query image using a first classifier and processing the processed query image using a second classifier to identify one or more entities in the processed query image that identify one or more entities associated with the processed query image, wherein the second classifier has a higher processing power than the first classifier. For example, in some cases, the user of the user device may accidentally provide the user click position, or may incorrectly provide the incorrect user click position. An incorrect user click location may include a click on or near an entity that is not immediately of interest to the user, or may include a click that is not on or near a likely entity center, such as a portion of the blue sky or a portion of a blurred background. In these cases, the recognition engine may process the received query image and bias the processing of the received query image based on the processed query image (e.g., based on the user click position) using higher processing power. The recognition engine 250 may then ensure that one or more entities are identified in the query image, even in the presence of accidental or incorrect clicks.
The recognition engine 250 may compare the identified entity to terms and entities associated with a set of known entities to identify an expanded set of entities. For example, the recognition engine 250 may have processed the processed query image and/or the received query image to identify a collection of entities "building," bridge, "" skyscraper, "" city, "" cucumber, "or" london. The recognition engine 250 may then compare the identified entity to terms associated with the identified entity to identify an expanded set of entities. For example, the identified entity can include the entity "building" and the recognition engine 250 can identify additional terms associated with the "building" such as "eiffel tower," empire building, "or" tajiling. As another example, the recognition engine 250 may identify the entity "cucumber" and be able to identify additional terms associated with "cucumber", such as "nomamafoster" (architect), "standard living" (tenant), or "london financial city" (location). In some implementations, a known set of entities or terms can be accessible to the recognition engine 250 at a database, such as a database associated with the recognition engine 250 or otherwise accessible to the recognition engine 250 (e.g., over one or more networks).
In some implementations, identifying one or more entities associated with the processed query image may be performed locally at the user device, e.g., the user device 202 may include one or more recognition engines and may be configured to extract features from a given query image. For example, the user device 202 may be configured to identify one or more entities associated with the processed query image by locally processing the processed query image at the user device 202 using a descriptor matching engine. In this case, the user device 202 may process the processed query image using the descriptor matching engine by extracting a higher density of descriptors in the defined region of interest than other regions in the processed query image as described above.
During operation (E), based on identifying one or more entities associated with the input query image and the user click location, the recognition engine 250 can send data to the query engine front end 220 identifying the entity and, if applicable, any additional entities or terms. The recognition engine 250 can send data identifying the entity over one or more networks or over one or more other wired or wireless connections to the query engine front end 220.
During operation (F), the query engine front end 220 can receive data identifying one or more entities and can send the data identifying the entities to the knowledge engine 260. For example, the query engine front end 220 can receive information identifying the entities "cucumber", "nomamanford", "standard life", and "london financial city" and can send data identifying "cucumber", "nomamanford", "standard life", and "london financial city" to the knowledge engine 260. In some examples, the query engine front end 220 can send data identifying an entity to the knowledge engine 260 over one or more networks or over one or more other wired or wireless connections.
Knowledge engine 260 can receive data identifying an entity and can identify information about the entity. For example, the knowledge engine can identify information pre-associated with one or more entities. In some implementations, knowledge engine 260 can identify information related to the identified entity based on accessing a database or server that maintains information related to the entity. For example, knowledge engine 260 can receive information identifying an entity "cucumber" and the knowledge engine can access a database or server to identify candidate search queries associated with the entity "cucumber" using a pre-computed query map, such as "how high the cucumber is" or "direction to the cucumber". In some implementations, the database or server accessed by knowledge engine 260 can be, for example, a database or server associated with knowledge engine 260 as part of knowledge engine 260, or knowledge engine 260 can access a database or server, for example, over one or more networks. The database or server maintaining information about the entities may include information in different languages. In this case, the knowledge engine may be configured to identify information associated with a given entity in a language that matches the user's language, for example, as indicated by the user device.
In some implementations, the information about the entity can include one or more candidate search queries related to or referring to the identified entity. For example, a database or server may include a trained or hard-coded statistical mapping of entities, e.g., based on search query logs, and be capable of storing candidate search queries related to various entities. Knowledge engine 260 can obtain or identify candidate search queries related to one or more entities associated with the user-entered query search image and the user click location using a database or server. For example, knowledge engine 260 can identify one or more candidate search queries related to the building "cucumber" at a database or server. Knowledge engine 260 can identify related candidate search queries based on executing a search query for candidates related to "cucumber" against a database or server. In other implementations, the knowledge engine 250 can identify related candidate search queries by accessing entries at a database or server that are obviously related to the identified entity. For example, a database or server may maintain folders or other data stores that include candidate search queries related to "cucumber", and knowledge engine 260 may be able to obtain or identify candidate search queries related to "cucumber".
Knowledge engine 260 is also capable of generating individual relevance scores for different types of information pre-associated with one or more entities. For example, knowledge engine 260 may determine whether the context of the received query image matches the candidate search query and generate respective relevance scores for the candidate search query based on the determined matches.
In some implementations, knowledge engine 260 may define a bounding box around each identified one or more entities associated with the processed query image. Knowledge engine 260 may then determine that the user click position is within one or more bounding boxes of one or more respective entities and assign a higher relevance score to the one or more respective entities than the other identified entities.
As described above with reference to operation (D), in some implementations, the recognition engine 250 may combine entities classified in the processed query image with entities classified in the received query image. In these cases, knowledge engine 260 can receive data identifying the combined entities and can contextualize the one or more entities classified in the processed query image using the one or more entities classified in the received query image. For example, knowledge engine 260 may identify candidate search queries that are pre-associated with an entity (e.g., an entity "building" or "cucumber") identified in the processed query image. In such examples, knowledge engine 260 may generate respective relevance scores for candidate search queries related to the attributes of "gherkin" that are higher than relevance scores for candidate search queries related to the attributes of "building" using an entity (e.g., entity "london") identified in the received query image.
In other examples, knowledge engine 260 may generate a search result page by using the candidate search queries and analyze the generated search result page to determine a measure indicating how interesting and useful the search result page is to generate respective relevance scores for each of the one or more candidate search queries. Based on the determined measurements, knowledge engine 260 may generate respective relevance scores for the candidate search queries. For example, candidate search queries that generate a search results page that includes many visual elements may be assigned a higher relevance score than candidate search queries that generate search results pages that include fewer or no visual elements.
In other examples, knowledge engine 260 may generate respective relevance scores for each of one or more candidate search queries by determining popularity of the candidate search queries. For example, knowledge engine 260 may generate a higher relevance score for candidate search queries issued a greater number of times than another candidate search query issued a lesser number of times.
In some instances, the relevance score may be assigned to information about one or more entities by another system or assigned to information by a person (e.g., a regulator or user of system 200).
During operation (G), based on identifying information about one or more entities, knowledge engine 260 can send data identifying different types and pieces of information and their respective relevance scores to query engine front-end 220. For example, knowledge engine 260 can obtain and/or identify one or more candidate search queries related to the building "cucumber" and can send a query engine front-end 220 including or identifying the candidate search query "how high is cucumber? Or "direction to cucumber". Knowledge engine 260 can send data comprising or identifying candidate search queries to query engine front-end 220 over one or more networks, or over one or more other wired or wireless connections.
The query engine front end 220 can receive data including or identifying information from the knowledge engine 260 and its respective relevance scores and can provide as output one or more representative segments responsive to receiving query images and user click position selection information. For example, the query engine front-end may select one or more representative search queries from the one or more candidate search queries based at least on the relevance score, e.g., by ranking the one or more candidate search queries and selecting a number of highest scoring search queries as representative search queries. For example, the query engine front-end may receive "how high is the cucumber that includes or identifies candidate search queries having a relevance score of 0.8? And "direction to cucumber" data with a correlation score of 0.6. Based on the relevance score, the query engine front-end may select the candidate search query "how high is the cucumber? "
During operation (H), the query engine front end 220 may send data encoding representative information (e.g., a representative search query) to the user device 202. In some implementations, the query engine front end 220 can send data encoding one or more representative search queries and data related to the presentation of search result pages associated with one or more of the representative search queries (e.g., search result pages associated with the highest scoring representative search query) to the user device 202 over one or more networks, or over one or more other wired or wireless connections.
The user device 202 is capable of receiving data encoding representative information from the query engine front end 220 and providing information for output to the user 204. For example, the user device 202 may receive a representative search query "direction to cucumber" encoding the rank "how high the cucumber is? "or" who owns the cucumber? "data and provide one or more representative search queries and a representative search query that is ranked highest to the user 204" how high is the cucumber? The "associated search results page is used for output, as depicted in FIG. 1 above.
FIG. 3 presents an example process 300 for providing information about one or more entities in response to receiving a query image and a user click location. For example, the process 300 can be performed by the system 200 in response to receiving a query image and a user click location at the user device 202 by the user 204.
The system receives the query image and the user click location (step 302). The query image may be a search query in the form of an image, such as a photograph from the surrounding of the user. The user click position may be provided as a point (x, y) of the query image, or as an area of the query image (e.g., a fixed-size area of the query image).
The system processes the received query image based on the user click location (step 304). In some implementations, the system can process the received query image by cropping the received query image based on the user click location. For example, the system may receive a query image showing a photograph of a basketball game with a user click location on or near the basketball being played. The system may process the received query image by cropping the received query based on the clicked basketball being played. For example, the system may crop the received query image by executing a content-aware cropping algorithm. As another example, the system may process the query image using an object detection neural network to generate a cropped received query image. As yet another example, the system may apply a fixed size clip to the received query image around the user click location, e.g., a fixed size clip around the basketball being played. In some implementations, the system can generate a plurality of cropped images by cropping the query image at several places, for example, where the object detection neural network has detected a plurality of objects in the query image.
In some implementations, the system can process the received query image based on the user click location by processing the received query image using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine to detect one or more regions of text in the received query image. For example, the system may select an area (e.g., a fixed-size area) around the user click location and process the selected area using a first OCR engine to identify a first number of entities. The system may further process the remaining text in the processed query image using a second OCR engine to identify a second number of entities. In some implementations, processing text using the second OCR engine may be less computationally expensive than processing text using the first OCR engine.
In some implementations, the system can process the received query image based on the user click location by defining a region of interest around the user click location. For example, the system may receive a query image showing a photograph of a basketball game with a user click location on or near the basketball being played. The system may process the received query image by defining a region of interest around the clicked playing basketball.
The system identifies one or more entities associated with the processed query image (step 306). For example, as described above with reference to step 304, in some embodiments, the system may generate a processed query image by cropping the received query image based on the user click location. In these cases, the system may identify one or more entities associated with the processed query image by processing the processed query image using a neural network (e.g., a neural network trained for image recognition as described above with reference to fig. 2) to classify the one or more entities in the processed image.
In some implementations, the system can further process the received query image (i.e., the unprocessed query image) using the neural network to classify one or more entities in the received query image. The system may then combine the one or more entities classified in the processed query image with the one or more entities classified in the received query image to generate an identified set of one or more entities. In some implementations, the system can combine the one or more entities classified in the processed query image with the one or more entities classified in the received query image by contextualizing the one or more entities classified in the processed query image using the one or more entities classified in the received query image.
For example, the system may receive a query image showing a photograph of a basketball game and crop the image based on a user click location centered on the basketball shown in the received query image. The system may then process the processed image using a neural network to classify one or more entities in the processed image. For example, the neural network may classify one or more entities as basketball in the processed image. The system may further process the received query image using a neural network to classify one or more entities in the received query image and use the classified one or more entities to contextualize the one or more entities classified in the processed query image. For example, the system may categorize the entity "basketball game" or "michael geordan" in the received query image and use these categorizations to provide context to the entity "basketball", including, for example, the context of basketball games or NBA league. As an alternative example, the system may receive a query image showing a photograph of the interior of a sports store, and the system may categorize entities including the name of the sports store or the name of the basketball manufacturer in the received query image and use these classifications to provide context to the entity "basketball," including, for example, the context of shopping.
As described above with reference to step 304, in some implementations, the system may process the received query image based on the user click location by processing the received query image using one or more OCR engines to detect one or more regions of text in the received query image. In these cases, the system may identify one or more entities associated with the processed query image by analyzing the detected text and identifying one or more entities included in the detected text. For example, the system may detect an area of text printed on the basketball shown in the processed query image and may identify an entity associated with the processed query image as the name of the manufacturer of the basketball.
As described above with reference to step 304, in some implementations, the system may process the received query image based on the user click location by defining a region of interest around the user click location. In these cases, the system may identify one or more entities associated with the processed query image by processing the processed query image using the descriptor matching engine to identify the one or more entities. For example, the system may process the processed query image using a descriptor matching engine by extracting a higher density of descriptors in the defined region of interest than other regions in the processed query image.
In some implementations, the system can process the received query image by using a first classifier to identify one or more entities in the received query image and process the processed query image by using a second classifier to identify one or more entities in the processed query image to identify one or more entities associated with the processed query image, wherein the second classifier has a higher processing power than the first classifier. For example, in some cases, the user of the user device may accidentally provide the user click position, or may incorrectly provide the incorrect user click position. An incorrect user click location may include a click on or near an entity that is not immediately of interest to the user, or may include a click that is not on or near a likely entity center, such as a portion of the blue sky or a portion of the blurred background. In these cases, the system may process the received query image and bias the processing of the received query image based on the processed query image (e.g., based on the user click position) using higher processing power. The system may then ensure that one or more entities are identified in the query image, even if there is an unexpected or incorrect click.
In response to receiving the query image and the user click location, the system provides information about the identified one or more entities (step 308). For example, the system may provide one or more knowledge cards related to the identified one or more entities, a search results page related to one or more of the identified entities, or one or more representative search queries related to the identified one or more entities. In some implementations, the system can provide information about the identified one or more entities based at least on the categorized one or more entities contextualized in the processed query image, as described above with reference to step 306. For example, the system may use one or more entities of the contextualized taxonomy to generate contextualized knowledge cards, search results pages, or representative search queries for the identified one or more entities, e.g., knowledge cards or search results pages related to the NBA alliance, rather than knowledge cards or search results pages related to purchasing basketball. Providing a representative search query for output in response to receiving a query image and a user click location is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 4.
FIG. 4 presents an example process 400 for providing a representative search query for output in response to receiving a query image and a user click location. For example, process 400 can be performed by system 200 in response to receiving a query image and a user click location at user device 202 by user 204.
For one or more identified entities associated with the processed query image, the system identifies one or more candidate search queries pre-associated with the one or more entities (step 402). For example, the system may access a pre-computed query map to identify one or more candidate search queries for a given entity. The pre-computed query map may be a trained or hard-coded statistical map of related entities, e.g., based on a search query log, and may be used to identify both entities and candidate search queries. For example, the query image may include a photograph of a basketball game, and the entity "basketball" may be received as an entity associated with the query image and the corresponding user click location. Because the entity "basketball" may be considered to be related to "NBA," both the entity "basketball" and the candidate search query "NBA" may be found in a pre-computed query map.
The system generates respective relevance scores for each of the candidate search queries (step 404). In some implementations, generating respective relevance scores for each of the candidate search queries may include generating respective relevance scores for each of the candidate search queries based on a proximity of one or more entities pre-associated with the candidate search queries to the user click location. For example, the query image may include a photograph of a basketball game with a basketball-centric user click location. In this example, the system may identify an entity "basketball" to be pre-associated with the candidate search query "NBA" and an entity "Michael geordan" to be pre-associated with the candidate search query "Michael geordan statistics". The system may generate respective relevance scores for candidate search queries "NBA" and "Michael geordan statistics" based on the proximity of the entities "basketball" and "Michael geordan" to the user's click location. For example, the candidate search query "NBA" may be assigned a higher relevance score than the candidate search query "Michael geordan statistics" because the entity "basketball" is closer to the user click location than the entity "Michael geordan".
In some implementations, the system can define a bounding box around each identified one or more entities associated with the processed query image. The system may then determine that the user click position is within one or more bounding boxes of one or more respective entities and assign a higher relevance score to the one or more respective entities than other identified entities. For example, the query image may include a photograph of a basketball and the system may define a bounding box around each entity identified in the query image, e.g., around the entity "basketball," michael geordan, "" chicago bull team, "or" referee. The system may then determine that the user click location is within the bounding box of the entity "basketball" and assign a higher relevance score to the candidate search query "NBA" than to other candidate search queries.
In some implementations, the respective relevance scores generated for each of the candidate search queries may be based on one or more of the following: (i) confidence in the results, (ii) popularity of the query, or (iii) temporal of candidate search queries. For example, the system may determine a measure of confidence that reflects the identified entity and the confidence that the candidate search query accurately represents the intent of the user, and generate respective relevance scores for each of the candidate search queries based on the determined measure of confidence. The system may generate a higher respective relevance score for a higher measured candidate search query having a confidence than a lower measured candidate search query having a confidence.
As another example, the system may determine popularity of each of the candidate search queries and generate respective relevance scores for each of the candidate search queries based on the determined popularity. The system may generate a higher respective relevance score for candidate search queries that have been issued a greater number of times than another candidate search query issued a lesser number of times.
As another example, the system may determine a temporal for each of the candidate search queries and generate respective relevance scores for each of the candidate search queries based on the determined temporal. The system may generate higher respective relevance scores for candidate search queries that are determined to be more current than candidate search queries that are determined to be less current. For example, candidate search queries related to a current basketball season may be determined to be more current than candidate search queries related to a past basketball season.
As another example of generating respective relevance scores for each of the candidate search queries, may include, for each candidate search query, generating a search results page using the candidate search queries and analyzing the generated search results pages to determine a measure indicating how interesting and useful the search results page is. Based on the determined measurements, the system may generate respective relevance scores for the candidate search queries. For example, a measurement indicating how interesting and useful the search results page is may depend on the visual elements shown in the search results page. The system may generate a higher respective relevance score for candidate search queries that generated search result pages with oneboxes or webaswer cards than candidate search queries that generated search result pages without oneboxes or webaswer cards.
The system selects a particular candidate search query as a representative search query for the query image based at least on the respective relevance scores generated (step 406). For example, the system may rank the generated relevance scores for the candidate search queries, e.g., using a ranking function or classifier, and select the particular candidate search query for the query image that corresponds to the highest ranked score.
In response to receiving the query image and the user click location, the system provides a representative search query for output (step 408). In some implementations, the system further generates a search results page using the representative search query and provides the generated search results page for output in response to receiving the query image. In some cases, the system may also provide for output a predetermined number of candidate search queries corresponding to a predetermined number of highest ranked scores in response to receiving the query image. For example, the system may provide the top 10 scored candidate search queries for output in response to receiving a query image and allow the user to select the search query of his choice.
Several embodiments have been described. However, it should be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure. For example, various forms of the flows shown above may be used, with steps reordered, added, or removed. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.
For examples in which the systems and/or methods discussed herein may collect personal information about a user, or may utilize personal information, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, preferences, or current location), or whether and/or how the systems and/or methods are able to perform operations that are more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways prior to its storage or use, thereby removing personally identifiable information. For example, the identity of the user may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or the geographic location of the user may be summarized where location information is obtained, such as to a city, zip code, or state level, so that the particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user can control how information about him or her is collected and used.
All of the embodiments and functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments may be implemented as one or more computer program products, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a computer readable medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. The computer readable medium can be a machine readable storage device, a machine readable storage substrate, a storage device, a composition of matter effecting a machine readable propagated signal, or a combination of one or more of them. The term "data processing apparatus" includes all apparatuses, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus may include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an operating environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, or a combination of one or more of them.
