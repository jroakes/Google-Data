Definitions
- Radio detection and ranging (RADAR) systems can be used to actively estimate distances to environmental features by emitting radio signals and detecting returning reflected signals. Distances to radio-reflective features can be determined according to the time delay between transmission and reception.
- the radar system can emit a signal that varies in frequency over time, such as a signal with a time-varying frequency ramp, and then relate the difference in frequency between the emitted signal and the reflected signal to a range estimate.
- Some systems may also estimate relative motion of reflective objects based on Doppler frequency shifts in the received reflected signals.
- Directional antennas can be used for the transmission and/or reception of signals to associate each range estimate with a bearing. More generally, directional antennas can also be used to focus radiated energy on a given field of view of interest. Combining the measured distances and the directional information allows for the surrounding environment features to be mapped.
- the radar sensor can thus be used, for instance, by an autonomous vehicle control system to avoid obstacles indicated by the sensor information.
- Some example automotive radar systems may be configured to operate at an electromagnetic wave frequency of 77 Giga-Hertz (GHz), which corresponds to a millimeter (mm) wave electromagnetic wave length (e.g., 3.9 mm for 77 GHz).
- GHz Giga-Hertz
- mm millimeter wave electromagnetic wave length
- Such radar systems may use antennas that can focus the radiated energy into tight beams in order to enable the radar system to measure an environment with high accuracy, such as an environment around an autonomous vehicle.
- Such antennas may be compact (typically with rectangular form factors), efficient (i.e., with little of the 77 GHz energy lost to heat in the antenna or reflected back into the transmitter electronics), and low cost and easy to manufacture (i.e., radar systems with these antennas can be made in high volume).

- FIG. 1 illustrates an example layout of radar sectors
- FIG. 2 illustrates example beam steering for a sector for a radar unit.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example radar system with phase coded linear frequency modulation.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example computing device for performing some of the methods disclosed herein.
- FIG. 5 is an example method for phase coded linear frequency modulation.
- vehicular radar systems may feature multiple radar units with each radar unit having an associated field of view. Additionally, the radar units may operate in an environment that may have radio noise. Typically, the signals from the multiple radar units and the radio noise may cause undesirable interference for the radar system.
- the apparatus and methods presented herein allow improved radar system functionality by using phase coded linear frequency modulation for radar to aid in radar system operation.
- vehicular radar systems have featured a single radar unit looking in a forward direction. These traditional radar systems would also typically only direct the radar beam in a single direction.
- the precision required in the placement of the radar unit may be not as great as systems with multiple radar units with steerable beams.
- the non-steerable beam only interrogating one direction may cause the lower precision requirement.
- a traditional vehicular radar system may only be configured to detect the presence of another vehicle directly in front of the vehicle having the radar system. Thus, as long as a radar beam generally points in the forward direction the traditional radar system would be able to detect the vehicle.
- More advanced radar systems may be used with a vehicle in order to obtain a wider field of view than just that directly in front of the vehicle. For example, it may be desirable either for a radar to be able to steer a radar beam or for a vehicle to feature multiple radar units pointing in different directions. Additionally, the radar units may be configured to detect more than just other vehicles located directly in front of the vehicle with the radar unit. Thus, the radar system may be able to interrogate different regions than just the region in front of the car. In some examples, multiple radar units may be combined with steerable radar beams to further increase the interrogation region and the imagining resolution of the vehicular radar system.
- An example radar system for use with the present disclosure may include multi-sector 90 degree field of view radar antenna architecture that may enable an antenna to both scan across approximately 90-degrees of the azimuth plane (e.g. the horizontal plane) while also being mountable on various surfaces of a vehicle. Having a radar antenna with a 90 degree field of view may enable a radar system to scan a full 360 azimuth plane by having four radar units each configured to scan one 90-degree non-overlapping sector. Therefore, the example disclosed radar system may be able to steer a radar beam to interrogate the entire region in the azimuth plane of the vehicle. So that for example, four such radars located on four corners of a car would provide a full 360 coverage around the car. For example, a system such as this may aid in autonomous driving of a vehicle.
- each radar unit can scan or span a 90-degree region
- placing 4 radar units on a vehicle may enable the vehicle to scan a beam over the full 360 azimuth plane.
- Each of the four radar units may be configured to scan a beam over one sector (i.e. one quarter of the azimuth plane) and thus the entire plane may be scanned by the combination of the four radar units.
- the placement of the radar units may be adjusted depending on the specific vehicle, the requirements of the radar system, or other design criteria.
- the radar units may be configured to scan a region of an angular width that is not 90 degrees. For example, some radar units may scan 30 degrees, 120 degrees, or another angle. Further, in some examples, the radar units on the vehicle may scan less than the full 360 azimuth plane.
- the radar sectors may be defined based on where the radar units may be mounted on the vehicle.
- one radar unit may be mounted in each of the side mirrors of the vehicle.
- the other two radar units may be mounted behind the taillights of the vehicle.
- the quadrants may be defined based on axes where one axis aligns with the direction of vehicular motion and the other axis aligns with the middle of the vehicle from front to back.
- the radar units may be mounted in order to have one pointing forward, one pointing backward, and one pointing to each side.
- the axes of the quadrants may be at a 45 degree angle to the direction of motion of the vehicle.
- the radar unit may be mounted on top of the vehicle.
- the modular multi-sector 90 degree field of view radar antenna architecture may be able to steer the radar beams emitted from each radar unit.
- the radar beams may be steered by the radar units in various ways.
- the radar units may be able to steer the beam in an approximately continuous manner across the 90 degree field of view for the respective antenna or the radar units may be configured with sectoral sub beams spanning the 90 degrees.
- the radar units may be able to steer the radar beam to predetermined directions within the 90 degree field of view for the respective antenna.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example layout of radar sectors for an autonomous vehicle 102 .
- each of the radar sectors may have an angular width approximately equal to the scanning range of the radar units (as will be described with respect to FIG. 2 ).
- the sectors of FIG. 1 divide the azimuth plane around the autonomous vehicle 102 into 90 degree sectors.
- the width and number of sectors may change.
- the radar sectors may align with the axes ( 112 a and 112 b ) of the vehicle 102 .
- the axes ( 112 a and 112 b ) of the vehicle 102 there may be a front left, front right, rear left, and rear right sector defined by the midpoints of the vehicle 102 .
- each radar unit may be configured to scan across one sector.
- each example radar unit of FIG. 1 has a scanning angle of approximately 90 degrees, each radar unit scans a region that approximately does not overlap with the scanning angle of any other radar unit.
- the layout of radar sectors shown in FIG. 1 is one example. Other possible layouts of radar sectors are possible as well.
- each radar unit may be mounted at a 45 degree angle with respect to the two axes of the vehicle 102 .
- a 90 degree scan of the radar unit would scan from one vehicle axis to the other vehicle axis.
- a radar unit mounted at a 45 degree angle to the axes in side mirror unit 104 may be able to scan the front left sector (i.e. from the vertical axis 112 a through the front of the vehicle 102 to the axis 112 b that runs through the side of the vehicle).
- An additional radar unit may be mounted at a 45 degree angle to the axes in side mirror unit 106 may be able to scan the front right sector.
- a radar unit may be mounted in taillight unit 110 .
- a radar unit may be mounted in taillight unit 108 .
- the radar unit placements shown in FIG. 1 are merely one example. In various other examples, the radar units may be placed in other locations, such as on top of the vehicle, or within or behind other vehicle components.
- the sectors may also be defined differently in various embodiments. For example, the sectors may be at a 45 degree angle with respect to the vehicle. In this example, one radar unit may face forward, another backward, and the other two to the sides of the vehicle.
- all the radar units of vehicle 102 may be configured with the same scanning angle.
- the azimuth plane around the vehicle is equal to a full 360 degrees.
- the scanning angle for the radar units would be equal to approximately 360 divided by the number of radar units on the vehicle.
- a vehicle 102 with one radar unit would need that radar unit to be able to scan over the full 360 degrees.
- the number of radar units may be chosen based on a number of criteria, such as ease of manufacture of the radar units, vehicle placement, or other criteria.
- some radar units may be configured with a planar structure that is sufficiently small.
- the planar radar unit may be mountable at various positions on a vehicle.
- a vehicle may have a dedicated radar housing mounted on the top of the vehicle.
- the radar housing may contain various radar units.
- radar units may be placed within the vehicle structure.
- radar units When radar units are located within the vehicle structure, each may not be visible from outside the vehicle without removing parts of the vehicle. Thus, the vehicle may not be altered aesthetically, cosmetically, or aerodynamically from adding radar units.
- radar units may be placed under vehicle trim work, under bumpers, under grills, within housings for lights, within side mirrors, or other locations as well.
- various plastics, polymers, and other materials may form part of the vehicle structure and cover the radar units, while allowing the radar signal to pass through.
- the radar units may be configured with different scanning ranges for different radar units. For example, in some embodiments a specific radar unit with a wide scanning angle may not be able to be placed on the vehicle in the proper location. Thus, a smaller radar unit, with a smaller scanning angle may be placed in that location. However, other radar units may be able to have larger scanning angles. Therefore, the total scanning angle of the radar units may add up to 360 degrees (or more) and provide full 360 degree azimuthal scanning. For example, a vehicle may have 3 radar units that each scan over 100 degrees and a fourth radar unit that scans over 60 degrees. Thus, the radar units may be able to scan the full azimuth plane, but the scanning sectors may not be equal in angular size.
- FIG. 2 illustrates example beam steering for a sector for a radar unit 200 .
- the radar unit 200 may be configured with a steerable beam, i.e., the radar unit 200 may be able to control a direction in which the beam is radiated. By controlling the direction in which the beam is radiated, the radar unit 200 may be able to direct radiation in a specific direction in order to determine radar reflections (and thus objects) in that direction. In some embodiments, the radar unit 200 may be able to scan a radar beam in a continuous manner across the various angles of the azimuth plane. In other embodiments, the radar unit 200 may be able to scan the radar beam in discrete steps across the various angles of the azimuth plane.
- the example radar unit 200 in FIG. 2 has a radar beam 206 that can be steered across a plurality of different angles.
- the radar beam 206 may have a half-power beamwidth of approximately 22.5 degrees.
- the half-power beamwidth describes the width, measured in degrees, of a main lobe of the radar beam 206 between two points that correspond to half the amplitude of the maximum of the radar beam 206 .
- the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may be different than 22.5 degrees. Additionally, in some embodiments, the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may change depending on the angle at which the radar beam 206 is pointed.
- the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may be narrower when the radar beam 206 is pointed more closely to the orthogonal 204 a (i.e. broadside) direction to the radiating surface and widen and the radar beam 206 is steered away from the orthogonal direction 204 a.
- the radar beam may be able to be steered to four different angles.
- the steering angle may be measured with respect to the orthogonal 204 a (i.e. broadside) direction to the radiating surface.
- the beam may be steered to +36 degrees at 204 c and ⁇ 36 degrees at 204 e .
- the beam may be steered to +12 degrees at 204 b and ⁇ 12 degrees at 204 d .
- the four different angles may represent the discrete angles to which the radar beam 206 may be steered.
- the radar beam may be able to be steered to two angles simultaneously. For example, the radar beam may be steered to both +12 and ⁇ 12 degrees at the same time.
- the full 90 degree field of view can be scanned.
- the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from +47.25 degrees to +24.75 degrees (as measured from the broadside direction 204 a ).
- the radar beam 206 is steered to ⁇ 36 degrees 604 e , the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from ⁇ 47.25 degrees to ⁇ 24.75 degrees.
- the radar beam 206 when the radar beam 206 is steered to +12 degrees 204 b , the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from +23.25 degrees to +0.75 degrees. And finally, when the radar beam 206 is steered to ⁇ 12 degrees 204 d , the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 will cover from ⁇ 23.25 degrees to ⁇ 0.75 degrees. Thus, the radar beam 206 will effectively be able to scan (i.e. selectively enable or disable the four beams spanning the angular width) from ⁇ 47.25 to +47.25 degrees, covering a range of 95 degrees.
- the number of steering angles, the direction of the steering angles, and the half-power beamwidth of the radar beam 206 may be varied depending on the specific example.
- a radar beam of a radar unit may be configured to only scan a 60 degree region. If a radar unit can scan a 60 degree region, six radar units may be used to scan a full 360 azimuth plane. However, if the radar unit can scan 90 degrees, four radar units may scan the full 360 azimuth plane.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example radar system 300 with phase coded linear frequency modulation.

- the chirp synthesis module 308 is configured to create chirp signal.
- the chirp signal may be used with both the transmission and reception of signals with the radar unit 300 .
- the chirp signal created by the chirp synthesis module 308 may a linear frequency modulated (LFM) signal.
- LFM signal may be an up-chirp, that is, it has a frequency that increase linearly with time, or it may be a down-chirp, that is, it has a frequency that decreases linearly with time.
- An LFM signal may be used because the use of LFM signaling in radar may combine the benefits of the high energy of a long pulse width signal with the high resolution of a short pulse width signal. Higher energies allow a radar system to work at longer distances and also to detect smaller objects. Shorter pulses may allow a radar system to more finely detect ranges of detected objects.
- the radar system 300 also includes a code synthesis module 310 and a chip rate selection module 312 .
- the code synthesis module is configured to create an encoding for the transmitted signal.
- the encoding is configured to allow multiple radar units to function within proximity of each other. If there are several radar modules operating in the vicinity of each other and each does not have a unique encoding, the radar units may interfere with each other. However, by providing an encoding for each radar unit, the radar unit may be able to resolve received reflections to determine the portion of the received signal corresponding to a signal transmitted by the respective radar unit.
- the presently disclosed encodings may allow a single radar unit to transmit multiple orthogonally-encoded signals at one time (i.e. based on one LFM ramp signal). This may allow a radar unit to function as a multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) radar. Further, if a single radar unit transmits multiple orthogonally-encoded signals at one time, the signals may be received and decoded by multiple radar units, as long as the receiving radar unit applies the correct code to decode the radar signal.
- MIMO multiple input, multiple output
- multiple vehicles driving within proximity of each other may each have radar units.
- the radar unit from one vehicle transmits a signal
- the radar unit of a different vehicle may receive that signal. Without the use of an encoding on the signal, the radar unit receiving the signal may not operate correctly. The radar unit may incorrectly operate as if that respective radar unit transmitted the received signal.
- a radar unit may filter or remove undesired signals from processing.
- a single vehicle may feature multiple radar units.
- each radar unit may ideally operate by only receiving signals based on reflections from signals transmitting by the respective radar unit.
- each radar unit of a single vehicle may also be configured to transmit signals with an encoding unique to the respective radar unit.
- the code synthesis module 310 may create a binary phase-shift key (BPSK) signal for the encoding.
- the BPSK signal may have a code rate based on the output of the chip rate selection module 312 .
- the chip rate selection module 312 may selectively output a desired signaling chip rate based on a set chip rate.
- the chip rate selection module 312 may selectively output a desired signaling chip rate based on a range of possible chip rates.
- the chip rate of the chip rate selection module 312 may cause the BPSK signal to have different signaling rates at different times.
- the chip rate selection module 312 may output a rate between 500 kiloHertz (kHz) and 600 kHz.
- a BPSK modulation scheme encodes signals by modulating the phase of the carrier signal from in-phase to 180 degrees out-of-phase based on a respective code.
- the codes may be orthogonal. (i.e. the codes may be mathematically defined so that if two signals are received at the same time, with different codes, each signal may be reconstructed due to the encoding).
- the code synthesis module 310 may create the BPSK modulation with a respective code having a rate specified by the chip rate selection module 312 .
- other modulation schemes may be used as well. For example, quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), higher bit-order phase-shift keying (PSK), differential phase-shift keying (DPSK), or other modulation schemes may be used as well.
- QPSK quadrature phase-shift keying
- PSK higher bit-order phase-shift keying
- DPSK differential phase-shift keying
- the transmitter 302 may receive the signal output by the chirp synthesis module 308 after it has been mixed by mixer 306 a along with the output of code synthesis module 310 .
- the mixer 306 a mixes the chirp signal from the chirp synthesis module 308 with the output of code synthesis module 310 , a modulated LFM radar signal is created.
- the transmitter 302 may transmit this modulated LFM radar signal.
- the output of the receiver 304 may be coupled to the input of mixer 306 b .
- the received reflected radio signals from the receiver 304 may be mixed with the output of the chirp synthesis module 308 .
- the chirp is removed from the received signals. Removing the chirp signal may be known as “dechirping.” After mixing, a signal is output that includes the superposition of phase-encoded reflections from many different ranges.
- the output of the mixer 306 b may be supplied to the code alignment module 314 .
- the code alignment module 314 may apply a time delay. The time delay applied may be based on a range of interest over which the reflected signal will be analyzed. By applying the time delay, the signal output by the code alignment module 314 may be adjusted in a way that the reflected signal may be decoded to supply information about the range of interest associated with the selected delay.
- the output of the code alignment module 314 may be coupled to the code removal module 316 .
- the code removal module 316 combines the output of the code alignment module 314 with the conjugate of the code from the code synthesis module 310 .
- the modulation encoding can be removed from the signal. After the modulation is removed (i.e., demodulated), a signal will be left that that results in a tone corresponding to the region of interest. Undesirable signals, such as those from regions other than the desired region, will form signals similar to white noise. These white noise signals may be easily filtered or removed.
- the FFT module 318 may perform a Fast Fourier Transform on the signal.
- the Fast Fourier Transform converts a time-domain signal into a frequency-domain signal.
- taking the Fast Fourier Transform of the demodulated signal converts the reflected signals into frequency domain signals.
- the frequency domain signals correspond to reflections in the target region. Reflections in the target region may have a Doppler frequency shift based on a velocity of the object.

- C i ⁇ k ⁇ indexes into k-th element the for the i-th channel
- ceil(x) is the ceiling function.

- the reflection signal may be a single reflection or a signal including several reflected signals. Further, the reflection signal may include reflection signals from more than one transmitted pulse from more than one radar channel (e.g., another radar unit). The reflection signals may be reflected from objects within the field of view of the radar system. The reflection signals may be received by an antenna or antenna system of the radar system. The antenna may output signals based on the received reflections for further processing by the radar system.

- ⁇ ⁇ ( t ) 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ f ⁇ ( t - 2 ⁇ r c ) + ⁇ ⁇ ( t ⁇ - 2 ⁇ r c ) 2
- the method 500 includes filtering the received reflection signal.
- the radar system may use stretch processing.
- Stretch processing includes mixing the received signal with a similar signal to the transmission signal before digitization of the signal.
- the received signal may be mixed with a chirp signal that is the conjugate of the chirp signal used to create the transmission signal.

- ⁇ ref *(t) is the conjugate phase history of the chirp signal at a given time t.
- stretch processing is used with a received reflection signal having a phase modulation and phase history based on Equation 4, the result may be a signal defined similarly to Equation 6.
- the signal based on Equation 6 may be quite computationally difficult to decode because it includes the superposition of the phase code at many different ranges, or equivalently, many different time delays.

- the method 500 includes removing the phase code modulation.
- the phase code may be removed by mixing the conjugate of the phase code with the signal represented by Equation 7.
- Equation 8 shows the removal of the phase code. Removal of the phase code may result in a single tone for a return from the waveform of interest. However, removal of the phase code will spread the undesirable return from other waveforms across the bandwidth. Thus, removal of the phase code may also provide some intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth interference rejection.
- IF intermediate frequency
- the code time alignment function is a narrowband function
- some amount of leakage creates strong range sidelobes at harmonics of the coding (or chip) rate. These harmonics can be undesirable.
- the sidelobes may cause a radar system to determine a reflection is coming from the wrong location based on the sidelobe effect. Further, one reflection may manifest itself as appearing to be more than one reflection due to the sidelobe effect as well.
- the radar system may operate by adapting the chips rate in the slow time domain. That is, on a pulse-to-pulse basis the chip rate is changed. For example, as previously discussed, a first pulse may be transmitted with a first chip rate. A second pulse may be transmitted with a second chip rate different than the first. Because the chip rates are different, each may have a different sidelobe effect. Thus, when the reflections are compared with each other, only the main lobes will be aligned and the side lobe effects may be removed.
- the chip rate may be varied for each pulse by adding between 0 to 100 kHz (selection is random and uniform over this interval) to the base chip rate of 500 kHz every pulse.
- dB decibels
