- Multiplier 434 then conveys each code word 436 to truncation function 438 .
- Truncation function 438 truncates ( 518 ) each code word 436 to produce a truncated code word, which truncated code word is the code word ‘ ⁇ ’ provided to phase shifter 210 .
- the length of code word ‘ ⁇ ’ is up to a designer of communication system 100 and should be a length appropriate for a level of granularity desired by the designer of communication system 100 for the phase shift introduced by phase shifter 210 .
- code word ‘ ⁇ ’ is eight (8) bits; however one of ordinary skill in the art realizes that ‘ ⁇ ’ may be any length.
- a length of each code word 430 read out of S/P buffer 426 , or produced by multiplier 434 may be of a length appropriate for code word ‘ ⁇ .’
- code word generator 212 may not include truncation function 438 as the code word may not need to be truncated to produce code word ‘ ⁇ .’
- Logic flow diagram 500 then ends ( 520 ).
- Phase shifter 210 then uses the code word ‘ ⁇ ’ to apply a phase shift to the symbol received by the phase shifter from symbol mapper 208 .
- FIGS. 6 and 7 an operation of a phase shifter 600 , such as phase shifter 210 , or when phase shifter 210 comprises multiple phase shifters PS 1 -PS N , each phase shifter of the multiple phase shifters PS 1 -PS N , is illustrated in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of phase shifter 600 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 7 is a logic flow diagram 700 illustrating a method executed by phase shifter 600 to implement a phase shift in the symbol received by the phase shifter in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- Logic flow diagram 700 begins ( 702 ) when phase shifter 600 receives ( 704 ) a code word ‘ ⁇ ’ from code word generator 212 .
- Phase shifter 600 routes the received code word to a sine and cosine function generator 602 .
- sine and cosine function generator 602 Based on the received code word, sine and cosine function generator 602 generates ( 706 ) a first value corresponding to a sine function ‘sin ⁇ ’ and a second value corresponding to a cosine function ‘cos ⁇ ,’ wherein ‘ ⁇ ’ is an angle corresponding to the code word ‘ ⁇ ’ received from code word generator 212 .
- ⁇ is an ‘n’ bit code word
- ⁇ C ⁇ (360°/2 n ), wherein C corresponds to the value represented by the code word ‘ ⁇ .’
- ⁇ is an eight (8) bit code word.
- This code word corresponds to a value of 137, and ⁇ is then equal to ‘137 ⁇ (360°/256),’ or approximately 192°.
- Sine and cosine function generator 602 then generates a first value corresponding to a sine of 192° and generates a second value corresponding to a cosine of 192°.
- sine and cosine function generator 602 generates the values corresponding to ‘sin ⁇ ’ and ‘cos ⁇ ’ by reference to a lookup table maintained by at least one memory device 240 .
- Sine and cosine function generator 602 then routes the first and second values, that is, ‘sin ⁇ ’ and ‘cos ⁇ ,’ to a quadrature encryptor 604 .
- Quadrature encryptor 604 receives the first and second values, that is, ‘sin ⁇ ’ and ‘cos ⁇ ,’ from sine and cosine function generator 602 . Quadrature encryptor 604 further receives ( 708 ) a symbol (I in ,Q in ) produced by symbol mapper 208 . Quadrature encryptor 604 then shifts ( 710 ) a phase of the symbol based on the ‘sin ⁇ ’ and ‘cos ⁇ ’ received from sine and cosine function generator 602 to produce an encrypted, phase shifted symbol (I out ,Q out ).
- the phase shifted symbol (I out ,Q out ) is then conveyed by phase shifter 600 to an orthogonal modulator, such as orthogonal modulator 214 , or to a transformer, such as transformer 218 , whichever is appropriate, and logic flow diagram 700 then ends ( 712 ).
- Logic flow 800 begins ( 802 ) when a signal received via an antenna 252 is routed to a receiver section 260 , where a low noise amplifier (LNA) 262 amplifies ( 804 ) the received signal. LNA 262 then routes the amplified signal to a demodulator 264 that downconverts ( 806 ) the amplified signal from a transmit frequency to a baseband frequency. The baseband signal is then conveyed to the receive side signal processing unit 270 .
- LNA low noise amplifier
- Signal processing unit 270 routes the baseband signal to a cyclic prefix (C/P) remover 272 that removes ( 808 ) a cyclic prefix that had been appended to the signal.
- C/P remover 272 conveys the cyclic prefix-less signal to orthogonal demodulator 274 .
- signal processing unit 270 may route the baseband signal directly to orthogonal demodulator 274 .
- Orthogonal demodulator 274 performs an inverse function to the function performed by orthogonal modulator 214 .
- orthogonal demodulator 274 comprises an S/P converter 276 coupled to an inverse transformer 278 , which inverse transformer is further coupled to a P/S converter 280 .
- orthogonal demodulator 274 routes the cyclic prefix-less signal to S/P converter 276 .
- S/P converter 276 converts ( 810 ) the downconverted, prefix-less signal from a serial to a parallel form, outputting N parallel modulated subcarriers.
- the N parallel modulated subcarriers are conveyed to inverse transformer 278 , such as a discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or a fast Fourier Transform (FFT), that transforms ( 812 ) each subcarrier of the N parallel modulated subcarriers from a time domain to a frequency domain based upon a corresponding orthogonal function of the N orthogonal functions used in transformer 218 . That is, inverse transformer 278 transforms each encrypted symbol to a frequency domain sub-band, or subcarrier, associated with the symbol's time domain subcarrier to produce multiple encrypted symbols.
- the output of inverse transformer 278 includes ‘N’ parallel encrypted symbols based on the ‘N’ modulated subcarriers, wherein each symbol of the ‘N’ parallel encrypted symbols is drawn from the ‘M’ possible symbols of the constellation used on the transmit side 202 .
- Transformer 278 conveys the ‘N’ parallel encrypted symbols to a P/S converter 280 .
- P/S converter 280 converts ( 814 ) the ‘N’ parallel encrypted symbols from a parallel form to a serial form to produce a stream of encrypted symbols and conveys the symbol stream to a phase shifter 282 .
- Phase shifter 282 decrypts ( 818 ) each encrypted symbol in the symbol stream by shifting a phase of the encrypted symbol in compensation for the phase shift added to the symbol by phase shifter 210 , thereby producing multiple decrypted symbols.
- Phase shifter 282 then conveys each decrypted symbol to an inverse symbol mapper 286 .
- the transmitted data includes multiple data-types, such as user data, pilot data, and synchronization data
- the user data is encrypted by a transmit side phase shifter
- only the symbols associated with the user data are conveyed by orthogonal demodulator to phase shifter 282 .
- Phase shifter 282 decrypts each encrypted symbol, that is, the symbols associated with the user data, by shifting a phase of the encrypted symbol in compensation for the phase shift added to the symbol by phase shifter 210 to produce a stream of decrypted symbols that is conveyed to inverse symbol mapper 286 .
- the symbols associated with the non-user data-types are not encrypted by the transmit side and therefore are in a non-encrypted format, that is, comprise a stream of non-encrypted symbols, when output by P/S converter 280 .
- the non-encrypted symbols may then be used for synchronization and pilot interpolation purposes, whichever is appropriate, and may be discarded without being conveyed to inverse symbol mapper 286 .
- Phase shifter 282 implements the phase shift of each encrypted symbol based on a same code word as the code word used to determine a phase shift in phase shifter 210 , which code word is generated by a code word generator 284 coupled to phase shifter 282 .
- phase shifter 282 may subtract, from the phase of the symbol, a phase equivalent to the phase shift added to the symbol by phase shifter 210 .
- phase shifter 282 may add a phase to the symbol that will complete a 360° rotation of the symbol around the complex plane, that is, may apply a phase shift approximately equal to ‘360°- ⁇ ’. For example, if phase shifter 210 applied a 192° phase shift to the symbol, then phase shifter 282 may apply a phase shift of approximately ‘360°-192°,’ or 168°, to the symbol.
- Code word generator 284 outputs code words that are synchronized with the code words output by code word generator 212 .
- signal processing unit 274 initializes code word generator 284 by inputting the session key, or a string of bits derived from the session key, and/or the mobile serial number, or a string of bits derived from the mobile serial number, into the code word generator.
- each time receiving communication device 270 receives a new frame signal processing unit 274 re-initializes code word generator 284 so that the first, in time, symbols decrypted from the new frame are decrypted based on the re-initialized code word generator.
- phase shifter 282 may comprise a phase shifter module that is interposed between inverse transformer 278 and P/S converter 280 instead of succeeding the P/S converter.
- phase shifter 282 similar to phase shifter 210 , may comprise multiple phase shifters, PS 1 -PS N , wherein each phase shifter of the multiple phase shifters is associated with, and receives from inverse transformer 278 , an encrypted symbol of the multiple (‘N’) parallel symbols output by the inverse transformer.
- Each phase shifter of the multiple phase shifters PS 1 -PS N is further associated with a corresponding one of the multiple (‘N’) subcarriers.
- each phase shifter PS 1 -PS N receives a code word ‘ ⁇ ’ produced by code word generator 284 that is different from the code word provided to the other phase shifters PS 1 -PS N .
- each phase shifter PS 1 -PS N decrypts the symbol by shifting a phase of the symbol based on the code word to produce a decrypted symbol.
- Each phase shifter PS 1 -PS N then applies the decrypted symbol to P/S converter 280 for conversion from a parallel form to a serial form.
- the transmitted data includes multiple data-types, such as user data, pilot data, and synchronization data
- only the encrypted symbols that is, the symbols associated with the user data and which symbols are phase shifted by the transmit side
- the non-encrypted symbols that is, the symbols that are associated with the one or more other data-types, for example, the pilot data and the synchronization data, and which symbols are not phase shifted by the transmit side, are conveyed directly by inverse transformer 278 to P/S converter 280 .
- S/P converter 276 assigns the downconverted signal to multiple time domain subcarriers, wherein one or more time domain subcarriers of the multiple time domain subcarriers are associated with the user data and one or more time domain subcarriers of the multiple time domain subcarriers are associated with the pilot data.
- Inverse transformer 278 then transforms each time domain subcarrier associated with user data to a frequency domain subcarrier to produce multiple encrypted symbols and further transforms each time domain subcarrier associated with non-user data to a frequency domain subcarrier to produce multiple non-encrypted symbols.
- Inverse transformer 278 then conveys the encrypted symbols to phase shifter module 282 , and more particularly to phase shifters PS 1 -PS N , and conveys the non-encrypted symbols to P/S converter 280 .
- Each phase shifter PS 1 -PS N decrypts a received encrypted symbol by shifting a phase of the symbol based on a code word to produce a decrypted symbol and conveys the decrypted symbol to P/S converter 280 .
- P/S converter 280 then converts the decrypted symbols received from phase shifter module 282 and the non-encrypted symbols received from inverse transformer 278 from a parallel format to a serial format.
- orthogonal demodulator 274 may comprise at least one despreader instead of an S/P converter, inverse transformer, and P/S converter.
- the at least one despreader despreads ( 816 ) a received, encrypted symbol by applying an orthogonal spreading code, that is, a CDMA subcarrier, corresponding to the orthogonal spreading code used by orthogonal modulator 214 , to demodulate the received signal and to produce a stream of demodulated, that is, despread, encrypted symbols.
- orthogonal demodulator 274 may comprise multiple serial despreaders, wherein one despreader of the multiple despreaders despreads each symbol with a long code and another despreader of the multiple despreaders spreads the symbol with a Walsh code or an OVSF.
- signal processing unit 274 may or may not include C/P remover 272 .
- orthogonal demodulator 274 then conveys each despread, encrypted symbol to phase shifter 282 . As described in detail above, phase shifter 282 then decrypts ( 818 ) each despread, encrypted symbol by shifting a phase of the symbol in compensation for the phase shift added to the symbol by phase shifter 210 , thereby producing multiple decrypted symbols.
- Inverse symbol mapper 286 produces a bit stream by recovering ( 820 ) the P-tuple corresponding to each decrypted symbol based on the symbol mapping scheme used by symbol mapper 208 . That is, inverse symbol mapper 286 maps each symbol to a corresponding point in the constellation used by symbol mapper 208 , thereby recovering the P-tuple corresponding to that point. Inverse symbol mapper 286 then conveys the recovered bit stream to a decoder 288 . Decoder 288 decodes ( 822 ) the bit stream based on the error correction code applied by encoder 206 and conveys the decoded bit stream to a data sink (not shown), and logic flow 800 then ends ( 824 ).
- communication system 100 By shifting a phase of a symbol that is to be transmitted based on information known to the transmitting and receiving communication devices, communication system 100 provides encryption at a physical layer that makes an air interface more secure against decryption by an undesired interceptor of a communication.
- a symbol mapper included in a transmitting communication device produces multiple symbols based on a received bit stream and a symbol mapping scheme.
- a phase shifter included in the transmitting communication device then shifts a phase of each symbol based on a code word to produce an encrypted symbol, which code word may be generated by a code word generator based on one or more encryption keys known to both the transmitting and receiving communication devices.
- the encrypted symbols are then transmitted via the air interface.
- the receiving communication device decrypts received, encrypted symbols by shifting each received, encrypted symbol by a phase corresponding to the phase used to encrypt the symbol, thereby producing a decrypted symbol.
- An inverse symbol mapper then recovers the bits corresponding to each decrypted symbol based on the symbol mapping scheme used by the transmitting device symbol mapper.
