Definitions
- This document relates to presenting content.
- Providing relevant advertising content to users is generally important to advertisers and service providers. However, implementing a cost-effective way of providing such relevant advertising content can prove difficult in an ever-changing online market. Further, while relevant information for targeting a particular user may be known by one entity, others may not readily have access to or be able to use such information when, for example, making targeting decisions.
- a computer-implemented method comprises receiving a request for content from a user, determining a user list associated with the user, the user list including a definition that characterizes members of the user list, determining additional data related to a context associated with the user, and providing user list definition data and the additional data along with the request to a consumer that has subscribed to the user list.
- the request is a request for an ad to be displayed to the user and where the consumer is an advertiser that is to provide customized content to the user.
- the user list comprises the definition and one or more members each identified by user-specific data.
- the user list is stored in a table of user lists and where the user specific data identifies the user.
- the user specific data is a global identifier associated with the user in an advertising serving system.
- Determining additional data includes retrieving data based on information associated with the user.
- Retrieving data includes retrieving data based on a location of the user.
- Retrieving data includes retrieving data from a third party.
- Retrieving data includes determining additional information about the user and retrieving additional data based on the additional information.
- the additional information is location information.
- the additional data is weather information in a location associated with the user.
- the additional information relates to an ownership of a particular type of account including certain assets and where the additional data is change data of a value or holding in the account.
- the context relates to a current condition associated with an environment in which the user is operating.
- Providing the additional data and the user list definition data includes providing data to subscribers to the user list for use in targeting content to the user. Targeting includes adjusting bids in real time. Targeting includes customizing content to be presented to the user.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an example system for providing and using shared data.
- FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of example user lists.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for joining user list definition data with additional data in response to receiving a request for content from a user.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram of an example sequence of operations that are centered around an ad server that uses user list information joined with external data to serve an ad with customized content.
- FIG. 5 shows an example of a computer device and a mobile computer device that can be used to implement the techniques described here.
- Advertisers, publishers, and service providers generally may wish to exchange data for purposes of implementing a meaningful way of providing information and/or services (e.g., advertising content) to online users. If specific content is determined to be meaningful to a particular user, then the user may wish to access the content, purchase the content, or otherwise interact with the content. This interaction can provide revenue to the content provider (e.g., advertiser, publisher or service provider). If a particular content provider (e.g., advertiser, publisher, or service provider) can collect data about how specific content may or may not be meaningful to users (i.e., in the form of a user list), the collected data may be used by others in a variety of ways. One use relates to selecting targeted content.
- information and/or services e.g., advertising content
- User lists can represent specific user information pertaining to predefined categories.
- the categories can be defined by the data owners.
- a user list may include data about one or more users which characterizes the users to a category (e.g., homeowner, craftsman, DVD renter, etc.) to allow targeting of the users by, for example, publishers or advertisers.
- the user lists can be used to target relevant advertising content.
- User lists can be generated and exchanged according to a number of rules, and those rules can be used to market particular user lists to specific consumers.
- the rules can employ methods of assigning users to particular user lists.
- Such rules can provide a logical categorization of data, information, or services for the purposes of determining which data content in the user lists is particularly relevant to a number of users.
- Methods are described for associating user specific information with one or more user lists that are owned or maintained by a data owner.
- An association between the user-specific data and the user lists is made.
- the association can be exploited, for example, for real-time bidding in response to requests for content or to customize content to be provided to a specific user.
- Other uses of the user list information and associations are possible.
- user lists can be coupled with other data to discern a “context” of the user to which content is to be served.
- Context include the weather in the user's area (hot/cold, clear/raining/snowing, etc.), user stock portfolio conditions (e.g., up/down), etc.
- Content that is provided in context may provide more timely and useful information to the users.
- context information can be useful when selecting, customizing, or bidding on ads.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a system 100 for providing and using shared data.
- the shared data can, for example, include user lists detailing a number of predefined categories pertaining to specific users.
- the categories can be defined by or relate to user information including, but not limited to, browser history, user selections, cookie information, user-provided preferences, purchase histories, web search data, or other data (i.e., where the user has provided permission for the storing and/or collecting of such data).
- a user list is owned by a data provider that gathered the information in a respective user list.
- the user lists can be shared with other entities, such as for example using a data exchange.
- the user lists can be shared amongst advertisers, third-party service providers, or third-party advertisers, data aggregators, and other online users.
- the user lists can be provided to the data exchange and maintained by the data exchange and/or by the data owners. User lists can be updated as appropriate to either refine the category/categories associated therewith or the users that are members of a given list. Management of user lists is described in greater detail below.
- the system 100 includes a data exchange engine 102 for providing an interface for advertisers and other consumers to discover and/or license user lists 104 .
- the data exchange engine 102 can be configurable to maintain, update, present, license, sell or otherwise manage one or more user lists based on owned or permissioned data.
- the generated user lists can include user-specific associations characterizing specific online user behavior.
- the associations can be used, for example, to provide personalized content from an advertising server 106 , a third-party server 108 , or other content provider.
- the data exchange engine 102 as described here may parallel the functionality of an online advertisement exchange system for active targeted online advertisers, for example.
- the data exchange engine 102 can create an exchange between owners of permissioned data and consumers of such data. Consumers of the permissioned data can include advertisers that seek to target particular categories of users.
- the data exchange engine 102 provides a mechanism for a provider of advertising placement services in targeted online advertising to make available additional third-party data sources to buyers of advertising space.
- the data exchange engine 102 can provide user lists to publishers, syndicates, and other data providers for various purposes, including the targeting of advertising content to users.
- the data exchange engine 102 can provide an interface for data owners to securely view and manage their own data (i.e., manage a user list). For example, a data owner can generate and store information in a user list by entering data both manually and automatically. Other entities may be permitted to enter/maintain information in a user list. Publishers can also extract data for direct sales models or other marketing plans. Although computer hardware is not depicted in the data exchange engine 102 , processors, memory, and other processing components may be included.
- the advertising server 106 can provide advertising content to any number of browsers 110 via the data exchange engine 102 or directly.
- the advertising server 106 can be configurable for receiving advertising content requests and providing advertising content to requesting users.
- the advertising server 106 can select advertisements targeted based on one or more criteria and in view of data that is included in one or more user lists.
- the advertising server 106 can also provide access to other storage elements, such as ad repositories, in the example shown as ad repository 112 .
- the ad repository 112 can be used to store advertising content associated with particular keywords, bidding criteria, advertisers, and targeting criteria.
- Data storage elements may include any one or combination of methods for storing data, including without limitation, arrays, hash tables, lists, and pairs.
- the advertising server 106 can access other similar types of data storage devices, such as user lists 104 , for example. While reference is made to providing advertisements, the advertising server 106 can provide other forms of content.
- advertisers can work with data providers to purchase or license user lists for purposes of targeting certain categories (e.g., demographic categories, interest categories, preference categories).
- the user lists can be analyzed for quality and other considerations.
- the advertisers can use the user lists for determining targeting criteria or to modify current bids, for example.
- an advertiser can subscribe for a period of time to a user list.
- the user list itself may be defined as being associated with a certain category (e.g., Internet shoppers interested in buying a sports car) of users.
- Requests for advertisements can be received by the advertising system, and the data exchange can be used to determine for a given user to which user lists the user is subscribed.
- the advertisers that have subscribed to the user lists may be presented with the request (and necessarily information that the users satisfy the category(ies) associated with the user list(s)), and then may adjust/submit bids in consideration of such information. This is just one example of a use for the user list data.
- the third-party servers 108 can provide third-party services to any number of browsers 110 via the data exchange engine 102 .
- the third-party servers 108 can provide web services, advertising services, or external APIs (application programming interfaces) to connect to a third-party server.
- the third-party servers 108 can include, for example, one or more servers executing a search engine application program.
- the third-party servers 108 can include a related information server or an advertising server.
- Third-party servers 108 can track user activity using cookies 114 .
- the browser 110 represents a user browsing the Internet.
- the browser 110 can access any website available on a network belonging to a person, or any other type of entity such as a company, enterprise, etc.
- FIG. 1 browser 110 can access a service or website.
- the service or website can be hosted by the third-party server 108 , or alternatively by another server associated with system 100 .
- a user can employ the browser 110 to search the Internet for services, information, or merchandise.
- the browser 110 can track user activity using, for example, cookies 116 .
- the advertising server 106 includes one or more advertisement customizers (not shown) operable to customize advertising content according to one or more user lists.
- an advertisement customizer can customize the display criteria, language, or other content of an advertisement according to user list information. For example, if a particular user list includes user-entered searching pertaining to purchasing a vehicle, the advertising server 106 can use the user-entered searching information (e.g., a cookie stored from performing a web search in a browser) to customize the display or content of an advertisement. The customization can, for example, provide the user with a more relevant advertisement.
- the system 100 can store, for example in a table-based repository, a list of user lists for which a particular user belongs.
- the table-based repository can, for example, be represented by a proprietary distributed storage system having a multi-dimensional sorted map as described in the paper entitled “Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data” by Fay Chang, Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Wilson C. Hsieh, Deborah A. Wallach, Mike Burrows, Tushar Chandra, Andrew Fikes, and Robert E. Gruber, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- the table-based repository represents a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size (e.g., petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers).
- Each user list in the proprietary database can be included in one or more tables having multiple dimensions (one of which may be a field for time, allowing for versioning and garbage collection).
- the system 100 can provide an index to the table-based repository.
- the index can be represented by, for example, a user cookie.
- the table-based repository may be a set of rows and columns where the rows represent cookies corresponding to particular users and the columns represent a characterization associated with the user list, such as particular categories, keywords, websites, or other descriptive data.
- the user browser 110 can make a request for advertising content from the advertising server 106 or the third-party server 108 .
- the data exchange engine 102 can retrieve a list of user lists from the table-based repository associated with a received request from a given user and provide the request to identified consumers of the user lists. Any subsequent processing of the request can use the list, for example, for targeting, advertising customization and bid generation.
- the list of user lists or portions of the list can also be transmitted to a real-time bidder to provide the bidder with pertinent information about one or more users. Other uses are possible.
- FIG. 2 is an example showing a schematic diagram of user lists 104 stored in a table 200 .
- one or more entities e.g., a web publishing entity that collected the user data
- the user lists 104 in the table 200 are all provided by a same entity.
- the user lists 104 in the table 200 can include user lists owned/associated with different entities.
- users create their own user lists and provide the lists to the data exchange engine 102 . For example, users can format content in user lists according to personal preferences and offer the user list data to the data exchange engine 102 for publication, management and use in targeting content to users.
- the data in the user lists 104 is developed, for example based at least in part on user-provided, searching and browser data.
- the data exchange engine 102 can manage the user lists 104 which details users 212 A-E.
- the table 200 can be indexed by a user identifier, such as the users 212 column.
- each row represents a single user.
- a user identifier (not shown) can be used to identify a user.
- the user identifier can be a user identifier associated with a user in a domain associated with the entity that owns/provides the data (i.e., a local identifier).
- the user identifier can be of the form of a global identifier associated with the user, such as an identifier that the advertising system assigns to the user.
- Global identifiers can be associated with “local” entity identifiers and mapped such that requests that include a local entity identifier can be associated with the global identifier and hence, can be associated with user lists associated with plural entities. As a user can be associated with multiple user lists owned by different data owners, global identifiers can help to tie together those user lists for that user.
- each column represents a user list that includes a characterization (sometimes referred to as a definition), such as by way of a particular category(ies), keyword(s), website(s), demographic(s), interest(s), or other user classification.
- Example characterizations in the table 200 include sports cars, washing machines, and scuba diving.
- the characterization can include descriptors, such as keywords, that describe a given category.
- Each characterization may embody the combination of plural separate categories or subject matter.
- the characterization sports cars may embody those individuals that visited a web site that were interested in cars and those that were particularly interested in sports cars (which themselves represent two different categories).
- logical combinations of categories or subject matter can be used to define the characterization for a given user list.
- Columns 214 - 218 of the table 200 each can identify, at least at a high level, a different characterization associated with a different user list.
- the column 214 identifies users characterized by “Category A Sports Cars.”
- Other example characterizations and associated user lists are represented by column 216 (i.e., “Category B Washing Machines”) and column 218 (i.e., “Category C Scuba Diving”) to name a few examples.
- the table 200 can represent hundreds or thousands of characterizations and associated user lists.
- each entry in the table 200 (i.e., the intersection of a row and a column) represents whether the user is a member of a given user list. For example, entry 210 indicates that user A is interested in or associated with a user list that has the characterization of sports cars, and entry 211 indicates that user Don is interested in or associated with a user list that has the characterization of washing machines. In some implementations, other data may be included in the entry.
- Other data can include geo-location data, cookie data, further personal data related to the user and known by the data owner, example web pages or example content (e.g., content surfed by the user), keyword searches, location data, website data, side vertical data, page vertical data, formatted text strings (where the data owner may include data related to the particular user in accordance with a definition set by the data owner (e.g., a series of bits that are set or not depending on the individual user's data for things like demographics, other interests, or other data that is different from the characterization but may be of use in targeting information to the particular user)) or other data.
- a definition set by the data owner e.g., a series of bits that are set or not depending on the individual user's data for things like demographics, other interests, or other data that is different from the characterization but may be of use in targeting information to the particular user
- entry 220 includes an indication that user C is not only a member of the user list associated with category C (scuba diving) but also that the user is located at a particular location (e.g., lives in Portland) and is a member of certain demographic groups (e.g. is male).
- Identification of user lists to which a person belongs can be made by the data exchange engine 102 when a cookie or other user identifiable information is received.
- the data exchange engine 102 uses the cookie or user identifying information as an index to the user lists 104 .
- the data exchange engine 102 can cross reference received user identifier data with particular user list information to determine an association between user list data and the cookie data/user information.
- a user (A) showed an interest in user list A which is characterized by the keywords “sports cars”.
- the user may, as part of a session with a given data provider, have provided a request to view sports cars made by Lexus such as providing a keyword search for “Lexus sports cars.”
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for joining user list definition data with additional data in response to receiving a request for content from a user.
- the process 300 may be executed, for example, by the data exchange engine 102 shown in FIG. 1 in order to join a user list with external data to provide customized content in an ad. More or fewer participants may be involved.
- a request for content is received from a user.
- the request for content can be a request to serve an ad, for example, that the data exchange engine 102 receives as a result of a user (e.g., Don) who is browsing the Internet.
- Don's browser may initially display search results that have been received in Don's browser in response to his search query, such as a query for area appliance stores (e.g., keywords “major appliances”).
- Don may formulate the query to search for a replacement washing machine, for example, and may even include “washing machines” in the query.
- the search results may contain several entries for area appliance stores, and Don may select (e.g., click on) one of the search results entries.
- one entry can be for Gary's Appliances Store, and the entry can include the name of the store, an address and phone number, a map and driving instructions, a snippet that describes the store, a clickable link to a corresponding webpage, and so on.
- Don's browser can attempt to navigate to the webpage (e.g., www.garysappliances.com) that corresponds to the search result.
- the webpage www.garysappliances.com can be designed to include or embed one or more ads, each of which being an available impression that can be served, for example, by the ad server 106 .
- the request for content received from the user Don is a request to serve an ad on www.garysappliances.com.
- This request can, for example, be received and processed by the data exchange engine 102 and/or other engines (e.g., by an advertising server engine).
- a user list associated with the user is determined, including a definition that characterizes members of the user list.
- the data exchange engine 102 can look up user lists 104 in the table 200 that are associated with Don.
- the look-up can employ user-specific data, such as the user's user identifier (e.g., “Don” or some other identifier as described above), as an index to the row of interest in the table 200 .
- information from, for example, a cookie on the user's computer (or information from the user's search query) can be used to associate the Category B Washing Machines user list with the user Don, an association depicted in FIG.
- the data exchange engine 102 can make the association using the definition for Category B Washing Machines that characterizes members in the user list.
- the Category B Washing Machines user list is the user list that is determined, but other user lists, such as user lists associated with appliances in general, may be determined in addition or instead.
- multiple user lists can be determined, and the data exchange engine 102 can select the user list that is likely to be the best match or forward all matching information on to subscribers to the respective user lists.
- determining the additional data related to a context can begin by (or include) examining information from one or more cookies on a user's (e.g., Don's) computer.
- a user's e.g., Don's
- at least one cookie may contain the IP address associated with Don's computer.
- the data exchange engine 102 can use the IP address to pinpoint Don's geographic location, such as a small town in the Midwest. The data exchange engine 102 can also use this geo-location information to access the current weather for Don's area, such as from a third-party weather information server.
- the third-party weather information server may indicate that Don's small town is in the middle of a heat wave and the current temperature is in the 90's.
- the additional data related to a context associated with the user includes the current weather and recent conditions.
- the weather in this case, is just one example of a current condition associated with the user's environment, but other examples can include other relevant local or current data such as concerts or other upcoming area events, recent local news stories, area road construction or other projects, and so on.
- the additional data that is determined can be another user list. For example, if user's current weather conditions include a hot temperature, stage 306 can determine a user list such as “Users with Hot Weather” which can include users in regions where hot weather is observed.
- user list definition data and the additional data are provided along with the request to a consumer that has subscribed to the user list.
- the data exchange engine 102 can provide the Washing Machines user list definition, the current weather conditions, and the ad request to a consumer (e.g., the particular ad server 106 that can serve the ad to www.garysappliances.com).
- the combination of information in this way essentially serves to “join” the user list with the external data.
- the ad server 106 that is selected by the data exchange engine 102 to receive the ad request and joined information can be a consumer (e.g., one of several ad servers 106 ) that has subscribed to the Washing Machines user list.
- the other user list can be included with the user list definition and ad request that are provided to the consumer
- the ad server 106 can create an ad having customized content based on the information. For example, in addition to including information in the ad that is related to various washing machines in which Don may be interested, the ad server 106 can provide details of a current sale or promotion on air conditioners. The selection of air conditioners is just one example customization that can occur based on the weather conditions where Don lives. Other ad customization can include products or services that may appeal to Don in light of the weather conditions. Furthermore, by knowing that Don's small Midwest town is in the middle of a heat wave, the ad server 106 can promote particular models of washing machines that operate efficiently or have “cool house” technology (e.g., they avoid heating the surrounding area).
- a customized ad that can be served to Don may include information for a local Asian food restaurant that delivers and (on Don's hot day of weather) offers a discount on cold beverages that can be added to the meal.
- the example that was just described uses Dan's current weather conditions and time-of-day as the additional data related to a context associated with the user, but still other contexts can also be used for targeting ads.
- a combination of information from other sources such as cookies on Don's computer or information obtained from third-party sources may be used to determine context.
- information may be available that indicates that Don's current stock portfolio is on a downward trend.
- An ad server 106 can use this information to generate other customized ads for Don, such as ads for financial planners in Don's general area that are displayed, for example, when Don visits investment-related websites.
- Another example of customized content can include the situation in which up-to-the-minute, daytime information is available, such as a promotion at a nearby department or discount store.
- local copies can be maintained for data that is obtained from external sources, such as at stage 306 .
- the data exchange engine 102 can maintain local copies of external data in one or more tables.
- the data exchange engine 102 can query external data sources on a regular or scheduled basis, e.g., every one or two hours.
- One example type of data that can be obtained every few hours is the set of weather conditions (e.g., temperature, precipitation, etc.) that can be obtained from national weather service websites or other meteorological sources.
- the information can include forecasts for all US ZIP codes, and can be stored locally in files (or RDBMS tables, etc.) and overwritten as more current information is available and obtained.
- This type of information can be indexed in various ways, such as by state, city, county, latitude/longitude, ZIP code, or other ways. Similar weather-related information can be obtained and stored on a regular basis for non-domestic areas, including Canada, Mexico, North America, and countries or areas on other continents. In some implementations, the schedules by which a certain area's data is updated on a regular basis can depend on the population of the area and/or the number of potential computers to which ads may be served.
- context information can include information that is known ahead of time. Examples include holidays, elections, and schedules (e.g., for schools, cities, etc.). This type of information, for example, can be combined with information from a user's cookie to create context-based ads for such promotions as “Back-to-School” sales, holiday or Spring Break rates on products and services (e.g., that match the user's memberships in particular user lists), and so on.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram of an example sequence of operations 400 that are centered around an ad server 106 that uses user list information joined with external data to serve an ad with customized content.
- a request for an ad can occur.
- the request can be similar to the request received at stage 302 of the process 300 , such as a request for an ad related to washing machines or other major appliances that can occur when the user navigates to a webpage that hosts such ads.
- step 2 data in the cookie store 402 can be looked up, such as the user's (e.g., Don's) IP address.
- step 3 information from the cookie can be used to obtain additional information, such as information from third-party servers 108 or other external data sources.
- the additional information can include current weather conditions in Don's Midwest town.

Abstract
A computer-implemented method comprises receiving a request for content from a user, determining a user list associated with the user, the user list including a definition that characterizes members of the user list, determining additional data related to a context associated with the user, and providing user list definition data and the additional data along with the request to a consumer that has subscribed to the user list.
Description
- This patent application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/379,289, filed Sep. 1, 2010 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/379,384, filed Sep. 1, 2010. The content of both U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/379,289 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/379,384 is hereby incorporated by reference into this application as if set forth herein in full.
- This document relates to presenting content.
- Providing relevant advertising content to users is generally important to advertisers and service providers. However, implementing a cost-effective way of providing such relevant advertising content can prove difficult in an ever-changing online market. Further, while relevant information for targeting a particular user may be known by one entity, others may not readily have access to or be able to use such information when, for example, making targeting decisions.
- This document discusses systems and techniques by which user lists are joined with external data.
- In one aspect, a computer-implemented method comprises receiving a request for content from a user, determining a user list associated with the user, the user list including a definition that characterizes members of the user list, determining additional data related to a context associated with the user, and providing user list definition data and the additional data along with the request to a consumer that has subscribed to the user list.
- Implementations can include any, all, or none of the following features. The request is a request for an ad to be displayed to the user and where the consumer is an advertiser that is to provide customized content to the user. The user list comprises the definition and one or more members each identified by user-specific data. The user list is stored in a table of user lists and where the user specific data identifies the user. The user specific data is a global identifier associated with the user in an advertising serving system. Determining additional data includes retrieving data based on information associated with the user. Retrieving data includes retrieving data based on a location of the user. Retrieving data includes retrieving data from a third party. Retrieving data includes determining additional information about the user and retrieving additional data based on the additional information. The additional information is location information. The additional data is weather information in a location associated with the user. The additional information relates to an ownership of a particular type of account including certain assets and where the additional data is change data of a value or holding in the account. The context relates to a current condition associated with an environment in which the user is operating. Providing the additional data and the user list definition data includes providing data to subscribers to the user list for use in targeting content to the user. Targeting includes adjusting bids in real time. Targeting includes customizing content to be presented to the user.
- The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

- Advertisers, publishers, and service providers generally may wish to exchange data for purposes of implementing a meaningful way of providing information and/or services (e.g., advertising content) to online users. If specific content is determined to be meaningful to a particular user, then the user may wish to access the content, purchase the content, or otherwise interact with the content. This interaction can provide revenue to the content provider (e.g., advertiser, publisher or service provider). If a particular content provider (e.g., advertiser, publisher, or service provider) can collect data about how specific content may or may not be meaningful to users (i.e., in the form of a user list), the collected data may be used by others in a variety of ways. One use relates to selecting targeted content. Other uses are possible, such as in adjusting bids in an auction based, for example, on user lists that indicate specific content is of interest to one or more users. User lists can be published, sold, licensed or otherwise accessed to assist in providing personalized content to the specific users and increasing revenue for a content provider.
- User lists can represent specific user information pertaining to predefined categories. The categories can be defined by the data owners. For example, a user list may include data about one or more users which characterizes the users to a category (e.g., homeowner, craftsman, DVD renter, etc.) to allow targeting of the users by, for example, publishers or advertisers. In some implementations, the user lists can be used to target relevant advertising content.
- User lists can be generated and exchanged according to a number of rules, and those rules can be used to market particular user lists to specific consumers. The rules can employ methods of assigning users to particular user lists. Such rules can provide a logical categorization of data, information, or services for the purposes of determining which data content in the user lists is particularly relevant to a number of users.
- Methods are described for associating user specific information with one or more user lists that are owned or maintained by a data owner. An association between the user-specific data and the user lists is made. The association can be exploited, for example, for real-time bidding in response to requests for content or to customize content to be provided to a specific user. Other uses of the user list information and associations are possible.
- In some implementations, user lists can be coupled with other data to discern a “context” of the user to which content is to be served. Examples of “context” include the weather in the user's area (hot/cold, clear/raining/snowing, etc.), user stock portfolio conditions (e.g., up/down), etc. Content that is provided in context may provide more timely and useful information to the users. Moreover, context information can be useful when selecting, customizing, or bidding on ads.

FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of asystem 100 for providing and using shared data. The shared data can, for example, include user lists detailing a number of predefined categories pertaining to specific users. The categories can be defined by or relate to user information including, but not limited to, browser history, user selections, cookie information, user-provided preferences, purchase histories, web search data, or other data (i.e., where the user has provided permission for the storing and/or collecting of such data). In some implementations, a user list is owned by a data provider that gathered the information in a respective user list. In some implementations, the user lists can be shared with other entities, such as for example using a data exchange. For example, the user lists can be shared amongst advertisers, third-party service providers, or third-party advertisers, data aggregators, and other online users. - The user lists can be provided to the data exchange and maintained by the data exchange and/or by the data owners. User lists can be updated as appropriate to either refine the category/categories associated therewith or the users that are members of a given list. Management of user lists is described in greater detail below.
- The
system 100 includes adata exchange engine 102 for providing an interface for advertisers and other consumers to discover and/or license user lists 104. Thedata exchange engine 102 can be configurable to maintain, update, present, license, sell or otherwise manage one or more user lists based on owned or permissioned data. The generated user lists can include user-specific associations characterizing specific online user behavior. The associations can be used, for example, to provide personalized content from anadvertising server 106, a third-party server 108, or other content provider. Thedata exchange engine 102 as described here may parallel the functionality of an online advertisement exchange system for active targeted online advertisers, for example. - In some implementations, the
data exchange engine 102 can create an exchange between owners of permissioned data and consumers of such data. Consumers of the permissioned data can include advertisers that seek to target particular categories of users. In some implementations, thedata exchange engine 102 provides a mechanism for a provider of advertising placement services in targeted online advertising to make available additional third-party data sources to buyers of advertising space. In some implementations, thedata exchange engine 102 can provide user lists to publishers, syndicates, and other data providers for various purposes, including the targeting of advertising content to users. - The
data exchange engine 102 can provide an interface for data owners to securely view and manage their own data (i.e., manage a user list). For example, a data owner can generate and store information in a user list by entering data both manually and automatically. Other entities may be permitted to enter/maintain information in a user list. Publishers can also extract data for direct sales models or other marketing plans. Although computer hardware is not depicted in thedata exchange engine 102, processors, memory, and other processing components may be included. - The
advertising server 106 can provide advertising content to any number ofbrowsers 110 via thedata exchange engine 102 or directly. In addition, theadvertising server 106 can be configurable for receiving advertising content requests and providing advertising content to requesting users. In operation, theadvertising server 106 can select advertisements targeted based on one or more criteria and in view of data that is included in one or more user lists. Theadvertising server 106 can also provide access to other storage elements, such as ad repositories, in the example shown asad repository 112. Thead repository 112 can be used to store advertising content associated with particular keywords, bidding criteria, advertisers, and targeting criteria. Data storage elements may include any one or combination of methods for storing data, including without limitation, arrays, hash tables, lists, and pairs. Theadvertising server 106 can access other similar types of data storage devices, such as user lists 104, for example. While reference is made to providing advertisements, theadvertising server 106 can provide other forms of content. - In some implementations, advertisers can work with data providers to purchase or license user lists for purposes of targeting certain categories (e.g., demographic categories, interest categories, preference categories). The user lists can be analyzed for quality and other considerations. The advertisers can use the user lists for determining targeting criteria or to modify current bids, for example. In one example use case, an advertiser can subscribe for a period of time to a user list. The user list itself may be defined as being associated with a certain category (e.g., Internet shoppers interested in buying a sports car) of users. Requests for advertisements can be received by the advertising system, and the data exchange can be used to determine for a given user to which user lists the user is subscribed. In a real-time bid example, the advertisers that have subscribed to the user lists may be presented with the request (and necessarily information that the users satisfy the category(ies) associated with the user list(s)), and then may adjust/submit bids in consideration of such information. This is just one example of a use for the user list data.
- The third-
party servers 108 can provide third-party services to any number ofbrowsers 110 via thedata exchange engine 102. For example, the third-party servers 108 can provide web services, advertising services, or external APIs (application programming interfaces) to connect to a third-party server. The third-party servers 108 can include, for example, one or more servers executing a search engine application program. In some implementations, the third-party servers 108 can include a related information server or an advertising server. Third-party servers 108 can track useractivity using cookies 114. - The
browser 110 represents a user browsing the Internet. Thebrowser 110 can access any website available on a network belonging to a person, or any other type of entity such as a company, enterprise, etc. For example, inFIG. 1 browser 110 can access a service or website. The service or website can be hosted by the third-party server 108, or alternatively by another server associated withsystem 100. A user can employ thebrowser 110 to search the Internet for services, information, or merchandise. Thebrowser 110 can track user activity using, for example,cookies 116. - In some implementations, the
advertising server 106 includes one or more advertisement customizers (not shown) operable to customize advertising content according to one or more user lists. In particular, an advertisement customizer can customize the display criteria, language, or other content of an advertisement according to user list information. For example, if a particular user list includes user-entered searching pertaining to purchasing a vehicle, theadvertising server 106 can use the user-entered searching information (e.g., a cookie stored from performing a web search in a browser) to customize the display or content of an advertisement. The customization can, for example, provide the user with a more relevant advertisement. - In operation and for each generated user list, the
system 100 can store, for example in a table-based repository, a list of user lists for which a particular user belongs. The table-based repository can, for example, be represented by a proprietary distributed storage system having a multi-dimensional sorted map as described in the paper entitled “Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data” by Fay Chang, Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Wilson C. Hsieh, Deborah A. Wallach, Mike Burrows, Tushar Chandra, Andrew Fikes, and Robert E. Gruber, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The table-based repository represents a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size (e.g., petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers). Each user list in the proprietary database can be included in one or more tables having multiple dimensions (one of which may be a field for time, allowing for versioning and garbage collection). - The
system 100 can provide an index to the table-based repository. The index can be represented by, for example, a user cookie. For example, the table-based repository may be a set of rows and columns where the rows represent cookies corresponding to particular users and the columns represent a characterization associated with the user list, such as particular categories, keywords, websites, or other descriptive data. - At some point, the
user browser 110 can make a request for advertising content from theadvertising server 106 or the third-party server 108. Thedata exchange engine 102 can retrieve a list of user lists from the table-based repository associated with a received request from a given user and provide the request to identified consumers of the user lists. Any subsequent processing of the request can use the list, for example, for targeting, advertising customization and bid generation. The list of user lists or portions of the list can also be transmitted to a real-time bidder to provide the bidder with pertinent information about one or more users. Other uses are possible. -
FIG. 2 is an example showing a schematic diagram of user lists 104 stored in a table 200. In this example, one or more entities (e.g., a web publishing entity that collected the user data) provided the user lists 104 to thedata exchange engine 102. In some implementations, the user lists 104 in the table 200 are all provided by a same entity. In some implementations, the user lists 104 in the table 200 can include user lists owned/associated with different entities. In some implementations, users create their own user lists and provide the lists to thedata exchange engine 102. For example, users can format content in user lists according to personal preferences and offer the user list data to thedata exchange engine 102 for publication, management and use in targeting content to users. The data in the user lists 104 is developed, for example based at least in part on user-provided, searching and browser data. In this example, thedata exchange engine 102 can manage the user lists 104 which detailsusers 212 A-E. In some implementations, the table 200 can be indexed by a user identifier, such as theusers 212 column. - In the example shown, each row represents a single user. A user identifier (not shown) can be used to identify a user. The user identifier can be a user identifier associated with a user in a domain associated with the entity that owns/provides the data (i.e., a local identifier). In some implementations, such as those where plural different entities provide user lists that are stored in a single table, the user identifier can be of the form of a global identifier associated with the user, such as an identifier that the advertising system assigns to the user. Global identifiers can be associated with “local” entity identifiers and mapped such that requests that include a local entity identifier can be associated with the global identifier and hence, can be associated with user lists associated with plural entities. As a user can be associated with multiple user lists owned by different data owners, global identifiers can help to tie together those user lists for that user.
- In the example shown, each column represents a user list that includes a characterization (sometimes referred to as a definition), such as by way of a particular category(ies), keyword(s), website(s), demographic(s), interest(s), or other user classification. Example characterizations in the table 200 include sports cars, washing machines, and scuba diving. The characterization can include descriptors, such as keywords, that describe a given category. Each characterization may embody the combination of plural separate categories or subject matter. For example, the characterization sports cars, may embody those individuals that visited a web site that were interested in cars and those that were particularly interested in sports cars (which themselves represent two different categories). In some implementations, logical combinations of categories or subject matter can be used to define the characterization for a given user list.
- Columns 214-218 of the table 200 each can identify, at least at a high level, a different characterization associated with a different user list. For example, the
column 214 identifies users characterized by “Category A Sports Cars.” Other example characterizations and associated user lists are represented by column 216 (i.e., “Category B Washing Machines”) and column 218 (i.e., “Category C Scuba Diving”) to name a few examples. The table 200 can represent hundreds or thousands of characterizations and associated user lists. - In some implementations, each entry in the table 200 (i.e., the intersection of a row and a column) represents whether the user is a member of a given user list. For example,
entry 210 indicates that user A is interested in or associated with a user list that has the characterization of sports cars, andentry 211 indicates that user Don is interested in or associated with a user list that has the characterization of washing machines. In some implementations, other data may be included in the entry. Other data can include geo-location data, cookie data, further personal data related to the user and known by the data owner, example web pages or example content (e.g., content surfed by the user), keyword searches, location data, website data, side vertical data, page vertical data, formatted text strings (where the data owner may include data related to the particular user in accordance with a definition set by the data owner (e.g., a series of bits that are set or not depending on the individual user's data for things like demographics, other interests, or other data that is different from the characterization but may be of use in targeting information to the particular user)) or other data. For example,entry 220 includes an indication that user C is not only a member of the user list associated with category C (scuba diving) but also that the user is located at a particular location (e.g., lives in Portland) and is a member of certain demographic groups (e.g. is male). - Identification of user lists to which a person belongs can be made by the
data exchange engine 102 when a cookie or other user identifiable information is received. In some implementations, thedata exchange engine 102 uses the cookie or user identifying information as an index to the user lists 104. For example, thedata exchange engine 102 can cross reference received user identifier data with particular user list information to determine an association between user list data and the cookie data/user information. As shown in user lists 104, a user (A) showed an interest in user list A which is characterized by the keywords “sports cars”. For example, the user may, as part of a session with a given data provider, have provided a request to view sports cars made by Lexus such as providing a keyword search for “Lexus sports cars.” -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of anexample process 300 for joining user list definition data with additional data in response to receiving a request for content from a user. Theprocess 300 may be executed, for example, by thedata exchange engine 102 shown inFIG. 1 in order to join a user list with external data to provide customized content in an ad. More or fewer participants may be involved. - At
stage 302, a request for content is received from a user. In some implementations, the request for content can be a request to serve an ad, for example, that thedata exchange engine 102 receives as a result of a user (e.g., Don) who is browsing the Internet. Prior to the request to serve the ad, Don's browser may initially display search results that have been received in Don's browser in response to his search query, such as a query for area appliance stores (e.g., keywords “major appliances”). Don may formulate the query to search for a replacement washing machine, for example, and may even include “washing machines” in the query. The search results may contain several entries for area appliance stores, and Don may select (e.g., click on) one of the search results entries. For example, one entry can be for Gary's Appliances Store, and the entry can include the name of the store, an address and phone number, a map and driving instructions, a snippet that describes the store, a clickable link to a corresponding webpage, and so on. As a result of clicking on the search result, Don's browser can attempt to navigate to the webpage (e.g., www.garysappliances.com) that corresponds to the search result. In this example, the webpage www.garysappliances.com can be designed to include or embed one or more ads, each of which being an available impression that can be served, for example, by thead server 106. Thus, in this example, the request for content received from the user Don is a request to serve an ad on www.garysappliances.com. This request can, for example, be received and processed by thedata exchange engine 102 and/or other engines (e.g., by an advertising server engine). - At
stage 304, a user list associated with the user is determined, including a definition that characterizes members of the user list. In the current example, referring toFIG. 2 , thedata exchange engine 102 can look up user lists 104 in the table 200 that are associated with Don. The look-up can employ user-specific data, such as the user's user identifier (e.g., “Don” or some other identifier as described above), as an index to the row of interest in the table 200. Further, information from, for example, a cookie on the user's computer (or information from the user's search query) can be used to associate the Category B Washing Machines user list with the user Don, an association depicted inFIG. 2 by theentry 211 incolumn 216, signifying that Don is a member of that user list. Thedata exchange engine 102 can make the association using the definition for Category B Washing Machines that characterizes members in the user list. In this example, the Category B Washing Machines user list is the user list that is determined, but other user lists, such as user lists associated with appliances in general, may be determined in addition or instead. In some implementations, multiple user lists can be determined, and thedata exchange engine 102 can select the user list that is likely to be the best match or forward all matching information on to subscribers to the respective user lists. - At
stage 306, additional data related to a context associated with the user is determined. In some implementations, determining the additional data related to a context can begin by (or include) examining information from one or more cookies on a user's (e.g., Don's) computer. For example, at least one cookie may contain the IP address associated with Don's computer. In some implementations, thedata exchange engine 102 can use the IP address to pinpoint Don's geographic location, such as a small town in the Midwest. Thedata exchange engine 102 can also use this geo-location information to access the current weather for Don's area, such as from a third-party weather information server. At the time of Don's query, for example, the third-party weather information server may indicate that Don's small town is in the middle of a heat wave and the current temperature is in the 90's. Thus, in this example, the additional data related to a context associated with the user (e.g., Don) includes the current weather and recent conditions. The weather, in this case, is just one example of a current condition associated with the user's environment, but other examples can include other relevant local or current data such as concerts or other upcoming area events, recent local news stories, area road construction or other projects, and so on. In some implementations, the additional data that is determined can be another user list. For example, if user's current weather conditions include a hot temperature,stage 306 can determine a user list such as “Users with Hot Weather” which can include users in regions where hot weather is observed. - At
stage 308, user list definition data and the additional data are provided along with the request to a consumer that has subscribed to the user list. Continuing with the current example, thedata exchange engine 102 can provide the Washing Machines user list definition, the current weather conditions, and the ad request to a consumer (e.g., theparticular ad server 106 that can serve the ad to www.garysappliances.com). The combination of information in this way essentially serves to “join” the user list with the external data. Thead server 106 that is selected by thedata exchange engine 102 to receive the ad request and joined information can be a consumer (e.g., one of several ad servers 106) that has subscribed to the Washing Machines user list. In some implementations, in cases in whichstage 306 determines another user list, the other user list can be included with the user list definition and ad request that are provided to the consumer - Using the information received, for example, the
ad server 106 can create an ad having customized content based on the information. For example, in addition to including information in the ad that is related to various washing machines in which Don may be interested, thead server 106 can provide details of a current sale or promotion on air conditioners. The selection of air conditioners is just one example customization that can occur based on the weather conditions where Don lives. Other ad customization can include products or services that may appeal to Don in light of the weather conditions. Furthermore, by knowing that Don's small Midwest town is in the middle of a heat wave, thead server 106 can promote particular models of washing machines that operate efficiently or have “cool house” technology (e.g., they avoid heating the surrounding area). Other example contexts can be time-based. For example, consider the case in which Don happens to be surfing the Internet around dinnertime and is a member of a user list characterized by a liking for Asian food. In this case, a customized ad that can be served to Don may include information for a local Asian food restaurant that delivers and (on Don's hot day of weather) offers a discount on cold beverages that can be added to the meal. - The example that was just described uses Dan's current weather conditions and time-of-day as the additional data related to a context associated with the user, but still other contexts can also be used for targeting ads. For example, a combination of information from other sources, such as cookies on Don's computer or information obtained from third-party sources may be used to determine context. For example, information may be available that indicates that Don's current stock portfolio is on a downward trend. An
ad server 106 can use this information to generate other customized ads for Don, such as ads for financial planners in Don's general area that are displayed, for example, when Don visits investment-related websites. Another example of customized content can include the situation in which up-to-the-minute, daytime information is available, such as a promotion at a nearby department or discount store. - In some implementations, local copies can be maintained for data that is obtained from external sources, such as at
stage 306. In some implementations, thedata exchange engine 102, for example, can maintain local copies of external data in one or more tables. To keep the information up-to-date, thedata exchange engine 102 can query external data sources on a regular or scheduled basis, e.g., every one or two hours. One example type of data that can be obtained every few hours is the set of weather conditions (e.g., temperature, precipitation, etc.) that can be obtained from national weather service websites or other meteorological sources. In some implementations, the information can include forecasts for all US ZIP codes, and can be stored locally in files (or RDBMS tables, etc.) and overwritten as more current information is available and obtained. This type of information can be indexed in various ways, such as by state, city, county, latitude/longitude, ZIP code, or other ways. Similar weather-related information can be obtained and stored on a regular basis for non-domestic areas, including Canada, Mexico, North America, and countries or areas on other continents. In some implementations, the schedules by which a certain area's data is updated on a regular basis can depend on the population of the area and/or the number of potential computers to which ads may be served. - In some implementations, context information can include information that is known ahead of time. Examples include holidays, elections, and schedules (e.g., for schools, cities, etc.). This type of information, for example, can be combined with information from a user's cookie to create context-based ads for such promotions as “Back-to-School” sales, holiday or Spring Break rates on products and services (e.g., that match the user's memberships in particular user lists), and so on.
-
FIG. 4 is a diagram of an example sequence ofoperations 400 that are centered around anad server 106 that uses user list information joined with external data to serve an ad with customized content. Instep 1, based on user action on the user'sbrowser 110, a request for an ad can occur. For example, the request can be similar to the request received atstage 302 of theprocess 300, such as a request for an ad related to washing machines or other major appliances that can occur when the user navigates to a webpage that hosts such ads. - In
step 2, data in thecookie store 402 can be looked up, such as the user's (e.g., Don's) IP address. In step 3, information from the cookie can be used to obtain additional information, such as information from third-party servers 108 or other external data sources. In the present example, the additional information can include current weather conditions in Don's Midwest town. At this time, the user list associated with the user is also known (e.g., provided by the data exchange engine 102). For example, the user list for Don is the Category B Washing Machines user list. At this time, enough information exists so that a targeted ad with customized content can be created. - In
step 4, which can be optional (e.g., as indicated by a dashed line), the information acquired in the previous steps, including the user lists, is passed to a real-time bidder 404. The bidding in this case can involve bids received from one or more consumers, or advertisers, who can bid on available impressions corresponding to, for example, the website to which the user is navigating. Using the targeting information, for example, bids can be adjusted in real-time. For example, a bid for an available impression may be significantly higher than otherwise because the targeted ad may be more likely to lead to a conversion. In some cases, bidding may occur without the use of the addition targeting information, and the additional targeting information can be used later as needed (e.g., to change the content of an ad). - In
step 5, optionally and irrespective of whether bidding has occurred using the targeting information, user list and other information can be provided to anad customizer 406. Returning again to the example involving ads provided to the user Don, thead customizer 406 can customize the ad using available information, including current weather conditions in Don's town. The customized ad can be served right away and/or stored in thead repository 112. Instep 6, user lists can be used to access ads in the ad repository. -

Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 568. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, GPS (Global Positioning System)receiver module 570 may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data todevice 550, which may be used as appropriate by applications running ondevice 550. -
Device 550 may also communicate audibly usingaudio codec 560, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information.Audio codec 560 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset ofdevice 550.
