Background technology
Telecommunications industry association has used interim standard IS-95-A (IS-95) to come at cellular system
In realize CDMA.In cdma communication system, movement station (MS) with in geographic area
Any one or more in multiple base station sub-systems (BSS) of interior distribution communicate.Each
BSS sends pilot frequency channel signal continuously, and it has identical extension code word, but has difference
Code phase offset.Phase offset allows to distinguish each pilot signal, thus allows to distinguish base
Stand.Here, simply the pilot signal of BSS will be referred to as pilot tone.MS monitored pilots is also
Measure the pilot energy received.
IS-95 is the some states of the communication definitions between MS and BS and channel.Such as, at stream
During movement station in amount state controls, BSS over a forward traffic channel in a forward with MS
Communication, and communicate with BSS on the Reverse Traffic Channel that MS is in the reverse link.In the calling phase
Between, MS monitors and safeguards four set pilot tones with having to last for.Four set pilot tones are referred to as pilot set, its
Including active set, Candidate Set, Lin Juji and residual set.
Active set is the pilot tone being associated with the forward traffic channel distributing to MS.Candidate Set is
Such pilot tone, it is not currently in active set, but by MS with enough strength reception,
The forward traffic channel being associated can be successfully demodulated with instruction.Neighbours' collection is such pilot tone,
It is not currently in active set or Candidate Set, but possibly as the candidate of switching.Residual set is
Except neighbours' collection, Candidate Set and activity in the current current system in the distribution of CDMA frequency
All possible pilot tone outside the pilot tone concentrated.
Typically, BSS serves covering domain, and this covering domain is divided into multiple sector.Each fan
One or more in multiple Base Transceiver Station (BTS) that district is included by BSS again services.
When the ms is serviced by a first bts, MS continuously searches for the pilot channel of neighbours BTS, with
Find the pilot tone being enough better than threshold value.MS uses Pilot Strength Measurement Message this event to be notified
To first, service BTS.When MS moves to by the from by the first sector of a BTS service
During the second sector that two BTS service, special pilot is risen to activity from Candidate Set by communication system
Collection, rises to Candidate Set from neighbours' collection.This lifting is led to by service BTS via switching guide message
Know to MS.Thereafter, when MS is before terminating the communication with former BTS, starts and have been added to
When the new BTS of active set communicates, occur " soft handover ".
For reverse link, typically, each BTS in active set demodulates and decodes independently
The each frame received from MS or packet.Thereafter, switching centre it is responsible at each active set BTS
Decoding frame between arbitrate.Such operating in soft handover has multiple advantages.Quantitatively,
When user moves to adjacent sectors from a sector, this characteristic is improved and implements between BTS
More reliable switching.Quantitatively, the capacity/covering during soft handover improves cdma system.
Such as, Fig. 1 is the block diagram of communication system 100 of prior art.Preferably, communication system
System 100 is CDMA2000 or WCDMA system.Communication system 100 includes that multiple community is (aobvious
Show seven), each of which community is divided into three sectors (a, b, c).It is positioned at each little
Base station sub-system (BSS) 101-107 in district provides to each movement station being positioned at this community
Communication service.Each BSS 101-107 includes multiple BTS, these BTS be positioned at by BSS
Movement station in the sector of the community of service is wirelessly connected.Communication system 100 is wrapped further
Including radio network controller (RNC) 110, it is connected to each BSS, also includes gateway 112,
It is connected to RNC.Gateway 112 provides (the most public with external network to communication system 100
Switched telephone (PSTN) or the Internet) interface.
Typically, MS (such as MS 114) and the BSS (such as BSS 101) servicing this MS
Between the quality of communication link change with the motion of MS in time.As a result, along with MS 114
And the degeneration of the communication link between BSS 101, communication system 100 provides soft handover (SHO)
Flow process, can be switched to MS 114 separately from rudimentary first communication link of quality by this flow process
One higher-quality communication link.Such as, as it is shown in figure 1, by the sector b of Serving cell 1
The MS 114 that serviced of BTS be in three together with the sector c of the community 3 and sector a of community 4
In side's soft handover.The BTS being associated with sector services MS concomitantly, in other words, with sector
The BTS that 1-b, 3-c and 4-a are associated is referred to as the active set of MS in this area.
Referring now to Fig. 2, which depict the soft handoff procedure carried out by communication system 100.Fig. 2
It it is the block diagram of the hierarchical structure of communication system 100.As in figure 2 it is shown, RNC 110 includes ARQ
Function 210, scheduler 212 and soft handover (SHO) function 214.Fig. 2 retouches further
State multiple BTS 201-207, each of which BTS provide corresponding BSS 101-107 and be positioned at by
The wave point between MS in the sector of BSS service.
When performing a soft handoff, each BTS 201,203,204 in the active set of MS 114
Transmission is received via the reverse link of each communication channel from MS 114.Active set BTS 201,203
Determine by SHO function 214 with 204.When receiving transmission from MS 114, each active set
The content of the radio frames that BTS 201,203,204 demodulation and decoding receives.Each active set BTS
201,203,204 thereafter by demodulation and decoding radio frames together with relevant frame quality information transmission
To RNC 110.
The RNC 110 each BTS 201,203,204 from active set receives demodulation and decoding
Radio frames together with relevant frame quality information, and based on frame quality information select optimum frame.RNC
The scheduler 212 of 110 generates thereafter control channel information with ARQ function 210, and it is as phase
Each BTS 201,203,204 that the radio frames of same preformatting is distributed in active set.
Active set BTS 201,203,204 broadcasts preformatting the most simultaneously
Radio frames.Thereafter, MS 114 use control channel information determines which kind of transfer rate of use.
For obtaining higher handling capacity and lower delay, it is desirable to increase the high data of reverse link
Rate covers.For obtaining these requirements on reverse link, communication system (such as communication system 100)
Have adaptation technology, such as mixed automatic repeat request (H-ARQ) and Adaptive Modulation and
Coding (AMC).
Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) provides motility, modulating and forward error correction
(FEC) what encoding scheme matched by each user (or MS) of communication system service is average
Channel conditions.For there is suitable channel matter due to it close to BTS or other geography superiority
The user of amount, AMC promise is significantly increased average data rate.With without 100kbps during AMC
Compare, use the enhancement mode gsm system of AMC to provide the data transfer rate of up to 384kbps.Class
As, 5MHz cdma system can be provided by AMC and be up to 10Mbps and 2Mbps respectively
Downlink and uplink peak data rate, be typically 2Mbps during without AMC
With 384kbps.
AMC has multiple limitation.AMC is for measuring error and delay-sensitive.Suitable for selecting
Suitable modulation, scheduler (such as scheduler 212) must channel knowledge quality.During channel is estimated
Mistake scheduler will be caused to select the data transfer rate of mistake, and send with too high power, thus
Waste power system capacity, or send with too low power, thus increase Block Error Rate.Owing to continuing
The mobile channel of change, reporting channel measure in delay also reduce channel quality estimation can
By property.For overcoming measurement to postpone, it is possible to increase the frequency of ChannelMeasurementReport DETAILED.But, measure report
The power system capacity that increases consumption accused, this portion capacity can be used for carrying data originally.
Mixing ARQ is implicit link adaptation technique.Wherein, in AMC, use explicit
C/I measures or is similar to measurement and arranges modulation and coded format, in H-ARQ, uses link
Layer confirms to carry out resending decision-making.Have been developed in many technology to realize H-ARQ, such as
Chase combination, rate compatible punctured Turbo code and incremental redundancy.Incremental redundancy, i.e. II
Type H-ARQ, is the realization of such H-ARQ technology, wherein, as to sending whole volume
The simple replacement repeated of code division group, if decoding unsuccessfully in attempting for the first time, incrementally sends out
Send extra redundancy.
Type III H-ARQ falls within the classification of incremental redundancy ARQ method.But, use III
During type H-ARQ, each resend can self-demarking code, this situation with II type H-ARQ
Different.Chase combination (also referred to as having type III H-ARQ of a redundancy versions) relates to by sending
Device resends same coded data packet.This of packet that the decoder of receiver end will send
Multiple copies is combined by the SNR weighting received.So, after each transmission again,
Obtain diversity (time) gain and coding gain (being only applicable to IR).There is many redundancies
Type III H-ARQ in, use different punching bits in each retransmission.The most real
The details of existing various H-ARQ methods is well known in the art, and the most not discusses.
H-ARQ Yu AMC combination can increase user throughput significantly, makes system hold potentially
Amount increases to twice/tri-times.It practice, mixing ARQ fits by sending extra increments of redundancy
Answer channel, which increase encoding rate and significantly reduce the data transfer rate of match channels.Mixing ARQ
Depend not only upon channel to estimate, and depend on by the mistake of ARQ notice of settlement.At present, exist
In CDMA2000 and WCDMA system, reverse link ARQ function (such as ARQ function
210) and scheduling feature (such as scheduling feature 212) resides in RNC (such as RNC 110)
In.ARQ function and scheduling feature position in the rnc are by supporting the needs of soft handover certainly
It is fixed, this is because soft handover function (such as soft handover function 214) also resides in RNC.
But, place in the rnc the result of these functions be BSS (such as BSS 101-107) and
The BTS 201-207 that it is associated is only capable of being communicated by RNC, causes latency penalties.
Accordingly, there exist the needs to the new architecture for digit wireless communication system, this framework will
The scheduling of the communication system reducing prior art postpones with ARQ.

These BTS are the active set of MS.As used herein, term " active set " with
" servicing ", such as active set BTS and service BTS, is interchangeable, and both of which refers to place
BTS in the active set of the MS being associated.Further, although Fig. 3 and 10 is by BTS
301,303 and 304 be depicted as only servicing single MS, those of ordinary skill in the art it is realized that
Each BTS 301-307 can dispatch and service multiple MS, in other words, each BTS concomitantly
301-307 can be concomitantly as the member of multiple active sets.
Fig. 3 describes the network architecture 300 of communication system 1000, and it is in accordance with embodiments of the invention.
As it is shown on figure 3, communication system includes multiple BTS 301-307, each of which BTS is accordingly
BSS 1001-1007 and the MS in the sector serviced by BTS between provide wireless and connect
Mouthful.In communication system 1000, scheduling feature 316, ARQ function 314 and SHO function
318 are distributed in each BTS 301-307.As a result, compared with the RNC 110 of prior art,
RNC 1010 decreases function.RNC 1010 by definition by communication system 1000 service every
The member of the active set of one MS (such as MS 1014), is responsible for mobility, and (being responsible for)
Adjust multicast/group and receive group.For each MS in communication system 1000, Internet protocol (IP)
Each BTS that packet is directly multicasted in the active set of MS, i.e. the active set of MS 1014
In BTS 301,303,304.
As noted above, each BTS 301-307 of communication system 1000 includes
SHO function 318, it performs by performed by the SHO function 214 of the RNC 110 of prior art

In BTS 301-307, these functions also reside in the RNC 110 of communication system 100.
As a result, when on specific blend ARQ channel send data block by active set BTS successfully
During decoding, BTS confirms to be successfully decoded by transmitting ACK to source MS (i.e. MS 1014),
And instruct transmission ACK without waiting for RNC 1010.
Each active set BTS, the most each BTS 301,303,304, dispatch respectively its with by
The EUDCH of the MS (i.e. MS 1014) of this BTS service, it uses shorter frame period (ratio
As said, 2 milliseconds (ms)), control simultaneously information shorter Yu longer frame period (such as,
2ms and 10ms frame period) between divide, to minimize SNR, thus reduce interference.Change
Yan Zhi, it is desirable to MS more frequently or the control information of lasting report uses bigger frame big
Little, such as 10ms, this reduce interference.Send less frequent, or only as scheduling user
The control information sent time (i.e. MS) sends with shorter frame period, this interval coupling enhancement mode
Uplink frame interval, such as 2ms, this reduce time delay.
For allowing each active set BTS 301,303,304 to decode each EUDCH frame, MS
1014 transmit the modulation and coding information being associated with EUDCH frame to each active set BTS,
Incremental redundancy version information, H-ARQ status information, and transport block size information, these letters
System is referred to as transformat and resource related information (TFRI).In another embodiment of the present invention
In, TFRI only defines speed and modulation coding information and H-ARQ state.Preferably, MS 1014
Coding TFRI also sends TFRI on the frame period identical with EUDCH.
By providing MS 1014 to correspond to each increasing of active set BTS 301,303,304
The TFRI signaling of strong type rl transmission, communication system 1000 is supported in a distributed way
H-ARQ, AMC, active set handoff and scheduling feature.As described in more detail below
Like that, by the control function that will be supported by RNC (such as RNC 110) in the prior art
Moving to BTS 301-307, communication system 1000 allows active set BTS 301,303,304 to exist
Soft handover (SHO) period performs based on time and H-ARQ refresh function based on SNR,
There is provided efficient control channel architecture to be enhanced reverse link (up-link) channel
Support scheduling, H-ARQ, AMC function, in order to maximize handling capacity, and allow SHO district
MS in territory selects corresponding to most preferably from multiple distribution that multiple active set BTS receive from it
The dispatching distribution of TFRI.As a result, communication system 1000 allows inharmonic (uncoordinated)
(i.e. not having explicit communication between active set BTS 301,303,304) is right during SHO
The scheduling of enhanced uplink channel (EUDCH), supports H-ARQ Yu AMC also simultaneously
Still grand selection diversity and crescendo (upfade) scheduling benefit are obtained.
Referring now to Fig. 4, message flow chart 400 describes the MS of communication system 1000 (such as
MS 1014) multiple BTS (i.e. BTS 301,303 and 304) of including with the active set of MS
In each between communication exchange, it is in accordance with embodiments of the invention.MS 1014 is to each
Active set BTS 301,303,304 transmits schedule information 402, and it uses has known fixed tune
System and code rate and the first reverse link control channel 406 of transport block size.Semi-static
On the basis of realize the corresponding code assignment to the first reverse link control channel.Preferably, when
When the corresponding data queue of MS is empty, MS 1014 does not send control information.
Each active set BTS 301,303,304 is via the first reverse link control channel 406
Schedule information 402 is received from the MS 1014 serviced by this BTS.Schedule information 402 can include
The data queue status of MS and power rating.In another embodiment of the invention, data queue
State can 3 layers of signaling of account for queued and the data of queuing.In another embodiment of the present invention
In, schedule information 402 can farther include type field, wherein can send data queue status
Or power rating.
Based on the schedule information 402 received from each MS serviced by BTS, for each tune
Degree transmission intercal 410, each service BTS (i.e. active set BTS) 301,303,304 is dispatched
One or more in the MS serviced by this BTS, i.e. MS 1014.A reality in the present invention
Executing in example, scheduling transmission interval 410 is 10ms, and this scheduling transmission interval is divided into five 2ms
Subframe 422.The each MS serviced by BTS, such as about the MS 1014 of BTS 301,
Send out in second reverse control channel 412 and the 2ms subframe in each in EUDCH 414
Send, to reduce signaling, thus reduce signaling interference overhead.By by 10ms scheduling transmission interval
410 are divided into five 2ms subframes 422, the MS of service, such as MS 1014, can be based on
Current channel conditions optimizes speed (TFRI), meanwhile, by allowing with 10ms
It is spaced (such as the interval of the first reverse link control channel 406) rather than between 2ms subframe
Some controls are sent every (such as the sub-frame interval 424 of the second reverse link control channel 412)
Information processed (such as schedule information 402), minimizes control channel interference.
Each active set BTS 301,303,304 uses reverse link interference level, and MS adjusts
Degree information 402, and power control information determines each MS serviced by this BTS (such as
MS 1014) maximum allowable power margin target.Power headroom is current special physics control
Difference between the maximum power level that channel processed (DPCCH) power level and this MS support.
Pilot tone is reverse chain channel, and it is used for the purpose of demodulation, such as automatic frequency and controls, together
Step and power control.Such as, in a wcdma system, this channel is the one of DPCCH
Part.In another embodiment of the invention, determine more than maximum power level target and non-power
Amount target.In another embodiment of the present invention, determine maximum EUDCH to DPCCH (or
EUDCH is to pilot tone) power ratio target rather than power margin target.
When selecting MS (such as MS 1014) to be dispatched, each active set BTS 301,
303,304 in the first forward link control channel 426 to selected MS (i.e. MS 1014)
Transmit dispatching distribution 418.In one embodiment of the invention, dispatching distribution 418 includes maximum
Allow " power headroom " target with use the first forward link for next 10ms transmission intercal
Control the EUDCH sub-frame transmission intervals (such as 2ms sub-frame interval) of the permission of channel 426
Mapping.Figure 12 explains the example of the mapping that dispatching distribution 418 (Fig. 4) includes.Row 1205
Including one group of status indicator, its display is at scheduling transmission interval 1210 (such as Fig. 4 of distribution
Scheduling transmission interval 410) which EUDCH subframe period MS 1014 can use.At this
In another bright embodiment, the dispatching distribution 418 of Fig. 4 can farther include physical channel Walsh
Second forward link control channel (SFLCCH) 420 of code assignment, also referred to as Fig. 4
The second forward link control channel code word (SFLCCH_code).Another reality in the present invention
Execute in example, map the TFRI that may also include for each EUDCH subframe and distribute, i.e. correspond to
The TFRI subframe of each EUDCH subframe.Figure 13 shows the example of such mapping,
It also includes status indicator row 1205 and string TFRI value 1315.Each active set BTS
301,303,304 the second forward link control channel 420 is also used to transmit and MS to MS
The relevant ACK/NAK information of EUDCH sub-frame transmission.
Each active set BTS 301,303,304 is that the first forward link control channel 426 is created
Building MS identifier (ID), it is uniquely associated with the MS serviced by this BTS, i.e. MS 1014.
BTS is uniquely associated with n-bit ID of MS (and at MS and active set BTS by order
Place is for known) by the CRC generator at BTS, create MS ID.Used by BTS
