Definitions
- the present invention relates to the field of automated information retrieval in the context of document processing. Particularly, the present invention relates to a system and associated method for discovering a majority schema from a set of related documents that share similar but not identical schemas.
- the World Wide Web is comprised of an expansive network of interconnected computers upon which businesses, governments, groups, and individuals throughout the world maintain inter-linked computer files known as web pages. Users navigate these pages by means of computer software programs commonly known as Internet browsers. Due to the vast number of WWW sites, many web pages have a redundancy of information or share a strong likeness in either function or title. The vastness of the unstructured WWW causes users to rely primarily on Internet search engines to retrieve information or to locate businesses. These search engines use various means to determine the relevance of a user-defined search to the information retrieved.
- the authors of web pages provide information known as metadata, within the body of the hypertext markup language (HTML) document that defines the web pages.
- a computer software product known as a web crawler, systematically accesses web pages by sequentially following hypertext links from page to page.
- the crawler indexes the pages for use by the search engines using information about a web page as provided by its address or Universal Resource Locator (URL), metadata, and other criteria found within the page.
- the crawler is run periodically to update previously stored data and to append information about newly created web pages.
- the information compiled by the crawler is stored in a metadata repository or database.
- the search engines search this repository to identify matches for the user-defined search rather than attempt to find matches in real time.
- a typical search engine has an interface with a search window where the user enters an alphanumeric search expression or keywords.
- the search engine sifts through available web sites for the user's search terms, and returns the search of results in the form of HTML pages.
- Each search result includes a list of individual entries that have been identified by the search engine as satisfying the user's search expression.
- Each entry or “hit” may include a hyperlink that points to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) location or web page.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- certain search result pages include a short summary or abstract that describes the content of the URL location.
- search engines generate this abstract from the file at the URL, and provide acceptable results for URLs that point to HTML format documents.
- a typical abstract includes a combination of values selected from HTML tags. These values may include a text from the web page's “title” tag, from what are referred to as “annotations” or “meta tag values” such as “description”, “keywords”, etc., from “heading” tag values (e.g., H 1 , H 2 tags), or from some combination of the content of these tags.
- Automatic programs such as web crawlers also known as spiders or robots, visit the web sites and extract information.
- comparison shopping search engines visit web sites describing information, such as prices, and extract semantic information from these sites.
- the retrieved data are oftentimes unhelpful, unrelated or difficult to extract.
- the present invention addresses the need to build search engines that allow users to formulate structural queries like “find a student with a Master's degree and a GPA of 3.5 or more and skills in Java.”
- search engines that allow users to formulate structural queries like “find a student with a Master's degree and a GPA of 3.5 or more and skills in Java.”
- U.S. Pat. No. 5,694,592 to Driscoll describes a method of querying and retrieving documents from a database using semantic knowledge about the query string to determine document relevancy.
- U.S. Pat. No. 5,848,407 to Ishikawa describes a method of presenting potentially related hypertext document summaries to a user who is using a search engine that indexes a plurality of hypertext documents.
- the present invention teaches a schema discovery system and associated method that satisfy this need.
- the system discovers a majority schema for a set of related and similarly marked up documents, such as HTML documents, based on the assumption that though the structure of these documents is mostly for visual purposes, the keywords used in the documents along with the structural tags provide some hints, and allow a rough sketch of the underlying intended schema. It is further assumed that albeit the set of HTML documents are marked up differently due to diverse authoring skills, they are closely related in content. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the presence of a schema that can unify these different schemas, which schema is shared by the most (i.e., majority) of these HTML documents.
- the copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/531,019 generally describes a process that uses visual clues and structural tags to extract basic schematic structures of HTML documents.
- the present invention describes a method that reconstructs a majority of schemas from these schematic structures. It also proposes constraints-based mechanism for domain experts to specify domain knowledge, if any, that can help the reconstruction process.
- the algorithm used by the present system may be summarized by the following process:
- the schematic structures of markup documents are extracted and represented as sets of ordered trees with nodes labeled by a set of keywords inputted from the user. Keywords identify important concepts in these documents. Reordering rules are used to reconfigure the trees so that its structure more closely resembles the semantic structures of a predefined template, such as an HTML document.
- the ordered trees are mapped to sets of paths, ignoring ordering and repetitive information.
- the assumption is that choosing an imprecise representation helps reveal common patterns.
- Prevalent patterns among the trees are presumed to be label paths that occur frequently among all the documents.
- a constraint mechanism is introduced for users to specify a restriction on the forms of schematic structures in the majority schema. This helps reduce the search space and to filter out noise. The set of frequent label paths satisfying the constraints are discovered.
- the set of labels is converted to a predefined structure schema, such as XML DTD schema.
- a predefined structure schema such as XML DTD schema.
- Information lost in the inexact representation of trees can be recovered by heuristics.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary operating environment in which a schema discovery system of the present invention can be used;
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram that illustrates a high level architecture of the system of FIG. 1 shown used in the context of an Internet search;
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart representing a schema discovery method implemented by the system of FIG. 2;
- FIG. 4 is comprised of FIGS. 4A, 4 B and 4 C, and illustrates three exemplary trees representing three hypertext documents;
- FIG. 5 shows the tree corresponding to the set of label paths to which the trees of FIGS. 4A, 4 B and 4 C are mapped.
- Child From graph theory, a node pointed to by a path from a parent
- Constraint Specifies a relationship between two or more keywords.
- Crawler A program that automatically explores the World Wide Web by retrieving a document and recursively retrieving some or all the documents that are linked to it.
- Depth (level) of a node The number of nodes from the root to the node in its tree.
- Distance measure A numeric metric between 0 and 1 (inclusive) that measures how similar two trees are. The lower is the distance measure, the more similar are the two trees. If the distance measure between two trees is below a user-defined threshold, the two trees are considered similar. Otherwise, they are considered dissimilar.

- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- Web browser A software program that allows users to request and read hypertext documents. The browser gives some means of viewing the contents of web documents and of navigating from one document to another.
- Web document or page A collection of data available on the World Wide Web and identified by a URL.
- a web page is a file written in HTML and stored on a web server. It is possible for the server to generate pages dynamically in response to a request from the user.
- a web page can be in any format that the browser or a helper application can display. The format is transmitted as part of the headers of the response as a MIME type, e.g. “text/html”, “image/gif”.
- An HTML web page will typically refer to other web pages and Internet resources by including hypertext links.
- Web site A database or other collection of inter-linked hypertext documents (“web documents” or “web pages”) and associated data entities, which is accessible via a computer network, and which forms part of a larger, distributed informational system such as the WWW.
- a web site corresponds to a particular Internet domain name, and includes the content of a particular organization.
- Other types of web sites may include, for example, a hypertext database of a corporate “intranet” (i.e., an internal network which uses standard Internet protocols), or a site of a hypertext system that uses document retrieval protocols other than those of the WWW.
- WWW World Wide Web

- XML tags are embedded within the informational content of the document. These tags are not predefined and can be interpreted by different applications for different purposes, such as exchange of data, visual display. For example, when the web document (or “XML document”) is subsequently transmitted by a web server to a web browser, the tags are interpreted by the browser and used to parse and display the document. In addition to specifying how the web browser is to display the document, XML tags can be used to create hyperlinks to other web documents.
- Xpointer (XML Pointer Language): An XML syntax that allows the specification of hyperlinks within XML documents. Xpointer enables internal XML structures to be referenced rather than referencing the entire page. The syntax is appended to a URL from another page to point to an element inside an XML document.
- FIG. 1 portrays the overall environment in which a schema discovery system 10 for semi-structured documents according to the present invention may be used.
- the system 10 includes a software or computer program product which is typically embedded within, or installed on a host server 15 .
- the system 10 can be saved on a suitable storage medium such as a diskette, a CD, a hard drive, or like devices. While the system 10 will be described in connection with the WWW, the system 10 can be used with a stand-alone repository of terms that may have been derived from the WWW and/or other sources.
- the cloud-like communication network 20 is comprised of communication lines and switches connecting servers such as servers 25 , 27 , to gateways such as gateway 30 .
- the servers 25 , 27 and the gateway 30 provide the communication access to the WWW Internet.
- Users, such as remote Internet users are represented by a variety of computers such as computers 35 , 37 , 39 , and can query the host server 15 for the desired information.
- the host server 15 is connected to the network 20 via a communications link such as a telephone, cable, or satellite link.
- the servers 25 , 27 can be connected via high speed Internet network lines 44 , 46 to other computers and gateways.
- the servers 25 , 27 provide access to stored information such as hypertext or web documents indicated generally at 50 , 55 , and 60 .
- the hypertext documents 50 , 55 , 60 most likely include embedded hypertext link to other locally stored pages, and hypertext links 70 , 72 , 74 , 76 to other webs sites or documents 55 , 60 that are stored by various web servers such as the server 27 .
- FIG. 2 illustrates a high-level architecture showing the system 10 used in the context of an Internet environment.
- the system 10 resides between the user and the semi-structured documents available for search on the WWW 20 . Documents judged to fall into a given category by the system will be made available to the user for their perusal and possible use.
- a user employs a browser or a user interface (UI) 140 to enter a search query that is transmitted to a search service provider 100 .
- the search service provider 100 accesses the system 10 .
- the system automatically searches the semi-structured documents on the WWW 20 .
- the search results will be sent to the user via the search service provider 100 .
- the search results may include a list of URLs and associated brief abstracts describing the nature of the resources found.
- Raw HTML files 300 may be searched for, selected or downloaded and stored according to criteria representing resumes such as keywords such as “resume”, “job application”, “job search”, or a combination of words and phrases such as “job experience”, “university education” etc.
- the schematic structures 305 are extracted from the HTML files by determining common keywords, and section titles in the HTML files 300 .
- the HTML files may hierarchically refer to other files and point to other locations, thus the files may need flattening to incorporate elements from several locations into one file. Keywords are also extracted from the HTML files which will be used to subsequently determine the DTD.
- the HTML files are rewritten into XML format. Keywords identify important concepts in the HTML documents.
- the schematic structures of markup documents are extracted and represented as sets of ordered trees with nodes labeled by a set of keywords input from the user. Reordering rules are used to reconfigure the trees so that its structure resembles the semantic structures of the HTML documents more closely.
- step 310 ordered trees are mapped to sets of label paths, therefore ignoring ordering and repetitive information.
- the assumption is that choosing an imprecise representation helps to reveal common patterns.
- the technique is to incrementally explore label paths of increasing length which are analyzed by constraint rules to discover frequent label paths at step 315 , for example, as described in the copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/531,019.
- FIG. 4A An exemplary tree 400 is shown in FIG. 4A where the zero level is the HTML identifier, followed by the objective label describing the type of job the individual is looking for, and further illustrating the applicant's educational qualifications such as date, degree, and organizations.
- FIG. 4B An illustration of another common sequence or tree 410 is also shown in FIG. 4B, where the contact information is the starting information, and education is highlighted in the sequence of education, degree, date, and organization.
- FIG. 4C illustrates yet another common configuration or tree 420 , in which the contact information is the starting information and education is highlighted in the sequence of education, organization, degree and date.
- FIG. 5 illustrates how the data in FIG. 4A through 4C may generate several trees T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , and different label paths p 1 , p 2 , p 3 , p 4 , p 5 , p 6 . While it may be relatively easy for a human to find equivalencies among small number of these label paths p 1 , p 2 , p 3 , p 4 , p 5 , p 6 , it is significantly more difficult to do so for a large number of label paths.
- the present invention addresses the solution to the problem of automating the analysis of equivalencies in the label paths.
- the method 300 uses a set of constraints at step 315 to analyze the label paths to determine the most frequent path or paths.
- Prevalent patterns among the trees are label paths that occur frequently among all the HTML documents.
- a constraint mechanism for users may be introduced to specify restriction on the forms of schematic structures in the common schema. This helps to reduce the search space and to filter out noise.
- the set of frequent label paths satisfying the constraints are discovered by finding the most common label paths among the trees at depths of 1 or more, and then reordering the label paths and searching again for common label paths of increasing length. The task is to minimize searching in a simple heuristic. By using constraints to limit the search space the problem of searching may be greatly simplified.
- a keyword cannot appear more than once along a label path
- the set of keywords is divided into two sets: title keywords and content keywords.
- Title keywords can for example be the title of a resume, and hence can only occur as first level nodes in the tree.
- Content keywords describe the content of title keywords and hence can only occur at a depth of greater than one in the tree.
- the label paths in the tree 400 of FIG. 4A of length 5 are:
- the method 300 identifies and unifies similar subtree structures at step 320 . Since the documents share similar but inexact schematic structures, there are repetitive structures among the common tree structures discovered. These repetitive subtrees are identified by a notion of distance measure. Subtrees that are similar have small distance measure and are subsequently merged together by flattening their structures up to certain depth, and by combining the flattened nodes into one level.
- a majority schema describing the XML documents has been determined.
- the majority schema is translated into an XML DTD 330 by a number of heuristics that can recover information lost in the discovery process, such as order among sibling elements, number of occurrences of an element in another element. Minority schematic structures in the HTML documents are filtered out by the majority schema (and hence its name) which are not described in the DTD, resulting in a more concise DTD.
