- the use of the interface circuit for transmission line termination allows for the creation of a single point of termination for a DIMM. This can improve performance, reduce cost, and provide other benefits for a memory module design.
- An interface circuit for transmission line termination can be used to tune termination values specifically for a DIMM. Standard termination values, for example the termination values mandated by Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC), might not always be optimal for a given DIMM, leading to sub-optimal performance.
- JEDEC Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council
- an interface circuit for transmission line termination can provide optimal ODT resistance for a given DIMM, which preserves signal integrity and minimizes noise on the transmission line. Furthermore, the use of the interface circuit can also provide termination resistance for a DIMM that is higher than the resistance mandated by a standard. If higher resistance is used while signal integrity is maintained, power dissipation will be reduced because the amount of dissipated power is inversely proportional to the value of termination resistance. As a result, the use of an interface circuit for transmission line termination can improve electrical performance and signal quality within a memory system using one or more DIMMs.

- Each of the one or more interface circuits 150 can be, for example, a data buffer, a data buffer chip, a buffer chip, or an interface chip.
- the location of the interface circuit 150 is not fixed to a particular module or section of the computer system.
- the interface circuit 150 can be positioned between the processor section 126 and the memory module 130 ( FIG. 1C ).
- the interface circuit 150 is located in the memory controller 124 , as shown in FIG. 1D .
- each memory chip 142 is coupled to its own interface circuit 150 within memory module 130 ( FIG. 1E ).
- the interface circuit 150 is located in the processor section 126 or in processor 125 , as shown in FIG. 1F .
- the interface circuit 150 can act as an interface between the memory chips 142 and the memory controller 124 .
- the interface circuit 150 accepts signals and commands from the memory controller 124 and relays or transmits commands or signals to the memory chips 142 . These could be the same or different signals or commands.
- Each of the one or more interface circuits 150 can also emulate a virtual memory module, presenting the memory controller 124 with an appearance of one or more virtual memory circuits. In the emulation mode, the memory controller 124 interacts with the interface circuit 150 as it would with a physical DRAM or multiple physical DRAMs on a memory module, depending on the configuration of the interface circuit 150 .
- each interface circuit 150 can emulate a portion (i.e., a slice) of the virtual memory module that is presented to the memory controller 124 .
- An interface circuit 150 that is located on a memory module can also act as a data buffer for multiple memory chips 142 .
- the interface circuit 150 can buffer one or more ranks and present a single controllable point of termination for a transmission line.
- the interface circuit 150 can be connected to memory chips 142 or to the memory controller 124 with one or more transmission lines.
- the interface circuit 150 can therefore provide a more flexible memory module (e.g., DIMM) termination instead of, or in addition to, the memory chips (e.g., DRAM) located on the memory module.
- the interface circuit 150 can terminate all transmission lines or just a portion of the transmission lines of the DIMM. In case when multiple interface circuits 150 are used, each interface circuit 150 can terminate a portion of the transmission lines of the DIMM. For example, the interface circuit 150 can be used to terminate 8 bits of data. If there are 72 bits of data provided by a DIMM, then nine interface circuits are needed to terminate the entire DIMM. In another example, the interface circuit 150 can be used to terminate 72 bits of data, in which case one interface circuit 150 would be needed to terminate the entire 72-bit DIMM. Additionally, the interface circuit 150 can terminate various transmission lines. For example, the interface circuit 150 can terminate a transmission line between the memory controller 124 and the interface circuit 150 . In addition or alternatively, the interface circuit 150 can terminate a transmission line between the interface circuit 150 and one or more of the memory chips 142 .
- Each of one or more interface circuits 150 can respond to a plurality of ODT signals or MRS commands received from the memory controller 124 .
- the memory controller 124 sends one ODT signal or MRS command per physical rank. In some other implementations, the memory controller 124 sends more than one ODT signal or MRS command per physical rank.
- the interface circuit 150 can apply different or asymmetric termination values for non-target ranks during reads and writes. Using different non-target DIMM termination values for reads and writes allows for improved signal quality of the channel and reduced power dissipation due to the inherent asymmetry of a termination line.
- the interface circuit 150 can choose a single termination value that is optimal for the entire DIMM.
- the interface circuit 150 can use a lookup table filled with termination values to select a single termination value based on the MRS commands it receives from the memory controller 124 .
- the lookup table can be stored within interface circuit 150 or in other memory locations, e.g., memory controller 124 , processor 125 , or a memory module 130 .
- the interface circuit 150 can compute a single termination based on one or more stored formula.
- the formula can accept input parameters associated with MRS commands from the memory controller 124 and output a single termination value.
- Other techniques of choosing termination values can be used, e.g., applying specific voltages to specific pins of the interface circuit 150 or programming one or more registers in the interface circuit 150 .
- the register can be, for example, a flip-flop or a storage element.

- memory controller 124 would issue an MRS 0 command that would set the ODT resistor values in DRAMs of the first rank (e.g., as shown by term_a in Tables 1A-B) and would also issue an ODT 0 command signal that would activate corresponding ODT resistors in the first rank.
- Memory controller 124 would also issue an MRS 1 command that would set the ODT resistor values in DRAMs of the second rank (e.g., as shown by term_b in Tables 1A-B) and would also issue an ODT 1 command signal that would enable the corresponding ODT resistors in the second rank.
- the interface circuit 150 is aware of signals/commands transmitted by the memory controller 124 to both ranks of the DIMM, it can select a single ODT resistor value for both ranks using a lookup table, for example, the resistor value shown in Tables 1A-B. The interface circuit 150 can then terminate the transmission line with the ODT resistor having the single selected termination value.
- the interface circuit 150 can also issue signals/commands to DRAMs in each rank to set their internal ODTs to the selected termination value.
- This single termination value may be optimized for multiple ranks to improve electrical performance and signal quality.
- the interface circuit 150 will signal or apply an ODT resistance value of RZQ/12.
- the resulting value can be found in the lookup table at the intersection of a row and a column for given resistance values for rank 0 (term_a) and rank 1 (term_b), which are received from the memory controller 124 in the form of MRS commands.
- the RZQ variable is set to 240 ohm
- a similar lookup table approach can be applied to Rtt_Nom values, Rtt_WR values, or termination values for other types of signals.
- the size of the lookup table is reduced by ‘folding’ the lookup table due to symmetry of the entry values (Rtt).
- an asymmetric lookup table is used in which the entry values are not diagonally symmetric.
- the resulting lookup table entries do not need to correspond to the parallel resistor equivalent of Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC) standard termination values.
- JEDEC Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council
- the table entry corresponding to 40 ohm for the first rank in parallel with 40 ohm for the second rank (40/40) does not have to result in a 20 ohm termination setting.
- the lookup table entries are different from Rtt_Nom or Rtt_WR values required by the JEDEC standards.
- each interface circuit 150 can select a termination value for the portion of the DIMM that is being terminated by that interface circuit 150 using the techniques discussed above.
- FIG. 2 is an example timing diagram 200 for a 3-DIMMs per channel (3DPC) configuration, where each DIMM is a two-rank DIMM.
- the timing diagram 200 shows timing waveforms for each of the DIMMs in three slots: DIMM A 220 , DIMM B 222 , and DIMM C 224 .
- each DIMM receives two ODT signal waveforms for ranks 0 and 1 (ODT 0 , ODT 1 ), thus showing a total of six ODT signals: signals 230 and 232 for DIMM A, signals 234 and 236 for DIMM B, and signals 238 and 240 for DIMM C.
- timing diagram 200 shows a Read signal 250 applied to DIMM A either at rank 0 (R 0 ) or rank 1 (R 1 ).
- the timing diagram 200 also shows a Write signal 252 applied to DIMM A at rank 0 (R 0 ).
- the values stored in the lookup table can be different from the ODT values mandated by JEDEC.
- a traditional two-rank DIMM system relying on JEDEC standard will have its memory controller set DIMM termination values of either INF (infinity or open circuit), 40 ohm (assert either ODT 0 or ODT 1 ), or 20 ohm (assert ODT 0 and ODT 1 ).
- the interface circuit 150 relying on the lookup table can set the ODT resistance value differently from memory controller relying on JEDEC-mandated values. For example, for the same values of R 0 Rtt_Nom and R 1 Rtt_Nom, the interface circuit 150 can select a resistance value that is equal to ZQ/12 (20 ohm) or ZQ/8 (30 ohm) or some other termination value. Therefore, even though the timing diagram 200 shows a 20 ohm termination value for the 40 I/40 scenario, the selected ODT value could correspond to any other value specified in the lookup table for the specified pair of R 0 and R 1 values.
- the memory controller can continue to provide ODT 0 and ODT 1 signals to distinguish between reads and writes even though ODT 1 signal might not have any effect in a traditional memory channel. This allows single and multiple rank DIMMs to have the same electrical performance.
- various encodings of the ODT signals are used.
- the interface circuit 150 can assert ODT 0 signal for non-target DIMMs for reads and ODT 1 signal for non-target DIMMs for writes.
- termination resistance values in multi-rank DIMM configurations are selected in a similar manner.
- an interface circuit provides a multi-rank DIMM termination resistance using a look-up table.
- an interface circuit can also provide a multi-rank DIMM termination resistance that is different from the JEDEC standard termination value.
- an interface circuit can provide a multi-rank DIMM with a single termination resistance.
- An interface circuit can also provide a multi-rank DIMM with a termination resistance that optimizes electrical performance. The termination resistance can be different for reads and writes.
- a DIMM is configured with a single load on the data lines but receives multiple ODT input signals or commands. This means that while the DIMM can terminate the data line with a single termination resistance, the DIMM will appear to the memory controller as though it has two termination resistances that can be configured by the memory controller with multiple ODT signals and MRS commands.
- a DIMM has an ODT value that is a programmable function of the of ODT input signals that are asserted by the system or memory controller.
- FIGS. 3A-C are block diagrams of an example memory module using an interface circuit to provide DIMM termination.
- FIGS. 3A-C include an interface circuit similar to interface circuit 150 described in the context of the computer systems in FIGS. 1A-F .
- DRAMs 316 , 318 , 320 , and 324 can have attributes comparable to those described with respect to memory chips 142 , respectively.
- the interface circuit 314 can have attributes comparable to, and illustrative of, the interface circuits 150 shown in FIGS. 1A-F .
- other elements within FIGS. 3A-C have attributes comparable to, and illustrative of, corresponding elements in FIGS. 1A-F .
- the interface circuit 314 is coupled to DRAMs 316 , 318 , 320 , and 324 .
- the interface circuit 314 is coupled to the memory controller using memory bus signals DQ[3:0], DQ[7:4], DQS 1 — t , DQS 1 — c , DQS 0 — t , DQS 0 — c , VSS. Additionally, other bus signals (not shown) can be included.
- FIG. 3A shows only a partial view of the DIMM, which provides 8 bits of data to the system through DQ[7:4] bus signal.
- the interface circuit combines two virtual ranks to present a single physical rank to the system (e.g., to a memory controller).
- DRAMs 316 and 320 belong to a virtual rank 0 and DRAMs 318 and 324 are parts of virtual rank 1 .
- DRAMs devices 316 and 318 together with interface circuit 314 operate to form a single larger virtual DRAM device 312 .
- DRAM devices 320 and 324 together with interface circuit 314 operate to form a virtual DRAM device 310 .
- the virtual DRAM device 310 represents a “slice” of the DIMM, as it provides a “nibble” (e.g., 4 bits) of data to the memory system.
- DRAM devices 316 and 318 also represent a slice that emulates a single virtual DRAM 312 .
- the interface circuit 314 thus provides termination for two slices of DIMM comprising virtual DRAM devices 310 and 312 . Additionally, as a result of emulation, the system sees a single-rank DIMM.
- the interface circuit 314 is used to provide termination of transmission lines coupled to DIMM.
- FIG. 3A shows resistors 333 , 334 , 336 , 337 that can be used, either alone or in various combinations with each other, for transmission line termination.
- the interface circuit 314 can include one or more ODT resistors 334 (annotated as T 2 ).
- ODT resistor 334 may be used to terminate DQ[7:4] channel.
- DQ[7:4] is a bus having four pins: DQ 7 , DQ 6 , DQ 5 , DQ 4 and thus may require four different ODT resistors.
- DRAMs 316 , 318 , 320 , and 324 can also include their own ODT resistors 336 (annotated as T).
- the circuit of FIG. 3A also includes one or more resistors 333 that provide series stub termination of the DQ signals. These resistors are used in addition to any parallel DIMM termination, for example, provided by ODT resistors 334 and 336 . Other similar value stub resistors can also be used with transmission lines associated with other data signals.
- resistor 337 is a calibration resistor connected to pin ZQ.
- FIG. 3A also shows that the interface circuit 314 can receive ODT control signals though pins ODT 0 326 and ODT 1 328 .
- the ODT signal turns on or turns off a given ODT resistor at the DRAM.
- the ODT signal to DRAM devices in virtual rank 0 is ODT 0 326 and the ODT signal to the DRAM devices in virtual rank 1 is ODT 1 328 .
- the interface circuit 314 provides for flexibility pins for signals ODT 330 , ODT 332 , ODT 0 326 , and ODT 1 328 may be connected in a number of different configurations.
- ODT 0 326 and ODT 1 328 are connected directly to the system (e.g., memory controller); ODT 330 and ODT 332 are hard-wired; and interface circuit 314 performs the function determine the value of DIMM termination based on the values of ODT 0 and ODT 1 (e.g., using a lookup table as describe above with respect to Tables 1A-B). In this manner, the DIMM can use the flexibility provided by using two ODT signals, yet provide the appearance of a single physical rank to the system.
- a standard DIMM would then set termination of 40 ohm on each of two DRAM devices.
- the resulting parallel combination of two nets each terminated to 40 ohm would then appear electrically to be terminated to 20 ohm.
- the presence of interface circuit provides for additional flexibility in setting ODT termination values. For example, a system designer may determine, through simulation, that a single termination value of 15 ohm (different from the normal, standard-mandated value of 20 ohm) is electrically better for a DIMM embodiment using interface circuits.
- the interface circuit 314 using a lookup table as described, may therefore present a single termination value of 15 ohm to the memory controller.
- ODT 0 326 and ODT 1 328 are connected to a logic circuit (not shown) that can derive values for ODT 0 326 and ODT 1 328 not just from one or more ODT signals received from the system, but also from any of the control, address, or other signals present on the DIMM.
- the signals ODT 330 and ODT 332 can be hard-wired or can be wired to the logic circuit. Additionally, there can be fewer or more than two ODT signals between the logic circuit and interface circuit 314 .
- the one or more logic circuits can be a CPLD, ASIC, FPGA, or part of an intelligent register (on an R-DIMM or registered-DIMM for example), or a combination of such components.
- the function of the logic circuit is performed by a modified JEDEC register with a number of additional pins added.
- the function of the logic circuit can also be performed by one or more interface circuits and shared between the interface circuits using signals (e.g., ODT 330 and ODT 332 ) as a bus to communicate the termination values that are to be used by each interface circuit.
- the logic circuit determines the target rank and non-target ranks for reads or writes and then communicates this information to each of the interface circuits so that termination values can be set appropriately.
- the lookup table or tables for termination values can be located in the interface circuits, in one or more logic circuit, or shared/partitioned between components. The exact partitioning of the lookup table function to determine termination values between the interface circuits and any logic circuit depends, for example, on the economics of package size, logic function and speed, or number of pins.
- signals ODT 330 and ODT 332 are used in combination with dynamic termination of the DRAM (i.e., termination that can vary between read and write operations and also between target and non-target ranks) in addition to termination of the DIMM provided by interface circuit 314 .
- dynamic termination of the DRAM i.e., termination that can vary between read and write operations and also between target and non-target ranks
- the system can operate as though the DIMM is a single-rank DIMM and send termination commands to the DIMM as though it were a single-rank DIMM.
- a system designer has an ability to vary or tune the logical and timing behavior as well as the values of termination in three places: (a) DRAM 316 ; (b) DRAM 318 ; and (c) interface circuit 314 , to improve signal quality of the channel and reduce power dissipation.
- a DIMM with four physical ranks and two logical ranks can be created in a similar fashion to the one described above.
- a computer system using 2-rank DIMMs would have two ODT signals provided to each DIMM.

- circuit 372 transmits the same MRS commands or ODT signals to the ODT resistor 366 that it receives from the memory controller. In some other implementations, circuit 372 generates its own commands or signals that are different from the commands/signals it receives from the memory controller.

- Elements within FIG. 4 can have attributes comparable to and illustrative of corresponding elements in FIGS. 1A-F and 3 A-C.
- FIG. 4 shows a DIMM 400 that has two virtual ranks and four physical ranks.
- DRAM 410 is in physical rank number zero
- DRAM 412 is in the first physical rank
- DRAM 414 is in the second physical rank
- DRAM 416 is in the third physical rank.
- DRAM 410 and DRAM 412 are in virtual rank 0 440 .
- DRAM 414 and DRAM 416 are in virtual rank 1 442 .
- DRAMs 410 , 412 , 414 , and 416 have attributes comparable to and illustrative to DRAMs discussed with respect to FIGS. 1A-F and 3 A-C.
- DRAMs 410 , 412 , 414 , and 416 can include ODT resistors 464 , which were discussed with respect to FIG. 3B .
- FIG. 4 shows an interface circuit 420 and an interface circuit 422 .

- FIG. 4 also shows one instance of a logic circuit 424 .
- DIMM 400 can include other components, for example, a register, smart (i.e. modified or enhanced) register device or register circuit for R-DIMMs, a discrete PLL and/or DLL, voltage regulators, SPD, other non-volatile memory devices, bypass capacitors, resistors, and other components.
- a register for example, a register, smart (i.e. modified or enhanced) register device or register circuit for R-DIMMs, a discrete PLL and/or DLL, voltage regulators, SPD, other non-volatile memory devices, bypass capacitors, resistors, and other components.
- DIMM 400 is connected to the system (e.g., memory controller) through conducting fingers 430 of the DIMM PCB. Some, but not all, of these fingers are illustrated in FIG. 4 , for example, the finger for DQS 0 — t , shown as finger 430 . Each finger receives a signal and corresponds to a signal name, e.g., DQS 0 — t 432 . DQ 0 434 is an output (or pin) of the interface circuits 420 and 422 . In some implementations, these two outputs are tied, dotted or connected to an electrical network. Any termination applied to any pin on this electrical network thus applies to the entire electrical network (and the same is true for other similar signals and electrical networks).
- interface circuits 420 and 422 are shown as containing multiple instances of switch 436 .
- Net DQ 0 434 is connected through switches 436 to signal pin DQ[0] of DRAM 410 , DRAM 412 , DRAM 414 , and DRAM 416 .
- switch 436 is a single-pole single-throw (SPST) switch. In some other implementations, switch 436 is mechanical or non-mechanical. Regardless, the switch 436 can be one of various switch types, for example, SPST, DPDT, or SPDT, a two-way or bidirectional switch or circuit element, a parallel combination of one-way, uni-directional switches or circuit elements, a CMOS switch, a multiplexor (MUX), a de-multiplexer (de-MUX), a CMOS bidirectional buffer; a CMOS pass gate, or any other type of switch.
- SPST single-pole single-throw
- the function of the switches 436 is to allow the physical DRAM devices behind the interface circuit to be connected together to emulate a virtual DRAM. These switches prevent such factors as bus contention, logic contention or other factors that may prevent or present unwanted problems from such a connection. Any logic function or switching element that achieves this purpose can be used. Any logical or electrical delay introduced by such a switch or logic can be compensated for. For example, the address and/or command signals can be modified through controlled delay or other logical devices.
- Switch 436 is controlled by signals from logic circuit 424 coupled to the interface circuits, including interface circuit 420 and interface circuit 422 .
- switches 436 in the interface circuits are controlled so that only one of the DRAM devices is connected to any given signal net at one time. Thus, for example, if the switch connecting net DQ 0 434 to DRAM 410 is closed, then switches connecting net DQ 0 434 to DRAMs 412 , 414 , 416 are open.
- the termination of nets, such as DQ 0 434 , by interface circuits 420 and 422 is controlled by inputs ODT 0 i 444 (where “i” stands for internal) and ODT 1 i 446 .
- ODT has been used in the context of DRAM devices
- the on-die termination used by an interface circuit can be different from the on-die termination used by a DRAM device. Since ODT 0 i 444 and ODT 1 i 446 are internal signals, the interface circuit termination circuits can be different from standard DRAM devices. Additionally, the signal levels, protocol, and timing can also be different from standard DRAM devices.
- interface circuit 420 provides termination when DRAM 410 is connected to net DQ 0 434 .
- the interface circuit 420 can be controlled by ODT 0 i 444 and ODT 1 i 446 .
- interface circuit 422 can also provide a different value of termination (including no termination at all) as controlled by signals ODT 0 i 444 and ODT 1 i 446 .
- the ODT control signals or commands from the system are ODT 0 448 and ODT 1 450 .
- the ODT input signals or commands to the DRAM devices are shown by ODT signals 452 , 454 , 456 , 458 .
- the ODT signals 452 , 454 , 456 , 458 are not connected.
- ODT signals 452 , 454 , 456 , 458 are connected, for example, as: (a) hardwired (i.e. to VSS or VDD or other fixed voltage); (b) connected to logic circuit 424 ; (c) directly connected to the system; or (d) a combination of (a), (b), and (c).
- transmission line termination can be placed in a number of locations, for example, (a) at the output of interface circuit 420 ; (b) the output of interface circuit 422 ; (c) the output of DRAM 410 ; (d) the output of DRAM 412 ; (e) the output of DRAM 414 ; (f) the output of DRAM 416 ; or may use any combination of these.
- location for termination the system designer can vary or tune the values and timing of termination to improve signal quality of the channel and reduce power dissipation.
- a memory controller in a DDR3 system sets termination values to different values than used in normal operation during different DRAM modes or during other DRAM, DIMM and system modes, phases, or steps of operation.
- DRAM modes can include initialization, wear-leveling, initial calibration, periodic calibration, DLL off, DLL disabled, DLL frozen, or various power-down modes.
- the logic circuit 424 may also be programmed (by design as part of its logic or caused by control or other signals or means) to operate differently during different modes/phases of operation so that a DIMM with one or more interface circuits can appear, respond to, and communicate with the system as if it were a standard or traditional DIMM without interface circuits.
- logic circuit 424 can use different termination values during different phases of operation (e.g., memory reads and memory writes) either by pre-programmed design or by external command or control, or the logic timing may operate differently.
- logic circuit 424 can use a termination value during read operations that is different from a termination value during write operations.
- DIMM 400 with the interface circuit(s) may operate differently from a standard or traditional DIMM (for example, by using different termination values or different timing than a standard DIMM), the modified DIMM would appear to the computer system/memory controller as if it were operating as a standard DIMM.
- FIG. 4 shows these internal ODT signals between logic circuit 424 and the interface circuits 420 and 422 as ODT 0 i 444 and ODT 1 i 446 .
- the number of internal ODT signals can be same, fewer, or greater than the number of ODT signals from the system/memory controller.
- interface circuit 420 and interface circuit 422 are combined into a single interface circuit, resulting in one interface circuit per slice.
- logic circuit 424 is shared by all of the interface circuits on the DIMM 400 . In these implementations, there would be one logic circuit per DIMM 400 . In yet other implementations, a logic circuit or several logic circuits are positioned on each side of a DIMM 400 (or side of a PCB, board, card, package that is part of a module or DIMM, etc.) to simplify PCB routing. Any number of logic circuits may be used depending on the type of DIMM, the number of PCBs used, or other factors.
- interface circuits and logic circuits can be integrated together into a single interface circuit.
- an interface circuit and/or logic circuit can be used on each side of a PCB or PCBs to improve board routing.
- some or all of the interface circuits and/or logic circuits can be integrated with one or more register circuits or any of the other DIMM components on an R-DIMM.

- DRAM devices 510 , 512 , 514 , and 516 can include ODT resistors 580 , which can be similar to ODT resistor 346 discussed with respect to FIG. 3B .
- DIMM 500 has virtual rank 0 540 , with DRAM devices 510 and 512 and virtual rank 1 542 , with DRAM devices 514 and 516 .
- Interface circuit 520 uses switches 562 and 564 to either couple or isolate data signals such as DQ 0 534 to the DRAM devices. Signals, for example, DQ 0 534 are received from the system through connectors e.g., finger 530 .
- a register circuit 524 provides ODT control signals on bus 566 and switch control signals on bus 568 to interface circuit 520 and/or other interface circuits. Register circuit 524 can also provide standard JEDEC register functions.
- register circuit 524 can receive inputs 572 that include command, address, control, and other signals from the system through connectors, e.g., finger 578 . In some implementations, other signals are not directly connected to the register circuit 524 , as shown in FIG. 5 by finger 576 .
- the register circuit 524 can transmit command, address, control and other signals (possibly modified in timing and values) through bus 574 to the DRAM devices, for example, DRAM device 516 . Not all the connections of command, address, control and other signals between DRAM devices are shown in FIG. 5 .
- the register circuit 524 can receive inputs ODT 0 548 and ODT 1 550 from a system (e.g., a memory controller of a host system). The register circuit 524 can also alter timing and behavior of ODT control before passing this information to interface circuit 520 through bus 566 . The interface circuit 520 can then provide DIMM termination at DQ pin with ODT resistor 560 . In some implementations, the timing of termination signals (including when and how they are applied, changed, removed) and determination of termination values are split between register circuit 524 and interface circuit 520 .
- the register circuit 524 also creates ODT control signals 570 : R 0 _ODT 0 , R 0 _ODT 1 , R 1 _ODT 0 , R 1 _ODT 1 . These signals can be coupled to DRAM device signals 552 , 554 , 556 and 558 .
- signals 552 , 554 , 556 and 558 may be hard-wired (to VSS, VDD or other potential); (b) some or all of signals 570 are created by interface circuit 520 ; (c) some or all of signals 570 are based on ODT 0 548 and ODT 1 550 ; (d) some or all of signals 570 are altered in timing and value from ODT 0 548 and ODT 1 550 ; or (e) any combination of implementations (a)-(d).

DRAMs can also be arranged with their longer sides being perpendicular to the longer edge of the PCB 600 . Alternatively, the DRAMs can be arranged such that some have long sides parallel to the longer edge of the PCB 600 and others have longer sides perpendicular to the longer edge of the PCB 600 . Such arrangement may be useful to optimize high-speed PCB routing.
