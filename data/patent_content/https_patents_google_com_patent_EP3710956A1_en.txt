Definitions
- This di sclosure relates to the field of content sharing platforms and, in particular, to comprehensibility -based identification of educational content of multiple content types.
- content sharing platforms allow users to connect to and share information with each other.
- the content sharing aspect of such platforms allows users to upload, view, and share content, such as video content, image content, audio content, text content, website, applications, channels, playlists, and so on (which may be collectively referred to as“media items” or“content items”).
- viewable and shareable content items may include audio clips, movie clips, TV clips, and music videos, as well as amateur content such as video blogging, short original videos, pictures, photos, other multimedia content, etc.
- Users may use computing devices (such as smart phones, cellular phones, laptop computers, desktop computers, netbooks, tablet computers, netwOrk-connected televisions) to use, play, and/or consume media items (e.g., watch digital videos, and/or listen to digital music).
- computing devices such as smart phones, cellular phones, laptop computers, desktop computers, netbooks, tablet computers, netwOrk-connected televisions
- media items e.g., watch digital videos, and/or listen to digital music.
- a method includes determining, by a processing device, respective comprehensibility ranking signals for content items corresponding to a user request, the comprehensibility ranking signals based on learning attribute scores generated for the content items from at least one machine learning model, determining a learning level of a user corresponding to the user request, ranking the content items based on a mapping between the learning level and the respective comprehensibility ranking signals of the content items, and providing, by the processing device, a recommendation for the content items according to the ranking of the content item s.
- the method further includes identifying a change in the learning level of the user to a new learning level, updating the recommendation for the content items based on a mapping between the new learning level and the respective comprehensibility ranking signals of the content items, and automatically updating the recommendation for the content items according to the updated ranking of the content items.

- aspects and implementations of the disclosure are directed to comprehensibility- based identification of educational content of multiple content types. Implementations are described for a learning content system that enables the identification, curation, and presentation of educational content appropriate and relevant for a comprehension level of a requesting user.
- Educational content may refer to one or more content items that are instructive, informational, academic, and/or safe (e.g., not mature, violent or explicit).
- Implementations of the disclosure may identify content that is educational and at a corresponding comprehension level for a user that is interacting with the content.
- the learning content system may identify topics (e.g., subjects, person, place, thing, etc.) that are educational to a user, identify content items (e.g., applications, videos, books, websites, etc.) for different user comprehension level groups for these topics, rank the identified content items according to comprehensibility and other metrics (e.g., interest level, etc.), and publish the content to a learning content interface of the content sharing platform.
- topics e.g., subjects, person, place, thing, etc.
- content items e.g., applications, videos, books, websites, etc.
- rank the identified content items e.g., applications, videos, books, websites, etc.
- the learning content interface may include a home screen user interface (UI) of a learning-specific application associated with the content sharing platform.
- UI home screen user interface
- Existing content curation solutions for learning and/or educational environments generally do not automate the process of identifying, curating, and presenting educational content that is appropriate and relevant for different learning levels (comprehension levels) of users.
- Existing content curation solutions for learning and/or educational environments typically provide a whitelist approach where a small set of content is hum an -selected out of an entire corpus of content.
- there may be more uploaded content to parse through than is practical for humans to review e.g., 300 hours of video uploaded to many platforms every minute; numerous applications and books and websites available and introduced on a daily basis, etc.).
- these existing solutions usually are not being performed algorithmically, do not use high volumes of content, and/or do not have a high rate of incoming, new content as well as a large volume of base content.
- a technical problem addressed by embodiments of the disclosure is that unnecessary processing resources and network bandwidth resources may be consumed by excessive communications between a client device and a server when trying to determine the ideal set of content items to curate for a user in terms of educati onal value and
- each time irrelevant and undesired content items are presented to a user as a result of a search query or a user navigation within an application the user may continue to request updated content via new search requests or additional navigation within the application.
- These additional requests are transmitted from the client device to a server to look-up content items based on the updated request.
- the server may transmit new results that include the different content items as suggestions to the client device that is displaying the search or navigation user interface.
- the data payload for transferring the updated suggestions may include a thumbnail, the full video file of the media content item, and metadata (e.g., title and description of the m edia content item).
- Sending multiple data payloads as the user enters the search query or continues to navigate can consume processing resources at the server to perform the look-ups, processing resources at the client device by displaying the list of suggested content items, network bandwidth resources by sending multiple data payloads as the updated requests are entered, and the like. This results in a slow process in the user arriving at a desired content item suggestion.
- this known solution suffers from inaccuracies in determining educational content that matches and/or is consistent with a learning level (comprehension level) of a requesting user. Moreover, these known solutions do not progressively update suggested content for the user as the comprehension level of the user changes.
- a technical solution to the above identified technical problems may include identifying content that is educational and at an appropriate learning level (comprehension level) for a user that is interacting with the content.
- a learning content system may utilize machine learning to identify content (e.g., applications, videos, books, websites, etc.) that is educational, algorithmically select such content for different user learning level (comprehension level) groups, rank the selected content according to a learning level of a user and other metrics (e.g., interest level, etc ), and publish the content to a learning content interface of a content sharing platform .
- the learning content interface may include a home screen UI of a learning specific application associated with the content sharing platform.
- the learning content platform may provide a service that identifies educational content at an appropriate learning level of users for various third party platforms (e.g., various social networking platforms, search engine platforms, media service platforms, online news platforms, content sharing platforms, etc.).
- the learning content system can continuously and/or periodically re assess the learning level of a user in order to respond to a change in the user’s learning level by dynamically and progressively update the content curation provided to the user. If a learning level of a user improves to a next level (or regresses to a lower level), the learning content system can reassess a mapping of comprehensibility ranking signals for the content items being accessed by the user to the updated learning level of the user. As a result, the learning content system can dynamically surface new and/or different content for the user and provide such content to the user without user intervention to request such updated content.
- This may be performed without any user intervention, thus providing a seamless, progressive, and relevant experience in terms of content curation (with the learning application or with other services).
- processing resources and network bandwidth are reduced as less communication occurs between the client device and a server in order to surface the most relevant, educational, and comprehensible content for the user.
- content items can be automatically installed, uninstalled and/or updated on a computing device based upon the content recommendation. For example, as the learning level of a user improves to a next level, new content that is appropriate to the new level of the user can be automatically installed on the user’s computing device, without user intervention. Similarly, old content that is no longer appropriate to the new level of the user can be automatically uninstalled from the user’s computing device, without user intervention. As another example, content that is no longer appropriate to the new level of the user can be automatically updated (e.g., by replacing the content with a different version, or by installing a plug-in), such that the updated content is appropriate to the new level of the user.
- the technical effect may include reducing the number of communi cati ons needed to surface educational content that corresponds to a learning (comprehension) level of a user. Reducing the number of communi cati ons may also reduce the processing resources (on all of a remote control, client device and backend server) and network bandwidth resources that are incurred during a search because of improved content item identification and user comprehension (learning level) matching occurring on the backend server based on machine learning models.
- machine learning is utilized to identify educational content that matches and/or is consistent with a learning level (comprehension level) of a requesting user and, moreover, that is progressively-updated without user intervention to match the user’s changing learning (comprehension) level.
- the disclosure often references videos for simplicity and brevity.
- teaching of the disclosure are applied to media items generally and can be applied to various types of content or media items, including for example, video, audio, text, images, program instructions, etc.

- the content items may be analyzed by signal generating engine 144 in response to the user initializing an application (e.g., content curated on a landing page of an application).
- the signal generation engine 144 may utilize the learning attribute scores generated by ML models 141 in a variety of ways.
- the signal generation engine 144 utilizes the learning attribute scores generated by ML models 141 to provide curated content items to a learning content interface of a learning-specific application associated with the content sharing platform 120 and/or with server 130.
- the learning- specification application may be provided to a user via media viewer 111 of client device 1 lOA-110Z More specifically, signal generation engine 144 may utilize the learning attribute scores for content items to curate content items that are educational and that are at an appropriate comprehension level for the user that is interacting with the content via the learning-specific application.
- An example user interface (UI) of a learning-specific application is discussed in more detail below with respect to FIG. 7.
- signal generation engine 144 utilizes the learning attribute scores generated by ML models 141 to generate ranking signal(s) for content items for other uses by learning content system 140 (e.g., learning tree 143 discussed further below) and for use by other platform servers 150.
- other platform servers 150 may provide services for recommending content items, such as, but not limited to, a search engine, a social network, a media service provider, an online news provider, and so on.
- the other platform servers 150 may utilize the comprehensibility ranking signal generated by signal generation engine 144 from the learning attribute scores in order to rank and/or recommend content provided by the other platform servers 150.
- the signal generation engine 144 can utilize the learning attribute scores provided by ML models 141 in different ways to provide different content curation outcomes. For example, the signal generation engine 144 may combine the learning attribute scores into a single combined comprehensibility ranking signal that is used for ranking,
- the learning attribute scores may be combined based on a variety of functions, such as an average, a weighted average, a mean, a mode, or any known mathematical function for combining numerical values to generate one or more values.
- the signal generation engine 144 may wei ght one or more of the attributes higher than the others when combining the scores based on a purpose of the curation. For example, in order to curate content items that may encourage a user to gamer additional interest in a certain subject matter area, the signal generation engine 144 may weigh the appeal and/or sparkability learning attribute scores for a content item higher than the other learning attribute scores of depth, learning impact, and developmental appropriateness. Similarly, when seeking to challenge a user with more difficult content, the developmental appropriateness learning attribute score may be weighed higher than the other learning attribute scores, and so on. In some implementations, the signal generation engine 144 can take into account a subset of the learning attribute scores, while ignoring others of the learning attribute scores.
- the signal generation engine 144 may structure the combination of the learning attribute scores in order to generate a comprehensibility ranking signal that identifies content items that a user at a particular learning level would understand but still be challenged by.
- the generation of the comprehensibility ranking signal may weigh more strongly those learning attributes (e.g., developmental appropriateness, depth) and then select the content items with higher scores which indicate that a content item is slightly more difficult than average.
- a comprehensibility ranking signal is generated by the signal generation engine 144, this signal may be passed on to the content recommendation engine 145 in order to identify content items for recommendation and/or curation.
- content recommendation engine 145 determines a learning level of a user accessing the curated content.
- the determined learning level may also be for an associated user (e.g., family member) of the user.
- the learning level of the user may be stored and maintained in learning level data 193 of data store 106.
- the learning level of the user may correlate to an educational grade level that a user is in or that a user has most-recently completed.
- the learning level may be a numerical value used to indicate the learning level of the user. However, other representations of the learning level of a user are also envisioned.
- the learning level of the user can be based on a user- provided age. Within a particular age, the learning level may be adapted based on how long as user has been at that age and/or at that particular learning level. In some implementations, the learning level of the user can be based on user artifacts including a history of user interactions with the learning-specific application and/or with the content sharing platform 120 and/or a third party content platform. In some implementations, the learning level of the user can be based on learning level metrics, such as a lexial level provided by the user or determined via interactions with the user. In further implementations, the learning level of the user can be based on a user-indicated input that indicates the learning level of the user.
- the learning level of the user may be based on any of the above factors and/or a combination of the above factors, as well as other learning level determinations.
- the learning level of the user may be determined based on application of ML to artifacts generated by the user (e.g., user history within the learning-specific application).
- a user may have more than one associated learning level.
- a user may have a first learning level associated with a first subject matter area (e.g., math), while having a second (different) learning level associated with a second subject matter area (e.g., English language arts (ELA)), and so on.
- the learning level of the user may be adjusted as the user progresses (or regresses).
- the content recommendation engine 145 may periodically assess or determine the learning level of the user in order to identify any changes in the user’s learning level.
- a learning level of an associated user to the primary user may be utilized.
- a learning level of a family member of the user may be determined and utilized in order to curate content specific to that family member.
- the content recommendation generation engine 145 may map or otherwise correspond a determined learning level of a user to the comprehensibility ranking signal generated by signal generation engine 144 for content items being curated for the user.
- the content recommendation engine 145 may map the determined learning level of a user to content items being curated by the engine 145 by identifying which learning attribute scores for the content item m ost closely align with the determi ned learning level of the user.
- the content recommendation engine 145 may utilize a variety of different approaches for mapping learning attribute scores to learning level of a user. In one impl ementation, those content items having the highest learning attribute scores for the learning level that matches the user’s learning level are ranked above other content items. For example, if a user is determined to be at a third learning level, then the content recommendation engine 145 may rank the content items having the highest learning attribute scores at the third learning level above other content items having lower learning attribute scores at the third learning level.
- the content recommendation engine 145 can surface those content items deemed to be most educational and comprehensible to a user at a third learning level.
- learning content system 140 can continuously and/or periodically re-assess the learning level of a user in order to update the content curation provided by the content recommendation engine 145 to the user. If a learning level of a user improves to a next level (or regresses to a lower level), the content recommendation engine 145 can reassess the mapping of the comprehensibility ranking signals for content items being accessed by the user to the updated learning level of the user. As a result, the content recommendation engine 145 may surface new and/or different content for the user and provide such content to the IJI generation engine 146 for presentation to the user.
- automatic may refer to performing a process without any manual input and/or user intervention from a client device or otherwise.
- processing resources and network bandwidth are reduced as less communication occurs between the client device 1 lOA-110Z and the server 130 in order to surface the most relevant, educational, and comprehensible content for the user.
- content items can be automatically installed, uninstalled and/or updated on a computing device based upon the content recommendation. For example, as the learning level of a user improves to a next level, new content that is appropriate to the new level of the user can be automatically installed on the user’s computing device, without user intervention. Similarly, old content that is no longer appropriate to the new learning level of the user can be automatically uninstalled from the user’s computing device, without user intervention. As another example, content that is no longer appropri ate to the new learning level of the user can be automatically updated (e.g., by replacing the content with a different version, or by installing a plug-in), such that the updated content is appropriate to the new level of the user.
- a particular use case of the comprehensibility ranking signal generated by signal generation engine 144 may be with a learning tree 143.
- the learning tree 143 is a data structure including information related to educational subject matter.
- the learning tree 143 is a structure into which a learning standard may be uniformly mapped into domains, sub -domains, topics, and skills.
- the learning tree 143 can be structured as a tree graph with a root node and corresponding children nodes connected to one another via edges. As such, the learning tree 143 may enable the mapping out of everything a person may learn in a standardized way (including educational subjects, as well as social and emotional skills).
- Each node in the learning tree 143 can be drilled down into more detailed information regarding an educational topic, with the base nodes (i.e., bottom nodes) including identification of content relevant to the base node.
- the base nodes may be organized according to learning level and may list the conditions for mastering the particular subject, topic, or skill at that learning level. For example, a base node
- the learning tree 143 may be utilized similar to a knowledge graph in order to map various educational subject matter areas and developmental milestones into a structured setting and provide corresponding supporting content for the information imparted by the learning tree 143.
- the comprehensibi 1 ity ranking signal may be used by content recommendation engine 145 to place content in the learning tree 143.
- Content items may be placed in the base nodes of the learning tree 143 corresponding to a learning level.
- the comprehensibility ranking can thus be used to place a particular content item into a corresponding base node. For example, a content item with its highest learning attribute scores in learning level“X” may be correspondingly placed in a base node of the learning tree 143 associated with learning level“X”.
- the identified content may then be provided to the UI generation module 146.
- the UI generation module 146 may associate formatting and other UI elements to generate a page or screen that displays the selected content as content that is educationally and comprehensively relevant to the accessing user.
- the content may be displayed via media viewer 111 on client device 1 lOA-110Z.

- the learning level of the user may be determined based on application of ML to artifacts generated by the user (e.g., user history within the learning-specific application) and/or other characteri stics of the user (e.g., user age, grade level, etc.).
- the processing device may rank the content items based on a mapping between the learning level and the respective comprehensibility ranking signals of the content items.
- the mapping may identify the learning attribute scores for the content items that most closely align with the determined learning level of the user.
- a variety of other different approaches can be used for mapping learning attribute scores to learning level of a user. For example, those content items having the highest learning attribute scores for the learning level that best correlates to the user’s learning level are ranked above other content items. As a result, those content items deemed to be most educational and comprehensible to a user at a particular learning level can be surfaced for the user.
