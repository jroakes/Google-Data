Definitions
- This specification relates to identifying a location relevant to resources indexed by a search engine.
- Search engines such as Internet search engines, identify resources, e.g. Web pages, images, text documents, and multimedia files, in response to queries submitted by users and present information about the resources in a manner that is useful to the users.
- Users of search engines are often interested in information specific to the users' locations. For example, users may want to know the local weather, or may be interested in local politics or sports. Some topics which are interesting to users of one location may be less interesting to users in a different location.
- a search engine allows a user to provide a query for which search results are returned in response.
- Some search engines can associate a location with a resource based on content of the resource, e.g., an address.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of determining a resource location for a resource from user locations associated with users who performed actions identified as having represented user interest in the resource.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Each user location may be represented by a longitude and a latitude.
- Each user location may be represented by a zip postal code.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating example users performing the same search from different locations.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example Internet search system that can use location information as will be described in this specification.
- FIG. 3A illustrates an example of a determining a location for a resource based on selection locations.
- FIG. 3B illustrates an example of determining popularity of a resource at a location.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart that represents operations of a process that determines a location for a resource.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating example users performing the same search from different locations.
- a user 102 located in Washington 104 , enters a search query “Zoo” 112 into a search interface 110 of a search engine.
- the user 102 is provided with a list of search results 122 .
- another user 106 located in Massachusetts 108 , enters a search query “Zoo” 116 into a search interface 114 of the same search engine.
- the search engine provides a list of search results 124 to the user 106 .
- Each of the search results provides information about a resource, including a link to the resource.
- search results 122 , 124 each contain search results for the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Wash. and the Southwick Zoo in Mendon, Mass.
- the user 102 located in Washington is more likely to be interested in the Woodland Park Zoo than the Southwick Zoo
- the user 106 in Massachusetts is more likely to be interested in the Southwick Zoo than the Woodland Park Zoo.
- the user 102 in Washington selects the Woodland Park search result.
- the user 106 in Massachusetts selects the Southwick Zoo search result.
- a search system can associate a location with a resource using information about the locations of users who expresses interest in search results that refer to the resource, for example by selecting the resource.
- Data associating locations with resources can be used in generating responses to subsequent searches submitted by subsequent users to improve the quality of the search results provided to the users.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example Internet search system 200 that can use location information as will be described in this specification.
- the search system receives search requests and responds with search results identifying Internet-addressable resources responsive to the requests.
- the resources can be, for example, web pages, text documents, PDF (portable document format) documents, images or videos.
- a search request is generated on a client device 202 , e.g., a personal computer or a smart phone, when a user of the device enters a search query in a search interface.
- the search interface is provided in the form of a web page that is received from the search system and displayed on a display of the user device by a program, e.g., a web browser, running on the device.
- the client device and the search system communicate over a data communication network 204 .
- the network can include the Internet and, for example, one or more cellular telephones, local area or wide area networks.
- the search request sent to the search system includes the search query and, generally, other information, including information about the user device including, in some cases, information about the geographic location of the device, e.g., GPS (global positioning system) coordinates.
- the search system maintains a log of click data 218 that associates user selections of search results 212 (i.e., selection of resources) with the associated queries and location information about the user or user device or both. From the click data, the system can determine a length of time a user spent viewing a selected resource and categorize the associated click on the search result as a long click, which can be taken as indicating user interest in the resource, or a short click, can be taken as indicating a lack of user interest in the resource.
- a user enters a query in a client device 202 .
- the client device sends a search request that includes the query over a network 204 to a search engine 206 .
- the search engine associates the user with a location based on information provided in the request or otherwise provided by the client device.
- a location identification engine 214 may determine a location of the user based on the Internet Protocol Address of the client device, or the location identification engine may determine a location of the user based on GPS coordinates provided by the client device.
- a location of the user may be determined based on location information provided from a cellular service provider.
- the cellular service provider can provide a location of a cellular communications tower to which the request was transmitted from the client device.
- the location identification engine can use information in a query log 212 describing interactions between the client device, or a user of the client device, and the search system to determine a location of the user.
- the search system can identify a location of the user through the use of cookies or other state-preserving techniques over a short session or over longer periods of time.
- the query log may indicate the user had previously searched for “Palo Alto High School” and, since users in other locations are unlikely to search for “Palo Alto High School,” determine that the user is most likely in or near Palo Alto.
- a single query in the log may not be sufficient to unambiguously determine a location.
- a user searching for “Fremont High School” may be either from Sunnyvale, Calif. or Los Angeles, Calif.
- the location identification engine may rely on multiple recent queries to determine a location.
- the location identification engine provides the location of the user to a ranking engine 216 .
- the search engine identifies search results that are responsive to the query.
- the ranking engine ranks the search results so that resources determined to be best are presented first.
- the ranking engine ranks resources using information associated with the resource, including location information.
- Conventional systems identify a location of a resource by analyzing the resource itself, for example, by examining the resource for address and telephone numbers.
- the search system returns the ranked search results to the client device in a response to the search request.
- the user of the client device may select one or more of the search results.
- the selection of the search result is communicated to the search engine.
- the search engine stores the location of the user at the time the search result is selected, as a selection location in a click data log 218 on the search system.
- the location identification engine 214 determines locations to associate with resources based on the selection locations referencing the resource.
- a location associated with the resource is defined by a central point and a dispersion, for example a statistical dispersion.
- the dispersion defines an area where the resource is most frequently selected.
- resources which have a relatively small dispersion that is, resources which have the majority of their selections in a relatively concentrated area, are designated as local resources.
- locations associated with a resource are determined by the location identification engine and a location of the user is used by the ranking engine to adjust scores associated with the search results.
- a score of a resource can be increased by an amount determined by the location of the user and a location of the resource.
- the ranking engine increases the score of the resource by a predetermined amount when the location of the user is within an area defined by the location of the resource.
- the ranking engine may increase the score of the resource based on the distance between the location of the user and the location of the resource.
- the score may be decreased when the location of the user is outside an area defined by the location of the resource.
- scores are increased or decreased only when the resource is determined to be a local resource.
- a local resource is a resource that is particularly relevant to a small geographical area.
- a local resource may be defined to be a resource where a radius of a dispersion associated with the location of the resource is less than a threshold (for example, 25 miles, 50 miles, or 100 miles).
- FIG. 3A illustrates an example of a determining a location for a resource based on selection locations.
- the geographical area for a resource is determined from an analysis of historical corresponding selection locations.
- a geographic area 302 is shown, here, the state of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.
- the geographic area analysis is not limited to states, countries, or any particular geopolitical boundary.
- Within an area a number of selection locations, representing locations where users expressed interest in the resource, are tracked, represented as the black dots 304 .
- black dots 304 For some implementations, using conventional methods of spatial distribution analysis, areas where a particular resource is popular may be identified.
- selection locations 310 that represent statistical outliers, far from other users who selected the resource, are excluded from the analysis.
- a center 306 is determined.
- the center may be identified using longitude and latitude coordinates.
- the center is the mean center of the distribution of selection locations.
- a dispersion is determined, represented by the circle 312 .
- the dispersion represents an area in which the resource is most frequently selected.
- the dispersion is defined by a standard deviation of the distance from the mean center. In general, the smaller an area of dispersion the more localized the interest in the resource, the larger the area of dispersion the less localized the interest in the resource.
- FIG. 3B illustrates an example of determining popularity of a resource at a location.
- the popularity of the resource (as measured by the number of result selections corresponding to that resource in the area) at a given location of a user 312 may be defined by the number of result selections and the distance between the location 312 and the center 306 .
- how popular the resource is determined to be depends on the distance between the location of the user 312 and the central location 306 as well as how quickly the resource's popularity disperses (e.g. the size of the dispersion area 306 ).
- Any conventional distribution function may be used to determine the popularity of the resource at a given point based on spatial probability distributions.
- an isotropic Gaussian distribution a bivariate Gaussian distribution, or other conventional cumulative distribution functions may be used.
- mixtures of Gaussians or other distribution functions, wavelets, or polygons, or any other method of representing a spatial distribution may be used.
- the popularity of the resource at a location is used to adjust the ranking of a search result referencing the resource.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart that represents operations of a process that determines a location for a resource. For convenience, the operations will be described with reference to a system that performs the operations.
- the system can be, for example, the search system 200 including the location identification engine 214 described in reference to FIG. 2 .
- the process identifies expressions of interest in a resource ( 402 ).
- a search environment one way to identify that a user expresses interest in a resource is that the user selects a search result which corresponds to the resource.
- the process requires the identification of a minimum number of users who expressed interest before determining a location for a resource, as described below. For example, the process may require fifty separate users express interest in a resource before a resource location may be determined. In general, the larger the number of users who expressed interest in the resource the greater the confidence that the locations of the users are representative of the distribution of the resource.
- a threshold confidence level can be required before associating a resource with a location. The confidence level can be calculated using conventional means. In some implementations, both a minimum number of users and a minimum confidence level can be required.
- the identification of interest is more refined. For example, a user may select a search result by accident. A user may also believe that a search result satisfies the users needs when, in fact, it does not. Generally, in response to selecting an unsatisfactory search result, the user will quickly return to the search page and select another search result, submit another query, or will abandon searching altogether.
- the process stores representations of expressions of interest over a period before associating the resource with a location. For example, the process may collect representations for three months before using the representations to determine a location for the resource. In other implementations, the process determines a location to associate with a resource after the resource has received a threshold number of expressions.
- the process stores a representation of the location of the user and the resource corresponding to the result in a database. In some implementations, the process stores the representations of the expression of interest and the resource corresponding to the search result if the selection of the result meets certain threshold criteria. For example, when the length of time a user spent viewing a selected resource exceeds a threshold. The process can filter out the expressions with shorter lengths of time. In other implementations, the process weights the location information based on the duration of time the user spends viewing the resource. Longer views are given more weight than shorter views.
- the process determines expression locations for the expressions of interest ( 404 ).
- the expression location may be an actual location identified using conventional means, for example an IP Address, GPS coordinates, or a location provided by a cellular provider.
- the expression location may also be an inferred location, identified by examining the query history of the user prior to expressing interest in the resource. For example, a user who submits the query “dentists in Berkley, Calif.” will likely select a result for a dentist in Berkley, Calif. In another scenario, a user who submits several queries targeting a specific location, for example “hotels in Paris”, “restaurants in Paris,” etc. is likely interested in Paris. In this case, an expression of interest by the user indicates that the resource is relevant to Paris.
- the expression location is determined to be Paris.
- the expression location is the location of a mobile phone on which the user expresses interest.
- the location of the mobile phone may be determined based on information identifying the cell tower or towers which receive the transmission from the cell phone.
- the location of the user is identified in terms of longitude and latitude coordinates.
- the process can also weight the expression based on a measure of confidence that the determined location of the user reflects an approximate actual location for a user. For example, GPS information provided from a client device may correspond to a high level of confidence that the determined location reflects the approximate actual location for the user. In contrast, a location of a user determined from submitted queries may correspond to a lower level of confidence.
- the process determines a resource location based on the expression locations ( 406 ).
- the resource location is based on the spatial distribution of the locations of the users.
- the resource location is identified by a mean center and a dispersion.
- the mean center is calculated by calculating the mean longitude and latitude.
- the mean longitude is calculated according to the formula:
- X is the mean longitudinal value
- N is the number of expression locations
- X i is the longitudinal value for the ith expression location.
- Y is the mean latitudinal value
- N is the number of expression locations
- Y i is the latitudinal value for the ith expression location.
- the mean center is the point defined by the mean longitudinal value and the mean latitudinal value.
- a weighted mean center may be calculated.
- the weighted mean center is calculated by determining a weighted mean longitude and a weighted mean latitude.
- the weighted mean longitudinal value is calculated according to the formula:
- X is the weighted mean longitudinal value
- N is the number of expression locations
- w i is the weight applied to the ith expression location
- X i is the longitudinal value for the ith expression location.
- the weighted mean latitudinal value is calculated according to the formula:
- Y is the weighted mean latitudinal value
- N is the number of expression locations
- w i is the weight applied to the ith expression location
- Y i is the latitudinal value for the ith expression location.
- the dispersion is a standard deviation of the distance of the expression locations.
- the standard deviation of the distance is calculated according to the formula:
- the dispersion may be defined by an ellipse, for example a standard deviation ellipse.
- the use of an ellipse allows for the possibility that the dispersion is directionally dependent, which may improve accuracy.
- the standard deviational ellipse is calculated by transposing the expression location coordinates onto a coordinate plane with an origin at the mean center (or weighted mean center), identifying an angle of rotation for the coordinate plane such that one axis represents the short axis of the ellipse, and another axis represents the long axis of the ellipse, and calculating the standard deviation along each axis.
- the angle of rotation can be calculated according to the formula:
- the standard deviation along the X′ axis of the coordinate plane can be calculated according to the formula:
- ⁇ X ⁇ ( X ′ ⁇ cos ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ - Y ′ ⁇ sin ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ) 2 N
- ⁇ X is the standard deviation along the X′ axis of the ellipse
- X′ is the transposed longitudinal coordinate
- Y′ is the transposed latitudinal coordinate
- ⁇ is the angle of rotation
- N is the number of expression locations.
- the standard deviation along the Y′ axis of the coordinate plane can be calculated according to the formula.
- ⁇ Y ⁇ ( X ′ ⁇ sin ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ + Y ′ ⁇ cos ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ) 2 N
- ⁇ Y is the standard deviation along the Y′ axis of the ellipse
- X′ is the transposed longitudinal coordinate
- Y′ is the transposed latitudinal coordinate
- ⁇ is the angle of rotation
- N is the number of expression locations.
- the resource is associated with each postal code that is located within the dispersion.
- the resource may also be associated with other geopolitical regions, for example, towns, cities, and states.
- outliers i.e., users whose locations are far outside the dispersion, are excluded from the distribution analysis.
- the resource dispersion is determined using a covariance
- ⁇ ⁇ S [ s ⁇ ⁇ 11 s ⁇ ⁇ 12 s ⁇ ⁇ 21 s ⁇ ⁇ 22 ] .
- S11, s22, and s12 can be calculated recursively using the standard identity:
- the resource dispersion can be adjusted to account for additional users who expressed interest in the resource.
- the inverse-Wishart distribution can be used as a conjugate prior for estimating the covariance matrix S.
- the cumulative variance and covariance of the distance can be estimated according to the formula:
- S 2 is the variance
- X i is the value for the ith point
- X bar is the average value
- N is the number of points.
- the cumulative covariance can be estimated according to the formula:
- S xy is the covariance
- Xi is the first variable value for the ith point (e.g. value along the first axis of a plane)
- Y i is the second variable value for the ith point (e.g. value along the second axis of the plane)
- X bar is the mean value of the first variable
- Y bar is the mean value of the second variable
- N is the number of points.
- a new point may be added and a new covariance may be calculated without recalculating the entire covariance.
- the new covariance may be calculated by storing the values for ⁇ X i Y i , ⁇ X i , ⁇ Y i and N.
