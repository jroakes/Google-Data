- Computing devices may enable a user to respond to incoming communications from one or more other computing devices.
- the incoming communications e.g., an email, a text message, a meeting request, etc.
- the incoming communications may include textual information.
- a computing device may enable a user of the computing device to respond to the incoming communication by allowing the user to input textual information (e.g., using an input device), and send the textual information to the one or more other computing devices as a response.
- Some computing devices may enable a user to choose a response stored by the computing device and send the chosen stored response, such as by providing one or more options that the user may select. For example, responsive to receiving a meeting request, a computing device may enable a user of the computing device to select a response to “accept” the meeting request, “decline” the meeting request, or choose other stored options. However, the computing device may provide only a small number of stored responses, thereby reducing the likelihood that the available stored responses include a response desired by the user. Conversely, the computing device may provide a larger number of stored responses, thereby requiring the user to search through a number of responses, which may not be useful in the current context of the incoming communication.
- a method includes receiving, by a computing system having at least one processor, from a computing device associated with a user, an indication of an incoming communication, the incoming communication including information and determining, by the computing system, based at least in part on the information included in the incoming communication, one or more candidate responses to the incoming communication, wherein each candidate response from the one or more candidate responses includes information to be sent by the computing device to at least one other computing device, and wherein at least one candidate response from the one or more candidate responses was previously selected at least at a threshold frequency by at least one of the user and one or more other users.
- the method further includes sending, by the computing system, to the computing device, a set of candidate responses from the one or more candidate responses.
- a computing system includes at least one processor and at least one module, operable by the at least one processor to receive, from a computing device associated with a user, an indication of an incoming communication, the incoming communication including information and determine, based at least in part on the information included in the incoming communication, one or more candidate responses to the incoming communication, wherein each candidate response from the one or more candidate responses includes information to be sent by the computing device to at least one other computing device, and wherein at least one candidate response from the one or more candidate responses was previously selected at least at a threshold frequency by at least one of the user and one or more other users.
- the at least one module is further operable by the at least one processor to send, to the computing device, a set of candidate responses from the one or more candidate responses.
- a computer-readable storage medium is encoded with instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor of a computing system to receive, from a computing device associated with a user, an indication of an incoming communication, the incoming communication including information and determine, based at least in part on the information included in the incoming communication, one or more candidate responses to the incoming communication, wherein each candidate response from the one or more candidate responses includes information to be sent by the computing device to at least one other computing device, and wherein at least one candidate response from the one or more candidate responses was previously selected at least at a threshold frequency by at least one of the user and one or more other users.

- the request for candidate responses may include information that was included in an incoming communication received by the computing device.
- the request may include information that was included in an incoming email, an incoming text message, an incoming application notification, an incoming calendar invite, and incoming reminder, or other incoming communication.
- the request for candidate responses may include all of the information included in the incoming communication. That is, the request may include the entire email, text message, etc.
- the request may include a portion of information.
- the request may include a date and time mentioned in the incoming communication, a location mentioned, the names of participants in a meeting, emoji, a picture, or other information.
- the request for candidate responses may, in some examples, include other information.
- the other information may include information pertaining to the computing device that sent the request and/or information pertaining to a user of the computing device that sent the request.
- a request may include a unique identifier (e.g., an ID number) identifying the user and/or the computing device that sent the request, location information indicating one or more locations of the computing device, time information indicating a time and/or time zone setting of the computing device, application information indicating an application currently being executed by the computing device and/or an activity in which the application currently being executed is engaging, communications information indicating the type of the incoming communication (e.g., email, text message, calendar alert, or other type), the type of response that the computing device will be sending, the time at which the incoming communication was received, previous communications to or from the sender, user information indicating an occupation of the user, an activity in which the user is currently engaged, contact information indicating the sender of the incoming communication, one or more recipients of the response that the computing device
- the request for candidate responses may include any information usable by one or more components of response suggestion unit 14 to determine a current context of the computing device and tailor candidate responses to better predict a response to the incoming communication.
- Communications unit 42 of response suggestion unit 14 may receive the request for candidate responses and send the request to one or more other components of response suggestion unit 14 , such as user data analysis module 50 .
- user data analysis module 50 may be operable by processors 40 to receive a request for candidate responses, obtain information from one or more other sources, and/or determine a current context for the request. That is, in some examples, user data analysis module 50 may obtain information included in a received incoming communication and other information (e.g., from the request for candidate responses or other sources) and determine a context on which to base predicted replies to the incoming communication. In some examples, user data analysis module 50 may determine a context based on the information included in the request for candidate responses.
- user data analysis module 50 may additionally or alternatively obtain supplemental information from other sources, such as an email account associated with a user of the computing device that sent the request, a social networking account of the user, web search history associated with the user, a location history associated with the user, or other sources.
- sources such as an email account associated with a user of the computing device that sent the request, a social networking account of the user, web search history associated with the user, a location history associated with the user, or other sources.
- User data analysis module 50 may only obtain supplemental information for a user if the user provides explicit permission. That is, user data analysis module 50 may only use various sources of information for predicting candidate responses if a user of the computing device that sent the request (e.g., computing device 2 ) explicitly allows response suggestion unit 14 to access the various sources. For instance, computing device 2 may prompt the user to provide a username and password for an email account, a social network service account, or other account. After receiving the information, computing device 2 may prompt the user to allow response suggestion unit 14 to access the account to obtain supplemental information. If the user explicitly agrees to allow access, computing device 2 may send an indication of the account and access credentials (e.g., a username and password or other information) to response suggestion unit 14 . If response suggestion unit 14 receives explicit permission, user data analysis module 50 may obtain supplemental information.
- computing device 2 may prompt the user to provide a username and password for an email account, a social network service account, or other account. After receiving the information, computing device 2 may prompt the user to allow response suggestion
- User data analysis module 50 may be operable by processors 40 to determine a current context of a computing device at or near the time that the computing device sent a request for candidate responses.
- User data analysis module 50 may define a current context by determining contextual elements and weights. For instance, user data analysis module 50 may determine contextual elements (e.g., based on textual information and/or other information) and weigh each contextual element based on a predicted accuracy and/or a predicted importance of the element.
- contextual elements may indicate a current location of the computing device, a time of day or current time, a type and/or name of an application being executed by the computing device, an activity in which the computing device is currently engaging, a user identification number for a user, a predicted destination of the user, a predicted mode of travel of the user, a predicted travel route of the user to the predicted destination, a predicted arrival time of the user at the predicted destination, a predicted current activity of the user, a predicted current availability of the user, a predicted future availability of the user (e.g., whether a user is available at a future point in time), a predicted time at which the user will be available, a predicted type of social relationship (e.g., professional, friendship, spouse, etc.) of the user, a predicted format of incoming communication (e.g., a status request, a status update, a request, or other format), a predicted format of response (e.g., a status update, a confirmation, an answer, etc.), a predicted tone,
- user data analysis module 50 may determine a contextual element indicating that the user of computing device 2 is currently at Location X based on location information included in the request received from computing device 2 .
- User data analysis module 50 may also determine a contextual element indicating that the person to whom the user is responding (e.g., the addressee) is at Location Y, based on information included in the request (e.g., “Are you coming to the pub?”) and/or additional information (e.g., a prior email from the addressee indicating a particular pub).
- User data analysis module 50 may further determine a contextual element indicating Location Y as a predicted destination of the user based on information included in the request (e.g., a current time) and supplemental information from an email account of the user (e.g., an email from the user to the addressee indicating that the user intends to meet the addressee at the pub at or near the current time).
- a contextual element indicating Location Y as a predicted destination of the user based on information included in the request (e.g., a current time) and supplemental information from an email account of the user (e.g., an email from the user to the addressee indicating that the user intends to meet the addressee at the pub at or near the current time).
- user data analysis module 50 may determine contextual elements indicating a predicted travel mode of the user and/or a predicted travel route of the user.
- User data analysis module 50 may determine a predicted travel mode of the user based on location information, email information, web search information, or other information. For instance, user data analysis module 50 may receive location information from computing device 2 (e.g., as part of a request for candidate responses) indicating a plurality of locations at which computing device 2 was previously located (e.g., within the last 5 minutes, the last minute, or other time period) as well as the respective times at which computing device 2 was located at each location.
- User data analysis module 50 may determine a contextual element indicating a predicted travel mode based at least in part on the distance between each of the locations. For example, for locations determined at a given time interval, a short distance between the locations (e.g., 10 feet, 50 feet, 100 feet, etc.) may cause user data analysis module 50 to determine a “walking” element. A longer distance between locations may cause user data analysis module 50 to determine an element indicating another type of transportation. User data analysis module 50 may determine predicted travel modes indicating walking, bicycle, public transportation, automobile, airplane, or other transportation mode. As another example, user data analysis module 50 may receive obtain email information indicating that the user will be driving to the predicted destination. In the example of FIG. 2 , user data analysis module 50 may determine, based on location information and/or other information, contextual element indicating that the user of computing device 2 is or will be travelling via automobile.
- a short distance between the locations e.g. 10 feet, 50 feet, 100 feet, etc.
- a longer distance between locations may cause user data analysis module 50 to determine
- User data analysis module 50 may determine a contextual element indicating a predicted travel route that a user will take to get from the user's current location to the predicted destination.
- the predicted travel route may include travel via various transportation modes, such as automobile, public transportation, bicycle, boat, airline/airplane, or other transportation mode.
- User data analysis module 50 may use map data and/or traffic data to determine the predicted travel route. That is, user data analysis module 50 may use information about one or more roadways, walkways, public transportation routes, waterways, airports, or other travel channels, as well as information about traffic conditions affecting those channels, to determine a travel route that the user may follow to reach the predicted destination.
- user data analysis module 50 may determine a contextual element indicating a series of roadways from the user's location, Location X, to the predicted destination, Location Y.
- User data analysis module 50 may also determine a contextual element indicating a predicted arrival time at the predicted destination, based on a predicted travel route and/or a predicted travel mode. After determining the predicted travel mode and predicted travel route, user data analysis module may determine the time it will take the user to use the predicted travel mode to get to the predicted destination by following the predicted travel route.
- user data analysis module 50 may determine contextual elements indicating a predicted format-of-response and/or a format-of-incoming-communication.
- User data analysis module 50 may determine a format of the response or format of the incoming communication based on received information, such as the grammar, language and/or punctuation of the incoming communication.
- user data analysis module 50 may also utilize other information, such as information from computing device 2 indicating a contact type (e.g., colleague, friend, family member, etc.) of the sender of the incoming communication.
- a contact type e.g., colleague, friend, family member, etc.
- user data analysis module 50 may determine a “status request” contextual element indicating the format of the incoming communication and a “status update” contextual element indicating the predicted format of the response.
- the determined contextual elements may be specific, such as an exact street address and/or name of an establishment as a predicted destination.
- the contextual elements may be generalized (e.g., “home” or a city name as a current location), or a range of values (e.g., “early evening” or “3:00 PM-5:00 PM” as a current time).
- user data analysis module 50 may determine a weight for each contextual element.
- the weighting may, in some examples, indicate the importance and/or certainty of the determined element. For instance, in the example of FIG. 2 , user data analysis module 50 may weigh the contextual element indicating Location X very heavily because the current location of computing device 2 is likely to be very accurate. User data analysis module 50 may weigh the contextual element indicating the sender-location category and/or for the predicted-user-destination category (e.g., Location Y) lighter, because the text “the pub” is a general location identifier and Location Y may be the incorrect pub. By determining the current context, user data analysis module 50 may determine candidate responses that are more likely to be selected by a user.
- user data analysis module 50 may use information included in an incoming communication and/or other information to predict a current context of a computing device and thereby provide candidate responses more likely to be selected based on the user's current status.
- User data analysis module 50 may provide information identifying the determined current context, including contextual elements and/or weights, to one or more other components of response suggestion unit 14 (e.g., suggestion module 16 ).
- Suggestion module 16 may be operable by processors 40 to receive a request for candidate responses and use the received current context to determine at least one candidate response to an incoming communication. That is, suggestion module 16 may receive the request (e.g., from communication units 42 ) and the current context (e.g., from user data analysis module 50 ) and output candidate responses. Suggestion module 16 may determine candidate responses by searching response data store 56 for one or more responses that have been selected at least at a threshold frequency by one or more users, and create a set of responses. In some examples, response data store 56 may limit the set of responses to those responses that include at least a portion of the content included in the incoming communication. For instance, in the example of FIG.
- suggestion module 16 may access and search response data store 56 to obtain a set of responses that each includes the words “are you coming” and end with a question mark. By searching for responses that include at least a portion of the information included in an incoming communication, suggestion module 16 may retrieve a set of responses that are more likely to have been used to respond to grammatically similar messages.
- Suggestion module 16 may determine candidate responses based on the obtained set of responses. In some examples, suggestion module 16 may output all obtained responses as candidate responses. That is, in some examples suggestion module 16 may predict candidate responses based on the received information included in an incoming communication. In other examples, suggestion module 16 may output obtained responses that are more likely to be relevant based on the current context. For instance, suggestion module 16 may determine which of the set of obtained responses are associated (e.g., “tagged”) with at least one of the received contextual elements. In some examples, any response not tagged with any of the received contextual elements may be discarded. That is, in some examples, suggestion module 16 may determine whether a particular response has been used in a similar context to the determined current context by determining whether the particular response is tagged with any of the contextual elements included in the current context.
- suggestion module 16 may determine whether a particular response has been used in a similar context to the determined current context by determining whether the particular response is tagged with any of the contextual elements included in the current context.
- suggestion module 16 may treat certain contextual elements as more important than others. For instance, suggestion module 16 may determine which contextual elements are important based on each element's corresponding weight. Suggestion module 16 may rank the obtained responses based on the contextual elements with which each of the obtained responses is tagged and the corresponding weights for the contextual elements. For instance, suggestion module 16 may sum the weights of each element with which a response is tagged to determine a candidate response score for each response. Suggestion module 16 may then order the set of responses based on the determined response scores. In other examples, suggestion module 16 may only sum the weights of the heaviest weighted elements (e.g., the 5 heaviest elements, the 10 heaviest elements, etc.) in the current context.
- the heaviest weighted elements e.g., the 5 heaviest elements, the 10 heaviest elements, etc.
- suggestion module 16 may take the frequency at which each response has previously been selected into account when ranking the obtained responses.
- Suggestion module 16 may rank the set of obtained responses in various other ways in accordance with techniques of the present disclosure. In any case, suggestion module 16 may output one or more of the ranked responses (e.g., the top 3 ranked responses, the top 5 ranked responses, etc.) as candidate responses.
- the context data may include a “status update” contextual element indicating a format-of-response.
- “Status update” may have a heavy weight associated with it (e.g., indicating that the element is important and/or likely to be accurate). Consequently, suggestion module 16 may rank responses having a “status update” tag higher than responses not tagged with “status update.” By retrieving a set of responses that was each selected at least at a threshold frequency by users, suggestion unit 16 may obtain responses from response data store 56 that are commonly used to reply to incoming communications.
- suggestion unit 16 may increase the likelihood that candidate responses are relevant to a user's current situation.
- Suggestion unit 16 may output at least one candidate response to one or more other components of response suggestion unit 14 (e.g., communication units 42 and/or aggregation module 52 ).
- communications units 42 may send the candidate responses to computing device 2 in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.
- Computing device 2 may receive a selection of a response (e.g., corresponding to a user performing a gesture at UI device 4 ) and computing device 2 may send the selected response to one or more recipients.
- the selected response may correspond to a candidate response or a custom response (e.g., a response created by the user of computing device 2 ).
- computing device 2 may also send an indication of the selected response to response suggestion unit 14 .
- Communication units 42 may receive the indication and send the indication to one or more other components of response suggestion unit 14 (e.g., aggregation module 52 ).
- Aggregation module 52 may be operably by processors 40 to receive one or more candidate responses, a determined current context used to determine the candidate responses, and/or an indication of a selected response and may cause response data store 56 to store or update relevant information based on the received information. For instance, aggregation module 52 may receive contextual elements and weights from user data analysis module 50 , candidate responses from suggestion module 16 , and an indication of a selected response from computing device 2 . Aggregation module 52 may be responsible, at least in part, for creating and/or updating the repository of responses and associated information (e.g., response data store 56 ) for determining what responses are applicable for a determined context.
- aggregation module 52 may tag the selected response with the proper values from the context data, and add the response to response data store 56 . That is, aggregation module 52 may create a new entry in response data store 56 and store at least an indication of the manually entered response. In order to determine the context in which the response was manually entered and selected, aggregation module 52 may store additional information associated with the response. The additional information may include at least an indication of the incoming communication to which the response was used as a response and/or one or more contextual elements determined based on a corresponding request. Aggregation module 52 may store the additional information as tags usable by suggestion module 16 to compare to a current context determined from future requests.
- aggregation module 52 may modify a frequency value, stored in response data store 56 , associated with the candidate response that was selected. For instance, in the example of FIG. 2 , the user of computing device 2 may select response option 24 B, and response suggestion unit may receive an indication of the selection. Aggregation unit 52 may increase the frequency value of the associated response (e.g., “I'm on my way!”) within response data store 56 .
- aggregation module 52 may modify one or more of the frequency values associated with the candidate responses that were not selected. That is, in some examples, aggregation module 52 may reduce the frequency associated with the un-selected responses, thereby making it less likely that the un-selected responses will be sent to a user in the future. In this way, aggregation module 52 may keep response data store 56 up to date in order to more accurately predict candidate responses.
- response data store 56 may store one or more responses, contextual elements associated with each of the one or more responses, and/or a frequency with which the responses were selected by one or more users.
- Responses, associated frequency information, and/or context data may be stored within response data store 56 using a range of one or more data structures, such as an array, a list, a database, a structured file (such as a file encoded using a markup language) or other data structure. That is, response data store 56 may contain data in any format capable of being created and/or accessed by one or more other components of response suggestion unit 14 .
- response data store 56 may include information received from users and/or information provided by managers or administrators of response suggestion unit 14 .
- response data store 56 may receive instructions from one or more modules of response suggestion unit 14 (e.g., aggregation module 52 ) to create or modify data within response data store 56 .
- response data store 56 may require administrator approval before storing or modifying information. Requiring administrator approval before storing or modifying information may help to ensure that erroneous or inappropriate responses are not stored and thus not suggested as subsequent candidate responses.
- response data store 56 may automatically store information as instructed by aggregation module 52 , such as when other management procedures are used.
- response suggestion unit 14 may decrease the time and/or effort required to respond to incoming communications. Furthermore, by receiving an indication of a selected response and updating a database of stored responses and associated context information, response suggestion unit 14 may provide accurate candidate responses that are more likely to be relevant to a user's current situation. Consequently, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure, the user may be presented with at least one response option that he or she may select to send as a response to an incoming communication thereby reducing the likelihood that the user will need to manually enter a response.
- FIGS. 3A and 3B are conceptual diagrams illustrating example GUIs for providing candidate responses to an incoming communication, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- the examples of FIGS. 3A and 3B are described below within the context of FIGS. 1 and 2 .
- GUIs 100 and 110 may be outputted for display by an internal display device of computing device 2 .
- GUIs 100 and 110 may be outputted by one or more components of computing device 2 for display at an external display device and/or at a remote computer device.
- Computing device 2 may output GUI 100 of FIG. 3A in response to receiving user input associated with a manual entry mode. For instance, computing device 2 may output GUI 100 in response to receiving a user's selection of manual entry option 26 of FIG. 1 . That is, computing device 2 may receive an incoming communication (e.g., from another computing device) and, subsequent to receiving the incoming communication, computing device 2 may receive an instruction to respond to the incoming communication from the user. In accordance with the techniques of the present disclosure, computing device 2 may send a request for candidate responses to response suggestion unit 14 and receive at least one candidate response in return. After displaying the at least one candidate response, computing device 2 may receive a selection of manual entry option 26 .
- an incoming communication e.g., from another computing device
- computing device 2 may send a request for candidate responses to response suggestion unit 14 and receive at least one candidate response in return. After displaying the at least one candidate response, computing device 2 may receive a selection of manual entry option 26 .
- Manual entry mode may enable a user to input a custom response at computing device 2 .
- the user may input a custom response by selecting characters on a keyboard or a graphical keyboard.
- the user may input a response by speaking the custom response (e.g., using voice-to-text transcription) or inputting the custom response in some other fashion.
- computing device 2 may have received input corresponding to displayed text 102 .
- displayed text 102 includes “That's 30 minutes away. I'll be there in 10.”
- computing device 2 may subsequently receive input from the user to send displayed text 102 as a custom response to the incoming communication. Responsive to receiving the input, computing device 2 may send the custom response to one or more other computing devices (e.g., as a text message, an email, or other communication). In accordance with techniques of the present disclosure, computing device 2 may also send at least an indication of the custom response to response suggestion unit 14 .
- Response suggestion unit 14 may receive the indication and provide the indication to aggregation module 52 .
- response data store 56 may not previously have received and/or stored a response that corresponds to displayed text 102 . That is, FIG. 3A may represent the first time that response suggestion unit 14 received the particular custom response. Consequently, Aggregation unit 52 may associated the response with the corresponding incoming communication and tag the custom response with the appropriate contextual elements (e.g., received from user data analysis module 50 ). Tags may include any contextual elements associated with the custom response. In the example of FIG.
- the custom response may be tagged with a geographical location of computing device 2 (e.g., Location X), a format-of-incoming-communication (e.g., “status request”), a format-of-response (e.g., “status update”), a value indicating the computing device (e.g., computing device 2 ) and/or a tag indicating the user, and other contextual elements.
- Aggregation module 52 may then store the custom response, corresponding incoming communication, and contextual elements in response data store 56 for potential future use as described herein.
- Computing device 2 may subsequently receive a second incoming communication. For instance, computing device 2 may receive a text message including the text “We're at the restaurant.” After receiving the incoming communication, computing device 2 may receive input instructing computing device 2 to respond to the incoming communication. Computing device 2 may send a request for candidate responses to response suggestion unit 14 , including information from the second incoming communication and/or other information (e.g., location information).
- a second incoming communication For instance, computing device 2 may receive a text message including the text “We're at the restaurant.” After receiving the incoming communication, computing device 2 may receive input instructing computing device 2 to respond to the incoming communication. Computing device 2 may send a request for candidate responses to response suggestion unit 14 , including information from the second incoming communication and/or other information (e.g., location information).
- Response suggestion unit 14 may receive the request, and provide at least a part of the information included in the request to user data analysis module 50 .
- User data analysis module 50 may analyze the textual information and/or the other information to determine a current context for computing device 2 . For instance, based on the textual information, and other information, user data analysis module 50 may determine various contextual elements and associated weights and send the current context to suggestion module 16 .
- the current context may include a contextual element indicating the user of computing device 2 .
- the element may be a unique identifier based on information received from computing device 2 , such as a phone number, a device ID number, or other information. That is, the user ID may be an arbitrary value assigned to a user and/or computing device. The user ID element may have a very heavy associated weight (e.g., because the certainty of the user ID is high). Consequently, suggestion module 16 may treat responses tagged with the same user ID as more contextually relevant than other responses that are not tagged with the user ID. In this way, suggestion module 16 may dynamically treat custom responses of a particular user as more important and/or appropriate for that user than responses received from other users. In other words, responses the user has previously selected may be treated as more relevant than other responses.
- suggestion module 16 may not select a response as a candidate response unless and until the response has been used at least a threshold number of times. That is, in some examples aggregation module 52 may store a new response, such as a received custom response, but suggestion module 16 may not select the new response as a candidate response until response suggestion unit 14 has received the custom response as a selected response a threshold number of times.
- response suggestion unit 14 may ensure that custom responses are suggested only after gaining a sufficient amount of popularity. For instance, while described in the examples of FIGS.
- suggestion module 16 may only output the response corresponding to displayed text 102 as a candidate response after response suggestion unit 14 has received the response as a selected response a threshold number of times (e.g., 3 times, 5 times, 10 times, etc.).
- a current context may include a contextual element indicating a level of deference.
- the level of deference may indicate a level of deference or apology to be used in a response.
- User data analysis module 50 may, in some examples, determine a level of deference based on information indicating the number of times the user has received an incoming communication having a similar context (e.g., from the same sender, of the same format, etc.). For instance, the information may indicate the number of times within a period of time (e.g., an hour, a day, a week, etc.) the user has received similar incoming communications from the sender. In other examples, the level of deference may be based on other information, such as the information included in the incoming communication.
- user data analysis module 50 may determine an “apologetic” contextual element, based on textual information and/or other information (e.g., information included in the request for candidate responses or from other sources). For instance, user data analysis module 50 may receive an indication that the user of computing device 2 has recently received multiple messages having a similar context from the sender of the current message. That is, in the examples of FIGS. 3A and 3B , the sender of the second incoming message, “We're at the restaurant,” may have recently sent two or three previous incoming messages to the user of computing device 2 . Based on the received current context, suggestion module 16 may select, as candidate responses, responses having an appropriate level of deference by selecting responses tagged with the “apologetic” element.
- suggestion module 16 may select, as candidate responses, responses having an appropriate level of deference by selecting responses tagged with the “apologetic” element.
- techniques of the present disclosure may enable suggestion module 16 to account for a level of deference when selecting candidate responses by only keeping responses in the set that includes a proper tag. For instance, suggestion module 16 may not select an “I'm on my way!” response as a candidate response because it was not tagged with an “apologetic” element. Suggestion module 16 may instead select an “I'm sorry. I'm on my way!” response, because it was tagged with the “apologetic” element (among other tags). In other examples, suggestion module 16 may account for certain contextual elements by modifying one or more of the obtained responses to determine the candidate responses.
- suggestion module 16 may obtain a set of responses selected at least at a threshold frequency, rank the obtained responses based on various weights for contextual elements, and then modify one or more of the ranked responses based on other contextual elements, such as a level of deference, a predicted travel duration, or other contextual elements. For instance, suggestion module 16 may obtain responses from response data store 56 and rank the obtained responses based on weights for one or more contextual elements of the current context. Suggestion module 16 may then modify one or more of the ranked responses, based on the “apologetic” contextual element. In such instance, suggestion module 16 may, for example, add the text, “I'm sorry” to the beginning of a response to form a candidate response.
- suggestion module 16 may modify a numerical value within a response to accurately reflect the current context (e.g., a predicted-arrival-time, a duration-of-activity, etc.). That is, in various examples, response suggestion unit 14 may use the determined current context to determine candidate responses in a variety of ways in accordance with the techniques of the present disclosure.
- a candidate response may be tagged with elements not included in the current context.
- a candidate response may not be tagged with all contextual elements included in the current context. That is, suggestion module 16 may output, as a candidate response, a response tagged with contextual elements corresponding to heavy weights, even if the response is not tagged with all contextual elements in the current context, or is tagged with values not in the current context. For instance, a response may not be tagged with the “apologetic” element, but may still be outputted as a candidate response, because the response is tagged with a number of other heavily weighted contextual elements.
- response suggestion unit 14 may send the candidate responses to the computing device from which the request was received.
- FIG. 3B includes GUI 110 .
- Computing device 2 may output GUI 110 in response to receiving the candidate responses from response suggestion unit 14 .
- GUI 110 includes background 112 and response selection area 114 .
- Response selection area 114 may be presented in a manner visually different from background 112 .
- background 112 may be shown in a different color than 114 .
- background may be shown out of focus and/or shaded, while response selection area 114 may be clearer and/or un-shaded.
- background 112 is shaded darker than response selection area 114 .
- response selection area 114 includes response options 116 A- 116 D (collectively, “response options 116 ”).
- Response options 116 may, in some examples, each represent a candidate response outputted by response suggestion unit 14 based at least in part on the determined current context of computing device 2 .
- suggestion module 16 may output a first candidate response corresponding to response option 116 A, “I'll be there in approximately 15 minutes,” based on a number of contextual elements, such as a “status request” element, a user-location element, Location X, a predicted-destination element, Location Z (e.g., the restaurant), and a predicted-arrival-time element, “15 minutes.”
- response option 116 B e.g., the custom response previously entered by the user
- Response options 116 C and 116 D may each correspond to candidate responses selected based at least on an “apologetic” element of the determined current context.
- response suggestion unit may enable computing device 2 to allow a user to select a response that is relevant to the user's current situation, without having to manually enter the response. Additionally, by receiving an indication of selected responses, response suggestion unit 16 may more accurately predict candidate responses for future requests.
- FIGS. 4A and 4B are conceptual diagrams illustrating example GUIs for providing candidate responses to an incoming communication, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The examples of FIGS. 4A and 4B are described below within the context of FIGS. 1 and 2 .
- GUIs 150 and 170 may be outputted for display by an internal display device of computing device 2 . In other examples, GUIs 150 and 170 may be outputted by one or more components of computing device 2 for display at an external display device and/or at a remote computer device.
- GUI 150 may include various information from an incoming communication (e.g., an email), such as a subject of the incoming communication (e.g., “Meeting to discuss hiring Mr. F”), a sender of the incoming communication (e.g., “Erica Davis”), and body text for the incoming communication.
- GUI 150 may include more or different information from the incoming communication.
- GUI 150 may also include one or more selectable options, such as reply option 152 . Responsive to receiving input indicating a selection of reply option 152 , one or more components of computing device 2 may generate and send a request for candidate responses, in accordance with the techniques of the present disclosure. That is, when computing device 2 receives instructions to enable the user to respond to the incoming communication, computing device 2 may generate a request including an indication of at least part of the information included in the incoming communication. In the examples of FIGS.
- the request for candidate responses may include information indicating the sender of the email, the recipient of the email (e.g., “Bob Andrews”), the subject of the email, the time at which the email was delivered, and at least a part of the body text of the email.
- the request for candidate responses may include the date and time mentioned in the body text of the email.
- the request for candidate responses may also include other information, such as location information (e.g., determined by device location module 8 ), a device identifier, a user identifier, a current time, a type of incoming communication, or other information.
- location information e.g., determined by device location module 8
- the request for candidate responses may include location information identifying a sequence of determined locations (e.g., the 10 most recent determinations).
- the request may also include an identifier of computing device 2 , an identifier of the user (e.g., Bob Andrews), stored contact information for the sender of the email, and other information.
- Computing device 2 may send the request for candidate responses to response suggestion unit 14 .
- response suggestion unit 14 may receive the request for candidate responses, and determine a current context of computing device 2 representing the context within which the response to the incoming communication is to be sent.
- one or more components of response suggestion unit 14 e.g., user data analysis module 50
- user data analysis module 50 may obtain additional information upon which to determine the current context. For instance, user data analysis module 50 may receive permission from the user to access a calendar of the user, a social networking service account of the user, or other source of information.
- Response suggestion unit 14 may use the received textual information and/or other information to determine a current context.
- user data analysis module 50 may determine a contextual element indicating a user ID for Bob Andrews, a contextual element indicating the sender of the incoming communication (e.g., “Erica Davis”), a contextual element indicating the type of incoming communication (e.g., “email”), and a contextual element indicating the type of response (e.g., “email”) based at least in part on the information included in the request.
- User data analysis module 50 may determine a “professional” contextual element indicating a social-relationship between the user (e.g., Bob Andrews) and the sender of the incoming communication (e.g., Erica Davis).
- User data analysis module 50 may determine the social-relationship based at least in part on the contact information received with the request (e.g., information identifying Erica Davis as a work colleague).
- User data analysis module 50 may, in the examples of FIGS. 4A and 4B , obtain additional information from a calendar service of the user. Based at least in part on the obtained information, user data analysis module 50 may determine a contextual element, “busy,” corresponding to a predicted future availability of the user. That is, user data analysis module 50 may determine that Bob Andrews is busy at the requested meeting time and determine a contextual element accordingly. Additionally, user data analysis module 50 may determine a contextual element indicating an available time. For instance, user data analysis module 50 may determine the nearest available time to the requested meeting time, the nearest block of time that meets a threshold size (e.g., 1 hour, 2 hours, etc.), or other indicator of an available time. In the examples of FIGS.
- a threshold size e.g., 1 hour, 2 hours, etc.
- user data analysis module 50 may determine “Wednesday, May 31, 2013 1:00 PM-3:00 PM” as the available time category. That is, user data analysis module 50 may determine that the user is busy during the requested day and time, but is available during the afternoon on the requested day.
- User data analysis module 50 may determine a contextual element indicating a predicted mode of travel based at least in part on location information included in the request. For instance, user data analysis module 50 may determine a contextual element indicating a motor vehicle or automobile, a bike, public transportation, a plane, a train, walking, or other mode of travel. In the examples of FIGS. 4A and 4B , the location information may indicate a series of consecutive points on a roadway. The points may be sufficiently spread out as to indicate that computing device 2 is travelling at a relatively high velocity (e.g., over 10 miles per hour, over 40 miles per hour, etc.). Based at least in part on this determination, user data analysis module 50 may determine an “automobile” element.
- a relatively high velocity e.g., over 10 miles per hour, over 40 miles per hour, etc.
- user data analysis module 50 may determine weights for one or more of the determined elements. Each weight may correspond to the predicted accuracy and/or importance of the associated contextual element. For instance, user data analysis module 50 may determine a heavy weight for a contextual element that is an important part of the current context, such as an element indicating a format of the incoming communication or a format of the response, or for a contextual element that is very likely to be accurate, such as an element indicating a user or a user location. User data analysis module 50 may determine a lighter weight for a contextual element that is less important or less probable. In the examples of FIGS.
- user data analysis module 50 may determine relatively heavy weights for the contextual elements indicating the type of response, the type of incoming communication, the user, the sender, the predicted future availability, the social relationship, and the format of the incoming communication.
- User data analysis module 50 may determine relatively lighter weights for the contextual elements indicating the format of the response, the predicted mode of travel, and the available time.
- user data analysis module 50 may provide the determined current context (including the contextual elements and the associated weights) to suggestion module 16 and aggregation module 52 in accordance with the techniques of the present disclosure.
- Suggestion module 16 may access response data store 56 and obtain a set of responses that were selected at least at a threshold frequency by the user of computing device 2 and/or other users, and that were used to respond to incoming communications that included at least a portion of the information included in the request (e.g., “Meeting to discuss [subject]” and/or “discuss [topic] with [participants] on [date/time].”) That is, suggestion module 16 may obtain a set of responses that includes responses selected at least at the threshold frequency and that were used to respond to an incoming communication that is the same or similar to the incoming communication indicated by the present request for candidate responses. After obtaining the set of responses, suggestion module may use the current context to determine candidate responses.
- suggestion module may use the current context to determine candidate responses.
- suggestion module 16 may discard obtained responses that are not tagged with at least one contextual element of the current context. That is, suggestion module 16 may only keep responses that are tagged with at least one contextual element of the current context, and thus are associated with a context that is the same or similar to the determined current context. Additionally or alternatively, suggestion module 16 may rank the responses based at least in part on the weights included in the current context. That is, suggestion module 16 may determine one or more tags of a response and determine a score for the response based at least in part on the weights associated with contextual elements corresponding to the tags. Suggestion module 16 may output, as a candidate response, at least one obtained response.
- suggestion module 16 may output, as candidate responses, all responses obtained from response data store 56 , all obtained responses that are tagged with at least one contextual element included in the current context, or any number of the obtained responses that are ranked most highly.
- the at least one candidate response may be sent by response suggestion unit 14 to computing device 2 .
- computing device 2 may display output GUI 170 for display in response to receiving the candidate responses from response suggestion unit 14 .
- GUI 170 includes response selection area 172 .
- Response selection area 172 includes response options 174 A- 174 D (collectively, “response options 174 ”) as well as custom response option 176 , response preamble 178 and response conclusion 180 .
- Response preamble 178 and/or response conclusion 180 may represent general elements applicable to all response options.
- Response preamble 178 and/or response conclusion 180 may be determined by computing device 2 , by response suggestion unit 14 , or some combination thereof.
- computing device 2 may determine a response preamble and a response conclusion based on information included in an incoming communication (e.g., the sender's name), user preferences (e.g., an email signature), or other information.
- response suggestion unit 14 may determine response preamble 178 and response conclusion 180 based at least in part on the “email” contextual element indicating the type of response and/or the “professional” contextual element indicating the social relationship.
- GUI 170 includes response options 174 .
- Response options 174 may correspond to candidate responses received from response suggestion unit 14 , responses stored at computing device 2 , responses stored at computing device 2 but modified by response suggestion unit 14 , responses received from response suggestion unit 14 but modified by computing device 2 , or some combination thereof.
- each of response options 174 may represent a candidate response outputted by suggestion module 16 and received from response suggestion unit 14 .
- the response corresponding to response option 174 A may have been selected or used by the user of computing device 2 in a number of previous contexts that are similar to the determined current context. That is, because the response is tagged with the relevant user value (e.g., a contextual element having a heavy weight), the response may be ranked highly by suggestion module 16 even though the “automobile” element was associated with a lighter weight.
- suggestion module 16 may rank the responses corresponding to response option 174 B and 174 C highly based at least in part on the high weight associated with the “busy” contextual element.
- Response option 174 B may correspond to a slightly higher ranked response than response option 174 C, because the contextual element indicating the available time may be associated with a very light weight. That is, in some examples, if the associated weight (e.g., a negative value) indicates that a contextual element is uncertain, responses that are not tagged with the uncertain contextual element may be ranked higher than those that are tagged with the uncertain element.
- the associated weight e.g., a negative value
- computing device 2 may receive input indicating a selection of one of response options 174 or custom response option 176 .
- computing device 2 may generate the response (e.g., including response preamble 178 , the selected option, and response conclusion 180 ) and send the response to one or more other computing devices. That is, computing device 2 may enable the user to select an option and send a response to the incoming communication.
- computing device 2 may send at least an indication of the selected response to response suggestion unit 14 .
- response suggestion unit 14 may more accurately predict relevant responses to subsequent incoming communications.
