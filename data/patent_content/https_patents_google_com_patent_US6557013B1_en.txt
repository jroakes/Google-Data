Definitions
- This invention relates generally to a system and method for managing the workflow associated with a story and in particular to a system and method for managing the workflow associated with the preparation, editing and creation of a story.
- a story may be created, such as a newspaper, a television newscast, a cable service, or a company who is generating success stories associated with their products
- the management of the workflow associated with the creation of a story is very difficult.
- the creation of a story may include receiving a submission for a new story, rating the story idea, checking the story's facts, writing the story and preparing the story for publishing.
- each step of the process was completed by one or more different people, but no one was easily able to monitor the entire story workflow process. Therefore, it is difficult to ensure that the entire process was completed correctly and that each step was in fact completed. It is also difficult for a person trying to manage the story workflow to ensure each step is being completed in a timely manner. It is also difficult to ensure that each story being generated is factually accurate.
- it is also difficult to implement a quality control process due to the large number of steps in the process and the large number of people involved in the process.
- the story workflow management process is equally complex. In this process, it is necessary to screen incoming success story submissions to remove the unwanted submissions. Then, it is necessary to check the submission's accuracy and, if the submission is accurate, the writing of the success story must be assigned to a writer. The writer then has to check all the facts (i.e. find the person, get the story and quotes, get the appropriate releases, get images and other media as required, have those media prepared for publication, etc.) and get everybody to sign off on what's been done. Once the writer has completed the story, it must be edited and prepared for publication. In a typical success story creation process within a corporation, the submissions for success stories are difficult to obtain.
- success story program In one type of success story program, one or more people in the organization are assigned to find and develop leads and turn them into stories. These people usually have one or more other assigned tasks which are their primary responsibility, and usually lack training in the skills required to do success stories. The results of this type of success story program is slow story turnaround, poor quality stories, few and often outdated stories, poor legal documentation and high hidden costs. The stories are also generally handled at a divisional level and therefore never centralized in a useful manner. In another success story program, the persons assigned to find and develop leads and turn them into stories bring in one or more outside contractors, such as individual freelancer writers, PR companies, or the like.
- a story workflow management system and method are provided in which each step of the story creation process from initial lead generation to final publication of the story is tracked so that the entire story creation process is more easily managed.
- the system integrates the various story creation processes into a single controlled process.
- the system permits the traditional story generation process to be automated and the speed of the story generation increased while the quality control for the stories is also increased.
- the integrated system provides various advantages to the story creation process including reduced costs to create a story, increased speed with which a story is prepared, and various features not typically available to a story writer.
- the system is also robust, compatible with other existing systems and networks and it very flexible.
- the end users may submit story submissions to the system about particular products and the system may provide a mechanism for processing the incoming submissions ideas and leads in an efficient manner.
- the system may store unformatted story contents so that the published story may be quickly published automatically by the system in a variety of different formats, such as a hardcopy of the story, a Postscript Display Format (PDF) file and the like.
- PDF Postscript Display Format
- the system may also permit leads for story submissions to be tracked so that a lead for a new story is not lost.
- the system also may be easily integrated into a corporate Intranet computer network and with other prior legacy databases.
- the system may also gather together the success stories spread throughout a corporation.
- the system also allows for more time and space flexibility for everybody in the process since the story creation is not constrained by location or time (i.e., everybody can work on it from anywhere at any time).
- the system also reduces the dependency on any one individual because this is a formalized system and the steps are defined and documented so that less skilled people may accomplish the same tasks typically completed by a more skilled person.
- the system is also easy scaled in size to increase the number of stories being created.
- the system also accumulates a central knowledge base for continually improving the story creation process based on ongoing experiences.
- the system may track visitors through the integrated web system, the system may track the visitor's interests and preferences and provide feedback to our customers which allows them to tune their marketing and products.
- the system permits a large number of story submissions to be generated so that the best stories (high quality control) may be picked from the submissions to create the stories.
- the system may include a server which is executing one or more software applications which implement various steps in the story creation process.
- the software applications may include a submission application for managing the story submission process, a writer application for managing the story rating and story creation process, an administrative application for controlling the access to the system and editorial review as well as managing and maintaining the data contained in the database space,and a publisher application for generating a published story in a variety of different formats.
- the system may also include a database for storing information about each submission and each completed story.
- the administrative system provides an overview of the system for an administrator, allows control of certain system data, controls the user permissions to access particular data so that different people who access the system may be able to view different information about the stories being prepared based on the privileges given to the person.
- the system may include an access database containing information about the web pages available in the system.
- the database may also include each different access level in the system and what web pages each different user may view. For example, a person submitting a story may only access and view the submission web pages while an editor may view all of the current stories being processed and their progress towards completion (see FIGS. 4A and 4B for example).
- the system may have a user interface which is generated to provide users of the system, including story submitters, story researchers, story writers, story editors, system administrators, system customers, sub-contractors, partners and others, with guidance through the process.
- WWW World Wide Web
- one or more web pages are generated as the user interface.
- the system may generate these user interface screens dynamically as each user accesses the system.
- each user accessing the system may have a predetermined security level based on the user's intended use of the system. Based on the predetermined security level, pieces of data are retrieved from a database and the user interface for the particular user is generated based on the retrieved data.
- each user only views the data in the user interface screen which the user has the privileges to view to provide security for the stories being generated.
- the user interface screens in the system are customizable to integrate seamlessly with the current look and feel of a customer's web site, for example, so that not only can different content be made accessible to different users based on the access privileges, but different versions of the same content as well as different presentations of that content may be provided to different users.
- the system may receive a submission form through the submission application system.
- the system may include a pre-qualification system for finding and generating leads and following up on the leads to have them pre-qualified (i.e., determine that the story is valuable and should be created.
- the system requests a submission from the featured person, and this submission is matched with the data from the pre-qualification and tracking system.
- This integrated pre-qualification and tracking system is valuable to clients because it provides their project managers with a simple method of generating leads and ensuring that leads don't fall through the cracks once they have signed off on them.

- Each client computer 24 may be a typical personal computer having a central processing unit which executes a browser application so that the user of the client computer may log onto the server 22 .
- the users of the client computers may include different people who may have different privilege or access rights to the data stored on the server.
- the different people may include one or more people who submit stories to the system (Submitter # 1 -Submitter #N), one or more story researchers writers (Researcher # 1 -Researcher #N) who research the story submissions, one or more writers (Writer # 1 -Writer #N) who write the stories (in some cases the story research and story writing may be done by the same person), one or more Editors (Editor # 1 -Editor #N) who oversee and edit these stories and a corporate manager (Manager) who wishes to review the current stories being processed for a particular corporation.
- a submission system as described below may be intelligent and may modify its actions or the data it displays based on the privileges of the user who requests the data.
- the forms content can be checked to ensure that certain minimum content requirements have been provided and an acknowledgment and receipt are automatically generated for the submitter or a request to fix any problems is generated. All of the submitted data may be automatically transferred into the workflow production system with an original copy of the submission data being preserved as write-only to ensure that it cannot be modified.
- An on-line help system is available to help user through the submission system.
- the resultant story may be output over a communications link, such as the Internet or e-mail, to a corporate web site 28 which stores the finished success stories in a database 30 and displays the success stories to client computers who access the corporate web site.
- the system may also store a copy of the story in its own database as described below.
- the system may also publish the story on its own success story website.
- the story, in accordance with the invention may be sent to the corporate web site using a variety of different delivery techniques, such as via fax, FedEx or anything else.
- the story is stored in the system's database and the corporate site's system requests a page containing a story from the system and then displays the story page within their website.
- the final version of the story is stored on a database in the corporate website maintained by the system and data is published locally into their website.
- each of the story creation sub-systems may operate independently of each other so that stories, for example, may be submitted at any time from anywhere in the world and automatically stored in the database.
- the story creation process as described below, is broken into a plurality of independent steps some of which may be performed out of order and at any time.
- the system automatically keeps track of the completed and uncompleted steps so that any authorized user of the system, such as researchers, writers, editors, administrators, customers, partners, etc., may quickly determine the status of any story.
- the system permits the steps to be completed at any time of the day or night to suit the work habits of different people. Now, more details of the sub-systems in the server will be described.
- the server 22 may include a submission application system 32 , a writer system 34 , an administration/security system 36 , a publisher system 38 , a help system 39 , a database 40 , a central processing unit (CPU) 42 , a memory 44 and a multi-media processing system 45 .
- the memory 44 may include any type of data storage system such as a semiconductor memory, such as a RAM, EEPROM, ROM or the like, a hard disk drive system, a tape drive storage system or the like.

- the system may also include a reporter system (not shown) which may sort the data in the database and/or in the pages being displayed to a user.
- the submission application system 32 may generate a user interface, as described in more detail below with reference to FIGS. 2A-2C, to gather information from a user about a possible story idea (a submission).
- the submission application system 32 automatically store the gathered information in the database 40 in a new story record with a unique numeric identifier.
- the submission application system may also include a lead generation system which may, for example, automatically generate messages, such as e-mail messages or Usenet postings, requesting that users submit story submissions.
- the submission application system may automatically post a message to a Usenet group relating to a particular product requesting success story submissions for the product or an editor using the system may also attempt to generate new leads. In this manner, the system 20 attempts to gather new story submissions from the users of the products.
- the submission application system 32 may also direct the user submitting a story, in certain circumstances, to fill out and send in a release form as will be described below with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the writer system 34 may permit a writer to rate the story submissions stored in the database, to manage the fact gathering process (i.e., researching the story) if the story submission is approved by an editor and to manage the writing of the story by a writer, and to manage the final pre-publications processing of a completed story.
- the writer system may also permit an editor to manage all of the writer stages of the story creation process including the final pre-publication processing of a completed story, and to edit or kill the story at any time during the story generation process. The details of these functions will be described below with reference to FIGS. 4-11.
- the information about the story is stored in the database 40 .
- the database also stores information about the status of each pending story.
- the administrator system 36 may control the access to the submission application and writer systems.
- the user accessing the submission application system 32 cannot access any information about other stories stored in the database using the submission application (since they do not have the appropriate privileges) while a writer, researcher or editor of stories may be able to access his/her own story and brief information about other stories.
- a supervisory editor may be able to access detailed information about every story to check the progress of each story and possibly send a reminder to a writer who has not completed a story, for example.
- a plurality of different security levels may be assigned to different users of the system to ensure that a particular user only views data which the user has the appropriate privileges to view.
- the administration system 36 also performs data maintenance and management functions.
- the user of the administration system may have the privileges to modify or delete data within the database which other users cannot modify or delete.
- the publisher 38 may generate a downloadable version of the generated success story so that a salesman, for example, may take a hard copy of the success story along with him on a sales visit.
- the publisher may also forward the completed, ready-to-be-published success story to the corporate web site 28 .
- the help system 39 may provide the users of the system with on-line help with any of the systems at any time in addition to step-by-step instructions provided in the user interface screens.
- the database 40 may store various pieces of information about each story including the steps completed in the story creation process, the submitted story idea, the written story and information about the person who submitted the story.
- the database may also store each completed story to keep a complete record of each completed story as well as a morgue archive and a graveyard archive (i.e., one or more levels of archives).
- the morgue archive may contain stories which are too old and no longer published while the graveyard archive may contain stories and story information which was spiked, as described below, or never made it past the initial rating process as described below.
- the database 40 may also store the information about each user of the system including his/her access level and the information necessary to generate the user interface pages shown to each user.
- the user interface pages generated for a particular user are dynamically generated as the user logs into the system based on the pieces of data in the database and the security level of the particular user. For example, a user from a particular corporation may log into the system and be able to view only the stories associated with that corporation although the system may contain stories for a plurality of different corporations.
- the multimedia processor system 45 will be described in more detail.
- the multimedia processor system 45 may receive multimedia (e.g., images, video, audio, animation, etc.) for a particular story and store the multimedia in the database 40 .
- a unique identifier may be generated for each piece of multimedia received to identify the story with which the multimedia is associated.
- the multimedia may then be processed to fit into the publication requirements of the system and published with the story once the story has been completed.
- the various systems described above provide an automatic document flow process in that a story in the system is automatically guided through the system and will appear in the pending page of a user automatically. Now, the submission application system and an example of a release page will be described.
- FIGS. 2A-2C are diagrams illustrating an example of a submission form 50 in accordance with the invention and FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an example of a release form 52 .
- the submission form 50 may include various user input blocks into which the user of the submission application system may enter information about the success story being submitted.
- the information may include contact information about the submitter, contact information about the person who knows more details about the success story, contact information about someone who needs to give permission to generate the story, information about the story and why it should be written, information about a website which may contain more information, information about the industry of the submitter's company, the size of the submitter's company, information about the hardware and software used during the project, information about how the product helped the submitter succeed, information about other websites to visit for information and information about how the submitter heard about the success story program as shown in FIGS. 2A-2C.
- the information gathered by the submission form, once submitted, is automatically stored in the database 40 shown in FIG. 1 and a new story submission record is created so that the a story submission review process may be completed.
- the story submission process may include an initial screening by a writer who makes a recommendation for the rating of the story submission and documents this recommendation.
- the writer may also give the story submission a working title and handles some of the other minor administrative tasks associated with processing a story submission.
- the editor is automatically notified of this rating and accepts or modifies the writer's recommended rating.
- the system may automatically place the story in the editor's Pending page (as described below) until the editor makes his decision about the rating. Then once the editor either gives the okay to proceed with the story, the story is automatically placed back into the assigned writer's Pending page (inbasket) or a researcher's inbasket, as appropriate. If the editor spikes the story, the story goes into the graveyard archive.
- the submission application system may send the release form 52 to the submitter or the appropriate person or organization featured in the story via e-mail or direct the submitter or the featured person or corporation to a website so that the release form may be downloaded.
- the submitter or featured person or corporation is then requested to review the release form and sign and date it.
- the submitter is asked to submit the release form, via facsimile and an original copy by mail, to an address.
- the release form 52 shown is a typical release ( ⁇ uantum Corporation),which permits the system's use of the submitter's information.
- the writer system will be described in more detail.
- the writer system may generate a plurality of user interface pages, shown in FIGS. 4-11, which manage the story creation process. Each of the writer pages may include a notes section (not shown) which permits the person using the page to enter notes about the story.
- FIGS. 4A and 4B are diagrams illustrating an example of a status page 60 for the writer system in accordance with the invention showing the status of the stories currently being prepared by the system.
- the status page may include a menu 62 near the top of the page permitting the user of the writer system to navigate through the steps within the writing process.
- the menu may include one or more hyperlinks to other pages in the writer system including the pending page, as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, a rating page as shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, an information completion page as shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, a story writing page in FIGS. 8A and 8B, a web data page as shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B, an editing page as shown in FIGS.
- FIGS. 9A and 9B a view report page as shown in FIGS. 5A-5C and a search page as shown in FIGS. 11A and 11B.
- the invention is not limited to the pages described below and additional pages may be added to provide more functionality to the system, such as a page for managing multimedia components and multimedia production.
- the system using these pages, may be easily expanded using existing technologies or new technologies by adding additional pages to provide the user of the system with access to the existing technologies or any new technologies.
- Each of the above pages will be described in more detail below.
- the status page 60 may further include an unrated story section 64 , a stories to be updated section 66 and a stories in process and stories completed section 68 .
- a unique status page may be generated for each user of the system so that, for example, a writer may see a status page listing the stories currently in the system for the particular writer.
- the status page may also be viewed as a sort of flow-based inbasket for each individual.
- the status page reflects the status of each story based on the traffic flow defined by the system so that it includes stories that appear because they are currently in the story creation process, because they have just come been submitted as a story submission and need a decision on whether they should be processed, or because the story needs updating.
- the unrated stories section contains story submissions within the database which have not yet been rated by a writer and approved by an editor as described above. Until a story is rated as being appropriate for publishing or not, the story submission will remain in the unrated section of the pending page of the writer and editor responsible for that customer.
- the stories to be updated section 66 may include stories whose submission information needs to be updated or augmented. In particular, once a story has been live to the public (published) for the predetermined period of time, the story appears in the updated section 66 because the story now needs to be checked for accuracy. The story remains in the updated section 66 until it has been checked and updated, if appropriate.
- the particular story is removed from the updated section and the predetermined time period is reset so that the story will appear again in the updated section after the predetermined time period expires again.
- each story will periodically be placed into the updated section to reverify the accuracy of the story.
- the pending stories section 68 contains all of the stories which are currently being prepared using the system 20 .
- the pending story section 68 may include a serial number section 70 , a title section 72 , a tickler section 74 and a story preparation status section 76 and other story status information as appropriate. Any story on a status page for a particular user which has been rated as worthy of writing and publication, but which has not yet been completed may be displayed in the pending story section for the appropriate writer and editor.
- the serial number section lists an identifier associated with each story, the name section lists the name of the story and the tickler section lists any due dates associated with the particular story.
- the story preparation status section 76 may include a panel 78 associated with each page listed above (the rating page, the information completion page, the story writing page, the web data page, and the editing page corresponding to the “1” panel, the “2” panel, the “3” panel, the “4” panel and the “5” panel, respectively). As all of the steps and items associated with a particular page are completed, the panel may change colors to indicate that that portion of the story generating process has been completed.
- the important thing about the status page is that it is automatically updated in real time as steps of the story creation process are completed so that the status page for any user of the system is constantly updated.
- Each status page also provides an individually customized overview of the entire process from the perspective of the writer, editor, administrator or other authorized user (i.e., each user views his own personalized status page based on the stories for which the user has responsibility).
- the status page may also be implemented using pop-up menus, other forms of navigation and status display as well as the use of additional colors and additional information so that the status page is not limited to the example shown.
- the panels for uncompleted pages may be red while the panels for completed pages may be yellow although the invention is not limited to these colors.
- FIGS. 5A-5C are diagrams illustrating an example of a page 90 showing information about a particular story being prepared using the system.
- the page may summarize the information gathered about a particular story in the system.
- the page may include a dashboard section 92 located near the left side of the page which provides information about the status of various tasks in the story creation process.
- the dashboard section 92 accurately reflects the current status of the individual checkboxes for the instruction steps listed at the top of each page of the writer system as described below.
- the dashboard section may uses logic and rules to summarize important information relating to the individual steps of the process so that each of the items listed in the dashboard section provides information to quickly inform the viewer what has been done, what is pending, and tell them where in the system (the help system) to find the instructions for that particular step or steps. Therefore, from this page and every other story creation page described below, it is possible to easily determine the status of the particular story based on the dashboard.
- each checkbox 94 may have a number in parentheses associated with it which refers to the particular step in the particular page.
- the dashboard may include an initial OK section 96 , a copy edit section 98 , a WebReady section 100 , a data complete section 102 and an implementation section 104 .
- all of the boxes in the dashboard have been checked off indicating that these steps have been completed except for a spiked checkbox 106 . If the spiked checkbox is checked off, then the story has been discarded by the writer or editor (depending on who has the privilege to spike a story) at some point in the story creation process which may be long before the story is written, such as anytime after the submission is made.
- the vast majority of spikings occur before the story is written when the writer rates the story.
- the story is ready for publishing and is awaiting the final review by the editor, customer and possibly the person/organization featured in the story and the posting of a date after which the story may be published.
- the story summary page 90 may also include original submission data including contact addresses and URLs to review, a description of the project about which the success story is being written, why the story is a good success story, the hardware and software used for the project, the contact address to appear on the published copy, and various story specific data, such as the headline, the story capsule, the story lead, the story body and quotes from the story.
- the story summary page 90 may be accessed by entering the writer system or by clicking on the view report button after selecting a particular story. Now, the submission rating page will be described in more detail.
- FIGS. 6A and 6B are diagrams illustrating an example of a page 110 for managing the submission rating process in accordance with the invention.
