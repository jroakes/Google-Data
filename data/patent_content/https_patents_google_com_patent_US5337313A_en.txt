Definitions
- This invention is generally directed to a radio frequency (RF) packet transmission system in which data is transmitted by packets and is specifically directed to a method and apparatus which preserves data stream packet sequencing.
- RF radio frequency
- FIG. 1 illustrates a typical RF packet transmission system comprising a wireless LAN in which control module (CM) 10 utilizes RF communications to communicate with a plurality of user modules (UM) 12.
- CM control module
- UM user modules
- Each UM 12 is connected to one or more user devices 14 such as a terminal, personal computer or other information input/output device via connection 16.
- the CM 10 is connected to data network 18 by data channel 20 which may include, but is not limited to wires or optical links.
- the CM 10 controls communications within the illustrated network and passes information from data network 18 to user devices 14 via an associated UM 12.
- the CM 10 also controls local communications by receiving information from one UM 12A and relaying the information to a different UM 12B.
- Data network 18 may consist of an Ethernet network, a Token Ring network, or any of the other of the well known data networks.
- information such as the information passed between UM 12 and a user device 14 or between CM 10 and data network 18, is conveyed in the form of data packets multiplexed into a data stream.
- Wireless information such as the information transmitted between UMs 12 and CM 10, is conveyed in the form of radio transmission packets.
- Each radio transmission packet typically contains a preamble and an information field.
- the preamble may comprise control data, synchronization information and/or destination device information.
- the information field contains at least some of the information comprising a data packet.
- a first terminal device 14, designated as terminal A transmits 5 packets numbered 0-4, while a second terminal 14, designated as terminal B, transmits 5 packets numbered 0-4.
- these 10 packets A0-A4 and B0-B4 are typically interspersed in a random nature, such as: B0,B1,A0,B2,A1,A2,A3,B3,A4,B4. While the data stream ordering appears completely random, it will be noticed upon closer inspection that this ordering is actually pseudorandom, for data packets A0-A4 and B0-B4 maintain their original and sequential order with respect to the source devices A and B, respectively. Consequently, packet A0 will always precede packets A1-A4 in ascending order while packet B0 will always precede packets B1-B4 in the same ascending order.
- Any number of terminal devices 14 can be serviced by UM 12.
- the number of data packets transmitted by those terminal devices may vary.
- the data stream length N can be any number of data packets. Despite these variances, data stream packets maintain a sequential relationship (0,1,2,3, . . . , N) with respect to their source or point of origin.
- a reconstructed data stream may only comprise, for example, data packets A1,B0,A4,B3,A2,B4,A0,B1,B2.
- packet data network 18 of FIG. 1 employs data messaging protocols capable of handling reordered data packets
- the reconstructed data stream A1,B0,A4,B3,A2, B4,A0,B1,B2 may be transmitted over channel 20 for further processing.
- packet data network 18 employs data messaging protocols which are catastrophically sensitive to the receipt of data packets from a terminal device 14 which no longer have their original sequentially ordered relationship (A0-A4 or B0-B4), successful processing and ultimately system operation will fail.
- Examples of data messaging protocols which are catastrophically sensitive to the receipt of reordered data packets include, but are not limited to:
- HDLC High Level Data Link Control
- LAP B Link Access Protocol-B
- LAP D Link Access Protocol-D
- SDLC Synchronous Data Link Control

- Method steps and apparatus structure is provided for identifying data packets from within the data stream as a function of source device identification information, generating data packet sequence information for the identified data packets, storing in memory, values corresponding to the data packet sequence information, and then transmitting the data packets, the source device identification information and the data packet sequence information to said second terminal having first terminal source device and data packet sequence information.
- steps and apparatus structure are provided for receiving said first terminal transmissions, fetching from second terminal memory, first terminal data packet sequence information as a function of first terminal source device identification information, and comparing the fetched data packet sequence information with the received data packet sequence information. As a function of the comparison, received data packet are forwarded for further processing when sequence information sequence numbers compare and are stored in an order determined by the sequence information when sequence numbers do not compare.
- the problems identified in handling packets in an RF packet transmission system are reduced, by the present invention which allows received data packets to be addressed into memory in accordance with a hierarchy of addressability associated with the address of a specific user device 14.
- the disclosed memory mapping permits data stream reconstruction on a user device-by-user device basis, such that a lost, unintelligible, or delayed radio transmission packet associated with one of a plurality of user devices does not interrupt service to the other devices supported by a common UM 12.
- a communications controller 11 includes a microprocessor 13, with associated read only memory (ROM) 15, random access memory (RAM) 17, serial interface device 19, and network interface 21.
- the serial interface device 19 consists of appropriate registers and line drivers for communication with a terminal device 24 connected to the UM by communications bus 29.
- the interface device 19 is an RS232 interface
- serial bus 29 is an RS232 bus
- I/O device 24 may be any of the well known asynchronous RS232 terminals capable of providing a serial I/O function. While depicted as a permanent connection, terminal device 24 is only connected as shown during various administrative and maintenance operations requiring direct I/O to and from UM 12.
- the network interface 21 consists of appropriate registers and line drivers for communication with the plurality of peripheral devices connected by network interface (NI) bus 16.
- NI network interface
- a plurality of peripheral devices including two-way RF radio 28, Ethernet I/O device 30, and Token Ring I/O device 32 are interfaced with UM 12.
- Each peripheral 28-32 contains a NI bus interface 36, 38, and 40, respectively. These interfaces provide the necessary registers and line drivers for communicating on NI bus 16 and will also include a microprocessor, RAM, and ROM if these resources are not available in the integrated devices.
- radio 28 includes one or more antennas designated 44 for RF communication between UM 12 and CM 10 as shown in FIG. 1.
- wireless information is communicated via transmission packets as discussed in association with FIG. 3.
- Ethernet I/O device 30 is coupled by wire 46 to a conventional Ethernet port.
- Token Ring I/O device 32 is coupled by wire 48 to a conventional Token Ring network.
- the illustrated peripherals are merely representative that virtually any type of packetized information can be coupled by means of an appropriate input/output device to UM 12.
- NI bus 16 connecting the various peripherals together via the communications controller 11
- TDM time division multiplexed
- FIG. 3 illustrates the correspondence between data stream 300 and a plurality of multiplexed data packets 310.
- the data stream 300 comprises data packets 310 numbered 1-N.
- Each data packet comprises a destination address, a source address and source device message information.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a transmission packet 400 which is transmitted over RF channels between CM 10 and UMs 12.
- the format illustrates the transmission of control information comprising packet preamble information 402, packet header 404 and reassembly header 406, as well as data field 408 which may contain a data packet 310.
- the packet preamble 402 is provided for radio 28 synchronization purposes.
- the packet header 404 and the reassembly header 406 will be explained in more detail below.
- FIG. 5 illustrates the information contained within the packet header as shown in FIG. 4.
- the packet header includes virtual circuit identification field (VCID) 510, packet length information 520, destination information 530, and validation information 540.
- VCID field 510 contains information that specifies a virtual circuit register contained within a UM or CM.
- the virtual circuit register points to or addresses a queue control block which in turn points to read and write packet descriptors which can point to an additional packet descriptor, as well as to read and write buffer descriptors.
- the buffer descriptors each point to a write buffer and to a next read and write buffer descriptor, thereby forming a link list of addresses for defining which buffer location the data field 408 of a received transmission packet 400 will be stored.
- the packet length field 520 provides information concerning the length of the associated packet.
- the destination information field 530 includes destination device address information for a UM 12 or a CM 10.
- the validation information field 540 contains data associated with a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) data accuracy calculation.
- CRC Cyclic Redundancy Check
- FIG. 6 illustrates information contained within the reassembly header of the transmission packet of FIG. 4.
- the Source LUID field 610 defines the logical unit identification of a UM 12.
- Source LUID is assigned by CM 10 to each UM 12 within the CM 10 zone of service.
- the protocol field 670 is used in part by the microprocessor 13 of FIG. 1 to maintain proper data packet ordering upon data stream recovery as described herein below. Since the Source LUID field 610 and the protocol field 670 are the only fields within the Reassembly Header of importance to the present invention, discussion of the remaining fields will not be presented at this time.
- FIG. 7 illustrates the information contained in the protocol field of a reassembly packet as shown in FIG. 6.
- the protocol field comprises broadcast field 710, terminal ID field 720, data stream sequence number 730, and Destination Service Access Point (DSAP) field 740. Additional fields 750 are reserved for future use.
- DSAP Destination Service Access Point
- the broadcast field 710 is used in CM to UM transmission.
- the broad cast field will be set to a logic one, otherwise it is a logic zero, identifying it as a non-broadcast type packet.
- Broadcast type packets are received and processed by all terminals devices 14 within the zone of coverage as established by CM 10.
- Non-broadcast type packets are for receipt by a specifically identified terminal 14 within the CM 10 zone of coverage.
- the terminal ID field 720 stores a value assigned by a servicing UM 12 when it receives, for the first time, a data packet from a newly installed terminal device 14. Thereafter, the terminal device 14 is identified by this terminal ID.
- the stream sequence number field 730 stores a number used by UMs 12 and CM 10 alike, to sequence received data packets thereby preserving their sequential relationship with respect to a common point of origin. It will be appreciated that this field size can be any number of bits, n, necessary to provide this functionality.
- the stream sequence number field 730 is an n bit field which provides for a range of 2 n sequence numbers. In accordance with the preferred embodiment n is 6, thereby providing for a range of sequence number from 0-63.
- the DSAP field 740 indicates whether the received packet is destined for a system service or LAN application. This enables proper routing of each received packet to the correct application for further processing.
- FIG. 8 is a flow chart of the steps performed by microprocessor 13 when UMs 12 receive a data packet 310 from terminal devices 14.
- flow proceeds to block 802 whenever UM 12 receives a data packet 310.
- flow proceeds to block 804 where the source address and the destination address within the packet 310 are read.
- the source address is the unique IEEE Ethernet address assigned to the source terminal device 14.
- the destination address is the IEEE Ethernet address of the device which is to receive the packet 310.
- Flow proceeds to decision block 806 where a bit status check is performed to see whether the received packet is to be transmitted as a broadcast type packet (broadcasted to all UMs serviced by CM 10) or not. Assuming it is, flow proceeds to block 828 where the reassembly header of FIGS. 4 and 6 is constructed.
- the packet is a non-broadcast type packet
- flow proceeds from block 806 to block 808 where an address table in RAM 17 which maintains entries for each of the terminals 14 connected to UM 12 is searched for the received packet's destination address.
- decision block 810 a check is made to see whether the destination address was found. If it is, the packet is discarded and program flow stops because the destination device is assumed to be connected to the UM and capable of receiving the packet over the wire 16.
- decision block 814 a check is performed to determine whether the source address was found in the RAM 17 address table. If so, flow proceeds to block 828 where the reassembly header of FIGS. 4 and 6 is constructed. If not, then a new entry must be made in the RAM 17 address table to identify this terminal device 14 previously unknown to the UM 12.
- FIG. 9 illustrates storage of source addresses in a source address field as well as the storage of a Terminal ID in a Terminal ID field.
- source addresses are read from received packets.
- the new terminal address, E is shown stored in Table 1. Terminal IDs are assigned as discussed below.
- FIG. 10 The Sequence Number Table, hereinafter referred to as Table 2, is depicted in FIG. 10. Referring to FIG. 10, it will be appreciated that row 4 of Table 2 is the next unused row. Therefore, at blocks 820 and 822 of FIG. 8, the Table 2 row index number, 4, is written into the Terminal Id field associated with the source address E, thereby providing a pointer from the Source Address Table 1 into the Sequence Number Table 2.
- Table 2 row 4 is utilized to track the sequence number of data packets as received from user device E.
- Table 2 comprises the following sequence information entries: V(s), Lower Window Bound, Tx Window Map, V(r), Rx Window Map, and Rx Window Queue Pointer.
- V(s) Lower Window Bound
- Tx Window Map V(r)
- Rx Window Map Rx Window Queue Pointer
- V(s) is the transmit sequence number (0-N) that will be assigned to the next transmission packet associated with a user device stream.
- Lower Window Bound is the sequence number value assigned to the oldest unacknowledged transmission packet in the particular device stream. When there are no unacknowledged packets outstanding, this field should equal V(s).
- Tx Window Map is a bit-mapped structure used to manage the Transmit Window when packets are acknowledged out of order. If a packet in the device stream is acknowledged and its stream sequence number is greater than the Lower Window Bound, a bit is set in the map structure which corresponds to the packet's sequence number relative to the Lower Window Bound. When the packet corresponding to Lower Window Bound is finally acknowledged or times out, the map structure is used to determine how far to advance the Lower Window Bound.
- V(r) is the sequence number (0-63) expected in the next packet received for a specific terminal ID. If a packet arrives for this terminal ID and its sequence number is not equal V(r), the packet will be queued as long as it is within the valid receive window extending from V(r)+1 to V(r)+(2 n-2 -1).
- Rx Window Map is a bit-mapped structure used to manage the Receive Window when packets are received out of order. If a packet is received whose sequence number is not V(r) but is nonetheless within the valid receive window, a bit is set in the map structure which corresponds to the packet's sequence number relative to V(r). Such a packet will be queued for transmission to the LAN application. When the packet corresponding to V(r) arrives or times out, the map structure is used to determine how far to advance V(r).
- Rx Window Queue Pointer is a pointer to a linked list of received packets that are queued for later transmission. Packets are inserted into this queue in order of sequence number.
- out of order packets are handled in the following manner:
- the reassembly header of FIGS. 4 and 6 is constructed for the received packet.
- the UM 12 LUID is placed into the Source LUID field 610 of FIG. 6 in order to identify which UM 12 transmitted the packet.
- the broadcast field 710 status is set based upon the decision at block 806.
- the Terminal ID field 720 is given the appropriate Terminal ID from Table 1.
- the Stream Sequence Number field 730 or N(s) receives the current value of V(s) as stored in Table 2.
- the DSAP field 740 status is set according to whether the packet, upon receipt is to be processed by the receiving device, CM 10, or is instead to be routed to the Packet Data Network 18 for further processing.
- V(s) as stored in Table 2 is incremented.
- a transmission lifetime timer is started and the transmission packet 400 is transmitted to the CM 10 at block 836.
- FIG. 11 a flow chart diagram of the steps performed by microprocessor 13 of CM 10 in response to the receipt of an ADD MESSAGE in accordance with step 826 of FIG. 8 is shown.
- the typical ADD MESSAGE transmitted by UM 12 comprises the UM 12 LUID, the new terminal device 14 Source Address and the Terminal ID as assigned by the transmitting UM 12 for the newly encountered terminal device 14.
- CM 10 receives an ADD MESSAGE.
- Flow proceeds to block 1104 where the UM LUID, Source Address and Terminal ID are read.
- a RAM 17 address table shown in FIG. 12 and hereinafter referred to as Table 3, is searched for the terminal device 14 Source Address.
- a check is performed to determine whether the Source Address was found. Assuming it was not found, flow proceeds to block 1110 where the Source Address, Terminal ID and LUID are stored in Table 3 in order to register the new terminal device 14 identified by the Source Address, Terminal ID and LUID received in the ADD MESSAGE at block 1102. Thereafter, at block 1112 the Terminal ID is used to index into a Sequence Number Table stored in RAM 17 of CM 10.
- the CM 10 Sequence Number Table is identical to Table 2 as previously described in association with FIG. 10.
- each Table 2 row comprises the following entries: V(s), Lower Window Bound, Tx Window Map, V(r), Rx Window Map, and Rx Window Queue Pointer, which collectively contain the information necessary for preserving packet ordering of both transmit and receive data streams as a function of Source Address, LUID and Terminal ID.
- Flow proceeds from block 1112 to block 1114 where the indexed Table 2 row is initialized.
- receipt of the ADD MESSAGE is acknowledged.
- FIG. 13 depicts a flow chart diagram of the steps performed by the microprocessor 13 of FIG. 2 when a CM 10 receives a data packet from the packet data network 18.
- flow proceeds to block 1302 whenever CM 10 receives a data packet 310 from the packet data network 18 of FIG. 1.
- block 1302 proceeds to block 1304 where the Destination Address within the packet 310 is read.
- the Destination Address is the IEEE Ethernet address of the device which is to receive the packet 310.
- Flow proceeds to decision block 1306 where a bit status check is performed to see whether the received packet is to be transmitted as a broadcast type packet, i.e., received and stored by all UMs serviced by CM 10, or not. Assuming it is, flow proceeds to block 1328 where a reassembly header is constructed in accordance with the description of step 828 of FIG. 8.
- a check is performed to determine whether the Destination Address was found. Assuming it is not, the packet is discarded and program flow stops because the destination device is either unknown or assumed to be connected to the channel 20 and capable of receiving the packet without CM 10 intervention. If the destination Device Address is found, however, flow proceeds to block 1328, where the reassembly header of FIGS. 4 and 6 is constructed in accordance with the description of step 828 of FIG. 8.
- V(s) as stored in the Sequence Number Table or Table 2 of CM 10 is incremented.
- a transmission packet lifetime timer is started and the transmission packet 400 is transmitted to the UM 12 at block 1336.
- FIG. 14 a flow chart diagram of the steps performed by the microprocessor 13 of CM 10 or the microprocessor 13 of UM 12 upon receipt of an indication that a transmission has been successfully completed or upon receipt of an indication that a transmission was not successfully completed within the time prescribed by the packet lifetime timer.
- flow proceeds to block 1402 where the packet lifetime timer is stopped.
- Flow proceeds to block 1404 where all memory resources reserved for tracking the packet are surrendered.
- decision block 1406 a check is performed to determine whether the sequence number N(s) is greater than the lower bound. If so, flow proceeds to block 1408 where the appropriate bit in the transmit window (Tx window) bit map is set in order to indicate that the transmission process for this packet is finished. Thereafter, the process flow ends.
- Tx window transmit window
- N(s) is not greater than the lower window bound
- flow proceeds from decision block 1406 to decision block 1410, where a check is performed to determine whether N(s) is equal to the lower window bound. If it is not, an erroneous update is assumed and the process flow ends. If, however, N(s) is equal to the lower window bound, flow proceeds to block 1412 and 1414 where the Lower Window Bound is incremented and the Tx window bit map is updated to indicate the change in the Lower Window bound. Thereafter, flow proceeds to decision block 1416 where a check is performed to determine whether the Tx Window Map bit status indexed by the Lower Window bound is equal to 1 (set).
- FIG. 15 a flow chart diagram of the steps performed by the microprocessor 13 of CM 10 or the microprocessor 13 of UM 12 upon receipt of a transmission packet 400 are shown.
- flow proceeds to block 1502 upon receipt of a transmission packet 400.
- the UM 12 LUID i.e., Source LUID 610 of FIG. 6, Broadcast Field 710 status, Terminal ID field 720 and Stream Sequence Number 730 of FIG. 7 are read.
- a check is performed with the Broadcast Field status to determine whether the received transmission packet 400 is a broadcast type packet.
- a check is performed to determine whether any previously received packets associated with the stream identified by Source LUID and Terminal ID having a sequence number equal to the incremented value of V(r) as determined at block 1518 are currently stored in memory. If so, flow branches back to block 1516 where the process is repeated until no such out of order packet remain stored in memory. At such time, the process flow ends in preparation for receipt of a next transmission packet 400.
- the sequence number range is from 0 to 2 n -1, where n is the number of bits used to encode the sequence number.
- n is equal to 6 thus the sequence number range is from 0 to 63.
- the Rx window -- size is 16 consecutive sequence numbers defined as V(r) plus the next 15 consecutive sequence numbers.
- N(r) is within the Rx window when N(r) is greater than V(r) and when N(r) is less than V(r)+Rx window -- size.
- N(r) is within the Rx window range when N(r) is between V(r)+1 to V(r)+(2 n-2 -1).
- flow proceeds to block 1526 where the data associated with the packet is stored in memory, under the direction of the Rx window queue pointer, in the order as determined by its sequence number N (r).
- the Rx window bit map is updated at block 1528 to document storage of the received packet, and a sequence number timer is started at block 1530 to provide time out protection.
- SYNCH window comprises the next consecutive 16 bits following the Rx window.
- N(r) is greater than or equal to V(r)+window -- size and when N(r) deemed to be within the SYNCH window when N(r) is greater than or equal to V(r)+window -- size and when N(r) is less than V(r)+2*(Rx window -- size) and when the Rx window bit map is empty.
- N(r) is deemed within the SYNCH window when N(r) is between V(r)+(2 n-2 )to V(r)+(2 n-1 -1). Under these conditions, it is assumed that all data packets comprising the current Rx window were lost, indicating that the CM 10 and the UM 12 Tx Windows and Rx Windows are no longer synchronized. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that this condition may occur because the present invention does not require the exchange of Rx and Tx Window status information between CM 10 and the UM 12.
- flow proceeds to block 1534 where the data associated with the last received transmission packet is forwarded to the appropriate application. Thereafter, the value V(r) in Table 2 is set to N(r)+1 at step 1536, the RX window bit map is updated at step 1538 to reflect the resynchronization of the expected sequence value V(r) to that of the next sequence number to be received, N(r)+1, and the process flow ends in preparation of receipt of a new transmission packet.
- the packet will be treated as either unrecognized or a repeated packet, in which case it will be dropped and process flow will cease at step 1540.
- FIG. 16 a flow chart diagram of the steps performed by microprocessor 13 of UM 12 or CM 10 upon the expiration of sequence number time out at step 1530 of FIG. 15.
- flow proceeds to block 1602 upon receipt of a time out indication.
- decision block 1604 a test is performed to determine whether the sequence number N(r) for the timed out packet is greater than the the expected sequence number V(r) as indexed by the status of the Rx Window Map at step 1528 of FIG. 15. If so, flow proceeds to decision block 1606 where a test is performed to determine whether any previously received and out of order packets may now be routed to an appropriate application. If so, flow proceeds to block 1608.
