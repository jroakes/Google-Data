Any feature of any drawing may be referenced and/or claimed in combination with any feature of any other drawing.
- The following detailed description of implementations refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the claims.
- This subject matter described herein relates generally to online content and, more specifically, to converting online content such as static image online content to dynamic content. As used herein, static image online content refers to static images refers to any image file that may be served as online content. Accordingly, static image online content may be of any appropriate file format including, for example and without limitation, graphics interchange format (.gif files), joint photographic expert group format (.jpeg files), bitmap image file format (.bmp files), WebP format (.webp files), PostScript format (.ps files), tagged image file format (.tiff files), and any other file format that may be used to encode depictions of images and serve such images. Further, static image online content, as used herein, also includes progressions of frames of any static image file. For example, animated gifs that use a fixed number of frames and display each frame in a time sequence are, as described herein, static image online content. Static images may also include, as described herein, printed images. As used herein, printed images must first be converted to a file format such as described above in order to convert the printed images to dynamic content using, for example, scanning. Typically, static images have fixed dimensions of size or fixed ratios between the boundaries of the static image.
- At least some online publications such as websites may be configured to display online content (e.g., advertisements). Such online content publications have designated locations used to display online advertisements. Such designated locations may be known as online “real estate.” In at least some cases, online real estate is associated with specific fixed pixel dimensions or ratios for the boundaries of the online real estate. When online advertisements are not associated with fixed pixel dimensions or ratios that correspond to the fixed pixel dimensions or ratios of the online real estate, problems may occur in serving such online advertisements to such online real estate. In one example, portions of online real estate may not be utilized when an online advertisement not matching the required online real estate is served. In another example, portions of the online advertisement may be compressed, distorted, or obscured. In additional examples, such online advertisements may simply not be served due to the lack of corresponding dimensions or ratios. As a result, the static images can only be properly served into certain online real estate of certain online publications. Further, at least some static images may benefit from being animated to highlight features of the static images. Application of animation may make the online content more visible or visually interesting and allow a viewer to more easily identify the online content for a follow-up action.
- The methods and systems described herein facilitate the conversion of such static image online content to dynamic content and thereby allow the serving of such dynamic content in a plurality of online real estate for a plurality of online publications and also providing animated forms of such dynamic content. The methods and systems are implemented by a content conversion computer system.
- A content conversion computer system receives a static image content having a plurality of image characteristics. For example, the static image content may include a combination of textual characteristics, image display characteristics, and color characteristics. The content conversion computer system may receive the static image content from any suitable source including for example and without limitation, an online content repository, crawling a plurality of web locations, an offline content repository, scanning physical images into static image online content using a scanning device, an advertiser network, online publications, and an online merchant. In the example embodiment, the content conversion computer system receives the static image content from an online content repository.
- The content conversion computer system is configured to analyze details of the static image content. More specifically, the content conversion computer system identifies at least some of the plurality of image characteristics associated with the static image. Accordingly, the content conversion computer system is capable of identifying textual characteristics, image display characteristics, and color characteristics. The content conversion computer system includes a plurality of components that are used to identify the plurality of image characteristics. In the example embodiment, the content conversion computer system analyzes the content of static image content and identifies a background area, at least one image area such as a “product image area”, and text blocks. The content conversion computer system may use machine vision algorithms, optical character recognition, edge detection engines, and color clustering engines to make such identifications.
- In the example embodiment, the content conversion computer system uses an optical character recognition (OCR) engine to identify textual characteristics of the static image content. Depending upon the condition of the image and the legibility of the text, the content conversion computer system may use a pre-processing method with its OCR engine to improve the quality of the textual recognition. Accordingly, the content conversion computer system may apply deskewing, despeckling, binzarization, line removal, layout analysis, zoning, line and word detection, character isolation or segmentation, normalization of aspect ratio or scale, or any other suitable pre-processing methods. After pre-processing, the content conversion computer system may apply an OCR algorithm such as matrix matching or feature extraction to make determinations on the characters displayed within the static image content. Alternately, any OCR algorithm is used to determine the characters displayed in the static image content. Further, the content conversion computer system may use algorithms to distinguish the formatting and size of words within the static image content including, for example, determining the presence of bold characters, determining the presence of italicized characters, determining the presence of underlined characters, determining the presence of superscripted characters, determining the presence of subscripted characters, determining font sizes associated with characters, and determining font faces associated with characters. Additionally, the content conversion computer system may apply post processing methods and algorithms to verify determinations made by the OCR algorithms. For example, a particular static image content is known to be associated with certain key terms because it is associated with a particular merchant. Accordingly, a lexicon is applied to verify that words identified by the OCR engine correspond to words associated with that merchant. The OCR engine accordingly allows the content conversion computer system to identify textual elements, formatting and styling related to textual elements, and placement of textual elements. As described below, during the generation of dynamic content, the content conversion computer system can substantially place, style, and format the textual elements in a similar manner within the dynamic content as was displayed in the static image content. As described above, in the example embodiment, the OCR engine analyzes text contained within the previously identified “text blocks.” In alternative embodiments, the OCR engine may analyze all textual elements available within static image content.
- The content conversion computer system also uses an edge engine to determine image display characteristics. As used herein, an edge engine or an edge detection engine, refers to at least one method for identifying characteristics within a digital image to find discontinuities. In at least some examples, edge detection engines examine digital images such as static image content to find significant changes in brightness characteristics. At such points of brightness changes (or other discontinuities), “features” of an image can be separated. Accordingly, an edge detection engine can identify the boundaries of images components within the static image content. For example, in at least a variety of static image content, multiple interior images are included. Such interior images may include, for example, depictions of a product or service, a corporate logo, and photographs of humans using goods and services related to the static image content. The edge engine allows each interior image or “feature” to be identified. Upon determining the boundaries and position of such interior images or features, the content conversion computer system can further extract each interior image or feature while also identifying the absolute and relative position of such features within the static image content. Extraction is performed using any suitable method including, for example, cropping, cutting, and copying of the features based upon boundaries identified by the edge detection engine. In the example embodiment, extraction includes cropping features identified by the edge detection engine. As described below, the interior image or feature can then be placed at an absolute or relative position similar to the identified position within the generated dynamic content. As described above, in the example embodiment, the edge engine analyzes image characteristics contained within the previously identified “image areas.” In alternative embodiments, the edge engine may analyze all image characteristics available within static image content.
- The content conversion computer system additionally uses a color engine to determine color characteristics related to the static image content. As used herein, the color engine refers to at least one method for identifying dominant colors and their associated “weights” within image content. In the example embodiment, the color engine analyzes color in the previously identified “image areas.” In alternative embodiments, the color engine analyzes the entire static image content. The color engine may apply any appropriate method including, for example, clustering algorithms, k-means algorithms, or any other suitable color identification and analysis methods and algorithms.
- Further, using the edge engine and the OCR engine, the content conversion computer system identifies attributes associated with textual elements. In at least some static image content, a variety of textual elements are included. For example, a primary textual element or a “headline” may be included wherein the headline states a primary slogan, statement, or identifier associated with the static image content. The headline may be distinguished from other textual elements based upon, for example, the placement of the textual element within the static image content, the size of the font of the textual element in relation to the other textual elements, and the font face associated with the textual element in relation to the other textual elements. In a second example, a secondary textual element or a “description” may be included wherein the description provides details related to the static image content. The description may be distinguished from other textual elements based upon, for example, the length in characters of the textual element in relation to the other textual elements, the placement of the textual element within the static image content, and the font size associated with the textual element in relation to the font size of the other textual elements. In a third example, a tertiary textual element or a “call to action” may be included wherein the call to action invites a viewer such as a customer to click on a button or a link to navigate to, for example, an online merchant associated with the static image content. The call to action may be distinguished from other textual elements based upon, for example, the placement of the textual element within the static image content, the placement of the textual image onto a graphical button or clickable item, and the font size associated with the textual element in relation to the font size of the other textual elements. Accordingly, the edge engine and the optical character recognition engine of the content conversion computer system identify all such elements described above to determine headline text, description text, and call to action text. The content conversion computer system may additionally use the edge engine and the optical character recognition engine to determine other specified textual elements including, for example, a textual company logo, a contact email address, a contact phone number, and a contact physical address. A textual company logo may be distinguished based upon, for example, font size, location, and font type. Alternately, a textual company logo may be distinguished by comparison of the characters to a lexicon. Email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses may be distinguished based upon the standardized formatting of the characters into recognizable patterns.
- As described herein, at least some image content includes a plurality of image content as “frames” of an “animated” image. However, in at least some examples including progressive image files, the “animated” content is a plurality of static image content. Accordingly, the content conversion computer system is configured to identify the presence of a “frame” based animation and accordingly parse out each of the plurality of static image content. Once separated, each “frame” can be analyzed and converted using the content conversion computer system. Further, in at least some cases, the content conversion computer system creates dynamic content that is animated in a substantially similar manner to the animated static image content. The content conversion computer system otherwise applies the same methods to the analysis and conversion of animated static image content that it applies to non-animated static image content.
- The content conversion computer system additionally determines a plurality of dynamic content characteristics to be used for converting the static image content to a dynamic content. The plurality of dynamic content characteristics include, for example, dimensions associated with the plurality of dynamic content, animation templates associated with the plurality of dynamic content, and styles and formatting characteristics associated with the plurality of dynamic content. The dynamic content characteristics may be retrieved from the memory of the content conversion computer system, a content server, a database, or any other computing device in communication with the content conversion computer system.
- The content conversion computer system generates dynamic content based upon the image characteristics and dynamic content characteristics. Generating dynamic content substantially represents applying the previously determined image characteristics and dynamic content characteristics to create a plurality of dynamic content. In the example embodiment, dynamic content is generated by building styles based upon a combination of the determined image characteristics and the dynamic content characteristics. Building styles further includes selecting at least one size and orientation for the dynamic content, at least one font type for textual elements, at least one font size for textual elements, at least one location for image elements, and at least one color scheme for image elements and textual elements. Further, building styles may also include selecting to animate at least a portion of the dynamic content. After building styles, the content conversion computer system builds a plurality of dynamic content. The plurality of dynamic content may be associated with different sizes and orientations, different font types, different font sizes, different image element locations, different animations, and different color schemes. Accordingly, the content conversion computer system may substantially generate dynamic content with a variety of presentation styles, presentation sizes, and presentation appearances. Such a plurality of dynamic content may be useful in serving suitable online content to a variety of real estate for a variety of online publications. In at least one example, each generated dynamic content is inventoried for its characteristics. Accordingly, when a content server chooses dynamic content to serve into a particular piece of real estate for a particular online publication, characteristics for serving may be easily identified. For example, a particular piece of real estate for a particular online publication may have a known requirement of animation, a requirement for a particular size and orientation, and a requirement for particular color scheme. A content server can accordingly identify the appropriate dynamic content from the plurality of dynamic content based upon the inventoried data. In at least one example, such inventoried data regarding the characteristics of the dynamic content is included as metadata within the dynamic content. In other examples, the inventoried data is included in a database, a file, or any other suitable form.
- In a first example, generating dynamic content includes generating a plurality of HTML 5 content with a plurality of distinct sizes, dimensions, and orientations. In other examples, the dynamic content can be generated as HTML 4 content or any other appropriate content format including earlier or later versions of HTML. In a second example, generating dynamic content includes generating a plurality of HTML 5 content with at least one animation. In other examples, the dynamic content can be generated as HTML 4 content or any other appropriate content format including earlier or later versions of HTML. The animation, as referenced above and described below, is selected based upon dynamic content characteristics. For example, the dynamic content characteristics may indicate that the dynamic content includes a “fade in”, a “fade out”, a “highlight”, or any other suitable form of animation. Such animation is applied to at least a portion of the dynamic content.

FIG. 3 is an example 300 of static imageonline content 340 that may be converted to dynamic content using content conversion computer system 116 (shown inFIG. 2 ) and the systems and methods described herein. As described above, static imageonline content 340 may be of any appropriate file format including, for example and without limitation, graphics interchange format (.gif files), joint photographic expert group format (.jpeg files), bitmap image file format (.bmp files), WebP format (.webp files), PostScript format (.ps files), tagged image file format (.tiff files), and any other file format that may be used to encode depictions of images and serve such images. - Example 300 shows a
mobile computing device 310 including adisplay screen 320.Display screen 320 depictsapplication 330. In the example embodiment,application 330 is a web browser configured to display content from the internet or other network resources. In the example embodiment,application 330 depicts static imageonline content 340. Static imageonline content 340 is displayed within anonline publication 335. In the example embodiment,online publication 335 is a news article including text. As described above,online publication 335 includes “real estate” for placing online content. Such real estate ofonline publication 335 may have requirements for dimensions or alternately for ratios of the boundaries (e.g., length and width). Accordingly, only online content with corresponding dimensions or ratios may be effectively served in such real estate. In the example embodiment, the real estate occupied by static imageonline content 340 is 600 pixels by 400 pixels. If online content of different dimensions is served into such real estate, it will need to be cropped or resized to fit the dimensions. If the ratio does not correspond to the 3:2 ratio of the real estate, even resizing will not serve appropriately because portions of the online content will be “cut off” or alternately empty space will remain in the real estate. Further, online content may be sized in relation to the resolution of an underlying image. If very small online content is expanded to accommodate a larger real estate, the online content may display with undesirable characteristics such as “pixelation”. Additionally, particularonline publications 335 may further be associated with particular style guidelines. For example particularonline publications 335 may only serve content with a particular color palette, with particular animations, or particular fonts and font sizes. As a result, static imageonline content 340 is limited because it can only be effectively served to particular real estate of particularonline publications 335. Further, in at least some examples,computing device 310 anddisplay screen 320 may be associated with certain dimensions and accordingly best present online content of certain sizes or dimensions. Accordingly, some static imageonline content 340 is not suitable for serving on at least somecomputing devices 310. - Static image
online content 340 further includes a plurality oftextual elements graphical elements textual elements textual elements online content 340 may includetextual elements online content 340 may include a plurality of a particular category oftextual elements textual element 352 may be identified as a “headline” because of the prominent location (near the top of static image online content 340) and font styling (bold). Further,textual element 354 may be identified as a “description” because of the location (underneathgraphical element 362 and localized in the center of static image online content 340) and the font styling (unstyled). Additionally,textual element 356 may be identified as a “call to action” because of the location (on top ofgraphical element 366 which may be identified as a “button”) and the font styling (underlined, a common font style for links). Accordingly, when generating dynamic content based on static imageonline content 340, such characteristics are recognized by content conversion computer system 116 (shown inFIG. 1 ) using, for example, optical character recognition (OCR) engines. - Also as discussed above and further below,
graphical elements graphical elements online content 340. Accordingly, when generating dynamic content based on static imageonline content 340, such characteristics are recognized by contentconversion computer system 116 using, for example, edge detection engines and color engines. As described above and herein, edge detection engines allow for the determination of the location ofgraphical elements graphical elements - In one example static image

Accordingly, each underlying frame may have a plurality oftextual elements graphical elements conversion computer system 116 additionally parses out each frame and applies, for example, OCR engines, edge detection engines, and color engines to each frame. Further, contentconversion computer system 116 determines the order of presentation of each frame and the duration of presentation of each frame. - The methods and systems described herein facilitate the conversion of static image
online content 340 to dynamic content and thereby allow the serving of such dynamic content in a plurality of online real estate for a plurality ofonline publications 335. -
FIG. 4 is an example data flow diagram 400 illustrating the conversion of static imageonline content 340 to a plurality ofdynamic content 460. Conversion of static imageonline content 340 is facilitated by contentconversion computer system 116. In the example embodiment, content conversion computer system is a particular version of data processing system 116 (shown inFIG. 1 ). Contentconversion computer system 116 receives static imageonline content 340. Static imageonline content 340 includes a plurality ofimage characteristics 405. For example, static imageonline content 340 may include a plurality of textual characteristics, image display characteristics, and color characteristics. Contentconversion computer system 116 may receive static imageonline content 340 from any suitable source including for example and without limitation,online content repository 402, crawling a plurality of web locations, an offline content repository, scanning physical images into static image online content using a scanning device, an advertiser network, online publications, and an online merchant (none shown). In the example embodiment, contentconversion computer system 116 receives static imageonline content 340 fromonline content repository 402. - Content
conversion computer system 116 is configured to analyze details of the static imageonline content 340. More specifically, contentconversion computer system 116 identifies at least some of plurality ofimage characteristics 405 associated with static imageonline content 340. Accordingly, contentconversion computer system 116 is capable of identifying textual characteristics, image display characteristics, and color characteristics. Contentconversion computer system 116 includes a plurality of components that are used to identify plurality ofimage characteristics 405. In the example embodiment, contentconversion computer system 116 analyzes the content of static imageonline content 340 and identifies a background area, at least one image area such as a “product image area”, and text blocks using aparsing engine 410. Contentconversion computer system 116 may use machine vision algorithms, optical character recognition, edge detection algorithms, color analysis algorithms, and any other suitable algorithm or method to effect parsingengine 410 identifying such areas of static imageonline content 340. Accordingly, static imageonline content 340 is segmented into segmented content 412 where each area of static imageonline content 340 is pre-processed for further analysis. In at least some examples, as described herein, static imageonline content 340 includes a plurality of images or “frames” displayed in progression. Parsingengine 410 is also configured to separate each “frame” from such “animated” static imageonline content 340 to identify a plurality of underlying static imageonline content 340, identify the display order of such underlying static imageonline content 340, and identify the duration associated with the display of each underlying static imageonline content 340. Upon such differentiation, each frame is analyzed individually using the methods described herein. - In the example embodiment, content
conversion computer system 116 uses an optical character recognition (OCR)engine 420 to identifytextual characteristics 422 of static imageonline content 340. Depending upon the condition of static imageonline content 340 and the legibility oftextual elements FIG. 3 ), contentconversion computer system 116 may use a pre-processing method during the execution ofOCR engine 420 to improve the quality of the textual recognition. Accordingly, contentconversion computer system 116 may apply deskewing, despeckling, binzarization, line removal, layout analysis, zoning, line and word detection, character isolation or segmentation, normalization of aspect ratio or scale, or any other suitable pre-processing methods. After pre-processing, contentconversion computer system 116 may apply an OCR algorithm such as matrix matching or feature extraction to make determinations on the characters displayed within static imageonline content 340. Alternately, any OCR algorithm is used to determine the characters displayed in static imageonline content 340. Further, contentconversion computer system 116 may use algorithms to distinguish the formatting and size of words within static imageonline content 340 including, for example, determining the presence of bold characters, determining the location and spacing of characters, determining the presence of italicized characters, determining the presence of underlined characters, determining the presence of superscripted characters, determining the presence of subscripted characters, determining font sizes associated with characters, and determining font faces associated with characters. Additionally, contentconversion computer system 116 may apply post processing methods and algorithms to verify determinations made by the OCR algorithms during the execution ofOCR engine 420. For example, a particular static imageonline content 340 is known to be associated with certain key terms because it is associated with a particular merchant. Accordingly, a lexicon is applied to verify that words identified byOCR engine 420 correspond to words associated with that merchant.OCR engine 420 accordingly allows the contentconversion computer system 116 to identify textual elements, formatting and styling related to textual elements, and placement of textual elements. More generally, contentconversion computer system 116 identifies all such properties astextual characteristics 422. As described below, during generation ofdynamic content 460, contentconversion computer system 116 can substantially place, style, and format the textual elements in a similar manner withindynamic content 460 as was displayed in static imageonline content 340 usingtextual characteristics 422. As described above, in the example embodiment,OCR engine 420 analyzes text contained within the “text blocks” identified by parsingengine 410 and separated into segmented content 412. In alternative embodiments,OCR engine 420 may analyze all textual elements available within static imageonline content 340. - Content
conversion computer system 116 also uses anedge engine 430 to determineimage display characteristics 432 of static imageonline content 340. As used herein, edge engine oredge detection engine 430, refers to at least one method for identifying characteristics within a digital image to find discontinuities. In at least some examples,edge detection engines 430 examine digital images such as static imageonline content 340 to find significant changes in brightness characteristics. At such points of brightness changes (or other discontinuities), “features” of an image can be separated. Accordingly,edge detection engine 430 can identify the boundaries of images components within static imageonline content 340. For example, in at least a variety of static imageonline content 340, multiple interior images are included such asimages FIG. 3 ). Such interior images may include, for example, depictions of a product or service, a corporate logo, photographs of humans using goods and services related to static imageonline content 340, and “call to action” graphics such as buttons.Edge detection engine 430 allows each interior image or “feature” to be identified. Upon determining the boundaries and positions of such interior images or features, the contentconversion computer system 116 can further extract each interior image or feature while also identifying the absolute and relative position of such features within static imageonline content 340. Extraction is performed using any suitable method including, for example, cropping, cutting, and copying of the features based upon boundaries identified byedge detection engine 430. In the example embodiment, extraction includes cropping features identified byedge detection engine 430 and is additionally performed byedge detection engine 430. As described below, the interior image or feature can then be placed at an absolute or relative position similar to the identified position within generateddynamic content 460. As described above, in the example embodiment,edge engine 430 analyzes image characteristics contained within the “image areas” identified by parsingengine 410 and segmented into segmented content 412. In alternative embodiments,edge engine 430 may analyze all image characteristics available within static imageonline content 340. - Content
conversion computer system 116 additionally usescolor engine 440 to determinecolor characteristics 442 related to static imageonline content 340. As used herein,color engine 440 refers to at least one method for identifying dominant colors and their associated “weights” within static imageonline content 340. In the example embodiment,color engine 440 analyzes color in the “image areas” identified by parsingengine 410 and segmented into segmented content 412. In alternative embodiments,color engine 440 analyzes entire static imageonline content 340.Color engine 440 may apply any appropriate method including, for example, clustering algorithms, k-means algorithms, or any other suitable color identification and analysis methods and algorithms. - Using
edge engine 430 andOCR engine 420, contentconversion computer system 116 identifies attributes associated withtextual elements online content 340, a variety oftextual elements edge engine 430 andOCR engine 420 of contentconversion computer system 116 identify all suchtextual elements textual characteristics 422 described above to determine headline text, description text, and call to action text. Contentconversion computer system 116 may additionally useedge engine 430 andOCR engine 420 to determine other specified textual elements including, for example, a textual company logo, a contact email address, a contact phone number, and a contact physical address. A textual company logo may be distinguished based upon, for example, font size, location, and font type. Alternately, a textual company logo may be distinguished by comparison of the characters to a lexicon. Email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses may be distinguished based upon the standardized formatting of the characters into recognizable patterns such as a seven or ten digit phone number using hyphens, periods, and parentheses as delimiters, an email address using “@” as an identifier of a domain, and the presence of a state code or a postal code. - Content
conversion computer system 116 additionally determines a plurality of dynamic content characteristics 450 to be used for converting static imageonline content 340 todynamic content 460. The plurality of dynamic content characteristics 450 include, for example, dimensions associated with plurality ofdynamic content 460, animation templates associated with plurality ofdynamic content 460, and styles and formatting characteristics associated with plurality ofdynamic content 460. Dynamic content characteristics 450 may be retrieved from memory of contentconversion computer system 116 such as memory 206 (shown inFIG. 2 ), a content server such as ad serving system 120 (shown inFIG. 1 ), a database such as database 126 (shown inFIG. 1 ), or any other computing device in communication with contentconversion computer system 116. - Content
conversion computer system 116 generatesdynamic content 460 based upon image characteristics 405 (and, further,textual characteristics 422,image display characteristics 432, and color characteristics 442) and dynamic content characteristics 450. Generatingdynamic content 460 substantially represents applying previouslydetermined image characteristics 405,textual characteristics 422,image display characteristics 432,color characteristics 442, and dynamic content characteristics 450 to create plurality ofdynamic content 460. In the example embodiment,dynamic content 460 is generated by building styles based upon a combination ofdetermined image characteristics 405textual characteristics 422,image display characteristics 432,color characteristics 442, and dynamic content characteristics 450. Building styles further includes selecting at least one size and orientation for eachdynamic content 460, at least one font type fortextual elements textual elements image elements image elements textual elements dynamic content 460. After building styles, contentconversion computer system 116 builds a plurality ofdynamic content 460. Plurality ofdynamic content 460 may be associated with different sizes and orientations, different font types, different font sizes, different image element locations, different animations, and different color schemes. Accordingly, contentconversion computer system 116 may substantially generatedynamic content 460 with a variety of presentation styles, presentation sizes, and presentation appearances. Such a plurality ofdynamic content 460 may be useful in serving suitable online content to a variety of real estate for a variety of online publications. In at least one example, each generateddynamic content 460 is inventoried for its characteristics. Accordingly, when a content server choosesdynamic content 460 to serve into a particular piece of real estate for a particular online publication, characteristics for serving may be easily identified. For example, a particular piece of real estate for a particular online publication may have a known requirement of animation, a requirement for a particular size and orientation, and a requirement for particular color scheme. A content server can accordingly identify the appropriate dynamic content from the plurality ofdynamic content 460 based upon the inventoried data. In at least one example, such inventoried data regarding the characteristics ofdynamic content 460 is included as metadata withindynamic content 460. In other examples, the inventoried data is included in a database, a file, or any other suitable form. - In one example, generating
dynamic content 460 includes generating a plurality of HTML 5 content with a plurality of distinct sizes, dimensions, and orientations. In other examples,dynamic content 460 can be generated as HTML 4 content or any other appropriate content format including subsequent or preceding versions of HTML. In a second example, generatingdynamic content 460 includes generating a plurality of HTML 5 content with at least one animation. In the example embodiment,dynamic content 460 is generated by using ananimation engine 452 configured to apply at least one custom animation style to at least a portion ofdynamic content 460. In other examples,dynamic content 460 can be generated as HTML 4 content or any other appropriate content format including subsequent or preceding versions of HTML. The animation, as referenced above and described below, is selected based upon dynamic content characteristics 450. For example,dynamic content 460 characteristics may indicate thatdynamic content 460 include a “fade in”, a “fade out”, a “highlight”, or any other suitable form of animation. Such animation is applied to at least a portion of at least one of the plurality ofdynamic content 460. Such indications of animation may be explicitly identified by a textual indicator within dynamic content characteristics 450. Alternately, such indications may be defined in any other suitable manner. - Upon generation of plurality of
