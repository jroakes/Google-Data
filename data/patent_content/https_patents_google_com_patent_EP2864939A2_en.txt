Definitions
- Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets have opened up a variety of new services that can be provided to users on the go.
- the geographic location of a mobile device can be determined using any of several technologies for determining its position, including by referencing cellular network towers, WiFi locations, or GPS. Where users opt in to allowing services to use their geographic location, location-based services can be provided through the local device.
- a location-based service is an information or entertainment service, which is accessible on mobile devices through a mobile network and which uses information on the geographical position of the mobile device.
- First generation location-based services can include services to identify a location of a person or object, such as discovering the nearest banking cash machine or the whereabouts of a friend.
- Such services can also include mobile commerce, for example, by providing coupons or advertising directed at customers based on their current location. They could further include personalized weather services and even location-based games.
- a more-granular understanding of a user's location information can allow more sophisticated services to be provided.
- the user's mobile device can generate a location history including data points such as longitude, latitude, and a timestamp for each visited location. More valuable, however, would be a list of businesses or other destinations visited by the user. Having such information might allow users to "check in” using social applications more easily by presenting the user with the name of the business that they are visiting when they choose to check in. E-commerce applications might include delivery coupons or advertising relating to businesses that the user actually visits.
- the mobile device could have an application that provides the user with a journal of where the user has gone on a given day or days. Many other improved location-based services could be provided with such information.
- Local search engines are search engines that allow users to submit geographically constrained searches against a structured database of local business listings. Results are not always accurate, however. Location information derived from mobile devices is not always exact. GPS can provide good results, but not indoors (including in places such as malls) or in other places where GPS signals can be difficult to receive, such as in "urban canyons.” Businesses may also be very closely clustered, including where single buildings include many businesses or where one business may be above or below another. Businesses may also not be geographically separated - one example is a hotel that also has a restaurant; it would be useful to know whether a visitor dined or stayed in such a place. Still further, the local search databases may not have fully precise information for distinguishing the coordinates of nearby businesses. All of these things contribute to local search engines providing inaccurate results under these circumstances.
- the disclosure describes a method for sorting, in order of decreasing visit likelihood, possible destinations visited by a user based on a geographic location from a user's location history using a computer processor.
- the method includes, for a geographic location from a user's location history, conducting by the processor a local search for destinations proximate to that geographic location, the geographic location having a time associated with it, the search providing at least a name for the destination and a distance from the geographic location.

- FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a mobile network 100 for providing location-based services.
- the mobile network 100 includes a communications network 110 and a mobile device 120.
- the mobile device 120 can connect to the
- communications network 110 via various access points 130. Although one mobile device 120 and one access point 130 is illustrated for example purposes, the mobile network can include any number of mobile devices and access points.
- the mobile device 120 can be any device that is configured to exchange data over a mobile network, such as a mobile phone, tablet computer, laptop computer, and so forth.
- the mobile device 120 can also be or can include devices that are not necessarily "mobile," such as desktop computers.
- the communications network 1 lOcan be a GSM, TDMA, or CDMA technology enabled network or any other form of wireless network, e.g., IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, or other Wi-Fi network, or a combination of wired and wireless networks.
- the access points 130 can be a form of radio receiver or transmitter that provides a gateway between the mobile device 120 and the communications network 110.
- the access points can be wireless routers or cellular network towers.
- the mobile device 120 can also receive GPS signals transmitted from GPS satellites 140.
- the mobile network 100 also includes a location server 150 that can exchange data with the mobile device 120 via the communications network 110.
- the location server 150 can include, for example, a digital data processor 160 in
- the location server 150 can be implemented on one or more computing devices. Such computing devices may include, but are not limited to, one or more personal computers, workstations, mini-computers, clustered computer systems, and/or embedded systems. Some or all of the location server 150 functionality could also be implemented on the mobile device 120 itself. Such computing devices may also include, but are not limited to, a device having one or more processors and memory for executing and storing instructions. Such a computing device may include software, firmware, and hardware. Software may include one or more applications and an operating system.

- FIG. 2 An example technique 200 for sorting, in order of decreasing visit likelihood, possible destinations visited by a user is illustrated in FIG. 2.
- the technique may include obtaining geographic location data, or it might operate on pre-existing location history data.
- the technique 200 begins at step 210 where geographic location data is obtained.
- the geographic location data can be obtained from location history data that is generated by a mobile device, such as the mobile device 120 of FIG. 1 and communicated to the location server 150 over the mobile network 100 via access points 130 and communications network 110.
- Location data can also be obtained by location server 150, such as when a user "checks in" at a location using any number of social application that provide for such check-ins.
- the location data can be acquired by the mobile device using any of several technologies for determining position.
- the location data can be acquired by the mobile device using a GPS receiver.
- the Global Positioning System is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides location and time information anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. The system is freely accessible by anyone with a GPS receiver, and many smart phones and other mobile devices include GPS receivers.
- the location data can also be determined using other techniques, such as proximity to cell towers (or other mobile network access points) of known location, or triangulating between the mobile device and a plurality of such towers.
- location data can be acquired by the mobile device and stored locally in a memory on the device.
- the location data can, in some examples, be processed on the mobile device using a processor on the device.
- the location data can be communicated to the location server for processing.
- location data can be acquired and transmitted directly to the location server.
- location data can be stored on the mobile device and transmitted to the location server at predetermined intervals. For example, location data acquired during a time period, e.g., a day, week, month, etc., can be stored on the mobile device, and transmitted to the location server at the end of that time period.
- the location data can be acquired and stored on the mobile device until certain conditions are met, e.g., access to a wireless network, and then communicated to the location server.
- the location data can be stored on the location server, e.g., in digital datastore 170 of FIG. 1, until data covering a plurality of days has been received.
- the location data can include both historical location data as well as current location data.
- Location data can be acquired by the mobile device at various intervals.
- location data can be acquired by the mobile device at regular intervals during each day.
- location data can be acquired several times per minute, once per minute, once per hour, once every two hours, or at any other time interval. For building a location history that is more useful with the techniques described herein, more frequent location sampling can be better than longer intervals between location data acquisition.
- Location data can take the form of (longitude, latitude, date, time). Location data can also include an accuracy radius that represents an estimate of the accuracy of that location data point. The accuracy radius can range from meters to kilometers depending on the type of location data. For example, GPS location data can have an accuracy radius of several meters while cellular network tower location data can have an accuracy radius of several kilometers.
- the location data can also be processed by the location server 150 in a number of ways.
- raw geographic location data can be processed to generate "visited place" geographic data.
- location data can be processed to relate the raw location data to a place by calculating a centroid for a cluster of nearby location data points.
- a cluster of location data points can be defined as a set of location data points that are physically close to one another and a centroid can be defined as the geographic center of a cluster of data points. This can be referred to as distance-based clustering.
- a plurality of data points gathered during a period when the user is expected to be at home e.g., during the night
- there may be data points that correspond to different locations within the user's house e.g., kitchen, bedroom, living room, etc.
- the location data for this period would show small variations in latitude and longitude, but would relate to a single place - the home. Accordingly, such points that are close in geography over time can be treated as a cluster that represents a single place.
- Geocoding refers to a process in which a human-readable address, e.g., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, can be converted to location data in geographic coordinates, e.g., latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739.
- Reverse geocoding refers to the reverse process, i.e., converting geographic coordinates into an address.
- Such information could be stored with the location data, or it could be used to form clusters - for example, by clustering location data that relates to a single address. This can be referred to as address-based clustering.
- the data represented by such clustering could take the form of a longitude, a latitude, a start time, and an end time, where the longitude and the latitude are for the centroid and the start and end times represent the time span over which the user was present in a particular place.
- the clustered location data may also include a radius that can reflect inaccuracies in the location measurement, movement of the person within the cluster, or both.
- the data could reflect multiple visits to the same place within a user's location history data.
- the data could include a vector of visit times, with each visit time including a (start time, end time) pair.
- the technique 200 continues at step 220 where a local search is conducted for a geographic location from a user's location history.
- the geographic location includes at least a position and a time.
- the geographic location also includes a radius, or distance from the position. This radius can be derived from accuracy information relating to the technique of acquiring the geographic location, or it could be based upon variation in position within a cluster. Alternatively, a preselected value can be used.
- the purpose of conducting the local search is to return destinations proximate to the geographic location.
- a destination is a business, address, or other mappable feature that can represent a place that might have been visited by the user. In some examples, the destination is a business.
- the local search can be conducted on a local search engine.
- Local search engines are search engines that attempt to return business listings and/or relevant web pages within a specific geographical area.
- a user may enter a search query and specify a geographical area near which the search query is to be performed.
- the local search engine returns relevant results, such as listings of businesses in the geographical area and/or relevant web pages pertaining to the geographical area, to the user.
- the local search is conducted by making a call to a local search engine with the geographic location from the user's history and a radius in which the search is to be performed.
- the local search might be conducted for a latitude and longitude, along with a radius, such as, for example, 200 meters.
- the latitude and longitude are generally a point or the centroid of a cluster from the user's location history.
- the radius may be calculated as described above, or it might be preselected, such as 200 meters.
- the 200 meter radius can be helpful if the expected accuracy in the location data is on the order of 100 meters. In this way, one can be confident that the user's actual destination is within the area searched as part of the local search.
- the local search can return the names of businesses within the radius.
- the local search might also return the distance between the business and the geographic location (or otherwise specify its relative position with respect to the geographic location).
- the local search might also return a category for each business located. For example, a restaurant might return a category of "food," while a hotel might return a category of
- the local search might also return a "prominence score.”
- a prominence score can be used to rank more prominent or well-known businesses ahead of less known businesses within the radius because it may be more likely that a user visited the better known business than the one that is geographically most proximate to the geographic location measurement.
- the location prominence score may be based on a set of factors that are unrelated to the geographical area over which the user is searching.
- the set of factors may include one or more of the following factors: (1) a score associated with an authoritative document (such as the Web page for the business); (2) the total number of documents referring to a business; (3) the highest score of documents referring to the business; (4) the number of documents with reviews of the business; and (5) the number of information documents that mention the business.
- the set of factors may include additional or different factors. Further information regarding prominence scores can be found in U.S. Patent No. 7,822,751 to O'Clair et al, entitled “Scoring Local Search Results Based on Location Prominence,” issued on October 26, 2010 and assigned on its face to Google, Inc.
- example technique 200 continues at step 230 where, for each destination returned by the local search engine, the time associated with the geographic location is compared to a visit likelihood distribution across time.
- the time associated with a geographic location might be a single time and date stamp for a single location reading, or it might be a start time and an end time (for example, where the geographic location represents a cluster of locations over time), or it might be a time vector representing start and end times for a plurality of visits by the user to the same place.
- Example visit likelihood distributions over time are illustrated in FIGS. 3A, 3B, and 3C.
- FIG. 3 A provides a likelihood distribution for the category "food" 310.
- each row there are seven rows, with each row having 24 entries.
- the rows in this example represent days of the week, with the first row representing Sunday, the second row representing Monday, etc.
- Each row consists of 24 numbers, which represents the 24 hours in each day (for example, from hours 0 to 23).
- the numbers themselves represent the likelihood of a visit to a business of the type identified during the specified hour of the week.
- the numbers are in the range of [1, 9] where 1 means that a user is least likely to visit at this time and 9 means that the user is most likely to visit at this time. These are not actual probabilities and so need not total to one, or any other particular value.
- FIG. 3A illustrating a distribution 310 for the category "food”
- FIG. 3B illustrating a distribution 320 for the category "accommodation”
- FIG. 3C illustrating a distribution 330 for the category "administrative area.”
- the most likely times to visit a food business correspond to meal times, with the highest values occurring at noon, 1 :00pm, 6:00pm, and 7:00pm. The likelihood of visiting an accommodation is highest during sleeping times.
- the time-likelihood distributions need not take any particular format.
- the distributions could be static, or they could be varied based on feedback from users, such as, for example, when they "check in” at a particular business using a mobile and/or social application.
- the distributions could also vary depending on the locale - dinner times in Barcelona, Spain for example, might be different than for Des Moines, Iowa.
- the distributions could be described by an equation rather than a table, and could have greater or lesser intervals between changes in likelihood.
- Time can also be applied in the example technique using opening and closing times for the business that could be provided by the local search engine or by another kind of search engine.
- the local search might include, for example, the hours that a business is open so that these times might be compared to the visit times to aid in determining the likelihood that the user visited that business.
- a visit likelihood is computed for each potential destination that is returned by the local search 240. This computation takes into account the distance of the destination from the geographic location, and also considers the visit likelihood across time, but can include other factors as well. In some examples, the computation takes place by taking each destination returned by the local search and performing the following steps on each in order to generate a likelihood (or a
- log(likelihood) First, find the likelihood from the time distribution of likelihood for each time that the place was visited. If the business falls within more than one category having a distribution, the highest likelihood category might be used. An average likelihood can be obtained if there are more than one visit, and the log of that likelihood can be used as one portion of the overall likelihood that the user visited this destination. The log of the distance from the geographic location to the destination can be combined with the likelihood in a manner that results in nearby places scoring higher than those farther away. A log of the prominence score can also be added to the likelihood so that more prominent destinations can be scored more highly than less prominent destinations. Totaling these scores can provide a log(likelihood) total that can be used with the technique.
- multipliers a, b, c, d, and e are used to vary the amount of impact each element can have on the total likelihood score.
- This example also takes into account opening and closing times for the business in addition to the business category likelihood distribution across time. Other formulas may also be used to combine these or other factors into a score that reflects the likelihood that the user visited one or more of the destinations returned by the local search.
- step 250 at least some of the destinations are sorted in decreasing order of visit likelihood. In this way, further processing can take place with the added insight of having the user's possible destinations ranked in terms of the likelihood that the user actually visited them. In some examples, this information can be used to serve the user more relevant advertisements or match the user with more relevant information. That is, if, based on the user's location history, one could say that the user likely visited certain destinations, advertisements or other information that is relevant to that destination will likely be more relevant to the user. The user will receive better information because of the likelihood ranking.
- the user can be provided with better information when attempting to check in using any number of social networking applications.
- FIG. 4 a typical check in screen 400 for a social application running on a mobile device such as a smart phone is illustrated.
- a user is attempting to check in at a destination in Mountain View, California.
- the application in this case running on a mobile device, provides the user with a list of destinations based upon the user's geographical location as measured on the mobile device.
- the closest destination 410 is listed at the top, with a list 420 of next nearest destinations provided below. The user can select one of these destinations in order to check in.
- this list can be improved to show not only the closest destinations (keeping in mind that location determination is not always exact), but the destinations that the user most likely visited. That is, the destinations that the user likely visited will be placed at the top of the list, making it easier for the user to check in.
- that fact can be factored back into the likelihood computation. For example, when a user visits the same geographic location in the future, the formula above could include the term "+ f * log(number of times checked in at the destination)." In this way, the algorithm could factor in the likelihood that the user was returning to a place already visited.

In addition, software embodying one or more modules can be stored as an executable program on one or more non-transitory computer- readable storage mediums.
- FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram of the modules of an example of the prediction server 150.
- the prediction server 150 can include a location history module 600 configured to receive and/or maintain a location history for each user of the prediction server 150.
- the current location of a user can be inferred from the current location of a mobile device or other object in the user's possession.
- the mobile device 120 can be configured, for users who opt in and in accordance with published privacy policies, to periodically communicate its current location to the location history module 600 using the mobile network 100. This can occur several times per minute, once per minute, once per hour, or at any other regular or sporadic time interval.
- the mobile device 120 can determine or estimate its current location using any of a variety of known techniques, such as by processing GPS signals, by detecting proximity to cell towers, Wi-Fi hot spots, or other mobile access points 130 of known location, or by triangulating between the mobile device 120 and a plurality of such access points 130.
- the location history module 600 can also receive the user's current location from other sources, such as when a user "checks in” at a location using any of a number of social applications that provide for such check-ins, when the user indicates their current position by dropping a pin at a particular location or making an equivalent selection using mapping software or when the user responds to a prompt for their current position.
- the location history module 600 can be configured to store location data for the user in a location history.
- the location history can include a table of timestamps for which location data of the user is available and the locations corresponding to each timestamp.
- the location history can also include a time period during which a user was at a particular location, which can be specified by a start time and an end time.
- the locations can be specified in a format that includes a longitude, a latitude, and an accuracy radius.
- the accuracy radius can represent an estimate of the accuracy of the location data.
- the accuracy radius can range from meters to kilometers depending on the source of the location data.
- location data derived from GPS signals can have an accuracy radius of several meters while location data derived from triangulation of cell towers can have an accuracy radius of several kilometers.
- the location history module 600 can also receive raw proximity or other data from the mobile device 120 and can perform any necessary triangulation or location calculations on the server side.
- the location history module 600 can be configured to receive the user's location history, or portions thereof, in batches instead of instantaneous data points.
- the user's mobile device can be configured to store location data at various time intervals to build a location history of the device and the user.
- the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features, e.g., executed by a computing device associated with or used by the user, collect user information (e.g., information about the user's location, or other information, such as about the user's contacts, social network connections, social actions or activities, preferences, or the like), and/or to control whether and/or how to receive content from a content server based on the collected information.
- user information e.g., information about the user's location, or other information, such as about the user's contacts, social network connections, social actions or activities, preferences, or the like
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected and used by a content server.
- the location history can be stored in a cache or other memory on the mobile device, and can be transmitted to the prediction server 150 over the communications network 110 at predetermined intervals. For example, location data acquired during a time period, e.g., a day, week, month, etc., can be stored on the mobile device, and transmitted to the prediction server 150 at the end of that time period. In some examples, the location data can be acquired and stored on the mobile device until certain conditions are met, e.g., access to a wireless network is available, and can then be communicated to the prediction server 150.
- a time period e.g., a day, week, month, etc.
- the location data can be acquired and stored on the mobile device until certain conditions are met, e.g., access to a wireless network is available, and can then be communicated to the prediction server 150.
- the location data in the user's location history can be processed in various ways by the mobile device 120 and/or the prediction server 150.
- location data can be processed to relate the raw location data to a visited place by calculating a centroid for a cluster of nearby location data points.
- a cluster of location data points can be defined as a set of location data points that are physically close to one another and a centroid can be defined as the geographic center of a cluster of data points. This can be referred to as distance-based clustering. For example, for a plurality of data points gathered during a period when the user is at home, there may be data points that correspond to different locations within the user's house, e.g., kitchen, bedroom, living room, etc.
- the location data for this period would show small variations in latitude and longitude, but would relate to a single place - the user's home. Accordingly, such points that are geographically proximate over time can be treated as a cluster that represents a single place. There may also be variability in the location data caused by inaccuracies in the data, the effect of which can be limited or removed by such clustering.
- the data represented by such clustering can be specified as series of time stamps, each with a corresponding location (e.g., a longitude and a latitude of the centroid), or can be specified as a start time, an end time, and a corresponding location.
- Processing of location data can also include obtaining additional information corresponding to a geographic location, such as an address or a business name associated with that location.
- additional information corresponding to a geographic location such as an address or a business name associated with that location.
- processes known as geocoding and reverse geocoding can be used to convert geographic coordinates into human-readable places and vice versa.
- Geocoding refers to a process in which a query (e.g., a human-readable address such as "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") can be converted to location data in geographic coordinates (e.g., latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739).
- Reverse geocoding refers to the reverse process, i.e., converting geographic coordinates into an address, place, etc. This information can be stored with the location data in the user's location history or can be used to form clusters - for example, by clustering location data that relates to a single address. This can be referred to as address-based clustering.
- the location history module 600 can thus receive and/or maintain a location history for each user of the prediction server 150 indicating a plurality of places that were previously visited by that user.
- the prediction server 150 can also include a visit prediction module 602 configured to process the location history received or maintained by the location history module 600 and to predict places that the user is likely to visit in the future.
- the visit prediction module 602 can use various probabilistic and other models to make such predictions.
- the visit prediction module 602 can employ a Markov chain model to predict future visits to places that the user has visited in the past on a semi-regular basis.
- a Markov chain model can be particularly effective for making predictions based on piecewise- stationary behavior (i.e., when a user does something almost regularly for a long period and then abruptly changes behavior to a new pattern), as it can quickly pick up on new patterns following a behavior change.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an example prediction technique that can be performed by the visit prediction module 602 in such examples. While various techniques disclosed herein may be shown in relation to a flowchart or flowcharts, it should be noted that any ordering of technique steps implied by such flowcharts or the description thereof is not to be construed as limiting the technique to performing the steps in that order. Rather, the various steps of each of the techniques disclosed herein can be performed in any of a variety of sequences. In addition, as the illustrated fiowchart(s) are merely examples, various other techniques that include additional steps or include fewer steps than illustrated are also within the scope of the present disclosure.
- the illustrated technique begins at step 700, in which the visit prediction module 602 extracts a list of visited places from the user's location history.
- distance-based, address-based, or other clustering techniques can be used to prevent location data points that differ slightly but correspond to the same general place from being interpreted as two separate places, thereby preventing duplicative listings in the list of visited places.
- the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features, e.g., executed by a computing device associated with or used by the user, collect user information (e.g., information about the user's location, or other
- information such as about the user's contacts, social network connections, social actions or activities, preferences, or the like), and/or to control whether and/or how to receive content from a content server based on the collected information.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. In these ways, the user may have control over how information is collected and used by a content server.
- step 702 the visit prediction module 602 creates, for each place in the list of visited places generated in step 700, a plurality of visit vectors, each visit vector
- Each visit vector thus corresponds to a visited place and a timeslot.
- a visit vector can include a stream of Boolean values (e.g., 0 or 1, F or T, etc.). Each element in the stream corresponds to an instance of the timeslot to which the vector corresponds, and the value of each element indicates whether the user visited the place to which the vector corresponds during the timeslot instance represented by that element.
- a visit vector can be defined that corresponds to a visited place "Place A” and a timeslot "Tuesday at 4:00PM.”
- each element in the vector corresponds to a unique instance of the Tuesday at 4:00PM timeslot (e.g., Tuesday at 4PM during a first week, Tuesday at 4PM during a second week, and so on).
- An element having a value of "T” indicates that the user visited Place A on Tuesday at 4PM on the week represented by the element, whereas an element having a value of "F” indicates that the user did not visit Place A on Tuesday at 4PM on the week represented by the element.
- the number of timeslots for which vectors are created can vary between examples.
- the visit prediction module 602 can create 48 vectors for each location in the list of visited places, each vector corresponding to one of 48 time slots representing the next 48 hours from the user's current time.
- the visit prediction module 602 can create 7 vectors for each location in the list of visited places, each vector corresponding to one of 7 time slots representing the next 7 days from the user's current time.
- timeslots can vary between examples.
- a single timeslot definition can be used, or the visit prediction module 602 can create visit vectors using a plurality of different timeslot definition schemes and make predictions based on one or more of said schemes.
- Example timeslot definition schemes include the following.
- timeslots can be defined based on a particular day of the week and a particular time of the day (e.g., Tuesday at 4:00PM or Saturday at 9:00AM). In such a definition, instances of each timeslot occur at a weekly frequency.
- an example visit vector of length 4 i.e., a vector having four elements corresponding to four instances of the timeslot
- an example visit vector of length 4 can be specified as: (Tuesday of Week 1 at 4:00PM, Tuesday of Week 2 at 4:00PM, Tuesday of Week 3 at 4:00PM, Tuesday of Week 4 at 4:00PM), where weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 are consecutive weeks. If the user visited the place to which the vector corresponds every other Tuesday at 4:00PM, the visit vector above would be TFTF. If the user never visited the place on Tuesdays at 4:00PM, the visit history vector would be FFFF. If the user visited the place every Tuesday at 4:00PM, the visit history vector would be TTTT.
- timeslots can be defined based only on a particular time of day (e.g., 12:00PM or 3:00PM). In such a definition, instances of each timeslot occur at a daily frequency.
- an example visit vector of length 4 can be specified as: (Day 1 at 12:00PM, Day 2 at 12:00PM, Day 3 at 12:00PM, Day 4 at 12:00PM), where days 1, 2, 3, and 4 are consecutive days. If the user visited the place to which the vector corresponds at 12:00PM only on days 2 and 3, the visit vector would be FTTF.
- timeslots can be defined based on a particular weekday at a particular time of the weekday. In such a definition, instances of each timeslot occur at a weekday frequency.
- an example visit vector of length 4 can be specified as: (Weekday 1 at 3:00PM, Weekday 2 at 3:00PM, Weekday 3 at 3:00PM, Weekday 4 at 3:00PM), where weekdays 1, 2, 3, and 4 are consecutive weekdays (e.g., Monday-Tuesday- Wednesday-Thursday or Thursday-Friday-Monday-Tuesday).
- a single timeslot can be defined as either or both of the two weekend days. In such a definition, instances of the timeslot occur at a weekly frequency.
- an example visit vector of length 4 can be specified as: (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4), where weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 are consecutive weeks.
- a week can be defined as starting on a Monday and ending on a Sunday (such that the Saturday of a particular week and the Sunday of a particular week occur on consecutive days). If the user visited the place to which the vector corresponds on Saturday of week 1 and Sunday of week 4, but did not visit the location on any weekend days in weeks 2 or 3, the visit vector would be TFFT. Similarly, if the user visited the place every Saturday during weeks 1 through 4, the visit vector would be TTTT.
- a single timeslot can be defined as at least one of the four weekend days in a two week period. In such a definition, instances of the timeslot occur at a frequency of every two weeks.
- an example visit vector of length 4 can be specified as: (Weeks 1 and 2, Weeks 3 and 4, Weeks 5 and 6, Weeks 7 and 8), where weeks 1 through 8 are consecutive weeks.
- a week can be defined as starting on a Monday and ending on a Sunday (such that the Saturday of a particular week and the Sunday of a particular week occur on consecutive days). If the user visited the place to which the vector corresponds on Saturday of week 1 and Sunday of week 6, but did not visit the place on any other weekend days, the visit vector would be TFTF.
- the visit prediction module 602 can create 48 visit vectors for each location that appears in the user's location history.
- the 48 visit vectors correspond to 48 hour- long timeslots immediately following the user's current time, and are defined according to the first timeslot definition scheme described above.
- visit vectors for each location would be created for 11 :00PM Tuesday, 12:00AM Wednesday, 1 :00AM Wednesday, . . . , 9:00PM Thursday, and 10:00PM Thursday.
- the visit vectors created in step 702 can be processed to make visit predictions.
- a set of consecutive elements in a visit vector can be referred to as a "sub-stream.”
- An attribute X can be defined for a sub-stream as the number of positive elements in the sub-stream.
- An attribute Y can be defined for a sub- stream as the total number of elements in the sub-stream.
- a sub-stream can thus be classified according to a pair (X,Y).
- a sub-stream can be referred to as being "of type (X,Y)" or as being “a (X,Y) sub-stream.”
- the visit prediction module 602 can execute a function TotalExamples(X,Y), or "T(X,Y)" on a particular visit vector to return the number of times that sub-streams of type (X,Y) occur in that visit vector. Only sub-streams that are followed in the visit vector by a subsequent element that can be used to inform a prediction are counted by the TotalExamples function.
- the TotalExamples function can have three inputs: a visit vector to be processed, a value X indicating the number of positive values in the sub-stream type to be counted, and a value Y indicating the length of the sub-stream type to be counted.
- executing the function T(2,3) on a visit vector V would return the total number of sub-streams in V that have a length of three, include exactly two positive elements, and are followed by a subsequent element.
- visit vector V TFTF.
- T(2,3) would return a value of "1" because there is only one sub-stream in the vector (the sub-stream that consists of TFT) that has exactly two positive values, a length of three, and that is followed by a subsequent element.
- This sub-stream is followed in the visit vector by subsequent element F.
- the visit prediction module 602 can calculate a probability quotient as the number of times that historical occurrences of the most recent sub-stream in the vector are followed by a positive element, divided by the number returned by the TotalExamples function. This probability quotient can be interpreted as a percentage likelihood of the user visiting the place represented by the vector in the next instance of the timeslot represented by the vector.
- T(l ,2) would return a value of "2" because there are two sub-streams in the vector (the first sub-stream that consists of TF and the sub-stream that consists of FT) that have exactly one positive value, a length of two, and that are followed by a subsequent element.
- the second sub-stream that consists of TF is not included in the count because it is not followed by a subsequent element (i.e., it is the most-recent sub-stream in the vector).
- the first sub-stream TF is followed by subsequent element T.
- the sub-stream FT is followed by subsequent element F.
- T(l , 1) would return a value of "2" because there are two sub-streams in the vector (the first sub-stream that consists of T and the second sub-stream that consists of T) that have exactly one positive value, a length of one, and that are followed by a subsequent element. In both cases, the sub-stream T is followed by subsequent element F.
- T(0,1) would return a value of "1" because there is only one sub-stream in the vector (the first sub-stream that consists of F) that has zero positive values, a length of one, and that is followed by a subsequent element.
- the second sub-stream that consists of F is not included in the count because it is not followed by a subsequent element (i.e., it is the most-recent sub-stream in the vector).
- the first sub-stream F is followed by subsequent element T.
- the system can select a model or models on which to base its prediction based on which has the most evidence and the most detail.
- the order of the Markov model (the Y value) can be selected to balance more evidence (more occurrences of a sub-stream of interest) with more detail (more elements in the sub-stream of interest). This can be performed by iteratively analyzing the visit vector using different values for Y (i.e., different order Markov chain models), or in some other fashion.
- a first visit vector is selected for processing in step 704.
- decision block 708 it is determined whether Y is greater than zero. If Y is greater than zero, execution proceeds to step 710. Otherwise, a probability of zero is returned in step 712 and execution proceeds to decision block 720.
- the visit prediction module 602 counts the number of positive elements in the sub-stream of interest to obtain a value for X.
- X is determined to be 2 because there are two positive elements in this portion of the visit vector.
- the sub-stream of interest is determined to be of type (2,4).
- the visit prediction module 602 then executes the TotalExamples function on the visit vector using these values of X and Y to count the number of times that a sub-stream of type (X,Y) occurs in the overall visit vector.
- the visit prediction module 602 can determine that the initial value for Y is too large to obtain meaningful historical information on which to base a prediction. In other words, the model has too much detail and not enough evidence.
- the value returned by T(X,Y) is compared to a threshold value. If T(X,Y) is greater than the threshold value, execution proceeds to step 716. Otherwise, Y is decremented (e.g., decremented by one) in step 718 and execution returns to decision block 708, causing the above process to be repeated for the new value of Y.
- This process can repeat until the value returned by the TotalElements function in decision block 714 exceeds the predetermined threshold number.
- the threshold number can be 3.
- a probability of the user visiting the place represented by the visit vector in the next instance of the timeslot represented by the visit vector is calculated in step 716.
- the visit prediction module 602 can accomplish this by counting how many times sub-streams of type (X,Y) were followed by a positive element in the visit vector, and then dividing this count by the result of T(X,Y). This ratio can indicate the estimated probability of a positive element following the sub-stream of interest.
- the probability estimated for each vector can be stored in a memory by the visit prediction module 602.
- the location history consists of 6 months (or 26 weeks) of location data
- a positive element in the vector indicates that the user visited Restaurant A at 6:00PM on the Wednesday of the week represented by that element's position in the vector.
- the last three elements in the vector are FTT, indicating that the user visited Restaurant A at 6:00PM the last two Wednesdays but did not visit Restaurant A at 6:00PM three Wednesdays ago.
- TFT (which is followed by F)
- TFT (which is followed by T).
- the returned data can be used to form a predication. As shown, there are three (2,3) sub-streams that are followed by a positive element, and a total of eleven (2,3) sub-streams. Accordingly, the visit prediction module 602 can determine that there is a 3/11 or 27 percent chance that the user will visit Restaurant A next Wednesday at 6PM. This probability can be stored in association with the visit vector. As discussed below with respect to the output module 604, this probability determination can be used to decide whether to automatically provide the user with information about Restaurant A (e.g., the weather in the city or town in which Restaurant A is located, the traffic on the route between the user's current location and the location of Restaurant A, etc.).
- Restaurant A e.g., the weather in the city or town in which Restaurant A is located, the traffic on the route between the user's current location and the location of Restaurant A, etc.
- a probability of zero is returned when there is insufficient location history data for a particular place to make a confident prediction as to whether a user will visit that place in the future (e.g., when no value of Y returns greater than a threshold number of sub-stream instances).
- the visit prediction module 602 can alternatively form a prediction using other sources of information. For example, instead of limiting its analysis to the user's location history data for the particular place, the visit history module 602 can use location history data for all places that are of a similar type to the particular place.
- the visit prediction module 602 can base its prediction on the user's past visits to any restaurant. Or, if Restaurant A is an Italian restaurant, the visit prediction module 602 can base its prediction on the user's past visits to any Italian restaurant.
- the visit prediction module 602 can base its prediction on location history data for other users of the prediction server 150. For example, the visit prediction module 602 can rely on visits to the particular place by all other users. The visit prediction module 602 can also rely on visits to the particular place by other users that are of a similar demographic to the current user (e.g., other users who also have children, or other users of the same age). The visit prediction module 602 can also rely on visits to places of the same type by other users (e.g., visits to Italian restaurants generally as opposed to visits to the particular restaurant in question).
- visits to Italian restaurants generally as opposed to visits to the particular restaurant in question.
- the visit prediction module 602 can use a beta-prior technique.
- the above techniques can be particularly useful in making predictions about places that are visited relatively frequently (e.g., on a semi-regular basis). For places that are visited less-frequently, the visit prediction module 602 can use other techniques.
- a random forest model can be used by the visit prediction module 602 to make predictions about places that are visited less-frequently.
- visit vectors can be created for visited places based on the amount of time elapsed between each visit to that place.
- each element in the visit vector represents a visit
- the value of each element represents the amount of time elapsed since that visit occurred (e.g., the number of days, weeks, months, and so on)
- a place that is visited every other Saturday would have a visit vector specified as (14, 28, 42, 56, 70).
- the visit vector can also be specified such that the values of each element represent the number of days elapsed between successive visits.
- a place that is visited every other Saturday could also have a visit vector specified as (14, 14, 14, 14, 14).
- the vector can be padded with zeroes. So for example if a visit vector of length 5 is desired but only two visits exist, the vector can be specified as (0, 0, 0, 14, 28).
- a machine learning system can be used to predict whether the user will visit the place again in a particular window of time (e.g., in the next week, in the next 10 days, in the next month, etc.).
- a variety of machine learning systems known in the art can be used for this purpose, such as the WEKA open source machine learning toolkit.
- the machine learning system has two inputs.
- the machine learning system is provided with a training set of various vectors followed by a yes or a no.
- the training vectors can be visit vectors selected from a variety of sources (e.g., the current user's location history, the location history for all users, the location history for all users of a particular demographic, location history for a particular place, location history for places of a particular type, and so forth).
- the machine learning system is provided with a query vector.
- the query vector can be the vector of the current user's past visits to the place in question.
- the machine learning system looks at past occurrences of this vector in the training set and at what happened after this vector was encountered (e.g., whether and when a subsequent visit occurred).
- the machine learning system follows a series of decision trees, as opposed to merely calculating a probability, and outputs a prediction as to whether the user is likely to visit the place in the next week, two weeks, month, etc.
- other learning models can be used, such as one that models visits based on a continuous, slowly-changing behavior assumption. Such models can use longer vectors as evidence but down-weigh visits based on how long ago they occurred.
- the prediction server 150 can also include an output module 604 configured to output information about places the user is predicted to visit.
- the output module 604 can send a text message, email, or push notification to the user's mobile device including such information.
- the output module 604 can output an instruction that instructs the user's mobile device to display the information, or to direct the mobile device's web browser to a website containing the information.
- Outputs generated by the output module 604 can be sent as data transmissions via the mobile network 100 to the mobile device 120, which can in turn be configured to display or otherwise present the output to the user.
- the presentation to the user can be in a standalone application, a device home screen, a native application, or in any other program executed on the mobile device.
- the output module 604 can determine whether to output information by comparing the probabilities generated for each visit vector by the visit prediction module 602 to a predetermined threshold probability.
- Example threshold probabilities can include 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or any other value determined to be useful through routine experimentation.
- Information relating to the place to which a vector corresponds can be output if the probability stored in association with that vector exceeds the threshold.
- the output module 604 can output information relating to Restaurant A.
- the timing of the output can vary from one example to the next, however, in some examples, the output is performed shortly before the relevant timeslot.
- the output can be generated at 5:00PM on Wednesday, one hour before the relevant 6:00PM timeslot.
- any of a variety of types of information available from the Internet or from the user's mobile device that relates to the relevant place and/or the relevant timeslot can be output by the output module 604.
- the output module 604 can output a traffic update for the user's route to the relevant place, a weather forecast for the relevant place, contact information of the user's contacts who live or work near the relevant place, news stories about the relevant place, and so forth.
- FIG. 8 An example technique of outputting information relating to places that a user is predicted to visit is shown in FIG. 8.
- the technique of FIG. 8 can run periodically or sporadically at any of a variety of timings.
- the technique is executed by the prediction server 150 nightly.
- the technique begins at step 800 where the user's location history is received or retrieved by the location history module 600. It will be appreciated that the location history module 600 can itself maintain the user's location history, in which case it may not be necessary to actively receive or retrieve it.
- the visit prediction module 602 makes future visit predictions for each visited place in the user's location history for each of one or more timeslots.
- the visit prediction module 602 can generate a prediction for each place/timeslot combination, e.g., in the form of a percentage likelihood that a user will visit the place during the timeslot as described above with respect to the technique of FIG. 7.
- step 804 a first of said predictions is selected for analysis.
- the probability or other quantitative value of the prediction is compared to a threshold amount in decision block 806. If the probability exceeds the threshold, information relating to the place and/or the timeslot is output for presentation to the user in step 808. If the probability does not exceed the threshold, it is determined in decision block 810 whether any unprocessed predictions exist. If so, execution returns to step 804 where the next unprocessed prediction is selected and processed as described above. If no unprocessed predictions remain, execution ends at step 812.
- a user can be automatically provided with information relating to a place that they are likely to visit in the near future, without requiring the user to actively or manually seek out the information.
- FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram of the modules of a mobile device for use in such an example.
- the structure and function of the mobile device illustrated in FIG. 9 is substantially similar to that of the prediction server of FIG. 6, except as noted herein and as will be readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, a detailed description thereof is omitted here for the sake of brevity.
- the mobile device can include a location history module 900 and a visit prediction module 902 that function in the same manner as those disclosed above with respect to the prediction server 150, except that data stored or produced by a remote server can be accessed by those modules using one or more calls to the remote server, for example using the mobile network 100.
- the mobile device can also include a display module 904 which operates in the same way as the output module 604 above, and that is configured to display information relating to places the user is predicted to visit, for example on a display screen of the mobile device.
