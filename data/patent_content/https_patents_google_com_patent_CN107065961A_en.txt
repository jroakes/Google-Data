Background technology
Although a large amount of effort and concern continue to invest exploitation renewal and more sustainable energy supply, by improving energy
Source efficiency is following still very crucial for the energy in the world to save the energy.According to from USDOE in October, 2010
Report, heats and freeze and account for typical U.S.'s residential energy is utilized 56%, becomes the energy consumption of most houses maximums.Even
With the improvement (for example, improved warming, more efficient warming machine) that the entity device related with freezing is heated to house, energy effect
Rate significantly improves the more preferable control and regulation that can be heated by house with refrigeration plant and realized.By with select with caution when
Between the runlevel that is spaced and carefully selects heat, divulge information and air adjustment (HVAC) equipment to start, can keep living it is empty
Between save mass energy while appropriateness is comfortable for its occupant.
But, in history, most known HVAC thermostatic control systems can be divided into one of two comparable class, it is believed that appoint
A kind of is not optimal in most realistic residential environment.In the first classification is many simple, non-programmable house thermostats,
Every kind of single mechanically or electrically driver plate generally included for setting preferred temperature and the single-fan-pass-AC that heats are switched.Although
Even using being all simple for most common occupant, but any Energy Saving Control is movable, such as adjusts nocturnal temperature
Or all heat supply/refrigeration are closed before leaving home, it is necessary to manually performed by user.Thus, the user of non-most but all vigilance
Generally it can all miss a large amount of saving energy chances.In addition, not providing the energy-conservation setting of higher level, such as triggering is specified to heat/freeze list
The customization temperature amplitude of oscillation needed for member is opened (expects (such as 1 degree to 3 of difference between design temperature and actual Current Temperatures
Degree)) ability.
On the other hand, in second of classification it is many programmable thermostats, it comes because of Energy Star in recent years
(U.S.) and TCO (Europe) standards and become more commonly and in terms of many different sets for the HVAC system that can be manipulated individually
It is progressive notable.But, unfortunately, user is generally arranged as difference after the panel door on thermostat surface or thermostat and matched somebody with somebody
The dazzling switch and controller array put frighten and seldom adjust manufacturer's default value to optimize its own
Using energy source.Therefore, even if the programmable thermostats installed in many houses can technically be run with saving setting shelves
HVAC, but only implement generic manufacturers default setting shelves in many houses.In fact, unfortunately in many cases,
Residential customer may be permanent with " interim " or " holding " mode operation unit, as unit is simply, non-programmable thermostat
The design temperature that manual manipulation is shown.
In more typically meaning, because people inevitably necessarily participates in, so can be provided in the presence of (i) HVAC control system
Energy-conservation complexity amount and (ii) save complexity and can put between the degree in the actual routine use of many houses occur tight
The situation of opening.Similar Problems appear in the multiple-unit apartment with one or more HVAC systems, hotel, retail shop, office building,
In industrial building and the more generally background of any living space or working space.Those skilled in the art are being read in the disclosure
The other problems of appearance are can be appreciated that during appearance.
It will be appreciated that if skilled craftsman is with reference to known to present disclosure, although the specific background controlled herein in HVAC system
Lower proposition exemplary, but there are a variety of other utilization of resources backgrounds that embodiment is easily applied, including (but do not limit
In) water conservancy is used, air is utilized, the utilization of the energy of the utilization of other natural resources and other forms (that is, non-HVAC is related).Cause
This, the application of this embodiment under these other utilization of resources backgrounds belongs in this teachings.
The programmable device for controlling HVAC system, such as thermostat are provided according to some embodiments.Programmable dress
Put including being adapted and programming to perform the height for the multiple high powers activity for including interfacing with user when in being active
Power digital circuit, uses substantially much smaller power when high power consumption circuit is in inactive state or sleep state.Device also includes
The low consumption circuit of multiple low-power activities is adapted and is programmed to carry out, it includes for example causing high power circuit from inactive
Status transition is active state；Poll sensors, such as temperature and take sensor；Be turned on and off HVAC functions.Device
Also include being adapted stealing electricity from the electric power for gathering electric power for opening and closing the HVAC triggers circuits of HVAC system function
Road；With electric power storage medium, such as rechargeable battery, it is adapted to store by electric power steals circuit collection come at least for height
Electric power that power digital circuit is used so that low consumption circuit can with than electric power steal circuit can the bigger speed of safe collection make
Run with interim during the energy with active state without unexpectedly switching HVAC functions.The example of high power activity includes channel radio
Letter；Drive display circuit；Graphical information is shown to user；The calculating related to study to performing.

A kind of " brain stem " function is provided when member is 100) away from keyboard.
Figure 10 A to Figure 10 C diagrams exist according to the representative of the embodiment of house (or other spaces) without radio data network
House 201 (or other spaces, retail shop, office building, industrial building such as with one or more HVAC systems and more typically
Any living space in ground or working space) in install multiple VSCU units favourable situation concept map.Have for house 201
Figure 10 A of single HVAC system 298 embodiment, main VSCU units 100 are mounted and are connected to it via control line 298
On, wherein auxiliary VSCU units 100'(is for example) it is placed on bedside cupboard 1202.Main VSCU units 100 and auxiliary VSCU are mono-
First 100' is respectively configured to the presence of automatic identification another one and uses wireless communication protocol, is such as run with adhoc mode
Wi-Fi or ZigBee communicate with one another.
Many favorable abilities be programmed in VSCU units 100 and 100' with weigh its communication and many sensing capabilities so that its
Many VSCU Elementary Functions as described herein without access to the Internet are performed (for example, " study " house with cooperation mode joint
HVAC environment, execution take sensing and prediction, " study " users'comfort preference etc.).Lift for simplified example, implement at one
In scheme, main VSCU units 100 receive temperature data from auxiliary VSCU units 100' and calculate the average value of two temperature, control
HVAC system 299 processed causes the mean temperature of house 201 to maintain current temperature setpoint level.One or more additional auxiliary
VSCU units (not shown) also can be positioned on one or more additional positions of premises and can turn into MANET " house
A part for VSCU networks ".The scope of this teaching is not limited to the auxiliary VSCU units of any specific maximum quantity.In further advantage
In, it is favourable to add more auxiliary VSCU units, because being detected, beneficial to spatial temperature gradient and heat beneficial to more accurately taking
The more preferable determination of characteristic and the data-handling capacity that supplement is provided.
Preferably, the main auxiliary of VSCU units 100/ VSCU units 100' is programmed to create master-slave relationship, and wherein its is automatic
Any conflict for changing control determination is solved in the way of being conducive to main VSCU units and/or makes any user on main cell defeated
Enter any conflicting user input prior to being carried out from VSCU units.Although main VSCU units 100 are starting or are giving tacit consent to feelings
It is probably " master " VSCU units under border, but any specific VSCU units are made as the identity of " master " or " from " not only by it
Identity for main VSCU units or auxiliary VSCU units is specified.In addition, any specific VSCU units are used as " master " or " from "
Identity is not fixed, but dynamic creation is best to meet the current HVAC that such as most preferably can be sensed and/or predicted by VSCU units
Control needs.For a preferred embodiment, the establishment of " master " to " from " identity is optimized to best meet such as by VSCU
The comfort level demand for the human occupants that unit most preferably can be sensed and/or predicted.For example, if each VSCU units are at it
The presence of multiple occupants is sensed in corresponding region, then main VSCU units are created as master unit and control HVAC system
299 cause the mean temperature readings of two VSCU units according to the template schedule of current active (i.e. time interval and it is each when
Between the schedule of set point temperatures that is spaced) remain current set point temperature.But if (such as in this reality in addition to the people of bedroom one
The auxiliary VSCU units 100' that is positioned on bedside cupboard is sensed in example) do not sense and have occupant in house, then aid in
VSCU units 100' is changed into " leading " VSCU units, and it orders " from " VSCU units 100 to control HVAC system 299 to cause as " master " is single
Member is sensed, and the temperature in bedroom remains current set point temperature.
Studied based on human behavior, many other automations that statistics is compiled and the like are master/slave creates situation and control
It is determined that belonging in the range of this teaching.In an example, MS master-slave determines to be in more good position based on which thermostat with more
It is reliably based on history and/or tests the circulation behavior observed or the automation determination of other standards domination temperature and carry out
And/or impacted or support.For example, the sensor directly over thermo-recorder may be unreliable and excessively continually makes to warm up
Mechanism of qi is circulated.Node in bathroom and under direct sunshine is also more unreliable.When there is multiple sensor/nodes, there is determination
The principal and subordinate of which more reliable algorithm and presence based on the determination determines.For some related embodiments, automatically determine
The adverse effect for being designed at least partly improving this placement can be allocated for the VSCU units in close bathroom and dish-washing machine
Custom built forms.
The establishment of the main auxiliary VSCU units of VSCU units 100/ 100' principal and subordinate's identity is also based on mankind's control input.
For example, if the presence of each VSCU unit senses multiple occupants into its corresponding region, and then user at two
The upper change current set point temperature manually of one of unit, then VSCU units can show that the output of monitor 102 is asked in its circle
Inscribe " main covering" (be similar to figure 5 above A to Fig. 5 B shown in inquiry ability), answer option "Yes" together with two and " allow VSCU
Determine ", the latter is circled to be responded by default.On the other hand, if two VSCU sense the use jointly only in house
The presence at family and without other occupants, then master unit can be created as by any cell of user's control, without inquiry user
Decision scheme.In further example, VSCU units 100/100' can be programmed to make it that the establishment of master/slave identity can be by user
The menu of one when system is set using two VSCU units (such as during question and answer are set) or in subsequent configuration drives
Dynamic user interface (seeing above Fig. 4 to Fig. 5 B) is clearly specified.When with as described in this specification other parts with lock function and/or
User's proprietary identification is when combining, and this wants to use the VSCU units control house temperature in their bedrooms and not at night in father and mother
Their teenage daughters are allowed to use the VSCU units in her bedroom particularly useful in the case of controlling house temperature at night.
Electric power availability is based on always according to the multiple VSCU units of embodiment offer and/or circuit heats standard with optimal side
Formula carefully shares the ability of calculating task between them.Senior sensing, prediction and control that many provides for VSCU units
Algorithm is relative complex and computation-intensive and if performing uncontrolledly may cause high power consumption and/or device to heat.For
One embodiment, intensive calculations automatically distribution cause its most (or multiple) it is known can now obtain optimal power supply and/or
Performed in a subset of the VSCU units of the known storage battery electric power for obtaining maximum amount.Thus, for example, due to being usually
Simplified installation and equipment safety consider, it is preferable that each main VSCU units are without family expenses AC electric power, so Figure 10 A master
VSCU units 100 are generally powered by the energy gathered from one or more 24VAC call realys power signals and therefore may
Only there is limited amount additional power to be used to perform intensive calculations.Can be with clock on the contrary, typically aiding in VSCU units to be
The bedside cupboard unit that radio is equally readily inserted into.In this case, many computational loads can distribute mono- to auxiliary VSCU
Member make it that electric power is saved in main VSCU units.In another embodiment, auxiliary VSCU units are (or more generally
Be allocated heavier computational load any VSCU units) perform density data calculate speed can be used known technology be subject to automatically
Control to avoid excessive device heating so that the TEMP mistake in the unit is avoided.In another embodiment
In, be allocated heavier computational load VSCU units TEMP function can temporary suspension reach include the calculating time it is lasting when
Between interval cause the control decision for not making to make mistake in the case where big circuit heating occurs really.
Referring now to Figure 10 B, it is often the case that house or management place can have two or more HVAC systems, wherein
Each is responsible for the different zones in house and controlled by the thermostat of its own.So, Figure 10 B are shown and first area Z1 phases
The first HVAC system 299 closed and the second HVAC system 299' related to second area Z2.According to embodiment, the first master
The main VSCU units 100 " of VSCU units 100 and second are provided for controlling correspondence HVAC unit 299 and 299'.First main VSCU is mono-
The main VSCU units 100 " of member 100 and second are configured to its communication of balance and many sensing capabilities so that it is combined with cooperation mode holds
Row is many similar or like in above with reference to VSCU Elementary Functions described in Figure 10 A based on collaboration communication and as described herein
Multi-area control other cooperation VSCU Elementary Functions.As illustrated in figure 10 c, the first main VSCU of main VSCU units 100 and second
The collaboration feature of unit 100 " can be further by adding one or more auxiliary VSCU units according to other embodiments
100' and further enhance.
Should be appreciated that be present in exist in some houses except each thermostat control the situation of a different HVAC systems with
Outer other many thermostat situations and multiple VSCU cell arrangements of this kind of system can be controlled to belong in the range of this teaching.One
In a little existing residential devices, single warming machine or single air-conditioning unit may be only existed, but house can still rely on ducting system
In braking air flap and be divided into multiple " regions ", each " region " is controlled by the thermostat of its own.In this case, two
Individual main VSCU units, which can be mounted and configure, to be come optionally with reference to the cooperation of one or more auxiliary VSCU units with according to described

Two circulation time curves of identical 1002 and 1004 in terms of total time percentage (for example, total the number of minutes in one hour).It is right
In two adjacent domains (such as Z1 and Z2) of thermal communication with one another, it has been found that run its system in the case of without mutual control operation
Heat (or refrigeration) unit can make system be strayed into a kind of high-frequency resonant response (Figure 10 D, curve 1002), it is characterized in that between amplitude of oscillation point
Fast temperature fluctuation and the circulation of of a relatively high quantity per hour, it can reduce efficiency because inertia startup and shutdown are lost.
On the contrary, when being controlled intentionally to differ each other according to embodiment, it has been found that occur more stable and more low-frequency response
Behavior (Figure 10 D, curve 1004), it is characterized in that less circulation per hour and corresponding higher efficiency.
A particularly advantageous embodiment under background for connecting VSCU units in non-network, VSCU units are configured

The postcode and street address of information, such as management place.Should be appreciated that above mentioned problem and selectivity answer only citing propose and
Unrestricted and many other problems and selectivity answer can provide the supplement or replacement as these examples, without departing from this teaching
Scope.
According to some embodiments, the postcode of house or management place can before and after setting question and answer start inquiry and with
It can be inquired afterwards based on postcode for the pre-customized different setting question-and-answer problems of different geographic regions.This is useful, because (example
Such as) best one group of question-and-answer problem for Alaska house or management place likely differs from (such as) and is directed to Florida house
Best one group of question-and-answer problem.
According to some embodiments, user is used for the house is automatic in initial setting up question and answer to the response of problem
On one of " snap-in " extremely multiple original template schedules, i.e. the row of the set point temperatures of time interval and each time interval
Journey table, it is stored in VSCU units and corresponding to some most common houses or management place example.Different house examples are (wherein
Can each have the original template schedule of its own) example may include：There is no the work man and wife of child；There are baby or child
Work man and wife；Work Home；The idle work man and wife of spouse；The active profession young man of night life；Retired man and wife；
With solitary retiree.House is based on setting question and answer (or some other times when user asks) institute in system initialization
The template schedule of " snap-in " serves as the facility starting point of the operation control of the HVAC system of many devices.User then can (example
Such as, using the user interface with VSCU unit sheets, socket or smart phone interface etc.) its template schedule is changed to fit
Answer its individual demand.VSCU units can also be automatically based upon the occupancy type learnt and manual user temperature control settings type is repaiied
Change these template schedules.By non-limiting examples, the typical template schedule of Work Home can be to heat " star for winter
Phase one, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday：[7:00 68][9:00 62][16:00 68][22:00 62] week

9 points to the morning of point is 68 degree, is then 62 degree from 9:00am to 4:00pm, then from 4 points in afternoon to evening 10 points be 68 degree,
Then from 10 points in evening to the morning 7 points be 62 degree, and for two all doomsdays, set point temperatures can be from 7 points in the morning to evening
10 points are 68 degree, then from 10 points in evening to the morning 7 points be 62 degree) and in cooling in summer " Monday, Tuesday, star
Phase three, Thursday, Friday：[7:00 75][9:00 82][16:00 78][22:00 75] Saturday, Sunday [7:00
75][9:00 78][22:00 75]”.In other embodiments, the amplitude of oscillation Temperature Quantity allowed, humidity range etc. can also
It is included in template schedule.
For an embodiment, template schedule can optionally in the way of iTunes Music playlist is shared
Shared under social networks background.For example, user can supply the issue of its template schedule on itself Facebook or MySpace page
Other people download.Customization or normalized template schedule can be provided based on house size or postcode.Template schedule preferably may be used
Based on calendar (for example, Christmas Day differently scheduling being in for more people).This is better than prior art scheduling, wherein various regions
All clients are endowed identical schedule or identical group of constraint being programmed in it to schedule.
For an embodiment, the instruction for mounting of customization can be supplied to based on its previously installed thermostat model
User.User can enter the website of VSCU manufacturers and input its current thermostat species and model and then provide based on described
The specification of a set of customization of the known mode of connection of model is for checking, downloading and printing.Optionally, in the computer of user
Or customization video is provided on smart phone.For another senior preferred embodiment, user can shoot its current thermostat
Photo and submit it to the website of VSCU manufacturers, wherein its species and model will use machine vision technique automatically true
It is fixed so that user need not find out its present kind and model.
For an embodiment, VSCU units are configured and programmed to carry out automatic detection and to correct one or more VSCU mono-
Exposure of the member in direct sunlight.Although as used any thermostat, user, which is proposed, to be avoided VSCU units being placed on directly
Sunshine region, but finding that VSCU units are placed on by many people by rule of thumb makes it straight within annual at least part time
Sunshine is connect up to the position of at least part time of one day.Direct sunshine exposure can damage HVAC system validity significantly, because warm
Degree can mistakenly be sensed into height, for example, VSCU units will measure 80 degree when room temperature is actual only 68 degree.According to embodiment party
Case, one or more VSCU units are programmed to (such as) by following the trail of temperature and then filtering within the cycle of a couple of days to several weeks
Between the cyclic behaviour characteristic and/or the multiple VSCU units of filtering of direct sunshine exposure eigenperiod sex differernce and detect straight
Connect sunshine exposure.Then implement correction using another bearing calibration.
For example it is and unrestricted, for correcting the straightforward procedure for heating and freezing read based on understanding ambient light sensor
Number, current time, current accurate or approximate date, it is previous heat/kind of refrigeration cycle duration, temperature change and humidity change and
In direct sunshine interim using Direct Digital deviation to sunshine sensor reading.From first pair learning occurs for VSCU units
Daylight impinges upon time and duration on device.If for example, date of the daylight before spring is in the morning 9:00 to 9:15 it
Between irradiate sensor, then it will be about in the next morning 8:58 to 9:13 check daylight.If need not now heat/
Kind of refrigeration cycle, then a kind of its mode of correction can be temperature to be estimated when direct sunshine effect weakens and in the morning 8:58 to 9:
In the interpolation of Current Temperatures and predicted temperature between 13.If heat/kind of refrigeration cycle need open, then its learn previous loops
And estimate cycle duration and temperature change.It can be used (device in itself in or another nigh device in)
Humidity and other sensors with verify heat/kind of refrigeration cycle opens and stays open up to appropriate time amount.
For some embodiments, VSCU units are modeled based on human comfort degree and provide optimal but energy-conservation control.
In one example, if user continues to heighten thermostat to higher than set point specified in template schedule, then VSCU is mono-
Member will learn and increase set point in its template schedule.In further example, if external temperature continues for many days
80 degree, and then have suddenly become 60 degree within one day, then VSCU units will make house be maintained at more than external temperature days persistently
Warmer set point in the case of 60 degree.Reason be the ambient weather type that known mankind custom has been continued for some time and
Therefore it is more more sensitive than longer-term temperature change to temperature jump.If for example, many days 60 degree, then people will more likely continue
Wear more warming (putting on long sleeves and similar clothing) and therefore set point can gradually reduce and/or amplitude of oscillation amount can gradually rise to save
Save the energy.
As another example of optimal but energy-conservation the control modeled based on human comfort degree, for an embodiment party
Case, VSCU is configured to based upon occupant's time of return of prediction and performed in an advantageous manner.For the present embodiment, theory is
(or precooling in corresponding instance) house is intentionally preheated, but only in limited range, can be solely " leaving home " and is set with " occupancy "
60% of difference between fixed point, until physical presence takes detecting event.If for example, " leaving home " set point temperatures are 64
Degree, then " occupancy " set point temperatures are 74 degree, then VSCU units start to house system before the expected 20 minutes time of getting home
Heat, but only so until house is heated to 70 degree.Then, when occupant enters, by VSCU unit triggers, remaining 4 degree heat.
In addition to energy-conservation, this occupant that can also make to go home feels happy, because hot blast is blowing, its sense for assigning the impression of family and being welcome
Feel, the impression of a kind of " it is very good to go home, excellent ".Moreover, it has been discovered that people are when just when of coming into door ratio is in slow-witted the preceding paragraph
Between after can more stand lower temperature.
As VSCU units provide it is optimal but energy-conservation control another example, exist be found provide for it is long when
Between but open the situation of entering house door in a limited number of times, such as occupant moves into the good result in the case of Christmas tree or groceries.Especially
Its, if generally from 68 degree heat to 72 degree need 5 minutes and suddenly only from 68 degree heat to 69 degree if spent 5 minutes or making
Temperature still keeps 68 degree after hot five minutes, then in the case where exception is temporary possibility, VSCU units, which will immediately shut off, to be heated
Up to 10 minutes to 15 minutes, and then again attempt to temperature raising back 72 degree.And if abnormal strictly temporary, that
Situation is settled a dispute by the parties concerned themselves.But, occur again if heating failure, then there may be the warning that request user notes (or short
Information) and if without the response from user, then the system system of Himdu logic is showed problem and closed.Email message can be sent to
User, such as " we exclude these items x-y-z from sensor logs, and possible entering house door is opened or a-b-c goes out
It is wrong ".
For another embodiment, there is provided the related combination operation of " study " process to VSCU units 100 and technology
Method.VSCU units are programmed to provide that relevant user takes and temperature control type substantially " learns ".Will for learn into
Exhibition (for example, " your occupied information is by study 60% ") such as shown every now and then by remote control, Email, SMS, VSCU unit
Etc. informing user.But, also there is the ability that user closes learning functionality because uncomfortable.In one embodiment, VSCU systems
System " will be pretended " not learnt (such as by stopping Progress message), but actually still learn in the background, with simulation model
Run and continue to compile learning materials.Then, after past a period of time, VSCU units can calculate the actual mould that it is run
Energy cost difference between the simulation model that formula is run in the background to it.If there is the significant difference of " X " dollar, then
Can show or send to user such as " if good morning enable study drive control if, then you may save $ 44, you
It is determined that being not desired to open now" message.
For another embodiment, there is provided the combination warp that the service of order is provided a user by VSCU data service providers
Battalion and technical method.When VSCU data service providers release New Algorithm, they can provide outer for VSCU unit clients
The order of portion's control/optimization service.As a part for the process of offer, VSCU data service providers can be gone through to the client
The inside and outside temperature data of history runs new algorithm and then (for example, display is shown or remotely accessed by VSCU units) informs
Client, " if good morning order this optimization service if, you may last year saving $ 88 ".Can be for an other firmware version
This renewal carries out similar offer, for example, " buy VSCU units software version 2.0 rather than still using version 1.0 if good morning
Words, you may save $ 90, and you are ready to spend $ 20 to buy version 2 .0 now”
For another embodiment, (showing or remotely access display for example, by VSCU units) is that user assigns suggestion
The combination operation of message and technical method, all following articles：" in the postcode with you with your house is equirotal possesses
The house of VSCU functions flower $ 1000 on heating and freezing, and you have spent $ 2000.You, which there may be, leaks out or sealing strip is asked
Topic.You can dial 650-555-1212 calling ABC HVAC repair companies, and it can carry out energy examination for you and be asked to find out
Topic.”
For another embodiment, VSCU units be programmed and configure be based solely on HVAC budgets providing the user and
Non-targeted temperature sets and controlled the ability of its HVAC system.User simply inputs it and wants monthly dollar gold of the flower on HVAC
Volume and VSCU adjust automaticallies set cause the selected amount of money according to the known occupancy type and preference of user with the most comfortable (or not
Level of comfort is minimum) mode spend.Optionally, user can heighten or turn down manually setting temperature from the VSCU schedules created
Degree, but if done so, VSCU units will show the cost variance by generation (for example, " daily extra $ 5 immediately：Continue
{ being } { no } ").Calculate it is contemplated that seasonal weather type, present month, weather forecast etc..For another embodiment party
Case, VSCU units can independently inquire user that " you want to save $ 100 by allowing VSCU to manage your setting for this month{ being }
{ no } " (with only inquiry " by temperature reduction once how " it is relative).
For another embodiment, VSCU units are programmed and configured " prepays HVAC " and/or " existing to provide the user
Pay HVAC ".Based on advance payment or budget amount, VSCU displays will show remaining dollar gold in prepayment or budget amount
Volume.This may be particularly useful in landlord-tenant's environment or estate management environment, and wherein landlord can be programmed and room to the amount of money
Visitor can check remaining sum in any particular point in time.This is also particularly useful to chalet, it is allowed to estate management side's remote management
Electricity usage and setting.As one part, above-mentioned software lock mechanism can determine that who is using thermostat based on personal code,
So VSCU will appreciate that the identity of user.This still can be highly useful in the case of single-family housing, wherein can set specific objective and
Family can dynamically check the running score about its performance situation relative to the target.The amount of money can be one group of acquiescence estimate
Or can be based on as used (such as) actual amount of the intelligent metering meter reading from utility company's database access.
For another embodiment, VSCU units are programmed and configured provides temperature setting branch to be based on user identity
Match somebody with somebody.Software lock work(can be used to ensure that the people only held pin can change the setting of VSCU temperature and VSCU units recognize list
Only landlord's (or other " dominator " passwords) and one or more single tenants (or other " by dominators ") password.Landlord
It can then log in and set maximum design temperature, such as 75 degree.Then, although tenant can change temperature, but VSCU is mono-
Member does not allow tenant that temperature is set higher than into 75 degree.Various tamper-evident means can be provided.Tamper-evident means by default, room
East is able to access that VSCU data service providers website to ensure its usage data of VSCU units time-triggered report, request weather data
Etc..
For another embodiment, with reference to Figure 12 hotel 1202, VSCU data service providers 1208 can be hotel

Dynamicization, comprehensive, dynamic control.For example, room VSCU temperature set-points can be adjusted when guest moves in first to comfort level
And then return to energy-saving horizontal after guest checks out.In addition, during guest stays at an inn, inherence is taken detection and (carried using unit
Sensor) and/or it is inherent take detection (by the hotel's computer for being connected to VSCU Hospitality management systems sense automatically door from
The inside is locked) it can be used for starting comfort level to energy-saving horizontal.This can be similarly used for by infrastructure management company's remote management
Chalet.
VSCU units also provide user based on its actual controlling behavior after being inputted by remote control or directly defeated
Enter to VSCU units (such as set question and answer during) that the template schedule that may be assigned to VSCU units manually to user is set
Point level or time interval definition carry out automation covering or rewriting.If for example, user specifies its every in question and answer are set
At 5 points in its afternoon goes home, but then continuous many days (for example, continuous 2 days or 3 days) temperature in the afternoon 4:30 be raised from 62 degree to
65 degree, then this is used to weigh schedule and then in the afternoon 4:20 heighten set point to 65 degree so that temperature is pre- in user
Phase comes into the afternoon 4 at door:65 degree are preheated to before 30.VSCU units change template schedule to generally conform to user's automatically
Actual behavior in home life and non-user voluntarily estimate that its behavior in home life gradually can occur or can immediately be given birth in the odd-numbered day within time a couple of days
The scope imitated without departing from this teaching.
For another embodiment, VSCU units are programmed and configured come by solving user based on the information sensed
Be intended to any ambiguity and be switched to refrigerating function from heat-production functions automatically.The essence of Figure 1A to Fig. 1 C VSCU units 100
Part is caused to be that nothing heats-closed-AC switches.A resulting problem is that relevant user is anticipated under specific user's control input
The potential ambiguity of figure.If for example, set point is changed to 65 degree by user from 78, then there may be them and merely desire to close
Close heat or they want open air-conditioning ambiguity.According to embodiment, background of the VSCU units based on set point change
The ambiguity whether switched with the solution of new and old set-point value.In one embodiment, method comprises the following steps：(a) tie up
The updated value of drift temperature is held, it is defined as in the case where not heating or freezing to controlled space using HVAC, and controlled space can
The estimation temperature that can be floated to；(b) user's set point change from old set point to new set point is received；(c) according to current temperature
The value of degree and the drift old set point of Temperature estimate and new set point is (for example, place it in by Current Temperatures and drift temperature
Divide trizonal state diagram on) with according to pattern switching (i.e. from heat be switched to freeze or be switched to from refrigeration heat)
Whether (i) clearly need not；(ii) clearly require；Or (iii) user carry out set point change when may need and to setting
Point change is classified；If being categorized as " may need " (d) in step (c) or if new set point being in Current Temperatures
Between drift temperature, then represent that illustrating for more energy efficient option asks user in (i) active together with drift option naturally
Switching is selected with realizing that new set point and (ii) are drifted to naturally between new set point.Another correlation function is no matter user exists
How to be selected in step (d), with this as study point and then next time occur when, can be automatically based upon to user select study
Automatically determination is made.For this method, or it may be present using different parameters substitution drift temperature for state diagram, for example, outside
Temperature, external temperature add 10 degree, " minimum comfort temperature " or similar temperature.It can be the optimal use in California
Numeral is drift temperature, and it is probably minimum comfort temperature in the Minnesota State.
For in view of automating the sustained improvement sensed and some particularly suitable embodiments, personalization control example leads to

VSCU correlation functions current and will demands of individuals and needs.For an example, VSCU units are programmed with " fingerprint
Change " function with recognize controlled before the enterprising trade of cell surface adjustment particular user and then suitably adjusted for the user
Its whole response.For example, user rotate VSCU unit outer shrouds concrete mode or its its finger is placed on VSCU units driver plate or master
Body (using touch sensing), it, which is inwardly clicked on, applies how much pressure and its body and (uses apart from VSCU unit driver plates are how close
Proximity transducer) it can be used as its " fingerprint ".In an example, each user can be identified in single question answer dialog
With first " fingerprinted " and its people's preference then can be from remote location or defeated in the control of driver plate up to VSCU units by it
Enter and learn.Initially, majority is fingerprinted to be completed via the user command from user's mobile phone and network.People can
Thermostat is largely controlled from its phone before getting home or after leaving home.If in addition, they are being easier to access calculating
The other positions (or even on home computer) of machine, then they can use network.Personalization from VSCU units
Control can multiple " users'comfort model " figures based on identified people.Model construction is in its preference/and physical comfort region
On.But if there is multiple users with very different preference, then build two (or more) different models
Rather than its equalization completely may be beneficial to.VSCU, which can rely on from remote ip address, to be accessed system and is in based on whom, for example,
It is in (or further feature) based on which mobile device or which user stays out and implements to be based on a model or another mould
The comfort temperature of type.Network service can be used for notifying these differences as information (and user can be caused to inform that it is matched somebody with somebody to user
Occasionally wear sweater).For taking the instantiation that detection and set point are adjusted, VSCU units according to the personalized of embodiment
It can judge the first occupant " M " with its remote control and direct control based on setting of its to VSCU units and like cooling off oneself a bit, and
Second occupant " W " likes warming up.When system determines that " W " is in and " M " stays out, subsequent temperature is set to higher
Or the independent template schedule customized for " W " is deferred in addition.The presence of " W " (for example) can not divided with " M's " using IP flows
Analysis method detects to determine that " M " is still on duty when house is sensed with occupant (it must be " W ").

The automated setting point based on set point temperatures schedule is provided according to some embodiments to determine and manual user
The algorithm of set point modification.The lasting rule changed as any manual user set point, user in main VSCU user interfaces or
Any set point inputted in VSCU user interfaces is aided in come into force most long four hours, operation, which is returned, after this time point just sets up
Pinpoint schedule.If normal set point schedule required the temperature change of scheduling (for example, scheduling at described four hours in interval
At night 10:00 point of change turns to sleep temperature), then it is defeated that the temperature set-point of scheduling covers manual user set point at this moment
Enter.
There is provided according to some embodiments and to be taken based on the closing space that senses and user's set point act of revision is set
Pinpoint the algorithm that schedule deviates and/or set point schedule is changed.Such a set point scheduling is discussed further below inclined
From an example of algorithm, referred herein as " leave home automatic/get home automatic " algorithm.
Figure 15 A to Figure 15 D illustrate the example for corresponding to " leave home automatic/get home automatic " algorithm according to preferred embodiment
Property operation normal set point temperatures schedule to the time plot of actual motion setpoint profile.In order in the clear and definite disclosure
The purpose of appearance, Figure 15 A are shown for user (possible the retired or the father or mother carried small children that be in) in particular job day
The relatively simple exemplary thermostat schedule 1502 on (such as Tuesday).Schedule 1502 only includes the morning 7:00 point and evening
Upper 9:Wake-up/interval of being in (its desired temperature is 76 degree) and evening 9 between 00:00 with the morning 7:Between sleep between 00 point
Every (its desired temperature is 66 degree).For this description, schedule 1502 can be referred to as " normal " set point schedule.Normal set point
Schedule 1502 may by present disclosure it is described above, one or more commonly assigned be incorporated to application case above
Described in any one or some other methods of a variety of methods create.For example, normal set point schedule 1502 may be
(such as using socket) is programmed, by wherein by set point schedule " snap-in " to multiple predetermined schedulings by end user
One (for example, the retired, the work man and wife without child, the unmarried city dweller etc.) of table, by based on from " horizontal line "
The automation study of user's set point modification of beginning schedule is clearly created by any of a variety of other methods.
According to preferred " leaving home automatic " algorithm, closing space seizure condition is continuous and automatic using many sensing technologies of VSCU
Sensing, the state demarcation being currently sensed be " occupancy " (or " being in " or " sensing activity ") or vacant (or " leaving home " or
" inactive ").If the seizure condition being currently sensed is " inactive " to reach predetermined minimum interval (state of referred herein as leaving home
Confidence window (ASCW)), then " leaving home automatic " operational mode triggering, wherein actual motion set point 1504 is changed for predetermined energy-conservation
Leave home state temperature (AST), but regardless of the set point temperatures specified by normal thermostat schedule 1502." leaving home automatic " operation
The purpose of pattern is unnecessary in the presence of being avoided when being set with the actual comfort level experienced or enjoy schedule 1502 without occupant
Heat or freeze, so as to save.For example, AST can be set as 62 degree for winter (or requiring the external temperature heated)
Acquiescence predetermined value and be set as 84 degree for the summer external temperature of refrigeration (or may require).Optionally, heat and
The AST temperature of refrigeration can be set by the user.
State of leaving home confidence window (ASCW) corresponds to the unappropriated time interval sensed, hereafter can reasonably count
The degree of accuracy carries out rational reliability service hypothesis so that within the enclosed space really without occupant.It is empty for most typical case's closings
Between, it has been found that the predetermined period in the range of 90 minutes to 180 minutes be for ASCW the appropriate cycle it is common to adapt to
Scene, peace and quiet are read, go out and win the confidence, take a nap, wherein the noninductive movement measured or the related occupied sensor sense of instruction
Survey.
In Figure 15 A to Figure 15 D example, under the background for heating situation with ASCW and 62 of 120 minutes degree of AST
There is provided exemplary description, it should be understood that for refrigeration and can be by art technology for the corresponding instance of other ASCW/AST values selections
Personnel understand and in the range of embodiment according to this description.It is bent for the set point for showing scheduling in Figure 15 B
Line 1502 and actual motion setpoint profile 1504, together with the activity time line (As) sensed, it shows to correspond to and sensed
Movable small Black oval mark, be the morning 11 at present:00 point.It is apparent that the cut-off morning 11:, there is sensing at 00 point
The a large number of users activity arrived is until the morning 10:, it is followed by inactive one hour interval 1506 at 00 point.Figure 15 C are shown under cut-off
Noon 4:00 point of scheduling and actual set point curve.As shown in figure 15 c, in the afternoon 12 after inactive at 120 minutes:00 point of triggering
" leaving home automatic " pattern, actual motion set point 1504 deviates the AST temperature that normal scheduling set point 1502 to 62 is spent.Under cut-off
Noon 4:, activity is not yet sensed after " leaving home automatic " pattern triggering at 00 point, and pattern of therefore " leaving home automatic " remains valid.
" leave home automatic " pattern can be based on the event, the time passage that sense and/or consistent with its basic object other
Triggering and terminates, basic object be within the enclosed space (reasonable high statistical probability degree) without occupant when save.Lift one
Set point temperatures are remained energy-conservation AST temperature until one in following event by individual embodiment, " leaving home automatic " mode operation
It is individual to occur：(i) the manual correction input from user is received；(ii) operational mode of " going home automatic " is based on the occupancy sensed
Activity and trigger；(iii) normal occupant has arrived and not yet reached for the determination of " spending a holiday " pattern the length of one's sleep；Or (iv)
" getting up " or " being in " interval of following day has been arrived and not yet reached for the determination of " spending a holiday " pattern.
So, Figure 15 D show to end the morning 12:00 point of scheduling and actual set point curve.As shown in figure 15d, big
About 5 dwelling activities in afternoon start to be sensed up to short time interval 1508, and it triggers " going home automatic " pattern, now actual
Operation set point 1504 returns to normal set point schedule 1502.
Preferably, provide the user according to the ability for expecting to save enthusiasm change ASCW (for example, being asked in initial setting up
Answer, by socket etc.).For example, the ASCW of 45 minutes can be provided for the user for the power conservation option for selecting " height enthusiasm ",
As a result determine only to make after inactive (or " leaving home " or " vacant " condition sensing) at 45 minutes for " the leaving home automatic " of system.
It can be used for improving for point window of ASCW time cycles and the distinct methods of the movable filtering sensed and " leave home certainly
It is dynamic " reliability of pattern triggering.It is related to other reasons (for example, pet) whether the activity that " understanding " is sensed exists to the mankind
Different learning methods can be additionally used in the reliability for improving the triggering of " leave home automatic " pattern.An embodiment is lifted, is sensed
Activity " background " rank (that is, be attributable to and non-human take result the event sensed activity) " can leave home
Automatically it is based on manually setting an input without correction and alternatively learning and/or confirm during pattern cycle ".If for example, " from
Family is automatic " in a period of time after pattern triggering without correction manually set a change, and this correction input is not present several
Individual different occasions are voluntarily repeated, then can conclude that the movable type that senses related to these intervals and/or degree can be true
Think there is unrelated " background " rank with the mankind, reason be if the mankind are implicitly present in, may be in one or more this fields
There is some type of corrective action in conjunction.
To take estimation similar mode similar to " leave home automatic ", the triggering of " going home automatic " operational mode also, it is preferred that
Pseudo- event is caused based on point window time window and/or the movable filtering sensed or there are unrelated other events with the actual mankind
" going home automatic " pattern will not unnecessarily be triggered.As an example, sensing process is sensed during being related to according to described point of window
To movable existence or non-existence and individually estimate 5 minutes point windows (or point window of other appropriate duration).If it find that
The activity of threshold quantity is sensed in two neighbouring times point window, then " going home automatic " pattern triggering is (for example, be shown in figure
15D time interval 1508).In triggering, " going home automatic " pattern is by making set point return to normal set point schedule
1502 and run.
The repetition being based on " leaving home automatic " pattern and/or " getting home automatic " mode operation is provided according to an embodiment
The related occupancy type of example and/or correction are manually entered the algorithm of the set point schedule modification of type.With " leave home it is automatic/
Get home automatic " the related occupancy of pattern and/or correction be manually entered behavior by multiple time cycle property degree continuous monitorings and mistake
Filter to detect the type of user occupancy, it can then weigh with " finishing " or " adjust " set point temperatures schedule in addition with more preferable
Ground matching is actual to take type.By by multiple time cycle property grade filterings, it is meant that (i) presses the continuous calendar day, and (ii) is pressed
Working day, (iii) pressed all doomsdays on all doomsdays on weekdays, (iv) by one day monthly one day monthly and/or based on
Any other packet on the date of logic association seeks correlation type simultaneously in terms of user behavior.If thus, for example, being one
Arranging continuous Friday observes the specific occupancy related to " leave home automatic/get home automatic " and/or corrects and be manually entered behavior,
The set point temperatures schedule on so Friday is adjusted preferably matching indicated occupancy type.If on Saturday and
Sunday and then next Saturday and Sunday and then next again Saturday and Sunday all observe and " left home certainly
Move/get home automatic " related specific occupancy and/or correction be manually entered behavior, then the set point temperature on Saturday and Sunday
Degree schedule is adjusted the indicated occupancy type arrived with preferably matching detection.Another example is lifted, if continuous some months
The 2nd day in every month observed the specific occupancy related to " leave home automatic/get home automatic " and/or correction by the 7th day manually
Input behavior, then the set point temperatures of the 2nd day to the 7th day of the subsequent moon are adjusted etc..
Figure 16 A to Figure 16 D diagrams according to embodiment based on " get home automatic " pattern and/or " getting home automatic " pattern
Related the occupancys type of repetition example and/or correction be manually entered the example that the set point timetable of type is changed.Pin
To this example, observed with the time and indicate its user being in all day on weekdays for normal set point temperatures, " left home certainly
Move " pattern triggering (Figure 16 A to figure in the case of without any correction manual user input at Wednesday close to the high noon of several weeks
Pattern of 16C) and then " getting home automatic " is in these days close to afternoon 5:Triggered at 00.This may correspond to (such as) and determines in star
Phase three works as the retired of volunteer to local library.Once this type is reliably created (for example, in continuous three stars
After phase three occurs), then as seen in fig. 16d, normal set point temperatures schedule automatic " regulation " or " finishing " causes under
One Wednesday and thereafter all Wednesday, exist between the morning 10:00 point and afternoon 5:Interval scheduling between 00 point
" leaving home " cycle, because prospective users are left home in this time interval really now.
If importantly, (it can for the generation correcting user input in one day in the date shown in Figure 16 A to Figure 16 C
Referred to as " punitive " user input), then set point schedule will not automatically " regulation " arrive Figure 16 D shown in situation.It is this
Correction or " punitive " input the automatic mode that can be left home for (i) and triggered, and (ii) is not present enough occupancy sensed and lived
It is dynamic (after for " background " event filtering) to trigger " going home automatic " pattern and (iii) user becomes uncomfortable and walked close to
Thermostat occurs to heighten the situation of temperature.For example, it may be the case that user read rather than on Wednesday upstairs
Noon 10:00 Dian Qu libraries, only Stall VSCU units do not sense it and exist and in the afternoon 12:00 point of triggering is left home certainly
Dynamic, user is then in about afternoon 12:45 become uncomfortable and are then down to heighten temperature manually.Due to " the punishment of user
Property " input proves that algorithm is " mistaking target " for this potential type, so set point schedule is not automatic " regulation "
To the situation shown in Figure 16 D, and in one embodiment, at least partly weighting to need this potential type in a negative direction
Correlation that will be higher is with this type of future establishment.Advantageously for more generally situation, " punitive " of user is inputted
It can be additionally used in adjustment application to the type and/or degree of the filtering for taking sensing algorithm, because being clearly present for " punitive "
The wrong conclusion of " inactive " that the time interval before correction input is sensed.
Although " leave home automatic/get home automatic " algorithm of the embodiment above is triggered by the occupied information being currently sensed,
But in another embodiment, it is bent based on the experience acquistion probability time set up by VSCU units in extension time limit
Line provides the automation of " leave home automatic/get home automatic " algorithm from triggering.For an embodiment, experience acquistion probability time
Curve is represented by representing one or more people and the scalar value of probability of closing space is taken in each particular point in time (experience is accounted for
With probability or EOP) time plot.Or reflection can be used to take statistics and/or a variety of other expression formula (examples of probability
Such as, probability-distribution function) or represent any of stochastic variable and non-usage is measured for EOP single scalar.
For an embodiment, VSCU units be configured to meet following standard it is intraday one or more when
Between from triggering to " leave home automatic " pattern：(i) normal set point schedule indicates " being in " time interval of scheduling, (ii) experience
Acquistion probability (EOP) is less than predetermined threshold (for example, less than 20%), and (iii) take sensor is not sensed and can clearly referred to
Show a large amount of activities of inhabitation people really within the enclosed space；(iv) take sensor not yet senses sufficiently low activity grade
Up to sufficiently long interval (that is, state of leaving home confidence window or ASCW) so as to enter " automatic mold of leaving home in above-mentioned " tradition " mode
Formula ".Once these conditions are satisfied and " leave home automatic " pattern is from triggering, then the reversion of " leaving home automatic " pattern can be with
" tradition " automatic mode identical mode (for example, inputted by " get home automatic " triggering, manual correction user etc.) of leaving home is carried out.
Regulation set point temperatures schedule is automated (namely based on the repetition example with " leaving home automatic " pattern based on " course of study "
Related occupancy type and/or correction income type manually) automatic mode and from tactile of leaving home that is triggered from " tradition " can be based on
Send out the combination observation for automatic mode algorithm of leaving home.
Have found above-mentioned " leave home automatic " pattern that is at least partially based on experience acquistion probability (EOP) from triggering with only
Only consider that " tradition " of current, instant occupied information leaves home to provide set point when the regulation of automatic triggering method is compared based on wherein
Temperature schedule it is more complete and statistically more accurate " regulation ".One reason is related to a large amount of activity sensing data samples and is used for
EOP meterings are produced, the related and useful inhabitation " test " assigned based on its execution " leave home automatically " process is become
Foundation.In terms of an angle, " leave home automatic " process can be taken as " stab into " automatically or " lunging " the user ecosystem to understand
About its take type more details without to its inquire detailed problems, need not rely on its response correctness and also without
A kind of mode for the instant accuracy for taking sensing hardware need to uniquely be relied on.
Figure 17 A to Figure 17 D illustrate the dynamic user interface for being used to encourage to reduce using energy source according to preferred embodiment.
Figure 17 A to Figure 17 D method is preferably incorporated into figure 3 above A to Fig. 3 K Time-temperature user interface method.Such as people in the art
Member it is readily apparent, although disclosed in Figure 17 A to Figure 17 D in the case where heating background, but to correspondence refrigeration background application can be by ability
Field technique personnel understand and belonged in the range of this teaching according to present disclosure.It is current that set point is heated in such as Figure 17 A
Be set as it is known belong to it is known be conducive to or suitable for the value in the range of the first of energy-conservation in the case of, show it is pleasant actively
Reinforcing mark, such as greenery 1742.When (see Figure 17 B) is heated when user heightens, as long as set point is still in the range of described first,
Greenery continue to show.But, when user continues to heighten set point to value (see Figure 17 C) for being more than the first scope, limitation is indicated
The passive reinforcing mark of warning, terrified, concern or some other negative moods, this mark is for example) the red sudden strain of a muscle of blade
Bright version 1742' or chimney figure or similar mark.Believe that many users can respond by the way that set point is turned down again passive strong
Change mark 1742', and as shown in figure 17d, if user makes set point return to the value being located in the range of first, it is obtained " reward "
It is the recovery of greenery 1742.The positive mood mark of many other types or display can be used for substitution greenery 1742 and similarly,
Many different passive reinforcing marks or display can be used for substitution flicker red autumnal leaves 1742', and in the range of still falling within this teaching.

Device control intelligence or " study " thermostat, it provides disposal ability, user interface directly perceived and attractive in appearance, network connectivity and energy-conservation energy
The abundant combination of power (including presently described automatic/automatic algorithms of getting home of leaving home), even if while this Premium Features may
Asking can safely provide than " electric power is stolen " option (for example, extracting less amount of electric power from one or more HVAC call realys)
Bigger instantaneous power draw, without so-called " the C- lines " from HVAC system or the line electricity from Domestic wall socket
Power.For example, top unit microprocessor 2402 can draw the 250mW order of magnitude, LCD module 1960 in wake-up and processing
The 250mW order of magnitude can be drawn in activity.In addition, Wi-Fi module 2410 can draw 250mW in activity, and it need to continue
Activity, such as generally consistent 2% working cycles.But, in order to avoid mistakenly making many commercial HVAC systems
HVAC relays trip, and electric power steals the power delivering capability that circuit is normally limited to 100mW to the 200mW order of magnitude, and it may
It is not enough to supply the required power of many common situations.
Thermostat 1800 at least relies on using rechargeable battery 1944 (or electric power storage medium on the plate of equivalent capability)
Solve these problems, the rechargeable battery 1944 is less than when electric power steals the amount that can safely provide in hardware power usage
Between interim charge and will be put during hardware power usage steals the time interval for the amount that can be safely provided more than electric power

Show that the mathematical studyings different with performing are calculated, and (ii) is with respect to small-power and smaller power intensive second processor (such as moral
The MSP430 microcontrollers of state instrument), it is used to perform less intensive task, including driving and control take sensor.For
Valuable electric power is saved, first processor maintains " sleep " state up to the time cycle of extension and only in the feelings of its ability of needs
By " wake-up " under condition, and second processor generally persistently keeps it turned on and (reached it is preferred that closing or disabling specific internal clock
Brief period interval is to save electric power) to perform its relative low-power task.First processor and second processor are mutually arranged
So that second processor can when particular event occurs " wake-up " first processor, it can be referred to as " wake-up " facility.These are called out
Awake facility can be opened and closed as by a part for the difference in functionality of realization and/or energy conservation object.For example, it is possible to provide " call out
Wake up PROX " facilities, by its second processor will by active proximity transducer (such as by the core section with I2C interfaces
The PROX that the SI1142 of science and technology is provided close to/ambient light sensor) when detecting the hand of user close to thermostat driver plate " wake-up "
First processor causes it to provide visual display to close user and be ready to quickly ring when its hand touches driver plate
Should.Be used as another example, it is possible to provide " wake up PIR " facilities, second processor will by it is described " wake up PIR " facilities by
Passive infrared motion sensor (is such as provided by the double base thermal detectors of DigiPyro PYD 1998 of PerkinElmer
First processor is waken up when PIR) detecting the motion in somewhere near thermostat.It is apparent that waking up PIR and automatic difference of getting home
Justice, gets home automatically because the PIR activities sensed of N number of successive memory paragraph may be needed to enable, and only single sufficient fortune
Dynamic event can just trigger wake-up PIR and wake up.
The dynamic conceptual example of sleep-awake timing of Figure 26 A to Figure 26 C diagrams gradually under big time scale, it can be
Realized between top unit (HU) microprocessor and backboard (BP) microcontroller, it advantageously provides performance, response, intelligence and electricity
It is well balanced between power consumption.Each higher curve values represent " wake-up " state (or equivalent higher-power state) and each
Relatively low curve values represent " sleep " state (or equivalent lower power state).As indicated, backplane controller is more often movable
With poll sensors and the similar relative low-power task of progress, and top unit microprocessor more often keeps sleep, for " weight
Will " situation (such as user interfaces with, network service and learning algorithm calculate etc.) wakes up.For optimizing sleep to waking up situation
A variety of Different Strategies can be realized and belonged in the range of this teaching by disclosed framework.For example, commonly assigned U.S. above
State's patent the 13/275,307th is open a kind of for saving top unit microprocessor " wake-up " time while still via constant temperature
The Wi-Fi facilities of device keep communicating with the effective and timely of the thermostat management server based on cloud.

When driver plate rotates, user's focuses in expansion and diminution icon 3054, and it also has when being extended in addition to attractive in appearance
It is more easy to the temperature value read.When its offer is inwardly clicked on, user, which focuses on it, can change or remove existing set point,
Rather than just by " punishment " of obscure any kind for attempting to create new scheduling set point forbidden.Finally, if user
Really the effective time of the original set point icon 3054 of selection change (using " picking up movement " method directly perceived, sees above the U.S. special
Profit the 13/269th, 501), then it is allowed to " movement " to the left or to the right original set point to new time point, but when " shifting
It is dynamic " icon close to any other original set point when, once it is with other original set points at a distance of one hour, that is, stops being moved to
Closer to even if user does not stop revolving dial.This provides the user with obscure, non-punitive and affine hint, and it has reached " shifting
It is dynamic " limit of the allowed time displacement of original set point icon.
Figure 31 A to Figure 31 D diagrams are shown for an embodiment to the time of user to temperature.It is preferred that time to temperature
The other side of degree display is described in U.S. Patent No. 12/984,602 commonly assigned above.Preferably, such as Figure 31 B institutes
Show, the time to temperature (hereinafter referred to as " T2T ") display 3131 immediately based on followed the trail of from such as this specific thermostat this
The quick estimation of the history performance data of individual specific HVAC system and this specific house and be supplied to user.As shown in Figure 31 C,
(such as check thermostat and user close to existing by the active of thermostat when user walks close to thermostat when being activated display
When short distance proximity transducer or " PROX " are detected), T2T shows that 3131 show estimation according to the more new estimation of remaining time
Remaining the number of minutes.It is apparent that having found due to the big standard deviation of T2T estimations in many cases, if T2T estimations are small
In described value, then preferably only display " less than 10 minutes " (or other appropriate small threshold values), in case user is disappointed or thinks if carried
The accurate countdown result supplied is inaccurate, there is problem.
Figure 32 diagrams heat the example that preferred thermostat is read when facility is enabled, such as AUX (heat pumps when second stage
The hot bar of auxiliary) or W2 (traditional second stage is heated).According to a preferred embodiment, if when temperature is heightened first
(that is, when user has heightened driver plate or heightened operation design temperature using remote-control facilities) initial time is to Temperature estimate
(" T2T ") is more than 20 minutes (or some other threshold values of the time of length uncomfortablely are made us in instruction), then second stage, which is heated, to be set
Apply and enabled automatically by thermostat.An embodiment is lifted, T2T, which is shown, can simply change into HEATX2 to indicate that second stage is heated
Facility is activated.Optionally, T2T estimations can be provided in addition to HEATX2 is shown, wherein T2T, which is calculated, especially to be corrected to consider
Second stage heats facility.Second stage heats facility and generally will keep starting until reaching target temperature in whole heat in the cycle
Degree, but the scope not limited to this of this teaching.
Figure 33 A to Figure 33 C diagram according to preferred embodiment during single phase heats the cycle use time to temperature
(T2T) information startup second stage heats facility.For any many reasons from windowing to firm sunset, it may occur however that HVAC systems
System " lagging behind " previously used first heats situation expected from the stage.For a preferred embodiment, such a case by
Thermostat is based on the time to temperature (T2T) detection, and now second stage heats facility and enabled automatically.For the side of being preferable to carry out
Case, if thermostat determines that it falls behind initial T2T and is estimated to exceed 10 minutes (or other appropriate threshold values) (if i.e., current T2T estimates
The total time of current estimation end time of the meter reflection since circulation until circulation will be bigger than initial T2T estimations more than 10 points
Clock), then second stage, which will heat facility, to be started.According to equation explanation, wherein " t " is the time since circulation and " T2T
(t) " time when being time " t " is to Temperature estimate, then if { [t+T2T (t)]-T2T (0) } go above 10 minutes (or
Other appropriate threshold values), then second stage heats facility and is activated.The embodiment for such as using Figure 32, T2T is shown then can letter
Singly change into HEATX2 or T2T estimations can also be optionally provided, wherein T2T is calculated and especially is corrected to consider second stage
Heat facility.Preferably, if circulated on system backwardness time point of the initial estimation more than 10 minutes is determined first almost complete
Into (for example, T2T is only 5 minutes or shorter), then second stage heats facility and will not be activated.For the side of being preferable to carry out
Case, due to needing frequently to keep the top unit processor of thermostat 1800 to sleep as far as possible, and need to be vigilant HVAC system simultaneously
Whether fall behind too many, therefore there is 15 minutes wake-up timers of automation, its whenever it is active heat circulation and come into force when, at top
Cell processor is set when entering sleep by top unit processor.In this way, if top unit processor is for some
Other purposes and heat circulation during be not waken up, then its by every 15 minutes wake up and perform determination HVAC system whether
Backward calculating.Second stage heats facility and generally remains startup until reaching target temperature, but the scope of this teaching is not limited
In this.
Figure 33 A to Figure 33 C show particular instance, wherein initial T2T is estimated as 18 minutes (Figure 33 A), but system starts
Fall behind and now fall behind 15 minutes (Figure 33 B), only exist the appropriateness progress towards target temperature.Such as Figure 33 B, from 15 minutes in the past
Start, system " backwardness " was up to 8 minutes and still had 11 minutes remaining (that is, T2T (5)=11), so overall estimate circulates the deadline
(since circulation) is now 26 minutes, and it estimated many 8 minutes than initial 18 minutes.Finally, in Figure 33 C, backwardness reaches system
More than 10 minutes, so second stage is heated, facility was activated and T2T estimations are replaced by HEATX2.
Figure 34 is illustrated according to preferred embodiment by thermostat 100 (or 1800) for the " alternative of heat pump polarity
The user interface screen shown to user is tested in automation ".In O/B ports as described in by other parts in this specification
The automatic detection of line and automatically detect, if user has heat pump, then selective automatic test generally will
At the end of setting question and answer after first install or front and rear generation is to determine that heat pump is conventional according to so-called " O " conventional or so-called " B "
Operation.Heat calling for " O " conventional heat pump, refrigeration calling (Y1) signal type be energized and heat pump (O/B) signal type not
It is energized, and calling is heated for opposite " B " conventional heat pump, Y1 signal types is energized and heat pump (O/B) signal type
It is energized.As described in U.S. Patent No. 13/038,191 commonly assigned above, thermostat 100 is able to carry out full automation
Test, wherein it starts according to " O " conventional (commonly known its is more commonly used for residential HVAC systems) first heats (or refrigeration)
And then by rise temperature (or decline temperature) automatically sensing heat pump whether according to described in " O " conventional operation.If it is not, that
Attempt more uncommon " B " it is conventional and similarly checking see heat pump whether according to " B " conventional operation.
According to some embodiments for further enhancing Consumer's Experience in initial setting up, other automations and optional
Select automation be programmed to it is as follows in thermostat 100.For an embodiment, which kind of AD HOC user without being required at
(heating to refrigeration) is by the puzzlement for carrying out selection between O/B orientation tests, but this decision-making is based on one by thermostat
Or standard that is multiple external and/or sensing is made automatically by thermostat.In an example, based on having received and/or downloaded
Postcode and current date, thermostat can to using heat or freeze as the first O/B orientation test carry out according to reason guess.
In another example, current external weather (for example, as based on postcode from high in the clouds receive) combine current room temperature use with
It is determined.In another particularly useful example is had been observed that, only current room temperature is used for based on predetermined threshold (such as
70 degree of Fahrenheit) make decisions, if wherein Current Temperatures are less than 70 degree of Fahrenheit, then used first during O/B orientation tests
Heating mode, and if Current Temperatures are higher than 70 degree of Fahrenheit, then first by refrigeration mode during O/B orientation tests.
It is apparent that full automation O/B orientation tests may need some times to complete, because it may need
Time reliably determines the actual temperature trend in room.According to a preferred embodiment, in automation O/B orientation tests
During beginning, user is demonstrated Figure 34 screen, and wherein it is apprised of automation heat pump test and carried out, but is also imparted with hand
Dynamic interference only includes informing which function of thermostat is just performed by HVAC system with the option of accelerated test, wherein manual intervention,
That is, heat whether to open or freeze and whether open.Advantageously, user can select interference with answering a question by perceiving air stream
Sensing is automated or it can simply leave and not interfere, under either case to be determined (although at somewhat longer interval
It is interior).This " selectivity automation " O/B orientations test advantageously strengthens Consumer's Experience during initial setting up.
In an optional embodiment, because it have been observed that most users can actually interfere correct to provide anyway
Answer and shortening are tested and because most systems are actually " O " conventional, so when user's actual selection is not interfered,
In the case of there is uncertain result (because (such as) windowing or thermostat internal electron are heated) in automatic test, thermostat
100 can be programmed to acquiescence " O " routine.Because in most cases " O " answers really correct, and therefore it is actual not
The quantity correctly determined it is very small and even there is usually no can cause damage bad determinations but be easy in the relatively short order of magnitude
Under the determination that is perceived by the user and this very small amount of user calling customer can support to solve problem when finding.Other
In embodiment, uncertain result can produce alarm flag or other instruction user manual interventions test or calling customer support its
It is alerted.In other alternate embodiments, " O " configuration simple hypothesis is that user after 10 minutes ask by not yet response diagram 34
News, but regardless of thermal tracking situation how sensed, if device electronics when initial installation and startup heats problem expection
Cause mistake conclusion in the time of big percentage, advantage estimation especially configured at " O " in some cases more than 95% it
Afterwards, then the embodiment is probably appropriate.
A kind of selectivity that is used for, which is provided, according to a preferred embodiment shows that present application is roused in emotion described above
" blade " is encouraged to encourage user in the good energy-conservation behavior of its practice.It has been found that this algorithm provides good result, because it can
Be intuitively, based on user indivedual temperature setting behavior and schedule and rewarded and roused for different types of user
Encourage and not constant, absolute, general algorithm.When user is via telecommunication network thermostat access facility and when user just makes
When being inputted with scheduling facility (walk close to or remotely access) adjustment set point, these rules can be applied to (but not limited to) and walk close to manually
Driver plate set point change.When example is given for heating, it will be assumed that same rule is applied to refrigeration, in opposite direction and numeral
Except threshold value is different.One group of useful rule is as follows.The predetermined constant selected with caution for lay down a regulation one group is described first.
Make to heat that to take default setting be that H_od=68F (represents that substantially good " occupancy " is heated and is set as described value or less than described
Value).It is that C_od=76F (represents that substantially good refrigeration " occupancy " is set as described value or is higher than refrigeration is taken default setting
Described value).Make to heat leave home to be defaulted as H_ad=H_od-6F=62F (represent it is substantially good heat " leaving home " be set as it is described
It is worth or less than described value).Refrigeration is left home to be defaulted as C_ad=C_od+6F=82F and (represent that substantially good refrigeration " leaving home " is set
It is set to described value or higher than described value).Make to heat occupancy waste and be defaulted as H_ow=H_od+6F=74F and (represent substantially bad system
Hot " occupancy " is set higher than described value).Finally, refrigeration occupancy waste is defaulted as C_ow=C_od-6F=70F and (represent big
Bad refrigeration " occupancy " is caused to be set at less than described value).
When thermostat is newly unpacked (" OOB ") and is just mounted good, there is the acquiescence single set point H_ for heating
The od=68F and C_od=76F for refrigeration.Run for first 7 days or some other acquiescence initial " OOB " cycles, if
Setting is remained H_od or less than H_od (heating) or C_od or higher than C_od (refrigeration) by user, and blade is first to encourage by showing
Step is familiar with passed on concept and sensation.Therefore, if user will heat set point at first 7 days is maintained at 68F or less than 68F,
So blade will be shown.Preferably, it is that higher than 68F (for heat), blade will be when user gradually changes set point temperatures
Gradually faded out under first Fahrenheit temperature so that it disappears when reaching 69F.Preferably, for all threshold value exhibitions as described herein
Show it is similar fade out/fade in behavior.
, can be using one group of steady blade display rule after 7 day cycle.Whenever when user's change current set point
For 2 degree of the few Fahrenheit of temperature set-point " energy " than current scheduling temperature when (that is, in the case of heating 2 degree of low Fahrenheit or
It is high 2 degree in the case of refrigeration), then blade will be shown.Similarly, if user is created than showing in schedule using scheduling facility
Have, the set point of previous effective low 2 degree of set point, then blade will display.Preferably, superposition certain limit is regular to these
On.First whenever when temperature set-point is for heating less than H_ad=62F or being higher than C_ad=82F for refrigeration or move to
During these scopes, blade will be shown all the time.Secondly, whenever when temperature setting is for heating higher than H_ow=74F or being directed to
When refrigeration is less than C_ow=70F, blade will not be shown.Second " limitation " rule can be omitted in some embodiments.
There is provided according to a preferred embodiment from qualification algorithm, it can or can not be reliable by its determination for thermostat 1800
Into auto state of leaving home to save, i.e., whether it has " sensor confidence " for its PIR activities.It is preferable to carry out for one
Scheme, automatic facility of leaving home, which is disabled, reaches predetermined period, such as starts (that is, replacement of installing or dispatch from the factory for the first time) 7 days afterwards in device.
The 5th day, the 6th day and the 7th day (or other predetermined appropriate cycles sample time by rule of thumb) after startup, PIR activities by from
The tracking of continuous (time memory paragraph) activity is dissipated, such as 5 minutes memory paragraphs, wherein memory paragraph are empty (if at the interval
In do not sense occupancy event) or full (if one or more occupancy events are sensed in the interval).When described
Between the time limit memory paragraph total (for 5 minutes memory paragraph 24x12x3=864) in, if greater than the predetermined threshold of full memory paragraph
Percentage, then " sensor confidence " is set up and if less than full memory paragraph percentage, then do not set up sensor confidence.Can pin
Predetermined threshold is empirically determined to specific model, version or the thermostat of setting.In an example, it has been found that 3.5% is suitable
Work as threshold value, i.e. if there are 30 or more full memory paragraphs for three days samples, then " sensor confidence " is set up, but this will
Change for different device model and setting.
There is provided automatic for the additional occupied information that is provided by its pir sensor according to another preferred embodiment
Change the method for the optimal threshold for the active proximity detector (PROX) for calculating thermostat 1800.In order to save electric power and extension
Life-span of LCD display and rechargeable battery and in order to prevent thermostat from serving as the aesthetic advantages of unwanted night-light,
PROX detectors be integrated into thermostat 1800 and by backboard microcontroller (hereinafter referred to as " BP μ C ") continue poll and
Control with detect user close to degree, LCD display starts and in other cases only in the case where detecting nearest user
Remain dark.Operably, PROX is such as every 1/60th seconds by BP μ C periodic pollings, and the DC read including PROX is moved
Except the PROX signals of version (to exclude the influence of ambient lighting change) are generated by BP μ C and (are referred herein as with threshold value
" PROX threshold values ") compare.If PROX signals are more than PROX threshold values, then BP μ C wake up top unit microprocessor (hereinafter
Referred to as " HU μ P "), it then starts LCD display.PROX threshold values need to be selected with caution so that (i) PROX facilities are not to noise and the back of the body
Scape hyperactivity hyperkinesia is sensitive, and it can cause crossing for PROX to trigger and unnecessarily wake up power-intensive HU μ P and LCD display, and
(ii) the excessively not insensitive user experience qualities for walk close in thermostat use of PROX are impaired (because user needs to carry out not
Naturally motion, for example, the hand for such as waving them carrys out wakeup unit).
According to a preferred embodiment, PROX threshold values periodically (or or with other HU μ P activities consistent aperiodically) by
HU μ P are recalculated based on newest PROX signal-obtainings history, and PROX signal histories are alternatively handled including PIR data
Historical time intervals foundation.Have found for the noise in PROX signals because of " nature " ambient noise in room
The sample phase of (such as lights) rather than when PROX signals be mingled with occur in room occupant activity (in general it can cause
The PROX threshold values of determination are higher than optimal or other less than optimal) when, calculate optimal PROX threshold values.Therefore, according to the side of being preferable to carry out
Case, HU μ P keep the newest history of PIR activities (it is collected for automatic facility of leaving home anyway) and PROX signal-obtainings
Record and PROX threshold values are then periodically calculated from newest history PROX data, times for occupant's activity that wherein PIR is sensed
What is rejected in the cycle before PROX threshold calculations from PROX data samples.In this way, determine more reliable and appropriate sensitive but not
The PROX threshold values of tetchiness.For an embodiment, BP μ C preserve a sample of PROX signal datas for every 5 minutes, and
And every time when HU μ P are waken up by the data transfer to HU μ P.For an embodiment, HU μ P are preserved at least 24 hours
From BP μ C receive PROX signal datas and based on the PROX data of newest 24 hours (together with corresponding 24 hours PIR feel
Survey and take data, all activities for leaving home automatic " memory paragraph " as described above) periodically recalculate PROX threshold values by 24 hours intervals.It is right
In another embodiment, PROX threshold values are recalculated when each HU μ P will enter sleep state by HU μ P.Recalculate
PROX threshold values be transferred to BP μ C, it then determines whether PROX events occur using the new PROX threshold values.Other excellent
Select in embodiment, thermostat is also configured to using can generate event more preferably PROX with ALS (ambient light sensor) data
Threshold value, because it is known that ambient light can increase background PROX signal noises and the DC values of PROX readings.

Start situation.Some common startup situations now are described according to some embodiments：
Situation 1：Unpack and experience (battery has electricity)：(1) user is by backboard correct wiring.MCU LDO have been turned on MCU；(2)
User's connection top unit (the battery PCM of protected mode)；(3) the acquiescence 20mA limit values in charger reset PCM protected modes,
VBAT recovers to about 3.7v；(4) PMU is opened；(5) MCU measures VBAT, and release top unit is reseted；(6) set up logical with MCU
Letter.
Situation 2：Unpack and experience (battery is without electricity)：(1) user is by backboard correct wiring.MCU LDO have been turned on MCU；(2)
User's connection top unit (the battery PCM of protected mode)；(3) the acquiescence 20mA limit values in charger reset PCM protected modes,
VBAT<3Av；(4) PMU is sampled to cell voltage but its EEPROM for being less than 3Av stores VMBCH_SEL values, therefore obstructed
Electricity；(5) MCU measures VBAT, sees low-voltage.MCU forces 100mA to charge and open instruction LED；(6) when VBAT transmits 3Av
During VMBCH_SEL voltages, top unit will be powered；(7) set up and communicate with MCU；(8) top unit allows MCU to close LED.
Situation 3：Top unit is collapsed：(1) top unit is in corpse state, is not talked with MCU, cell voltage ok；(2)
MCU not to be noted effective orders within the pause time limit；(3) MCU closes HV voltage-releasing voltage stabilizers to cut off electric power, then requires top
Unit is reseted；(4) MCU is again turned on HV voltage-releasing voltage stabilizers, and release is reseted；(5) set up and communicate with MCU.
Situation 4：Backboard collapses：(1) backboard unit is in corpse state, does not reply SoC；(2) SoC resets MCU；(3)
Set up and communicate with MCU.
Situation 5：Top unit VI is locked：(1) top unit Ul lock, but even lower level do not run (MCU communication still entering
OK, thus MCU is not reset by UI)；(2) user notices no screen activity, presses and hold button was up to 10 seconds, causes SoC weights
It is new to start；(3) set up and communicate with MCU.
Power consumption.The average power consumption of system is determined by some variables：(1) it is in the power of standby mode；(2) it is in movable mold
The power of formula；(3) it is in the power of interactive mode.
Standby mode.This pattern is that system incites somebody to action " most of the time " resident pattern.The definition of " most of the time " can
Can be different, but it should be able to be resident 95% reached in such state more than life of product.In this mode, MCU is run
But top unit is in standby mode.HVAC circuits can for activity and top unit can be waken up entrance by multiple events
Activity pattern：(1) proximity transducer or rotational event：SoC is connected directly to from the interrupt line close to side and therefore can be straight
Connecing causes to wake up.(2)Wi-Fi：Top unit can be waken up when packet is reached via Wi-Fi by being connected to SoC WL IRQ lines
(it is assumed that chipset can be programmed to SoC only at which when holding state on interruption non-broadcasting packet)；(3)ZigBee：
Data from ZigBee chips can wake up SoC (for example：Input ZigBee packets)；(4) timer：System can be counted from RTC
When device wake up.This can be used for recurrent event, such as via Wi-Fi to promoting the maintenance connected and Data Collection；(5) backboard
Communication：Input communication from backboard will wake up top unit.This can be sensing data or the warning monitored from HV AC
Notify.
Voluntarily it is periodically into power save state even if MCU is estimated it is waken up with right under 10Hz to reduce power consumption-such as
Pressure sensor is sampled.Because this part system is always switched on, so efficiency herein improves the top unit than seldom using
The more effective fruit of state optimization.The expectation situation of top unit power consumption is in this mode：4mW is used for CPU/DDR, and 2mW is used for
PMU, 4mW are used for Wi-Fi (based on the estimation of other known chipset), and 2mW is used for other project=11mW.In this mode
The expection situation of (no HVAC load switching) backboard power consumption is about 5mW, but the content that will be polled to depending on frequency sensor
And slight variation.
Activity pattern (display closing).In an active mode, top unit is powered, but display is closed.This mould
Formula is expected daily using hundreds of times, but uses very short time limit (being expected to each time less than 10 seconds).System is by transition
Include for the typical cause of activity pattern：(1) User Activity：Activity pattern will the transition during interactive mode is entered；(2) pass
Sensor Data Collection：Backboard can have the environmental data of buffering, and it, which need to be fed to control algolithm and be processed to determine, is
It is no to need response；(3) connection is promoted：In order to maintain TCP connections by most NAT routers, data must periodic transmission.Top
Unit can be used activity pattern and be maintained to perform this connection；(4) site promoter action：Here, user request to servo
The action of device can cause data via promote linkup transmit, cause Wi-Fi module wake up SoC come processing data and perform it is any must
The action wanted.
In the case of this pattern relative high powers property, it should be noted that ensure that any action is completed and returned in system
Before standby mode " occupied ".For example, if order is sent to MCU, it produces response, then response should carry out standby mistake
Preceding collection is crossed, otherwise system last may be beated between activity pattern and standby mode, it is not necessary to which strategic point wastes power.Use net
Network is connected it can also happen that the problem of same type (for example：TCP is closed).The mean power dissipated in this mode is depended on
Wi-Fi activities and processor are loaded into may be in the range of 200mW.
Interactive mode (display opening)：This is the actual pattern with device interactive of user.System it is fully active-screen
In the case that unlatching, backlight open, low delay performance need, power coverage is maximum in any operational mode.But, by
If in user interaction may briefly and infrequently-especially device according to expecting to perform-its influence to average system power is pre-
Meter is very low.It is expected that interactive model unit transit to activity pattern and subsequently enter it is standby before will have relatively long pause
(may up to 60 seconds).Probable value must make unit kept during decline activity pattern up to for a long time-may 30 seconds or longer-
If so that user starts again at and device interactive, then response is instant.Mean power in this pattern will be depended on
Wi-Fi activities, processor load and display backlight brightness are likely larger than 300mW.
Exemplary power consumption calculation.Table 1 shows how total system power consumption can calculate.
Table 1
As seen from Table 1, leading power is standby power, but wakes up top unit 8 times (daily 192 times) per hour
Also it is not very few.Switch each HVAC regions and also consume power, estimate in about 1mA@3.3v (i.e., it is assumed that HV in the case that battery is full
4.5mW power in voltage-releasing voltage stabilizer output).The 1H/1C+ fans of multiple circuits-at least may be switched simultaneously.This can be significantly increased
Power consumption and therefore it is also required to appropriate optimization.
Power supply.Understand that 40mA@5vdc may can be drawn from HV voltage-releasing voltage stabilizers from investigation；Because this is switch transition
Device, so this 200mW power should be converted into 44mA@4.5vdc in systems.Initially, it is believed that may only need to from HV
AC circuits consume 100mW or less, so this is good news.Note that there is the system of (but non-heat pump) of heating and freeze any
In, system can steal power from non-start up circuit, it is ensured that have 200mW power can use at any time.
