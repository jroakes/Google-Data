Abstract
Web pages of a Website may be processed to improve search results. For example, information likely to pertain to more than just the Web page it is directly associated with may be identified. One or more other, related, Web pages that such information is likely to pertain to is also identified. The identified information is associated with the identified other Web page(s) and this association is saved in a way to affect a search result score of the Web page(s).
Description
§ 1.1 technical fields
Embodiment according to the invention relates to information retrieval (IR).Particularly, embodiment according to the invention relates to the information retrieval of the document of improvement such as webpage, and described document belongs to such as one group in many groups document of website.
§ 1.2 background technologies
Search engine is in that to help people to find on WWW (" Web ") and other network aspect the information of interest very useful.Hold at Brisbane ,Australia
SeventhInternational World Wide Web Conference(
The 7th international web-seminar)Paper that last S.Brin and L.Page deliver " Anatomy of a Large-Scale HypertextualSearch Engine (analyzing extensive hypertext search engine) " and U.S. Patent No. 6, in 285,999 (both all incorporate into by reference at this) exemplary search engine has been described.Search engine can receive the inquiry to Search Results.In response, search engine can (for example from the index of webpage) retrieve relevant search results.Such Search Results can comprise the extracts of the tabulation of web page title for example, the text that extracts and the hypertext link of pointing to these webpages from these webpages, and described Search Results can be grouped into the Search Results of predetermined quantity (for example 10).
Fig. 1 is the top level block diagram that can comprise the environment 100 of network (such as the Internet) 160, wherein uses information access tools (facility) (client device) 110 to present from the information of one or more content providers (for example web page server) 180 visits.Research tool (server) 130 can be made by information access tools 110 and be used for searching for interested content.
Each content provider 180 can comprise storage resources (being also referred to as content) 136, visit and provide the resource retrieval operation 184 and the input/output interface operation 182 of content in response to request.These operations of content provider 180 can be by the computer realization such as personal computer or server.Therefore, storage resources 186 can be embodied as the data that are stored in such as on certain type the storage medium of disk, CD or the like.In this concrete environment 100, term " document " can be interpreted as comprising the addressable content such as webpage.
Fig. 2 is the process bubble diagram of Advanced Search instrument 200.Advanced Search instrument 200 is carried out three major functions shown in figure 2: creep (1); (2) index/ordering; And (3) search.Horizontal dotted line is divided into three parts corresponding to these three major functions with Fig. 2.More specifically, first 150 ' is corresponding with the function of creeping, second portion 140 ' with index/ranking function corresponding and third part 134 ' and search (or query processing) function corresponding (note the apostrophe " ' after reference numerals " be used to indicate referenced items only be a example) by the item of this numeric reference that does not have apostrophe.Each part of these parts will be introduced below in more detail.Yet, before doing like this, introduced several distinguishing characteristicss of this Advanced Search instrument 200.This Advanced Search instrument uses link structure and other technology of Web to improve Search Results.
Still, now further describe three major parts of Advanced Search engine 200 referring to Fig. 2.The part 150 ' of creeping can be distributed on a plurality of machines.Single URL server (not shown) is distributed URL(uniform resource locator) (URL) tabulation 206 to a plurality of crawl devices (crawler).Based on this url list 206, creep network 160 ' and obtain webpage 208 of the operation 202 of creeping.Pre-index operation 210 can generate page rank 212 and storehouse 214 from these webpages 208 then.Page rank 212 can comprise as paired a plurality of URL fingerprints (being unique value), page rank value.Storehouse 214 can comprise the page tlv triple of URL, content type and compression.
About index/ordering part 140 ', index/sorting operation 220 can generate inverted order index 226.Index/sorting operation 220 also can generate page rank 228 from quoted passage (citation) rank 212.Page rank 228 can comprise that document id, PageRank value are right.
About query processing part 134 ', search operation 230 can by Web server operation and can with inverted order index 226 and PageRank 228 use dictionary 232 in response to inquiry the generated query result.Query Result can be based on following combination: the information that (1) draws from PageRank 228, and (2) from particular document be included in the information (being also referred to as information retrieval (or " IR ") component) that tightness degree that the word the inquiry is complementary draws.
Such search engine (such as the search engine of firm introduction) is useful always, but also has improved space.For example, consider two kinds of following (2) situations.
At first, consider search inquiry " Ramada Cincinnati (Ramada Cincinnati) ".The present inventor thinks and knows best and the most useful Search Results should be that description Ramada on the Ramada website is at the webpage in the hotel in urban district, Cincinnati.Therefore, hope is returned this webpage (about its information and the link of pointing to it) as first Search Results.Regrettably, though exist the main page of indication Ramada website to have authoritative many evidences, be used for the webpage of Ramada and have authoritative evidence possibility seldom for word " Ramada (Ramada) " in the specific hotel in urban district, Cincinnati for word " Ramada (Ramada) ".Therefore, at least some search engines of handling this search " Ramada Cincinnati (Ramada Cincinnati) " will return the main page of Ramada website as first Search Results, though its may not as on the Ramada website to be used for Ramada useful at the webpage in the hotel in urban district, Cincinnati.What is worse, at least some search engines may not can return any webpage on the Ramada website as one of its best search result.
Secondly, consider search inquiry " three seasons palo alto (three season Palo Alto) ".In this example, the main page of the website in " Three Seasons (three seasons) " restaurant does not comprise the address in restaurant.Thereby, although the main page of website that has this restaurant does not have evidence to hint that it is relevant with Palo Alto on this main page to having authoritative many evidences three seasons.Notice that other webpage on this website indicates this restaurant to be positioned at Palo Alto really.
Example explanation as described above, only use the automatic search engine of directly relevant information (for example, at webpage and its structural word, word in the anchor point (anchor) of sensing webpage and the page rank of webpage) may can not find the webpage the most useful to ad hoc inquiry with webpage.Thereby it is useful that the improvement search engine makes it return better Search Results.Particularly, below be useful, (for example improve search engine, by improving the information of its processing), make that it can consider the degree of association of other webpage on this word and the same website when search engine carries out rank to the word of inquiring about (for example word and/or phrase) with the correlativity of a webpage.More generally, it is useful improving the identical or similar IR The Application of Technology of use.

§ 4.2.1 illustrative methods
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram that is used for making in mode according to the invention the illustrative methods 400 that the website internal information is associated.Accept site information (for example webpage, web page contents, webpage metadata, Yellow Page data, territory log-on data or the like) (frame 410).Identification may be relevant with the webpage of website information, described webpage is not only the webpage (frame 420) that described information institute (directly) is associated.The information discerned of identification may be relevant with it one or more other related web pages (frame 430).Then the information of being discerned is associated with the webpage of being discerned by (frame 440).Leaving method 400 (node 460) before, storage (for example, being kept at after being used on the memory device and using) website of revision and/or webpage are (for example, the webpage that has new related information) information, the search inquiry of the information that the webpage of feasible revision is discerned for comprising has the higher search score value (frame 450) of search score value that has than original web page.
Return referring to frame 420, be described below the example of the type of information of being discerned or the information of being discerned.Return referring to frame 430, be described below the example of one or more related web pages that the information how to be discerned may be relevant with it.As understanding from following description, in various embodiments, such information can make progress along the website, downwards and/or cross over the website and propagate.
Fig. 5 is the process flow diagram that is used for carrying out in mode according to the invention the illustrative methods 500 of Web search.Accept search inquiry information (frame 510).Use the website and/or the info web of search inquiry information, info web and the revision accepted to generate one group of one or more Search Results (frame 520) then.Leaving method 500 (node 540) before then, Search Results is being distributed requestor's (frame 530).
§ 4.2.1.1 is used to propagate the illustrative methods that the website is considered to it is had authoritative word information
Fig. 6 is the process flow diagram that is used for propagating in mode according to the invention the illustrative methods 600 of authoritative website internal information (for example, downward along the website topological structure).Accept site information (frame 610).For the given webpage (for example homepage) of website, determine that this website of finding is considered to it is had authoritative word (frame 620) on given webpage.Such word (for example word and/or phrase) can stand proving program (frame 630).Determine the webpage (frame 640) of the website relevant with information source webpage (for example site home page or root page or leaf).Can get rid of the webpage (frame 650) that is confirmed as being correlated with, be included into one or more exceptions.The information (for example authoritative word) discerned can be associated with determined (and not getting rid of) webpage then by (frame 660).Leave method 600 (node 680) before then, can preserve the website and/or the info web (frame 670) of (for example storage) revision.
Return referring to frame 620, can consider one or more evidences source when being considered to that in definite website it is had authoritative word.It can be to use this word in one or more the quoting (for example link or hypertext link) to the website that the website has an authoritative exemplary evidence source to word.It can be to use this word (for example enterprise name) in the catalogue that the homepage of website is listed as enterprise web site (for example Yellow Page) clauses and subclauses that the website has authoritative another exemplary evidence source to word.It can be to use this word in the domain name of website that the website has authoritative another exemplary evidence source to word.It can be if this word is a registered trademark that the website has authoritative another exemplary evidence source to word, and this trade mark registration and website (homepage) is associated.Another exemplary evidence source can be following probability: if search inquiry comprises word, then will there be good Search Results (Search Results of for example clicked Search Results, reception " the long click ", the user does not turn back to last webpage and do not click different result or the like in described " the long click ") in given time quantum (for example three minutes) corresponding to the website.Probability can be corresponding to the dynamics of evidence.
Naturally, word is had authoritative other evidence source is possible in the website.It is authoritative definite that all evidences can cause the website that word is had.Also can consider the evidence that opposes.For example, if there be the word evidence relevant, then in all evidences, can consider such evidence with other webpage of one or more other websites.In at least some embodiment, the dynamics of evidence can be used for determining the related dynamics (as being used for the IR purpose) of determined word and purpose (or meeting point (sink)) webpage.That is, the dynamics of evidence can be used to determine whether (a) carries out association, and/or (b) related dynamics.
Return referring to frame 640, in at least some embodiment according to the invention, relevant degree can be used to determine the related dynamics (as being used for the IR purpose) of determined word and purpose (or meeting point) webpage between webpage source and destination (or meeting point) webpage of determined word.
Return referring to frame 630, determined word can stand one or more validation tests.For example, for determined word, having the probability of good result if search inquiry comprises this word for the website of being considered may be greater than (or greater than scheduled volume and/or number percent greater than) the corresponding probability for all other websites (such information is known or confirmable for it).As another example,, then may wish only to use top n (for example, according to from the probability of the best website of the next one, probability differential or the like) query terms if there is determined word more than predetermined quantity.
Return referring to frame 650, determined Query Information (" information of being discerned ") can not propagated (for example downward) some webpage to the website of being considered.For example, the webpage with low score value (for example low page rank) possibly can't obtain the information of being discerned that is associated with it.As another example, the propagation to the information discerned can be limited to the separation degree (for example, the quantity of the backslash that begins from source web page) of the predetermined quantity (for example 2) of source (for example main or root) webpage in the website and purpose webpage.As another example, can get rid of the webpage (for example news release, message board, forum, foreign language page (for example using the purpose page of the language that is different from the source page) or the like) of some type.
Note,, then at least some embodiment according to the invention, may be required in and occur whole phrase (or all words of phrase) at least in the inquiry to avoid some problem if word is a phrase.For example, the website of consideration as " american century investments (investment of U.S.'s century) ".Although the homepage of this website can have authority to inquiry " american century investments (investment of U.S.'s century) ", it composition word " american (U.S.) ", " century (century) " reaches " investment (investment) " and does not have authority what inquire about.Thereby, for example, not comprising the search inquiry in " american century (U.S.'s century) " for comprising word " investments (investment) ", the webpage of this website should not obtain " lifting ".
Notice that in fact diffuse information can allow the other same web page on different web sites to have different score values downwards.For example, the webpage at the Cincinnati Ramada on the www.ramada.com of website can have higher score value (at least for the search inquiry that comprises word " ramada (Ramada) ") than the same web page on the www.hotels.com of website.This is useful, because when search inquiry comprises word " ramada (Ramada) ", the most users of search in the Ramada hotel of Cincinnati may prefer the webpage from authoritative website.
§ 4.2.1.2 is used to propagate the illustrative methods of height descriptive information
The present inventor recognizes the descriptive word (and out of Memory) of height that can not find the website usually on the homepage of website.It is useful discerning such height descriptive information and it is associated with master's (or root) page or leaf of website.
Fig. 7 is the process flow diagram that is used for propagating in mode according to the invention the illustrative methods 700 of highly descriptive website internal information (for example, making progress along the website topological structure).Accept site information (frame 710).Other descriptive information (frame 720) highly of the position (for example address) that identification is associated with webpage except master's (or root) of website page or leaf or some.The information of being discerned (for example position) is the information (frame 730) that can mark by the page.The information of being discerned (for example position) is propagated (for example along the website topological structure upwards) to one or more purpose webpages (frame 740).Determine the degree of confidence (frame 750) in the degree of association of information of being discerned (for example position) and purpose webpage.If degree of confidence is not high enough, then leave method 700 (frame 760 and node 790) simply.On the other hand,, then the information of being discerned (for example position) is associated with the purpose webpage by (frame 760 and 770), and stores (for example preserve) this association (frame 780) before leaving method 700 (node 790) if degree of confidence is enough high.
Note, can move frame 760-780 in one or more purpose webpages each.Degree of confidence is enough high but be possible for the enough height of another webpage for a webpage of website.Thereby, at least some embodiment according to the invention, estimate the evidence (removing as described below) that is used for each webpage individually.At each webpage place, the accumulation be used for all webpages of website topological structure below this webpage the institute on evidence.Use the evaluation of evidential matter of these accumulation to be used for the information of particular webpage.For example, lower webpage may have and is used for the only information of an address in the website topological structure, and it is enough evidences of propagating this address.Yet, webpage higher in the website topological structure also may have the evidence that is used for other address, it can cause for the relevant especially conclusion in this neither one address, website, and the address will upwards not propagated into higher webpage such in the website topological structure in this case.As an alternative, or extraly, first webpage on the website can have abundant proof and enough degree of confidence are arranged, but on the website topological structure not second webpage on the website on first webpage can not have evidence, have insufficient evidence and/or opposition evidence.
In at least some embodiment according to the invention, after upwards diffusing information, any webpage is for the different addresses that it all has the entire quantity of final evidence can be associated with all webpages of website (for example record thereon).When address information is marked, if the website has many addresses, then can give the address information on any given page less weight, because generally speaking as if this website do not have any physical focal point.
Return referring to frame 720, can discern the position that is associated with webpage.Can be used for the various data sources of recognizing site be included in full address, the location name that on webpage, occurs on the webpage, provide the Yellow Page data (for example, having homepage and/or telephone number) of the address that is used for webpage or position, from the country code in the metamessage of territory registration, territory, comprise the database of the word that is the place, the location name that on other page, occurs or the like near the link of pointing to this page.Location name from each source can be associated with webpage.In addition, can follow the trail of the kind and the quantity in the source that every information is provided.Return referring to frame 730, such information can be used to the positional information of being discerned is marked.
Still return referring to frame 720, can discern alternative site information or the information except that positional information.As an example, rare word (for example high contrary document frequency (IDF) word or the like) can be propagated (for example upward to master's (or root) page or leaf).As another example, page classification (for example from predefined tabulation, from verticals categories, from notion, from theme, from style or the like) can be propagated (for example upward to master's (or root) page or leaf).
Return referring to frame 740, this information can upwards be propagated along the URL level of website.For example, at each webpage place, can accumulate be used for the website the URL level at this webpage place or all positions of below this webpage, mentioning.Can accumulate one or more factors (for example frequency of the source of position and position or the like) of score value or impact fraction.Return referring to frame 750, score value that is accumulated or score value factor can be used to determine the confidence value of each position.That is, all positional information and sources thereof can be weighted the degree of confidence of determining in each position.Reaffirm, can carry out degree of confidence scoring to each webpage, wherein the degree of confidence score value is the function of the information on the webpage below particular webpage only in the topological structure of website.
Return referring to frame 760, determine which position (if existence) is considered to be associated assuredly with webpage.Machine learning system how can be used to determine weighting different types of " position degree of confidence " evidence (for example referring to, submit on November 13rd, 2003, name is called " RANKINGDOCUMENTS BASED ON LARGE DATA SETS (carrying out rank based on large data set pair document) " and with the U.S. Patent application No.10/706 of Jeremy Bern, Georges Harik, Noam Shazeer, Simon Tong and Joshua Levenberg classify as the inventor, 991 (are called " ' 991 application " and incorporate into by reference at this); And submit on Dec 15th, 2003, name is called LARGE SCALE MACHINELEARNING SYSTEMS AND METHODS (large-scale machine learning system and method) and with the U.S. Patent application No.10/734 of Jeremy Bern, Georges Harik, Noam Shazeer, Simon Tong and JoshuaLevenberg classify as the inventor, 584 (are called " ' 584 application " and incorporate into by reference at this),, it has described the machine learning techniques that can be used.Again referring to, Springer publication, T.Hastie, R.Tibshirani and J.H.Friedman write
The Elements of Statistical Learning (key element of statistical learning)(on July 30th, 2003).)。The example of evidence can comprise the source (for example address on webpage, Yellow Page data, territory registration, data or the like), evidence of evidence to the path (for example making progress) of current web page along level, capitalization, context or the like.Can use from the example of the web page extraction that has reliable evidence (for example the Yellow Page data are normally very reliable) for it and come the training machine learning system.After system was trained, it can be used to be weighted in the information of each webpage place to each location name accumulation.Still referring to frame 760, but not being applied to threshold value, degree of confidence whether positional information is associated with purpose (meeting point) webpage to find out, in at least some embodiment according to the invention, level of confidence can be used to determine the related dynamics (as being used for the IR purpose) of position and purpose (or meeting point) webpage.That is, level of confidence can be used to determine whether (a) carries out association, and/or (b) related dynamics.
In at least some embodiment according to the invention, be considered to the position of being correlated with too much if exist, then may wish (to the homepage of website) upwards not propagated in any of these position along the website.Thereby the number of different position can be used for the weighting of evidence.For example, for given webpage, if there is the evidence of many different addresses, then may wish any one address not to be propagated into this webpage, or when propagating such address when comprising that one or more inquiry in the address is considered to relevant search result but in scoring subsequently, give its less weight.Consider that position for example spreads all over the national special permission shop of the McDonald of the U.S..In such scheme, may not wish all that position is upwards propagated into the homepage that is used for the McDonald website.This is because a large amount of positions is not the height description of McDonald website.In addition, although aforementionedly relate on the basis of each webpage the analysis of evidence or to the weighting of the positional information propagated, the test of using some website scope can be useful.For example, the website is believed to comprise the different addresses more than predetermined quantity (for example 20), may wish any address not to be propagated into any webpage of website.
May be associated with one or more positions if the conclusion of model is a webpage, then be considered to may be relevant with webpage in the position.Return referring to frame 770 and 780, the position can be associated with webpage then, and can store (for example preserving) this association.
In at least some embodiment according to the invention, positional information can only upwards be propagated into master's (or root) page or leaf of website.
In at least some embodiment according to the invention, when handling inquiry,, then can give the credit that webpage has all words of position if in inquiry, except that the position, also there is other important words.That is, may wish: if inquiry only about the address, does not then give webpage with the position credit that increases.If on the other hand, in inquiry, there is other important, non-position word, then may wish to give each position word as the as many credit of important non-position word (or unlike its more credit) that dynamics is arranged most that is used to inquire about.If have the many positions that are associated with the website, then may wish to reduce the credit that gives.
Although relating to along the topological structure of website, some among the above-described embodiment upwards propagate the height descriptive information, but at least some embodiment according to the invention can (for example propagate by topological structure such information is downward along the topological structure of website or the leap website, at first make progress, downward then).

§ 4.2.3 refines and alternative
At least some embodiment according to the invention can use different technology to determine whether the website has " authority " for word.For example, if search terms is known (for example registered trademark), then grantee of trade-mark's website can be considered to that this trade mark word is had " authority ".As mentioned above, can consider various evidences source and can being weighted to all evidences.
Return referring to Fig. 4 440 and 450, Fig. 6 660 and 670 and Fig. 7 770 and 780, can in every way the information of being discerned be associated with the webpage of being discerned.For example, the inverted order index of the inverted order index 226 shown in Fig. 2 can be modified, to reflect the related of information of being discerned and the webpage of being discerned.More specifically, can to point to various { web page identifier, weights } right for word (for example word or expression).Weight can be called as hit count.For example, consider to be mapped to the word " Ramada (Ramada) " that is used at the webpage (ID#=1234) in the Ramada hotel of Cincinnati.The inverted order index can comprise information at first:
Ramada->...，{ID#1234，5}，...
The homepage that further hypothesis is used for the website of Ramada has authority to keyword " Ramada (Ramada) " and supposes that hope propagates into " Ramada (Ramada) " downwards other webpage of website.After related and preservation action, the inverted order index now can comprise information:
Ramada->...，{ID#1234，25}，...
Therefore weight can be increased.
As an alternative, the weight that can use particular type promotes, and makes it optionally to use in some cases, and does not use (for example based on search inquiry) in other situation.That is, it can be used to promote weight in some cases, and does not promote weight (for example based on search inquiry) in other situation.In such embodiments, word (for example word or expression) can point to various { web page identifier, weight, weight promote } tlv triple.Use as above similar example, the inverted order index can comprise information at first:
Ramada->...，{ID#1234，5，nul}，...
After related and preservation action, the inverted order index can comprise information then:
Ramada->...，{ID#1234，5，3}，...
Although weight promotes and is illustrated as variable, it can only be to indicate the binary value that whether promotes weight.In embodiment more according to the invention, even the binary value indication should promote weight, but in some environment (for example Cha Xun factor), promoting weight can be prevented from or reduce.
In at least some embodiment according to the invention, " lifting " can be applied to the score value (for example, IR score value and/or page rank score value or the like) of webpage or the component of score value.Lifting capacity can be the function of score value, makes the webpage with high score obtain the lifting bigger than the webpage with low initial score value at first.For example, lifting can be applied to:
score’＝score*(1+boost*score)
Wherein boost (lifting) and score (score value) are greater than 1.
Although above-described embodiment is in the environment of user search queries, embodiment according to the invention can be applied to other application, generates or the local advertising orientation such as the advertisement guiding.
In at least some embodiment according to the invention, inquiry can be according to being the info web of hope use revision when handling inquiry or wishing to use original info web to handle.As an example, two filter application to be able to be used the page info of which revision in inquiry decision when comprising geographical word information in inquiry.Be discussed below each of these filtrators.
For first filtrator, can occur based on its mode that in inquiry, whether occurs with geographical word, off-line generates the tabulation of the word that may be geographical word.For example, geographical word is occurring as in the inquiry in " hotels in X (in the hotel of X) " usually.If the mark that is occurred (fraction) of the potential geographical word in similar inquiry significantly is lower than the corresponding scores that is used for most geographical words, then this word can be considered to right and wrong geography.For example, although " MS " (abbreviation of " Mississippi (Mississippi) ") is geographical word, it can refer to many other things, as in phrase " MS California ".As rule, may wish " MS " not treated as geographical word, unless its in inquiry, occur with phrase, as " the Jackson MS " that hereinafter occurs geographically usually.Thereby, can generate the tabulation of geographical word based on having in word and the geographical similar inquiry form of indication as the remarkable balloon score of its appearance in the inquiry in " hotels inX (in the hotel of X) ".Then, when webpage being marked, only be used for being proved to be the GEONET page information of revision of the word of geography for inquiry.Do like this avoided for as the problem of the inquiry of " MS California ".
For second filtrator, can off-line be created on the very frequent tabulation that occurs in the inquiry as the word of " hotel (hotel) ", " pizza (Pizza) " or the like.Then, be geographical even some words of inquiry are identified as, not common word unless still can not use at least one other word of the information inquiry of revision.This avoided for as the problem of the inquiry in " London Hotels (hotel, London) ", wherein be desirable to provide and the corresponding Search Results of webpage about in general sense hotel, London, rather than only with the more corresponding Search Results in each hotel.
In above-mentioned at least some embodiment, the information (for example word) (making this webpage have the higher search score value of search score value that has in other cases than this webpage for the search inquiry that comprises these information) of preserving explicitly with the webpage of website comes from another webpage of same website.Yet at least some embodiment according to the invention, such information (for example word) can be from the document that does not belong to this website.For example, first webpage of supposing first website comprise the address and near this address, point to the quoting of second webpage (for example link) of second website.This can hint that the address of finding may be relevant with second webpage of second website on first webpage of first website.Thereby, this address and second webpage can be preserved explicitly, make second webpage have the higher search score value of search score value that has in other cases than this second webpage for the search inquiry that comprises this address part of this address (maybe may).
In fact, the source of information needs not to be webpage, and relation needs not to be link.For example, consider to comprise the SEC archives, enterprise's license archives or the like of the address (for example, the main business place of company) of enterprise name and enterprise.If the website is registered to enterprise, or has a URL that comprises enterprise name, or highlight enterprise name, but there is not address information, at least some embodiment then according to the invention can obtain the SEC archives, the address (information) of business listing (first document) or the like, determine the website (second document relevant) of the enterprise of appointment with first document, and preserve this address explicitly with the homepage of this website, make this homepage have the higher search score value of search score value that has in other cases than it for the search inquiry that comprises this address part of this address (maybe may).Notice that second example is that a certain type is slightly different with using the out of Memory source to obtain evidence with authorization information.
Example is illustrated as described above, and the source of information needs not to be the webpage on the same website, and even needs not to be webpage.
In at least some embodiment according to the invention, information (for example word) can belong to may be relevant with other document certain category information (for example address).In other words, information is not saved with webpage with not needing not make any distinction between explicitly.The information that information can be limited on the contrary, some kind or type.The example of the kind of information can comprise address, telephone number, the type of business, page style or the like.
In at least some embodiment according to the invention, the source of information needs not to be specific document at all.On the contrary, the source of information can be the relation between the word.Relation should be close.For example, if webpage comprises word " Cleveland (Cleveland) ", then information can be " Ohio (Ohio) ".As another example, if webpage comprises the telephone number that has in the area code in Chicago, then information can be " Chicago (Chicago) ".As another example, word " Michelangelo (Michelangelo) " and " Sistine Chapel (Sistine Chapel) " height correlation.Thereby, the webpage that has word " Sistine Chapel (Sistine Chapel) " can be associated with word " Michelangelo (Michelangelo) ", if make that search inquiry comprises " Michelangelo (Michelangelo) ", then this webpage will receive the higher search score value of search score value that has in other cases than it.Thereby information (for example, Ohio (Ohio), Chicago (Chicago), Michelangelo (Michelangelo) or the like) can not be to be derived from document or webpage, and described document or webpage and information have particular kind of relationship with webpage associated therewith.On the contrary, can based on webpage on the relation of information determine information.The dynamics of the relation of word can be the direction that depends on relation.For example, it can be useful that word " virus (virus) " is associated with webpage about " computer security (computer security) ", may be can be not useful but word " computer security (computer security) " is associated with webpage about " virus (virus) ".Can use various information expansion techniques to determine the one or more words relevant with the seed word.
