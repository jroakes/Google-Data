Abstract
Methods and apparatus related to determining reply content to reply to an electronic communication. Some embodiments are generally directed to analyzing a corpus of electronic communications to determine relationships between one or more original message characteristics of "original" messages of the electronic communications and reply content included in "reply" messages of the electronic communications. Some embodiments are generally directed to providing reply text for inclusion in a reply to a communication based on a determined relationship between one or more message characteristics of the communication and the reply text.
Description
Background
Users are often overwhelmed with electronic communications such as email, SMS communications, and social networking communications. Many electronic communications sent to a user explicitly solicit a reply or otherwise contain information that the user may wish to reply to. For example, contains "Are you interested in the marking lunch? (do you have an interest in lunch. Comprises "I just got engaged! An email of (i just engaged |) "may not explicitly solicit a reply, but a user receiving the email may still wish to send a congratulatory reply to the email. The user formulates a reply to the electronic communication and inputs the formulated reply at the computing device using a keyboard (e.g., a virtual keyboard of a smartphone or tablet), a microphone, and/or other user interface input devices of the computing device.
Disclosure of Invention
The present description relates generally to technical features related to determining reply content for replying to an electronic communication and/or providing the reply content for presentation via a computing device for inclusion in a reply to the electronic communication. Some embodiments are generally directed to analyzing a corpus of electronic communications (e.g., e-mail, SMS communications, and/or social networking communications) to determine relationships between one or more original message features of "original" messages of the electronic communications and reply content included in "reply" messages to the electronic communications. For example, the corpus may be analyzed to determine the relationship between the original message n-elements "attached" and "draft document [ s ] for your review" and the reply n-element "I'll take a look and ok view feedback" (I will see and will provide feedback) "based on the frequently occurring original message n-elements (and optionally other content) in the replied original message using the reply n-element (n-gram). In some implementations, the relationship between the original message characteristics and the reply content may be determined without allowing direct human access to one or more (e.g., any) electronic communications of the corpus. In some implementations, the relationship between the original message characteristics and the reply content may be determined based on a trained machine learning system using training examples, each training example having one or more output parameters indicative of the reply content of the reply message of the respective electronic communication and one or more input parameters indicative of the original content of the original message of the respective electronic communication.
Some embodiments are generally directed to providing reply text for inclusion in a reply to a communication based on a determined relationship between one or more message characteristics of the communication and the reply text. For example, an email may be sent to a user and include "Our team just on the Awesomeness Award! (our team just won the extraordinary prize!), "and may be based on one or more characteristics of the email and" Good job! Mapping (data defining a relationship) between (Good!) ", the reply text" Good job!is provided as a candidate reply to the email! ". For example, reply text may be provided for automatic population in replies to an email, for presenting (visually or audibly) suggestions as a user selection, and the like. As another example, an email may be sent to a user and include "Our team just on the Awesomeness Award! "and may be based on a mapping between one or more characteristics of the email and the reply content indicating a general congratulatory n-gram-and" Good job! "mapping defined as a highly ranked congratulatory n-gram to provide the user with the reply text" Good job! "as a reply to the email. For example, "Good jobA!based on its congratulatory n-gram being popular with the user, with a group of users similar to the user, or with all users! "may be defined as a congratulatory n-gram with a high ranking. In some implementations, the reply text may be provided for inclusion in the reply to the communication independently of any text input provided by the user in generating the reply to the communication. In other words, in some implementations, the reply text may be presented to the user even before the user begins to enter the reply. In some implementations, responsive to providing one or more message features of the communication to the trained machine learning system, reply text may be determined to be included in a reply to the communication based on output provided by the trained machine learning system.
Various methods and apparatus described herein may provide various technical effects. For example, some embodiments of the present disclosure enable one or more computer systems to determine, based on past electronic communications, relationships between message characteristics of original messages and reply content in replies responsive to those original messages, without allowing direct human access to one or more (e.g., any) electronic communications of a corpus. For example, some embodiments apply filtering and/or clustering techniques to these electronic communications and/or train a machine learning system based on training examples generated from these electronic communications to determine relationships between message features of original messages and reply content in replies responsive to these original messages. Further, for example, some embodiments of the present disclosure determine reply content based on the electronic communication sent to the user, such that the reply content can be presented to the user via the user's computing device for inclusion in a reply to the electronic communication. The determination and/or presentation may optionally occur before the user provides any text input and/or other reply input in generating the reply. This may reduce the use of one or more resources of the user's computing device that would otherwise be used during formulation of the user's reply content, particularly in embodiments where the reply content may be determined, in whole or in part, by a computer system separate from the user's computing device. As another example, some embodiments may determine a plurality of candidate reply texts for potential inclusion in the reply, and may provide one or more of the plurality of candidate reply texts based on, for example, a corresponding determined relationship between the candidate reply texts and the electronic communication to which the reply is responsive. For example, the display prominence of multiple presented reply texts may be determined based on their corresponding determined relationships. Additional and/or alternative technical effects may be provided, such as various technical effects described in greater detail herein.

Detailed Description
Fig. 1 illustrates an example environment in which a corpus of electronic communications can be analyzed to determine relationships between one or more original message features and reply content and/or in which reply text can be determined to be included in a reply to a communication based on at least one defined relationship between one or more message features of the communication and the reply text. The example environment includes a communication network 101 that facilitates communication between various components in the environment. In some embodiments, the communication network 101 may include the internet, one or more intranets, and/or one or more bus subsystems. The communication network 101 may optionally utilize one or more standard communication techniques, protocols, and/or interprocess communication techniques. The example environment includes a client device 106, an electronic communication system 110, a reply content system 120, a selection engine 130, an electronic communication database 152, and a relational database 158 between message characteristics and reply content.
The electronic communication system 110 and the reply content system 120 may each be implemented in one or more computers that communicate, for example, over a network (not shown). Electronic communication system 110 and reply content system 120 are example systems in which the systems, components, and techniques described herein may be implemented and/or with which the systems, components, and techniques described herein may interface. Electronic communication system 110 and reply content system 120 each include one or more memories for storing data and software applications, one or more processors for accessing data and executing applications, and other components that facilitate communication over a network. In some implementations, the electronic communication system 110 and/or the reply content system 120 may include one or more components of the example computer system of fig. 9. The operations performed by electronic communication system 110 and reply content system 120 may be distributed across multiple computer systems. In some implementations, one or more aspects of the reply content system 120 may be combined with the electronic communication system 110, and/or one or more aspects of the electronic communication system 110 and/or the reply content system 120 may be implemented on the client device 106.
Generally, in some implementations, the reply content system 120 analyzes a corpus of electronic communications, such as the corpus of electronic communications of the electronic communications database 152, to determine relationships between one or more original message characteristics of "original" messages of communications and content replies included in "reply" messages of those communications. In some of these implementations, the relationship between the original message characteristics and the reply content may be determined without allowing direct human access to one or more (e.g., any) electronic communications of the corpus.
Generally, in some implementations, the reply content system 120 additionally and/or alternatively determines and provides reply text for inclusion in a reply to a communication, such as a communication provided by the client device 106 and/or a communication of the electronic communication database 152 that the user has not replied to. Reply content system 120 may determine the reply text based on one or more determined relationships between one or more message characteristics of the communication and the reply text. In some implementations, the reply content system 120 may provide reply text for inclusion in the reply to the communication independent of any text input provided by the user in generating the reply to the communication.
As used herein, "electronic communication" or "communication" may refer to an email, a text message (e.g., SMS, MMS), an instant message, a transcribed voicemail, or any other electronic communication that includes at least some textual content. In various implementations, the electronic communication may include various metadata, and the metadata may optionally be utilized in one or more of the techniques described herein. For example, an electronic communication such as an email may include an electronic communication address, such as one or more sender identifiers (e.g., a sender email address), one or more recipient identifiers (e.g., a recipient email address, including both cc and cc recipients), a date sent, one or more attachments, a subject, a type of device sending and/or receiving the electronic communication, and so forth.
Depending on the context, "electronic communication" and "communication" as used herein are used to refer to both electronic communications that include only original messages and electronic communications that include one or more original messages and include one or more reply messages. The electronic communication may be a single document, such as an email that includes both the original message and the reply message and may be processed to distinguish the original message from the reply message. Processing the electronic communication to distinguish between the original message and the reply message may include "splitting" the message based on the presence of metadata, message interruptions, header information included in the message, quotation marks provided around the original message, and the like. The electronic communication may also be a plurality of documents mapped to each other in response to other documents of the plurality of documents based on at least one of the plurality of documents. For example, the electronic communication may include a first email that is an original message received by the user and a second email sent by the user as a reply to the original message, or an original and reply SMS message. The mapping of multiple documents to each other may be performed, for example, by the electronic communication system 110. For example, the electronic communication system 110 may map the first email to the second email based on the user selecting a "reply" user interface element when viewing the first email and then drafting the second email in response to selecting the reply user interface element.
As used herein, an original message is earlier in time than a reply message to a response, but not necessarily the first message in an electronic communication. For example, the original message may be the first message in time in an electronic communication, and the reply message in response to the original message may be a later in time (e.g., next in time) message. Further, for example, the original message may additionally and/or alternatively be a second, third, or fourth message in time in the electronic communication, and the reply message in response to the original message may be a later message in time in the electronic communication. Each of the original message and the reply message may include one or more of associated text, metadata, and/or other content (e.g., attachments, embedded images).
In various implementations, the reply content system 120 may include an original message characteristic determination engine 122, a reply content determination engine 124, and/or a relationship strength engine 126. In some implementations, all or aspects of engines 122, 124, and/or 126 may be omitted. In some implementations, all or more aspects of engines 122, 124, and/or 126 may be combined. In some implementations, all or aspects of engines 122, 124, and/or 126 may be implemented in a component separate from reply content system 120. Reply content system 120 is described herein as a single system that determines relationships between one or more original message characteristics of communicated "original" messages and reply content included in the communicated "reply" messages; and it determines and provides reply text for inclusion in a reply to a communication, such as a communication provided by a client. However, in some implementations, a first system may determine the relationship, and a separate second system may determine and provide the reply text based on the determined relationship.
In general, in determining the relationship between one or more original message characteristics and the reply content, the reply content determination engine 124 identifies a corpus of electronic communications that include the reply message and the original message to which the reply message is responsive, and determines reply content that occurs in reply messages of multiple electronic communications of the corpus.
In some implementations, the selection engine 130 can select communications to include in the corpus identified and analyzed by the reply content determination engine 124 based on one or more criteria. For example, selection engine 130 may limit which electronic communications are included in electronic communications database 152 based on the criteria, and electronic communications database 152 may be used as a corpus. Further, for example, the selection engine 130 can label or otherwise annotate certain communications of the electronic communications database 152 as suitable for inclusion in the corpus, and these annotated communications can be used as the corpus.
In some implementations, the selection engine 130 can select electronic communications included in a corpus of electronic communications based on the electronic communications including an "original" message and a "reply" message in response to the original message. As described herein, an electronic communication comprising an original message and a reply message may be a single document and/or multiple documents mapped to each other. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 selects electronic communications for inclusion in the corpus based on the reply text of the reply message of each electronic communication being less than a reply text threshold length and/or based on the original text of the original message of each electronic communication being less than an original text threshold length. For example, only communications that include reply text that includes less than 20 words and/or less than 100 characters may be selected.
In some implementations, the selection engine 130 can employ one or more techniques to reduce the occurrence of certain types of communications in the corpus. For example, where the corpus includes emails, the reply content determination engine 124 may employ techniques to filter out emails that may come from merchants. For example, emails from certain email addresses, emails from email addresses with a particular domain name, emails from email addresses with certain prefixes, emails with certain n-grams in the subject line, and so forth, may be filtered out of the corpus. In addition, e-mails that match certain merchant templates may be filtered out, for example. In addition, e-mails that may be spam may be filtered out, for example.
In some implementations, the selection engine 130 selects the electronic communications included in the corpus based on other attributes associated with the communications and/or the sender and/or recipient of the communications. For example, if it is desired to determine a relationship between original message features and reply n-grams for a particular geographic area, communications associated with that geographic area may be selected for inclusion in the corpus.
In some implementations, the reply content determination engine 124 determines reply n-grams that occur in reply text of at least a threshold number of reply messages of the electronic communication of the corpus and uses the reply n-grams as the reply content. For example, the threshold number may be set based on privacy considerations and/or efficiency considerations. In some of these embodiments, the reply n-gram may be an n-gram consisting of all reply text of one or more reply messages of the electronic communication of the corpus. In some implementations, the reply n-gram can be an n-gram that occurs in one or more particular segments (e.g., first sentences or phrases) of reply text of one or more reply messages of the electronic communications of the corpus. In some implementations, the reply n-gram may include portions of reply text of multiple reply messages of the electronic communication of the corpus and include identifiers of categories of other portions of the reply text of the multiple reply messages. For example, the n-gram of "see sender's first name" (there is the name of the sender) "can be determined based on the occurrence of" see you other Bob (there, Bob) "in the email sent by Bob," see you other Jane (there, Jane) "in the email sent by Jane, and so on.
In some implementations, the reply content determination engine 124 groups the corpus of electronic communications into a plurality of clusters and determines the reply content based on reply messages of one or more electronic communications of one of the clusters. In these embodiments, the reply content determination engine 124 groups the corpus of electronic communications into a plurality of clusters based on one or more attributes shared among one or more electronic communications within the corpus. For example, the reply content determination engine 124 may group the corpus of electronic communications into clusters based on similarities, such as semantic, syntactic, and/or textual similarities, between reply texts of reply messages of the electronic communications of the corpus. Generally, reply messages for electronic communications grouped in a given cluster will be more similar to each other (based on the similarity of the grouping utilization) than reply messages grouped in other clusters.
Typically, each of the determined clusters corresponds to a different category of reply content. For example, a cluster may contain electronic communications with "greetings" reply content, such as n-grams "Congrats! (congratulate!) "," That's awesome (too good!) "and" Way to go (good!) "; and another cluster may contain electronic communications with "thank you" reply content, such as n-grams "Thanks", "I advance it", and "Many Thanks". In some implementations, the reply content for a given cluster may include, for example, an identifier for the category (e.g., "congratulatory" reply content), an identifier for the n-gram that appears most frequently in the reply content in the electronic communications of the cluster (e.g., the 50 most frequent n-grams), and/or other identifiers for the content.
In some implementations, the reply content determination engine 124 can utilize one or more clustering algorithms in grouping a corpus of electronic communications into a plurality of clusters based on a similarity metric between the reply content. For example, in some implementations, x-means clustering may be utilized, where the distance between reply content is based on a similarity metric between the reply content. In general, x-means clustering is an unsupervised method to find an ideal k for k-means clustering. In general, k-means clustering aims to segment observations into groups, each observation being included in the group with which it is most relevant. Additional and/or alternative clustering techniques may optionally be used.
In general, in determining the relationship between one or more original message characteristics and the reply content, original message characteristic determination engine 122 determines one or more original message characteristics based on an original message of one or more electronic communications that include the reply content. For example, where the reply content is an n-gram, original message characteristic determination engine 122 may determine the original message characteristic based on analyzing the original message for one or more of the one or more electronic communications that include the n-gram in the reply message. Further, for example, where the reply content indicates reply content for a cluster of electronic communications determined by the reply content determination engine 124, the original message characteristic determination engine 122 may determine the original message characteristic based on analyzing the original messages of one or more electronic communications of the cluster of electronic communications.
In some implementations, frequently occurring n-grams in the original text of the original message including one or more electronic communications of the reply content may be determined as a message characteristic. Additional and/or alternative message characteristics may be determined, such as co-occurrence of two or more n-grams in the text of the original message of the one or more electronic communications that include the reply content. The co-occurrence of two or more n-grams may optionally co-occur in a particular order (e.g., a first n-gram before a second n-gram), in a particular positional relationship (e.g., within another n-grams or characters), and so forth. Additional and/or alternative original message characteristics may include, for example: features of one or more natural language processing tags (e.g., portions of speech, named entities, tones) applied to the text of the original message; based on characteristics of text that specifically appears in the topic, first sentence, last sentence, or other portion of the original message; based on characteristics of the metadata of the original message such as the time of sending the original message, the day of the week the email was sent, the number of recipients, the type of device sending the original message, etc. As one example, the raw message characteristics determined by the raw message characteristics determination engine 122 may be: the co-occurrence of a particular n-gram in the subject of a plurality of original messages with another particular n-gram in the body of those original messages.
In some implementations, where at least one message feature includes an n-gram in the text of the original message, the original message feature determination engine 122 can determine the n-gram based on a count of occurrences of the n-gram including the reply n-gram in the reply text in the electronic communication. For example, an n-gram occurring in an original message of 1000 of the electronic communications may be more likely to be determined as a message characteristic than an n-gram occurring in an original message of only 200 of the electronic communications. In some implementations, where at least one message feature includes an n-gram in the text of the original message, the original message feature determination engine 122 can additionally and/or alternatively determine the n-gram based on an overall popularity metric associated with the n-gram. For example, "The kids have been sick of all of The week" may be a less popular n-member than "Good moving" (e.g., based on its infrequent occurrence on a large corpus of documents, all electronic communications such as a corpus), and may be more likely to be determined as a message feature based on its less popular.
In some implementations, where at least one message feature includes an n-gram in the text of the original message, the original message feature determination engine 122 can determine an n-gram that includes portions of the text of the plurality of original messages, and includes identifiers or other higher-level indications of categories of other portions of the original message. For example, an n-element of "We have reservations at White cast, Let me know if you can't" in the first original message, Let I know you cannot in the second original message, etc. may be determined based on the occurrence of "We have reservations at White cast, Let I know you cannot" in the first original message, Let I know you cannot "in the second original message, and so on.
In general, in determining the relationship between one or more of the original message characteristics and the reply content, the relationship strength engine 126 calculates a relationship strength value between the reply content determined by the reply content determination engine 124 and at least one of the message characteristics determined by the original message characteristics determination engine 122. In some implementations, the relationship strength engine 126 calculates the relationship strength based at least in part on the amount of electronic communications of the corpus including both reply content and at least one message feature. For example, when the message features and the reply content appear in 1000 communications of the corpus, a "stronger" strength of the relationship value between the message features and the reply content may be determined compared to when the message features and the reply content appear only in 300 communications of the corpus.
In various implementations, a plurality of message features can be determined by the raw message feature determination engine 122, and the relationship strength engine 126 can determine a relationship strength value for the plurality of message features collectively and/or for individual segments of the plurality of message features. For example, the first message characteristic may be a first n-gram and the second message characteristic may be a second n-gram. The relationship strength engine 126 may calculate a strength of relationship value between the first n-gram and the reply content, the second n-gram and the reply content, and/or between the first and second n-grams and the reply content.
The relationship strength engine 126 further defines a relationship between at least one message feature and the reply n-gram based on the relationship strength value. In some implementations, defining the relationship between the at least one message feature and the reply content based on the strength of relationship value includes defining the relationship and assigning a strength of relationship value to the relationship. In some implementations, defining the relationship between the at least one message feature and the reply content based on the strength of relationship additionally and/or alternatively includes determining that the strength of relationship value satisfies a threshold and defining the relationship based on determining that the strength of relationship value satisfies the threshold.
In some implementations, at least the relationship strength engine 126 can be implemented as a machine learning system. In these implementations, training examples may be generated by the reply content system 120, each having an output parameter indicative of the reply content determined by the reply content determination engine 124 and one or more input parameters indicative of respective original message characteristics determined by the original message characteristics determination engine 122 based on the original text of one of the electronic communications that included the reply content in the reply message. For example, the first training example may include, as output parameters, the reply content and, as input parameters, all or part of the text of the original message (and optionally annotations associated with the text and/or other content of the original message) of the first communication including the reply content in the reply message. The second training example may include, as output parameters, the reply content and, as input parameters, all or part of the text of the original message (and optionally annotations associated with the text and/or other content of the original message) of the second communication including the reply content in the reply message. Additional training examples may be similarly generated, including additional training examples based on other reply content and associated original text.
The machine learning system may be trained based on training examples. Training of the machine learning system may include calculating relationship strengths and defining relationships. For example, the strength of the relationship between a particular message characteristic and a particular reply content may be based on the amount of training examples that include the particular message characteristic and the particular reply content. The trained machine learning system may be utilized to identify one or more candidate reply texts for additional communications (as explained herein) by providing one or more message features of the additional communications as input to the machine learning system and receiving information indicative of one or more suggested replies (and optionally associated strength of relationship values) as output from the machine learning system.
In some implementations, each output parameter of the training examples can be an indicator of a respective one of the clusters that is optionally determined by the original reply content determination engine 124. As described herein, each clustered reply message may include a plurality of unique n-grams that are all semantically and/or otherwise similar to one another. Utilizing indicators of clusters rather than unique n-grams itself may reduce the number of output variables in the training examples, which may result in more efficient training of the machine learning system. In some of these implementations, the machine learning system may be trained to provide one or more indicators of the clusters as output. The relationship strength engine 126 and/or other components can then utilize further mappings of the indicators of the clusters to the n-grams (and optionally weights associated with the mappings) and select one or more of the n-grams as reply text to utilize in the reply. For example, as described herein, in determining a cluster, the reply content determination engine 124 may indicate an indicator of a cluster and/or an n-gram of one or more frequently occurring clusters as the reply content of the particular cluster. For example, a cluster may contain electronic communications with "greetings" reply content, such as an n-gram "Congrats! "," That's awesome "and" Way to go ". In such an example, the machine learning system may provide as output an indicator of the cluster, and may map the cluster to the aforementioned n-grams (optionally along with a weight on which it may be based, e.g., a frequency of occurrence of the n-grams in reply messages to the cluster). The mapping may be used to select one or more n-grams to provide as reply text for inclusion in the reply.
The relationships defined by the relationship strength engine 126 may be stored in a relationship database 158 between message characteristics and reply content. For example, original message characteristics and reply content may be stored as nodes, and edges connecting the nodes may define relationships. The edges may optionally be weighted to define the strength of these relationships. In embodiments utilizing machine learning, the machine learning system may also store data in a database 158 of relationships between message features and reply content, the database 158 defining determined relationships between original message features that have been determined to be useful (based on input parameters of the training examples) and reply content (based on output parameters of the training examples).
Fig. 2 illustrates an example of how a relationship between one or more original message features and reply content may be determined based on a corpus of electronic communications. Reply content determination engine 124 identifies a corpus of electronic communications from electronic communications database 152 and determines reply content that occurs in reply messages of multiple electronic communications of the corpus. The electronic communication of the corpus includes a reply message and an original message to which the reply message is responsive. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 can select communications to include in the corpus identified and analyzed by the reply content determination engine 124 based on one or more criteria. In some implementations, the reply content determination engine 124 determines a reply n-gram that occurs in reply text of at least a threshold number of reply messages of the electronic communication of the corpus and utilizes the reply n-gram as the reply content.
Original message characteristic determination engine 122 determines one or more original message characteristics based on an original message of one or more electronic communications that include reply content. For example, the reply content determination engine 124 may provide an indication of electronic communications including the reply content to the original message characteristic determination engine 122, and the original message characteristic determination engine 122 may analyze the original messages of these electronic communications to determine one or more original message characteristics. For example, where the reply content is an n-gram, original message characteristic determination engine 122 may determine the original message characteristic based on analyzing the original message of one or more electronic communications that include the n-gram in the reply message.
The determined reply content and original message characteristics are provided to the relationship strength engine 126. The relationship strength engine 126 calculates a relationship strength value between the reply content determined by the reply content determination engine 124 and the at least one message characteristic determined by the original message characteristic determination engine 122. In some implementations, the relationship strength engine 126 calculates the relationship strength based at least in part on the amount of electronic communications of the corpus including both reply content and at least one message feature. For example, when the message features and the reply content appear in 2000 communications of the corpus, a "stronger" strength of the relationship values between the message features and the reply content may be determined than when the message features and the reply content appear only in 200 communications of the corpus. Although not shown in fig. 2, in some implementations, the relationship strength engine 126 can communicate with the electronic communication database 152 to, for example, determine an amount of electronic communications of the corpus that include both the reply content and the at least one message feature.
As described herein, in some embodiments, at least the relationship strength engine 126 may be implemented as a machine learning system. In these embodiments, the reply content and original message characteristics of fig. 2 may be provided as training examples, each having an output parameter indicative of the reply content determined by the reply content determination engine 124 and one or more input parameters indicative of respective original message characteristics determined based on the original text of one of the electronic communications in which the reply content was included in the reply message by the original message characteristic determination engine 122. The machine learning system may be trained based on training examples.
Fig. 3 illustrates another example of how a relationship between one or more original message features and reply content may be determined based on a corpus of electronic communications. Reply content determination engine 124 identifies a corpus of electronic communications from electronic communications database 152 and determines reply content 124a that appears in reply messages of multiple electronic communications of the corpus. Reply content 124a is the n-gram "sender's first name" appearing in the reply message of communication 152a, 152b, 152c]I will take a look and provide feedback (thank you [ name of sender [)]. I will look at and provide feedback) ", and optionally additional communications. The reply message in each of communications 152a, 152b, and 152c includes "R:"text after. Note that reply content 124a includes a higher level indication "[ sender's first name]", which is a category that contains the personal names" Bob "," Jane ", and" Bill "as senders of the respective original messages of the electronic communications 152a, 152b, and 152 c. The reply content determination engine 124 may be based on, for example, a person's nameThe comparison of the words with the metadata of the original message of the electronic communication 152a, 152b, and 152c determines that the personal name corresponds to the sender's name.
Original message characteristics determination engine 122 determines original message characteristics 123al, 123a2, and 123a3 based on an original message of a plurality of electronic communications that include reply content. The first original message characteristic is indicated by 123al as the n-gram "attached" appearing in the original message of the communication 152a, 152b, 152c and optionally the additional communication. The second original message characteristic is indicated by 123a2 as an n-gram "draft document [ s ] for your review" appearing in the original message of the communication 152a, 152b, 152c and optionally the additional communications ("s" indicates "document" may be singular or plural). The third original message characteristic is indicated by 123a3 as the co-occurrence of the n-grams of the first and second original message characteristics that occur in the original message of the communication 152a, 152b, 152c and optionally the additional communication.
The determined reply content 124a and original message characteristics 123al, 123a2, and 123a3 are provided to the relationship strength engine 126. The relationship strength engine 126 calculates a relationship strength value between the reply content 124a and each of the original message functions 123al, 123a2, and 123a 3. Based on the strength of relationship value, strength of relationship engine 126 defines a relationship 159a in database 158 between second original message characteristic 123a2 and reply content 124 a. Based on the strength of relationship value, strength of relationship engine 126 also defines a relationship 159a in database 158 between third original message feature 123a3 and reply content 124 a. In some embodiments, relationship strength engine 126 may also assign respective relationship strength values to relationships 159a and 159 b.
Based on the strength of relationship value, the strength of relationship engine 126 does not define a relationship between a first original message characteristic ("atteched") and the reply content. For example, the strength of relationship engine 126 may have calculated a strength of relationship value for each of the raw message features based on a comparison of: a volume of electronic communications of the corpus that include both reply content and at least one message feature; the corpus includes an amount of electronic communications of the reply message that include the at least one message feature in the original message and that do not include the reply content. For example, the relationship strength engine 126 may have determined that 1000 communications include "draft documents [ s ] for your review" in the original message and reply content in the reply message; and 50000 communications include "draft documents [ s ] for your view" in the original message and include a reply message that does not include the reply content. Strength of relationship engine 126 may determine a strength of relationship value between second original message characteristic 123a2 and reply content 124a based on a comparison of the two values (e.g., 1000/50000 ═ 0.02) — and determine that the strength of relationship value satisfies a threshold suitable for defining a relationship between second original message characteristic 123a2 and reply content 124 a. On the other hand, the relationship strength engine 126 may determine that 2000 communications include "atteched" in the original message and reply content in the reply message; and 500000 communications include "draft documents [ s ] for your view" in the original message and include a reply message that does not include reply content. Strength of relationship engine 126 may determine a strength of relationship value between first original message characteristic 123al and reply content 124a based on a comparison of the two values (e.g., 2000/500000 ═ 0.004) -and determine that the strength of relationship value fails to satisfy a threshold suitable for defining a relationship between first original message characteristic 123al and reply content 124 a.
FIG. 4 illustrates an example of grouping electronic communications into a plurality of clusters based on similarities between the communications, and determining reply content based on reply text of the clustered electronic communications. The reply content determination engine 124 identifies a corpus of electronic communications from the electronic communications database 152 and groups the corpus of electronic communications into a plurality of clusters based on one or more attributes shared in one or more electronic communications within the corpus. For example, the reply content determination engine 124 may group the corpus of electronic communications into clusters based on similarities, such as semantic, syntactic, and/or textual similarities, between reply texts of reply messages of the electronic communications of the corpus.
For example, the reply messages in each of the communications 152d, 152e, and 152f include text following "R:" and each reply message includes text that is generally "congratulatory" in nature. The reply content determination engine 124 may group these communications and the additional communications into the same cluster based on similarities between the reply text of the reply message. Typically, reply messages for electronic communications grouped in a given cluster correspond to different classes of reply content and will be more similar to each other than reply messages grouped in other clusters (e.g., based on similarities utilized in the packets).
The reply content determination engine 124 determines reply content 124b through 124n that indicates reply text in each cluster. For example, the reply content 124b indicates reply text in "cluster 1". The reply content indicating the reply text in the cluster may include, for example, an identifier of the category (e.g., "congratulatory" reply content), an identifier of the n-gram that appears most frequently in the reply content in the electronic communications of the cluster (e.g., the 50 most frequent n-grams), and/or other identifiers of the content.
Referring again to fig. 1, when reply text is provided for inclusion in a reply to a communication based on a determined relationship between one or more message characteristics of the communication and the reply text, the relationship strength engine 126 determines candidate reply text based on one or more message characteristics of the communication. For example, electronic communications may be provided to the relationship strength engine 126 by the client device 106, the electronic communication system 110 (optionally via the electronic communications database 152), and/or another component. The relationship strength engine 126 identifies at least one message characteristic of the electronic communication and determines candidate reply text for inclusion in a reply to the message based on at least one defined relationship (and optionally the strength of the relationship, if any) between the at least one message function and the candidate reply text.
In some implementations, such a determination can be made by the relationship strength engine 126 independent of any text input provided via the user's computing device in generating a reply to the electronic communication. In some of these implementations, the determination may be made before the user even views or otherwise consumes the communication. For example, the relationship strength engine 126 may process the communication before it is viewed by the user, determine candidate reply text for inclusion in a reply to the communication, and append or otherwise associate the candidate reply text with the communication before it is viewed by the user.
In some implementations, the relationship strength engine 126 determines a relationship strength value between at least one message feature and the candidate reply text, and provides the candidate reply text for inclusion in a reply to the message based on the relationship strength value. For example, in some embodiments, candidate reply text may be provided only when the relationship strength value satisfies a threshold. Further, for example, the significance of the candidate reply text and/or how to provide the candidate reply text may be based on the strength of relationship value.
In some implementations, the relationship strength engine 126 can identify a plurality of message features of the communication, each message feature having a relationship defined with the candidate reply text. For example, a first relationship between a first message feature and a candidate reply text may be identified; and may also identify a second relationship between the second message feature and the candidate reply text. In some of these embodiments, a first strength of relationship value for the first relationship and a second strength of relationship value for the second relationship may also be identified, and providing the candidate reply text for inclusion in the reply to the message may be based on the first strength of relationship value and the second strength of relationship value. For example, in some implementations, candidate reply text may be provided only if the sum, average, or other measure of these values satisfies a threshold. Further, for example, the significance of the candidate reply text and/or how to provide the candidate reply text may be based on the strength of relationship value.
In some implementations, the relationship strength engine 126 can identify a plurality of candidate reply texts for the electronic communication and optionally provide a plurality of candidate reply texts included in the reply. For example, the first and second reply texts may be identified based on a correspondence between the at least one message characteristic and the first and second texts. In some of these implementations, strength of relationship values for a first relationship (between the message feature and the first reply text) and a second relationship (between the message feature and the second reply text) may be identified and the first reply text for potential inclusion in the reply to the message may be provided based on a comparison of the strength of relationship values. For example, first reply text for potential inclusion in a reply to a message may be provided without providing second reply text for potential inclusion in a reply to a message (e.g., when the strength of relationship value of the first reply text is much "stronger" than the second reply text). Further, for example, the display prominence of each of the first reply text and the second reply text may be determined based on the strength of relationship value and both the first reply text and the second reply text and the indication of display prominence provided for potential inclusion in a reply to the message.
In some implementations in which the electronic communication is provided by the client device 106 to the relationship strength engine 126, the relationship strength engine 126 can provide the determined reply text to the client device 106 for presentation to the user as an option for inclusion in the reply. In some implementations where electronic communications are provided to the relationship strength engine 126 by the electronic communication system 110 via the electronic communication database 152, the relationship strength engine 126 can store an association of reply text with the electronic communication in the electronic communication database 152 and/or other databases.
In some implementations, the relationship strength engine 126 provides only the determined reply text and the potential prominence information, and the client device 106 and/or the electronic communication system 110 may generate a display of the determined reply text based on the provided data. In some implementations, the relationship strength engine 126 may additionally provide some or all of the data needed to generate the display. In some of these embodiments, any provided prominence information may be incorporated into the data indicating how the display should be presented.
As described herein, in some implementations, some reply content may be defined using one or more higher-level indications of reply text. In these cases, the relationship strength engine 126 may determine the actual reply text that is used to "fill in" the higher-level indication of the reply text. As one example, the determined reply content may be an n-gram of "see you other [ sender's first name ]", where "[ sender's first name ]" is a higher level indication of the reply text. The relationship strength engine 126 can determine the name of the sender of the electronic communication and include the name in the n-gram in place of "[ sender's first name ]. The relationship strength engine 126 can determine the name of the sender based on, for example, metadata of the electronic communication and/or contact information of the user to whom the electronic communication is sent.
As another example, the determined reply content may be an indication of a category of reply content such as "congratulatory reply," and the relationship strength engine 126 may determine one or more highly ranked congratulatory n-grams as the reply text. The ranking of a particular n-gram may be based on, for example, its popularity for users that receive electronic communications, for groups of users similar to the user, for all users, and/or its popularity as a reply n-gram in a corpus of electronic communications used to determine relationships between reply content and original information features. As one example, multiple n-grams may be mapped to a "congratulatory reply," and one or more n-grams may be selected for a particular user based on the number of times the user previously included these n-grams in the user-generated past replies.
As described herein, in some embodiments, the relationship strength engine 126 may be a trained machine learning system. In these embodiments, one or more candidate replies to a communication may be determined by providing as input one or more message characteristics of the communication to the relationship strength engine 126. In response to the input, the relationship strength engine 126 will provide one or more indications of the reply text as output (and optionally an associated relationship strength value).
Fig. 5 illustrates an example of how reply text may be determined to be included in a reply to a communication based on at least one defined relationship between one or more message characteristics of the communication and the reply text. Relationship strength engine 126 receives electronic communication 152 g. The relationship strength engine 126 identifies at least one message feature of the electronic communication 152g and determines candidate reply text to be included in a reply to the communication based on at least one relationship (and optionally a relationship strength) between the at least one message feature and the reply content in the relationship database 158 between the message feature and the reply content. In some implementations, the reply content may be provided by the relationship strength engine 126 as reply text for inclusion in a reply to the communication. In some implementations, some reply content may be defined using one or more higher-level indications of the reply text. In these cases, the relationship strength engine 126 may determine the actual reply text that is used to "fill in" the higher-level indication of the reply text.
8A-8C illustrate example graphical user interfaces for presenting candidate reply text for inclusion in a reply to an electronic communication. The graphical user interfaces of fig. 8A-8C may be presented at the client device 106 based on the reply text determined and provided by the relationship strength engine 126.

Fig. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method of determining a relationship between one or more original message features and reply content based on a corpus of electronic communications. For convenience, the operations of the flow diagrams are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. The system may include various components of various computer systems. For example, some operations may be performed by one or more components of reply content system 120, such as engines 122, 124, and/or 126. Also, while the operations of the method of FIG. 6 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted, or added.
At step 600, the system identifies a corpus of electronic communications. Each electronic communication of the corpus includes an original message and a reply message.
At step 605, the system determines reply content that appears in reply messages of multiple electronic communications of the corpus. At step 610, the system determines at least one message characteristic based on an original message of one or more electronic communications that include reply content.
At step 615, the system calculates a strength of relationship value between the reply content and at least one message feature. In some implementations, the strength of relationship value can be calculated based at least in part on an amount of electronic communication that includes both the reply content and the at least one message feature. At step 620, the system defines a relationship between the at least one message feature and the reply content based on the strength of relationship value.
Although the method of fig. 6 is described with respect to a single instance of reply content, it should be understood that one or more steps (e.g., all) may be iteratively performed to determine multiple instances of reply content and corresponding original message characteristics.
Fig. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method of determining reply text to include in a reply to a communication based on a defined relationship between one or more message characteristics of at least one communication and the reply text. For convenience, the operations of the flow diagrams are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. The system may include various components of various computer systems. For example, some operations may be performed by one or more components of the reply content system 120, such as the relationship strength engine 126. Further, while the operations of the method of FIG. 7 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted, or added.
At step 700, the system identifies an electronic communication sent to a user. At step 705, the system determines at least one message characteristic based on the electronic communication.
At step 710, the system determines the candidate reply text for inclusion in the reply to the message based on the defined relationship between the at least one message feature and the reply text. At step 715, candidate reply text is provided for inclusion in the reply to the electronic communication.
In this specification, the term "database" will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data. The data of the database need not be structured or unstructured in any particular way and may be stored on storage devices in one or more locations. Thus, for example, databases 152 and/or 158 may each include multiple data sets, each of which may be organized and accessed differently. Further, for example, all or portions of databases 152 and/or 158 may be combined into one database and/or may include pointers and/or other links between entries in the database.
In cases where the system described herein collects or may utilize personal information about a user, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether or not a program or feature is to collect user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, user preferences, or the user's current geographic location), or to control whether and/or how content is received from a content server that may be more relevant to the user. Further, certain data may be processed in one or more ways to remove personally identifiable information before being stored or used. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personally identifiable information cannot be determined for the user, or the geographic location of the user may be generalized such that a particular geographic location of the user cannot be determined if geographic location information is obtained (e.g., arrival at a city, zip code, or status level). Thus, the user may control how information is collected about the user and/or usage.
