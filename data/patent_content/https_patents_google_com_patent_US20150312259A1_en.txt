Abstract
A method performed by one or more processing devices includes receiving, from a client device controlled by a user, a search query including one or more search terms and user information of the user; accessing, by a server device based on receipt of the search query, a private content index for indexing private content of users; wherein the private content index includes access control lists; identifying, based on a comparison of the access control lists to the user information received, private content that is accessible to the user; identifying private content that is responsive to the one or more search terms and that is accessible to the user; identifying, based on a search of public content by the server device, public content that is responsive to the one or more search terms; and sending, to the client device, search results for the identified private and public content.
Description
- This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 61/531,382, filed on Sep. 6, 2012, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
- This disclosure relates generally to searching private content and public content.
- A user can submit a search query to a search engine to search the World Wide Web for public content that is relevant to the search query. Generally, public content can include information without access restrictions, including, e.g., restrictions on who can view and/or access the information. Generally, a restriction can include a limiting condition.
- Additionally, computer programs may allow users to search for private content. In some situations, the private content can be related to the computer program and stored by the computer program. Generally, private content includes information with access restrictions (e.g., through permissions in an access control list, stored on local storage that is not shared).
- In an example, an electronic mail (e-mail) computer program stores e-mail messages sent by and received for a user. In this example, the e-mail messages include private content. Access to view the e-mail messages is restricted to users that have been authenticated by the e-mail computer program (e.g., using usemame and password login information). Through the e-mail computer program, the user can search the private content (e.g., e-mail messages) that is stored by the e-mail computer program.
- In one aspect of the present disclosure, a method performed by one or more processing devices includes receiving, from a client device controlled by a user, a search query including one or more search terms and user information of the user; accessing, by a server device based on receipt of the search query, a private content index for indexing private content of users; wherein the private content index includes access control lists, and wherein an access control list identifies users authorized to access an item of private content; identifying, based on a comparison of the access control lists to the user information received, private content that is accessible to the user; identifying, based on a search of portions of the private content index associated with the private content that is accessible to the user, private content that is responsive to the one or more search terms and that is accessible to the user; identifying, based on a search of public content by the server device, public content that is responsive to the one or more search terms; and sending, to the client device, search results for the identified private and public content.
- Implementations of the disclosure can include one or more of the following features. In some implementations, the method also includes generating information for a graphical user interface that when rendered on a display of the computing device displays the search results; wherein sending includes: sending the information for the graphical user interface to the client device. In other implementations, the method includes comparing the user information to information in the access control lists.
- In still other implementations, the method includes ranking the search results. In some implementations, the portions of the private content index include index items, and an index item includes an access control list and information identifying an item of private content.
- In some implementations, the method includes receiving the private content of the users; generating the access control lists for the private content received; generating, at least partly based on the private content received and the access control lists, index items, and generating, based on the index items, the private content index.
- In some implementations, the private content that is accessible to the user includes at least one encrypted item of private content, and the method further includes: retrieving a key for the encrypted item of private content; and decrypting, with the key, the encrypted item of private content.
- In still other implementations, the private content index is remote from the client device. In some implementations; the user that controls the client device is a first user, and the private content that is accessible to the first user is not accessible to one or more second users that differ from the first user.
- In still another aspect of the disclosure, one or more machine-readable media are configured to store instructions that are executable by a server device to perform operations including receiving, from a client device controlled by a user, a search query including one or more search terms and user information of the user; accessing, based on receipt of the search query, a private content index for indexing private content of users; wherein the private content index includes access control lists, and wherein an access control list identifies users authorized to access an item of private content; identifying, based on a comparison of the access control lists to the user information received, private content that is accessible to the user; identifying, based on a search of portions of the private content index associated with the private content that is accessible to the user, private content that is responsive to the one or more search terms and that is accessible to the user; identifying, based on a search of public content, public content that is responsive to the one or more search terms; and sending, to the client device, search results for the identified private and public content. Implementations of this aspect of the present disclosure can include one or more of the foregoing features.
- In still another aspect of the disclosure, an electronic system includes a server device; and one or more machine-readable media configured to store instructions that are executable by the server device to perform operations including: receiving, from a client device controlled by a user, a search query including one or more search terms and user information of the user; accessing, based on receipt of the search query, a private content index for indexing private content of users; wherein the private content index includes access control lists, and wherein an access control list identifies users authorized to access an item of private content; identifying, based on a comparison of the access control lists to the user information received, private content that is accessible to the user; identifying, based on a search of portions of the private content index associated with the private content that is accessible to the user, private content that is responsive to the one or more search terms and that is accessible to the user; identifying, based on a search of public content, public content that is responsive to the one or more search terms; and sending, to the client device, search results for the identified private and public content. Implementations of this aspect of the present disclosure can include one or more of the foregoing features.
- Advantages of the present disclosure include one or more of the following. Users can search over both private and public contents through a single user interface, e.g., rather than using one user interface to search for public content and another, different user interface (or multiple different user interfaces) to search for private content. In an example, a user can use the system described herein to search the World Wide Web, the user's e-mail, and pictures that have been uploaded to a network by the user. In this example, a combined search over private and public contents increases an efficiency of the system in searching for content and reduces an amount of resources consumed by the system during searching.
- All or part of the foregoing can be implemented as a computer program product including instructions that are stored on one or more non-transitory machine-readable storage media, and that are executable on one or more processing devices. All or part of the foregoing can be implemented as an apparatus, method, or electronic system that can include one or more processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to implement the stated functions.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

- Described herein is a system that provides a user interface for performing a search on public content and private content, including, e.g., web history information, social network content, and so forth. In an example, social network content includes communications in a social network website posts made by a user in the social network website, content, endorsements, and media posts shared with the user by others, contacts from a social graph, profiles, shared media, contacts currently online (and/or participating in chats, videoconferences, etc.), posts and related information, calendar information, e-mail messages, private pictures, private images, profile pages, private documents, and so forth.
- In an example, the system determines private content and users that are authorized to access the private content. In some implementations, users can opt-in or opt-out of the system determining this information. In some implementations, the data can be anonymized to promote privacy of users. In this example, the system implements a hashing function to encrypt contents of e-mail messages and other content that the system identifies to anonymize. For example, in the context of emails, users that have access to the e-mail messages include the senders of e-mail message and the recipients of e-mail messages. In this example, the system stores the e-mail message and the senders/recipients of the e-mail message in an encrypted form to promote secure storage of the private content.
- In an example, the system provides the user with a user interface for searching of private content and public content. When the system receives through the user interface a search query from the user, the system determines private content that is accessible to the user. The system determines items of content that are relevant to the search query by searching private content that is accessible to the user and/or public content. In an example, a user interface for searching of private content and public content includes a control that enables a user to search for public content only, private content only, and/or any combination thereof.
-
FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram ofsystem 100 for searchingprivate content 152 andpublic content 150.System 100 includesserver 102.Server 102 includessearch engine 115 for searching of private and public content, as described in further detail below.Search engine 115 includes numerous components, including, e.g.,private content collector 106 andindex generator 114. -
Private content collector 106 is configured to determineprivate content 152 fromsources private content 152, including, e.g., social networking websites, picture hosting websites, online e-mail providers, and so forth, e.g., in accordance with the user's selection of the above-described controls. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,private content 152 includes a collection of items, including, e.g.,items 116. 118, 120 ofprivate content 152.Sources items private content 152 toprivate content collector 106. In an example,private content collector 106 is configured to crawlsources items private content 152. In still another example,sources items private content 152 toprivate content collector 106, for example, at pre-defined time intervals and/or whensources private content collector 106. -
System 100 also includesaccount information repository 110.Account information repository 110 is configured to store information for accessing accounts associated withsources source 144 may be an e-mail provider. In this example, forprivate content collector 106 to crawlsource 144,private content collector 106 uses information stored inaccount information repository 110 to access e-mail accounts of users ofsystem 100. By accessing e-mail accounts of the users,private content collector 106 may retrieve items (e.g., item 120) fromsource 144. In an example, a user is provided with the option of specifying which private content may be collected by private content collector and/or of specifying onlypublic content 150 is searched for the user. - In the example of
FIG. 1 , private content collector 10.6 receivesitems private content 152 fromsources Private content collector 106 is configured to format content initems private content 152 to comply with a standard for the storage and/or for the display of data. In an example, the standard specifies how different data elements and metadata coexist in a computer file, a particular way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file, how to convert a specific type of data to another type of data, and so forth.Private content collector 106formats items private content 152 to promote efficient indexing ofitems private content 152, e.g., as described in further detail below. - In an example,
private content collector 106 generates formatteditems items private content 152, respectively.Private content collector 106 groups together formatteditems private content 112. In this example, formattedprivate content 112 is sent to other modules inserver 102 as a data feed, e.g., rather than individually sending formatteditems -
Index generator 114 is configured to indexprivate content 152 and to indexpublic content 150. In the example ofFIG. 1 ,index generator 114 generatesprivate content index 126 that indexesprivate content 152. In an example,private content index 126 uses hash functions to encrypt portions of items of private content to promote secure storage of the items of private content. Using formatteditems index generator 114 generates index items and stores the index items inprivate content index 126. Generally, an index item includes information that indexes an item ofprivate content 152. -
Index generator 114 generatesindex item 128 toindex item 116 ofprivate content 152. As described in further detail below,index generator 114 uses contents of formatteditem 160 toindex item 116 ofprivate content 152.Index generator 114 also generates index items (not shown) foritems -
Index item 128 includes access control list (ACL) 132 with access information. Generally, access information includes information specifying identities of users that are authorized to access an item of content. In an example,index generator 114 determines users that are authorized to accessitem 116 ofprivate content 152. In this example,item 116 includes user information (not shown), e.g., information specifying identities of users. The user information included initem 116 includes identities of users that are authorized to accessitem 116 ofprivate content 152, as determined bysource 148. In other examples, the user information includes information specifying an identity of a user that sent information, e.g., an identity of user submitting a search query. - Using the user information in
item 116,private content collector 106 formats the user information for inclusion in formatteditem 160.Index generator 114 accesses formatteditem 160. Using the user information in formatteditem 160,index generator 114 determines users authorized to accessitem 116 ofprivate content 152. In this example,index generator 114 adds toACL 132 names of users included in formatteditem 160. in an example,item 116 ofprivate content 152 is an e-mail message. In this example, formatteditem 160 includes a formatted version of contents of the e-mail message. Using contents of formatteditem 160,index generator 114 determines that the sender and the recipients of the e-mail message are authorized to access the e-mail message (e.g.,item 116 of private content 152). - In still another example, formatted
item 160 includes account information fromaccount information repository 110, e.g., whenprivate content collector 106 uses account information to retrieveitem 116 ofprivate content 152 fromsource 148. In this example,index generator 114 adds toACL 132 the account information. -
Index item 128 also includescontent identifier 130, including, e.g., portions ofitem 116 ofprivate content 152 thatindex generator 114 has determined are relevant for identifying and/or for searching contents ofitem 116 ofprivate content 152, information describing contents ofitem 116 ofprivate content 152, keywords foritem 116 ofprivate content 152, and/or a unique identifier foritem 116 ofprivate content 152. In this example,index generator 114 generatescontent identifier 130 by parsing contents of formatteditem 160. - Using parsed contents of formatted
item 160,index generator 114 determines keywords, attributes, etc. ofitem 116 ofprivate content 152.Content identifier 130 may also include reference information. Generally, reference information includes information specifying a location of an item, including, e.g., a uniform resource location (URL) or other network location. In the example ofFIG. 1 , reference information includes information specifying a location ofsources - In another example, reference information may be linked to
index item 128 and stored in a separate repository (not shown).Content identifier 130 promotes a searching ofprivate content index 126 to determine whether an item ofprivate content 152 is relevant to searchquery 122, e.g., rather than searching the entire contents ofitem 116. In the example ofFIG. 1 ,search query 122 includes numerous types of search queries, including, e.g., search queries for images, search queries for documents, search queries for web sites, and search queries for other resources. - In an example,
items private content 152 include sensitive and/or confidential information (collectively referred to herein as confidential information, without limitation, for purposes of convenience). In an example,item 116 ofprivate content 152 includes confidential information. The confidential information is also included in formatteditem 160. When generatingcontent identifier 130 ofindex item 128,index generator 114 includes at least a portion of the confidential information incontent identifier 130. - In this example, to promote secure storage of the confidential information in
index item 128,index generator 114 encryptscontent identifier 130 using an encryption key, namely,key 142. Prior to includingindex item 128 in a search,search engine 115 determines that a user requesting the search has access to confidential information incontent identifier 130, as described in further detail below. - In still another example, identifying
portion 130 ofindex item 128 may be associated with a wrapped key (not shown). Generally, a wrapped key includes an encrypted key. To unwrap (e.g., decrypt) the wrapped key,server 102 sends the wrapped key to another security system (not shown). The security system sends toserver 102 the unwrapped key, which is used bysearch engine 115 to decryptcontent identifier 130. - In an example,
index generator 114 also generatespublic content index 134 forpublic content 150, including, e.g., publically accessible web pages, publically accessible websites, publically accessible documents, and other publically accessible information.Index generator 114 generatespublic content index 134, for example, by crawling the World Wide Web and indexing web pages, as is commonly known in the art. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,system 100 also includesclient device 104. Usingclient device 104, a user (not shown) submitssearch query 122 toserver 102. In this example,search query 122 includes one or more search terms. -
Search engine 115 receivessearch query 122. In the example ofFIG. 1 ,search engine 115 searches bothprivate content 152 andpublic content 150. Using contents ofsearch query 122,search engine 115 determines whichitems private content 152 the user has permission to access. - In this example,
search query 122 includes user information specifying an identity for the user submittingsearch query 122. In an example, the user information is stored in a cookie that is submitted with and/or included insearch query 122. A cookie includes a type of message that is given to a Web browser by a Web server. A cookie is used by the Web server to identify users. In the example ofFIG. 1 ,server 102 may include a Web server. - In an example, a user of
client device 104 accesses a Web site that includes a Web page for submission ofsearch query 122. In this example, the Web site uses cookies. Prior to submission ofsearch query 122, the Web site includes another Web page that prompts the user to fill out a form with user information, including, e.g., name information, e-mail address information, and so forth.Server 102 receives the user information and packages the user information into a cookie.Server 102 sends the cookie to a Web browser running onclient device 104.Client device 104 stores the cookie for later use, e.g., when the user submitssearch query 122. - When the user access the Web site to submit
search query 122, the browser running onclient device 104 sends the cookie to theserver 102. Using the user information in the cookie,server 102 determines an identity of the user. - Using the user information,
search engine 115 determines private content that is accessible to the user. In an example,search engine 115 scans ACLs of the index items inprivate content index 126 to determine which ofitems private content 152 are accessible to the user submittingsearch query 122. Rather than searching the index items inprivate content index 126,search engine 115 may be configured to only search index items indexing private content that is accessible to the user. - In an example of
FIG. 1 ,search engine 115 determines whether the user submittingsearch query 122 has access toitem 116 ofprivate content 152. In this example,search engine 115 compares the user information insearch query 122 to information inACL 132. If the user information insearch query 122 matches information inACL 132,search engine 115 determines that the user has access toitem 116 ofprivate content 152.Search engine 115 retrieves key 142 fromprivate content index 126 and uses key 142 to decrypt confidential information incontent identifier 130. In this example,search engine 115 searches the decrypted confidential information included incontent identifier 130. - In another example,
search engine 115 determines that the user does not have access toitem 116 ofprivate content 152. In this example,search engine 115 does not includeindex item 128 in its search ofprivate content repository 126. - Following a determination that the user has access to
item 116 ofprivate content 152,search engine 115 determines a relevancy ofitem 116 ofprivate content 152 to searchquery 122. In this example,search engine 115 determines a relevance score foritem 116 ofprivate content 152 usingcontent identifier 130 and search terms included insearch query 122. Generally, a relevance score includes a measure of importance of an item of information to a particular item of information, e.g., relative to relevance of other items of information to the particular item of information. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,search engine 115 identifiesitems private content 152 as relevant to searchquery 122.Search engine 115 generates search results foritems private content 152. Generally, a search result includes information describing the contents of an item of information and a reference to a location of the item of information. Generally, a reference includes a link and/or a pointer from one item of information to another item of information. -
Search engine 115 also searchespublic content index 134 for items ofpublic content 150 that may be relevant to searchquery 122. For items of public content identified as relevant to searchquery 122,search engine 115 also generates search results for the items ofpublic content 150. -
Search engine 115 generatessearch results 124 by combining search results foritems private content 152 with the search results for items ofpublic content 150 that are relevant to searchquery 122. In an example,search engine 115 rankssearch results 124 in accordance with relevance ofsearch results 124 to searchquery 122. -
Search engine 115 sendssearch results 124 toclient device 104. - In example, a user of
client device 104 selects a search result to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152.. In this example, upon selection of the search result,client device 104 sends a request (not shown) to viewitem 116 of private content to source 148, e.g., using the reference included in the search result. The request includes user information, e.g., specifying a user name and/or other information that identifies the user submitting the request. - To promote secure access to confidential information in
item 116 ofprivate content 152,search engine 115 may be configured to intercept the request to again verify that the user has access toitem 116 ofprivate content 152. In an example,search engine 115 sendsprivate content index 126 the request to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152 and the user information. Using the user information,search engine 115 determines whether the user has access to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152, for example based on information inACL 132, as described above. Ifsearch engine 115 determines that the user has access toitem 116 ofprivate content 152,search engine 115 passes the request foritem 116 ofprivate content 152 tosource 148. In response,source 148 sendsitem 116 toclient device 104 for display onclient device 104. - In a variation of
FIG. 1 ,index generator 114 may generate a single index for indexingprivate content 152 andpublic content 150, e.g., rather than generating separate indexes, namely,private content index 126 andpublic content index 134. - In still another variation of
FIG. 1 ,index generator 114 may generate individual private and public content indexes for users ofsystem 100, e.g., rather than generating private andpublic content indexes private content 152 andpublic content 150. In an example,index generator 114 generates an index (not shown) indexing items of private content that are accessible to a particular user. In this example,index generator 114 also generates another, different index (not shown) indexing items of public content that are also accessible to the particular user. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of example components ofsystem 100 for searchingprivate content 152 andpublic content 150. In the example ofFIG. 2 , formattedprivate content 112, formatteditems index item 128,content identifier 130,ACL 132, andpublic content 150 are not shown. -
Client device 104 can be a computing device capable of taking input from a user and communicating over a network (not shown) withserver 102 and/or with other client devices. For example,client device 104 can be a computer, e.g.,, a desktop computer, a laptop, a mobile phone (e.g., a smartphone), a personal digital assistant (“PDA”), a server, an embedded computing system, and the like. Although asingle client device 104 is shown inFIGS. 1 and 2 ,system 100 can include a plurality of client devices, which can be geographically dispersed. -
Server 102 can be a of a variety of computing devices capable of receiving information and running one or more services, which can be accessed byclient device 104. In an example,server 102 can include a server, a distributed computing system, a desktop computer, a laptop, a cell phone, a rack-mounted server, and the like.Server 102 can be a single server or a group of servers that are at a same location or at different locations.Client device 104 andserver 102 can run programs having a client-server relationship to each other. Although distinct modules are shown in the figures, in some examples, client and server programs can run on the same device. -
Server 102 can receive information fromclient device 104 and fromsources interface 200. I/O interface 200 can be a type of interface capable of receiving information over a network, including, e.g., an Ethernet interface, a wireless networking interface, a fiber-optic networking interface, a modern, and the like.Server 102 also includes aprocessing device 202 andmemory 204. A bus system 206, including, for example, a data bus and a motherboard, can be used to establish and to control data communication between the components ofserver 102. -
Processing device 202 can include one or more microprocessors. Generally,processing device 202 can include an appropriate processor and/or logic that is capable of receiving and storing data, and of communicating over a network (not shown).Memory 204 can include a hard drive and a random access memory storage device, including, e.g., a dynamic random access memory, or other types of non-transitory machine-readable storage devices. As shown inFIG. 2 ,memory 204 stores computer programs that are executable by processingdevice 202. These computer programs includeindex generator 114,search engine 115, andprivate content collector 106. In an example,index generator 114 and/orprivate content collector 106 may be included as components ofsearch engine 115. - In an example,
private content collector 106 is configured to retrieveitems private content 152 fromsources system 100. In this example, a user may input intoclient device 104 source information (not shown), namely,information identifying sources private content 152.Client device 104 sends the source information toserver 102.Private content collector 106 uses the source information in identifyingsources private content 152 and in collectingitems private content 152 fromsources - In this example, the user also inputs into
client device 104 account information to access the user's accounts withsources Client device 104 sends the account information toserver 102.Server 102 stores the account information inaccount information repository 110.Server 102 also tags the account information with information specifying the source associated with the account information. - In an example,
search engine 115 is configured to add restrictions to searchquery 122, e.g., to promote searching of index items that include information that is accessible to a user submitting the search.Search engine 115 adds restrictions specifying thatonly items private content 152 that are accessible to the user are searched. In this example, using the restrictions added tosearch query 122,search engine 115 determines which ofitems private content 152 are accessible to the user.Search engine 115 may determine which ofitems private content 152 are accessible to the user by comparing the user information insearch request 122 to the ACLs included in the index items, e.g.,ACL 132 inindex item 128. As previously described,search engine 115 searches the index items corresponding to items ofprivate content 152 that are accessible to the user. - In an example, a user may change permission settings on
items private content 152, e.g., by changing identities of other users authorized to accessitems private content 152, by changing the type of permission granted to other users foritems private content 152, and so forth. - In an example,
item 116 ofprivate content 152 includes a private photograph andsource 148 is a photograph hosting service. In this example,item 116 ofprivate content 152 is uploaded to source 148 by a user. During uploading, the user specifies names of other users that may viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152. As previously described,item 116 ofprivate content 152 includes (and/or is associated with) user information specifying names of users authorized to accessitem 116 ofprivate content 152. As part of the indexing process,index generator 114 includes the names of these users inACL 132. - In this example, the user that uploaded
item 116 ofprivate content 152 to source 148 changes the identities of the other users that are authorized to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152, e.g., by granting additional users access toview item 116 ofprivate content 152, by removing access for users to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152, by changing types of permission associated with users authorized to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152, and so forth. In this example, the user that uploadeditem 116 ofprivate content 152 may change the type of permission of other users by changing whether another user has access to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152, has access to edititem 116 ofprivate content 152, has access to shareitem 116 ofprivate content 152 with other users, and so forth. - In an example, when
source 148 detects a change in the permissions foritem 116 ofprivate content 152,source 148 sends to private content collector 106 a notification (not shown) of the change. In response,private content collector 106 sends the notification toindex generator 114, which uses the notification to updateACL 132 inindex item 128. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart showing process 300 for indexingitems private content 152. In operation,private content collector 106 crawls (302)sources private content collector 106 receives (304)items private content 152. By formatting contents ofitems private content 152,private content collector 106 generates (306) formatteditems Index generator 114 parses (not shown) contents of formatteditems index item 128 withcontent identifier 130 and ACL 132 (FIG. 1 ). - Using key 142 (
FIG. 1 ),index generator 114 encrypts (310) confidential information incontent identifier 130.Index generator 114 stores (312)index item 128, with encrypted confidential information stored incontent identifier 130, inprivate content index 142. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart showing process 400 for searchingprivate content 152 andpublic content 150. In operation,search engine 115 receives (402)search query 122. In response,search engine 115 adds (404) tosearch query 122 restrictions specifying thatsearch engine 115 only search for items ofprivate content 152 that are accessible to the user submittingsearch query 122.Search engine 115 also selects (406) user information included insearch query 122, as previously described. Based on the user information,search engine 115 determines (408) which ofitems private content 152 are accessible to the user. As previously described,search engine 116 may make this determination by comparing the user information to ACLs in index items stored inprivate content index 126, e.g.,ACL 132 inindex 128. - In the example of
FIG. 4 ,search engine 115 searches (410)private content 152 accessible to the user andpublic content 150 for items that are relevant to searchquery 122. In an example,search engine 115 determines thatitem 116 ofprivate content 152 is accessible to the user. Prior to searchingcontent identifier 130 ofindex item 128,search engine 128 uses key 142 to decrypt the encrypted confidential information incontent identifier 130. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing process 500 for generating search results 124. In operation,search engine 115 determines (502) items of private content and items of public content that are relevant to searchquery 122. In this example,search engine 115 determines whetheritem 116 ofprivate content 152 is relevant to searchquery 122 by searchingcontent identifier 130 ofindex item 128 for terms and/or content that is relevant to searchquery 122. In an example,search engine 115 is configured to select items ofprivate content 152 and items ofpublic content 150 with increased relevancy to searchquery 122, e.g., relative to relevancy of other items ofprivate content 152 and other items ofpublic content 150 to searchquery 122. For example,search engine 115 may select items ofprivate content 152 andpublic content 150 with a relevancy score that exceeds a relevancy threshold. In other example,search engine 115 may select a predefined number items ofprivate content 152 andpublic content 150 with increased relevancy to searchquery 122, e.g., relative to relevancy of other items to searchquery 122. - In the example of
FIG. 5 ,search engine 115 generates (504)search results 124 for the determined items ofprivate content 150 andpublic content 150 that are relevant to searchquery 122.Search engine 115 ranks (506) search results 124, e.g., in accordance with a ranking formula.Search engine 115 sends (508)search results 124 toclient device 104. -
FIG. 6 showsgraphical user interface 600 for searchingprivate content 152 andpublic content 150.Graphical user interface 600 includessearch portion 602 for input of a search query, e.g., search query 122 (FIG. 1 ).Graphical user interface 600 also displays contents of search results 124. An example search result can include a Web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the Web page, and an identifier, including, e.g., a Unified Resource Location (URL) of the Web page. - In this example, search results 124 include
search result items Search result items public content 150. - In the example of
FIG. 6 ,search result item 610 includes a search result foritem 116 ofprivate content 152. In this example,item 116 ofprivate content 152 includes a forum page of a social networking website.Search result item 610 includesidentifier 618. In the example ofFIG. 6 ,identifier 618 includes link to a URL foritem 116 ofprivate content 152. -
Search result item 610 also includessnippet 616 that includes comments, posts, and other information included initem 116 ofprivate content 152 that is accessible to the user submittingsearch query 122. In an example,search engine 115 may generatesnippet 616 from information included in content identifier 130 (FIG. 1 ). In an example, contents ofsnippet 616 may change based on the type of permission that has been granted to the user viewing the search result item. - In the example of
FIG. 6 ,identifier 618 includes a reference to a location (e.g., a URL) foritem 116 ofprivate content 152 at source 148 (e.g., a posting on a social networking website). Selection of the URL sends a request to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152. As previously described,server 102 may be configured to intercept the request to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152 to confirm that the user still has access to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152. For example, permission for the user to view and/or to accessitem 116 ofprivate content 152 may have changed from whensearch result item 610 was displayed ingraphical user interface 600. Ifserver 102 determines that the user still has access to viewitem 116 ofprivate content 152,server 102 passes the request ontosource 148. -
Search result item 610 also includesidentifiers FIG. 1 ,identifier 619 is a reference to a webpage for an author ofitem 116 ofprivate content 152.Identifier 621 is a reference to a webpage of a user that has posted a comment toitem 116 ofprivate content 152. - In the example of
FIG. 6 , users of the social networking website may post comments and perform other actions onitem 116 ofprivate content 152. In this example, a user of the social networking website may endorseitem 116 ofprivate content 152 through selection ofidentifier 623. The user of the social networking website may also view comments to the posting represented byitem 116 ofprivate content 152 made by other users, e.g., through selection ofidentifier 625. - In an example,
search result item 610 also includesicon 620, specifying an access level for the user viewingsearch result item 610. Generally, an access level includes information specifying an amount and/or a type of permission that has been granted to an entity. In the example ofFIG. 6 ,icon 620 displays information specifying that the user viewingsearch result item 610 has limited access toitem 116 ofprivate content 152. - Using the techniques described herein, a system provides a user interface for searching of private content and public content. The system receives private content from numerous sources. The system indexes portions of the private content for searching by a search engine. The system also indexes portions of the public content for searching the by search engine. Additionally, the portions of the private content that include confidential information are encrypted to promote a storage of the confidential information.
