The requested metadata is received from the second source, and the requested resource is received from the first source. A first representation of the document based on the received metadata is provided for display. After providing the first representation, a second representation of the document that combines portions of the first representation with additional portions of the document is generated, and the second representation is provided for display.
Description
Technical field
This specification is generally described for accelerating the technology that document loads.
Background technology
Permitted eurypalynous electronic equipment and accessed webpage and other document by network (such as the Internet).Single document is permissible
Including the content from multiple resources.Such as, the URL of document can identify HTML (HTML) file, and should
Html file can quote add-on assemble, such as CSS, image, advertisement, other html file that to show in inline frame
And other assembly.Utilize user the useful view of time and the document of web browser request document shown time it
Between be usually present significantly delay.
Summary of the invention
In order to accelerate document presenting to user, equipment can be asked by network request document and also from another source
Metadata, the layout of such as document or formatted message.Metadata can allow for equipment rendering during document early stage
Determine the exact layout of document.
Usually, the process loading document involves the assembly finding document singly.When the assembly of document is by sequentially
During discovery, the discovery of each New Parent can be identified along with New Parent, prefetch and process and introduce additional delay.Real in many
In example, process assembly discloses and must prefetch and process other additional assemblies to complete to render document.Along with document
New Parent is found and is processed, and web browser can repeatedly change the shown view of document.To the element in document
Carrying out relocating and reset size (commonly referred to as " refluxing ") can be still same be retrieved and be processed at the assembly of document
Time to hinder in the way of user's consumption to displayed content, mobile content.
In order to reduce the delay when presenting document to user, can usually count during conventional resource discovering
Before calculation information, it is provided that indicate the metadata of layout, formatting or the out of Memory relevant with document.Attempt at client device
Before loading document, calculating system can be analyzed the document and can speed up the metadata presented of document with identification or generation.
Such as, calculating system is capable of identify that and extracts the part rendering the various Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) needed for document.Such as, calculate
System can also determine that element in document is after document is fully rendered and script in document is explained
Final size and location.The part of the CSS file identified and the size and location of element can be stored as and document pair
The metadata answered, and can be provided in response to the request equipment of client.Because the layout of document change not as page
The text in face, image or other content are the most frequent, even if so after content provider changes the content of the page, and metadata
The accurate information relevant with the layout of document also will be usually provided.
When client device navigates to document, the web browser of this client device can pass through network request document.
Web browser can also ask the metadata presented for accelerating document individually.Such as, web browser can be to unit's number
Sending request according to service, wherein said request includes the URL (URL) of the document being loaded.Metadata takes

Detailed description of the invention
Fig. 1 is the block diagram illustrating the example for accelerating the system 100 that document loads.System 100 includes client device
110, first system the 120, second calculating system 130 and network 118 is calculated.The figure shows the stage of the flowing of data in graph form
(A) to (E), and illustrate stage (E) and (F) of the user interface gone out shown on client device 110.
In this example, user 102 loads document in the web browser of client device 110.Web browser is from meter
Calculation system 120 asks document.Before receiving document, web browser also is used for accelerating adding of document from calculating system 130 request
The data carried, are commonly called metadata or accelerate data.Web browser uses the content of document and the first number being independently provided
According to promptly to provide the view of document to user 102.In some implementations, the metadata asked allows web browser to exist
Reduce during display document or avoid backflow.The metadata asked can also allow for web browser and first provides having a mind to of document
Justice view (such as, have and format accurately and layout), web browser can be again by the content of individual processing document subsequently
There is provided.
Such as, client device 110 can be desktop computer, laptop computer, cell phone, smart phone,
Tablet PC, music player, E-book reader, navigation system or miscellaneous equipment.Every by calculate in system 120,130
One performed function can be performed by independent computer system or can be distributed across multiple computer systems.Network
118 can be wired or wireless or a combination of both, and can include private network and/or common network, the most mutually
Networking.
Many webpages and other document include across the content that multiple files spread.The URL of document can correspond to the first literary composition
Part, such as html file.Html file can quote the one or more built-in modules that must be downloaded document.Example
As, the example of built-in module include font, script file, CSS file, image, web application, media file and other
Html file.
As used herein, " document " or " webpage " typically refers to form together the set of the resource of whole document,
And it is not limited to the single file of such as html file.Such as, corresponding with URL " www.example.com " webpage can wrap
Include html file " www.example.com/index.html " and such as CSS file " www.example.com/
Main.css ", image file " www.example.com/image.jpg ", font file " www.example.com/
Font.woff " assembly, and other resource cited in the html file or other assembly of document.The embedding of webpage
Formula assembly is when being retrieved from single URL often as single file, it is common that fully renders or shows webpage
Required, and automatically retrieved and process the part as the process loading webpage by web browser.
When web browser loads webpage, web browser gradually finds to render the resource needed for this webpage.Such as, when
When web browser processes html file, web browser may determine that and also needs to some CSS file, font file and other resource
Render webpage.Web browser identification also retrieves these additional resources, and described additional resource can point to for web-browsing
Device is retrieved to complete the more resource of the page.
Such as, webpage can include the html file quoting a CSS file, and the 2nd CSS quoted by a described CSS file
File, the 3rd CSS file quoted by described 2nd CSS file.Generally, web browser determines that only html file at webpage is connect
A CSS file is just needed after receiving and processing.Then, exist when web browser is retrieved and processes a CSS file and prolong
Late.According to the content of a CSS file, web browser determines that the 2nd CSS file is needs, and when web browser is retrieved
And when processing the 2nd CSS file, there is another delay.According to the content of the 2nd CSS file, web browser determines the 3rd CSS literary composition
Part is needs, and there is the 3rd delay when the 3rd CSS file is retrieved and processed to web browser.This loading procedure leads
Relate to and sequentially load and process four different files, and when another file is processed, the backflow of webpage can change
The layout provided to be shown to user.
In order to avoid resource discovering and the delay that is associated of loading with order, can in render process early stage by wash with watercolours
Some in information needed for dye webpage provide as metadata.Such as, when the html file of web browser requested webpage
Time, web browser can also be from the metadata helping speed up the Metadata Service requested webpage that the page loads.Even if it is clear at web
Before device of looking at determines that CSS file needs, Metadata Service also is able to provide the content of multiple CSS file.As a result, web is worked as
When browser processes html file, web browser can utilize the information in metadata being supplied at the beginning of the webpage of user
Layout and formatting accurately are provided in the case of beginning view.
In some implementations, equipment is from the resource of the first source request document.Equipment please from second source different from the first source
Seek the metadata of document.The metadata of the document that equipment is asked from the second source reception, and asked from the first source reception
The resource of document.Equipment provides and represents for display based on to first of the document from the metadata received by the second source.
After the first expression providing document, the extention by the first part represented and document of equipment generation document combines
Second represents, and provides the second expression for display.
In the example of fig. 1, in the stage (A), user uses the web browser of client device 110 to navigate to net
Page.Such as, user can be with the URL of typing webpage or mutual with to linking of webpage.
In the stage (B), the web browser of client device 110 sends content (such as, the reality of document to webpage
One or more in resource) request 112.Request 112 is sent to calculating system 120, described calculating system by web browser
120 is the server of trustship webpage.Calculating system 120 can be operated by creating or distributing the content provider of webpage, or
Person is by content delivery network or represents content provider and provides other entity of webpage to operate.Such as, request 112 can be to use
In HTTP " get " request retrieving the resource (such as, the main html file of webpage) corresponding with the URL of webpage.
In the stage (C), the web browser of client device 110 sends the data to the loading for accelerating webpage
Request.Request 114 separates from request 112 and can be sent to and provide the clothes that the server of webpage, territory or system are different
Business device, territory or system.Such as, web browser can ask metadata from the Metadata Service provided by calculating system 130,
Described Metadata Service can be provided by the third party independent of content provider and computer system 120.Request 114 identification
The webpage that client device 110 is loading, this allows Metadata Service to provide the metadata specific to the webpage being just loaded.
Such as, request 114 may indicate that the URL of webpage.
Web browser can send the request to metadata before the html file receiving webpage or other resource any
114.Metadata Service can independent (such as, cited in not having html file or in other assembly of webpage spy
In the case of determining the identification of resource) identification based on webpage provides metadata.As a result, it is possible at roughly the same time parallel
Send request 112,114.In some implementations, web browser is configured to when new document is loaded just send unit's number
According to request automatically to strengthen loading procedure.Such as, when new document is loaded, web browser can be in known bits
The Metadata Service (such as, " www.example.com/metadata_service ") putting place sends request, and requested page
The metadata in face.
Calculating system 130 upon receipt of request 114, determines whether metadata can be used for the net asking to be identified in 114
Page.Calculating system 130 can have the access to data storage 135, and described data storage 135 includes in many different webpages
The metadata of each.As about Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 discussed further, it is possible to based on the analysis that webpage is rendered in advance
Select the metadata of webpage.Each through analyze the metadata selected by the page can by storage and be provided to after a while equipment with
Accelerated loading.Calculating system 130 can search in the data stored webpage URL and provide be specified for accelerate
Any metadata of the loading of webpage.
In the stage (D), client device 110 receives the metadata 132 of webpage from calculating system 130.Received
It is commonly called metadata, because received data can include about using for accelerating the data of the loading of webpage
Show the information of the mode of webpage, the size of the element of such as webpage, position and pattern.As discussed further below,
Metadata 132 can include the copy of the data of the resource from webpage.Metadata 132 can additionally or alternatively include leading to
Cross other data webpage being analyzed and generate.
In the stage (E), client device 110 receives one or more resources of webpage from calculating system 120, such as
Html file 122.Because request 112,114 is to send in the roughly the same time, so receiving in the roughly the same time
To metadata 132 and html file 122.When web browser process html file 122 time, about page layout format information with
And from the information Already in metadata 132 of built-in module.By this way, from built-in module (such as,
CSS file, script file, font etc.) information even find those assemblies are quoted and determines this letter in web browser
Breath be need before also be able to be present at client device 110.
Received metadata 132 may be configured to the various types of letters accelerating that webpage is presented to user 102
Any in breath.In some implementations, metadata 132 indicates page layout format or formatting.Metadata 132 can include and net
Page previously render relevant information.In some implementations, metadata 132 include with the node in the dom tree of webpage and with
The information that pattern that these nodes are corresponding is relevant.In some implementations, metadata 132 describes file design or the page knot of webpage
The characteristic of structure.In some implementations, metadata 132 includes the not displayable content from webpage, and gets rid of showing of webpage
Show content.Such as, in some implementations, metadata 132 can include from except the image specified to be shown to user and
Any data of the resource of the webpage beyond text.
In some implementations, metadata 132 includes that the built-in module from webpage is (such as, in one or more assemblies
Part or all) data.Such as, as discussed further below, metadata 132 can include one of webpage or
The copy of the data in the specific part of multiple CSS files or described CSS file.In some implementations, metadata 132 instruction is wanted
The list of the assembly downloaded, and without including the data from those assemblies.Such as, needed for metadata can identify and render webpage
CSS resource, to accelerate identification and the retrieval of required component.In some implementations, metadata 132 includes from some of webpage
The data of assembly, and only identify other assembly.
Some in metadata 132 may indicate that the layout completely rendered or the formatting of webpage.Such as, metadata 132
May indicate that image shown in the view of webpage and the position of other element and size.Metadata 132 may indicate that by
Another equipment (such as, the equipment in addition to client device 110) is according to element determined by previously the rendering completely of webpage
Final size and location.Such as, indicated size and location can be when element Javascript code in webpage or
Other script has been performed the size and location of this element when occurring afterwards.As a result, in metadata 132, adjustment is reflected
The effect of the script of page layout format.
In conventional loading procedure, when web browser firstly generates page layout format, web browser is not generally known
The final layout of the road page.Such as, perhaps web browser can not accurately determine the final size of the image in webpage.Clear
First device of looking at can estimate the size of image, but may must be found along with additional resource and process and change the big of image
Little or position.But, by providing the final size of image and other element, the initial wash with watercolours of web browser in metadata 132
Dye can be accurately placed and adjust the size of image along with it occurs in final rendering, and it can be avoided that backflow.
Metadata 132 can include the part of script file or the script being embedded in webpage.Additionally, or as replacing
Choosing, metadata can include the information relevant on the impact of the layout of the page with script, enabling in actual download and perform
The suitable feature of layout is just included before script.
Metadata 132 can include the pattern data from the CSS file being embedded in webpage.In some implementations, unit
Data 132 include the whole set of the data in the CSS file quoted by webpage.Can combine or inline multiple CSS file
To improve efficiency.In some implementations, metadata 132 only includes the part of the CSS file selected in document, and omits not
It it is the part rendering the actually required CSS file of webpage.Such as, the various CSS files cited in webpage can reach by sum
The data of 50 kilobytes.The data that may actually need only 20 kilobytes fully render webpage.Such as, if at webpage
In there is not certain types of element, then can omit the style information relevant with this certain types of element.Metadata 132 can
To include that the suitable subset (20 the most required kilobytes) of CSS data is to limit the amount of the data transmitted.
Metadata 132 can be included in the customization font used in webpage.Metadata 132 can include the word used
The list of body file and the URL of those fonts rather than include font, to allow the web browser will be generally in web browser
Determine font be need before retrieve font.
In some implementations, metadata 132 indicates the position of " fold line " of webpage.The position of fold line can represent pin
Visible part to the page of given screen size.Generally, fold line refers to show wherein the edge of the viewing area of resource
Or border, such as the bottom margin of the viewing area of webpage.When showing document in the web browser, the document is usual
Extend beyond web browser initially checks region, and user generally has to roll in document or otherwise lead
Boat, to be presented in viewing area the content initially not presented.Document initially can be in the browser on the display of user
The part checked is referred to as the fold line upper area of document.Such as, rolled before representing additional content user, fold line
Upper area can be the part of the document after resource is rendered and shows shown in viewing area.Generally can lead to
Cross the remainder of resource being scrolled down to represent in browser and be referred to as the fold line lower zone of document.
In some implementations, which image is metadata 132 indicate be visible for given screen size.Metadata
132 may indicate that the multiple different set of visible image under the different size of screen or viewing area.Web browser can
To use the information relevant with the fold line of webpage and visual picture that the process of the part of webpage is carried out prioritization.
For example, it is possible to before represented their other parts of webpage seen from not becoming by rolling until user, place
Reason part of visible webpage in fold line upper area.
Metadata 132 can get rid of the checked content of webpage.Such as, the text in webpage, image and other is visible
Element is excluded from metadata 132, and is not provided by calculating system 130.Such as, do not include will be to the reality shown in user
In the case of the text of border, metadata 132 may indicate that the font and style of text and wherein by the region of display text
Position and size.Similarly, metadata 132 can indicate that image size and location in the layout of the page, and does not includes
Image itself.
In some implementations, metadata 132 can include the checked content of webpage.Such as, metadata 132 can include
Image from webpage.Metadata 132 can include the real image of document, or can include for regarding document early stage
The image of the low resolution used in figure or compression image.In some instances, it is provided that by the most visible image
All or less than.Such as, image that the subset of the image provided can include being positioned at the central area of document and/or at least
The image of minimal size, and other image of document can be got rid of.In some implementations, metadata includes for display at literary composition
In the fold line upper area of shelves (such as, before being rolled by user in the top section of visible document or initial views)
Image, and get rid of for the image of display in the fold line lower zone (part such as, represented by rolling) of document.
Other standard of the image provided in the metadata for selection can be provided.In some implementations, it is provided that webpage
Any part accelerates the loading to the page.
In the stage (F), the web browser of client device 110 uses metadata 132 to provide the view of webpage, as
Shown in user interface 150.Web browser is configured such that the layout engine of web browser is according to the letter in metadata 132
Breath creates the view of the page.Metadata 132 can allow for web browser and more quickly provides net than by individually analysis webpage
The view of page.Additionally, the initial views of webpage can include than the layout being initially provided of in the case of not having metadata more
Layout accurately.
The view that web browser provides can include formatting or arranging as indicated in metadata 132
The part of content of webpage.Such as, the html file of webpage can include the text for being shown to user 102, and
The text can be illustrated with by pattern defined in the CSS in metadata 132.As a result, initial views may be based solely on by ratio
The view of html file is more accurate, and can find and retrieve institute than CSS resource cited in webpage
View is provided in few time time needed.The character font data being included in metadata 132 can also be used to show text.
It is likewise possible to be shown image and other element of webpage by the size and location indicated by metadata 132.
In some implementations, web browser can before treatment or receive the html file of webpage or other in
The view of webpage based on metadata 132 is provided before appearance.Such as, if earlier receiving unit's number than the html file of webpage
According to 132, then web browser can be based entirely on the generation initial views of metadata 132.Such as, initial views can include root
The image from metadata 132 formatted according to the CSS information in metadata and/or layout information and from metadata
The title of the webpage of 132 or other parts.
If the content of image or other element is unavailable when web browser provides the initial views of webpage, then web is clear
Device of looking at may be inserted into placeholder or otherwise retains the space that element will occupy.After having retrieved element, can
Web browser is inserted in the space specified by being retained.Because the final size and location of element is at initial cloth
Office is known when being generated, it is possible to be inserted in webpage by element with correct size and location, and without replacement web
The content of page.
In some implementations, metadata 132 indicates web browser to postpone and calls Javascript or other script, until
Till after using the information in metadata 132 to present the initial views of webpage.As a result, it is possible to provide webpage without delay
View be used for processing Javascript or other script.
Generally, Javascript content does not make more content visible be added to the view of webpage.In many instances,
The major part of webpage can be shown in the case of need not processing Javascript content.But, in other example,
Javascript or other content that can call may affect the content being shown to user.Such as, Javascript code is permissible
Adjust position or the size of element shown in webpage.As another example, when Javascript code is interrupted by browser
Time, it is the DOM Document Object Model (DOM) that webpage builds that element can be inserted into web browser by described Javascript code
In.The insertion of element can make other element (element inserted below element being such as positioned in dom tree) change webpage
Position in layout.
When web browser postpones the process to Javascript content, web browser remains able to use metadata
Element is laid out by 132 with size and location accurately.Metadata 132 can indicate that and sent out at all scripts and element
Now with process after the characteristic of final layout of webpage.Already allowed for by Javascript or in other can call by use
Layout character indicated in the metadata 132 of any change caused by appearance, web browser can be in Javascript content
It is processed and generates layout accurately before.As a result, when the i.e. convenient Javascript content affecting page layout is not yet processed,
Web browser also is able to provide the view with exact layout.
While user interface 150 is shown, web browser continues on for loading the resource discovery procedure of webpage.Net
The same way being processed normally is identified in the case of metadata 132 is disabled by each assembly of page with resource, quilt
Retrieval is and then the most processed.Can be by calculating system 120 or other system, by identical URL request specified in webpage
With these assemblies of reception.Being found along with new resources and retrieve, web browser makes at the beginning of the content that recently retrieves and webpage
Beginning view mixes.In user interface 150, viewing area 151a, 152b are arranged on and may not yet receive displayable content
Element side.When user interface 150 is displayed first, web browser may still undiscovered resources, or may wait
Treat that the transmission of resource completes.Because the metadata of webpage 132 indicates the size and location of these elements, so retaining in layout
Space so that described element can be later inserted in the case of need not changing page layout format.
In some implementations, resource (such as, the data Already in client device being included in metadata 132
Resource at 110) also after receiving metadata 132, during resource discovery procedure, it is downloaded to client device by independent underground
110.Such as, even if metadata 132 includes the data in the CSS file of webpage, web browser can continue to find, retrieve
And locate the original CSS file that reason content publisher is provided.By processing the source material as directly received from publisher,
Web browser can verify the correctness of the layout being generated.Difference quilt between source material and the metadata 132 of webpage
Resolve and be conducive to source material.Such as, if CSS file indicates an aspect and the indication in metadata 132 of page layout format
The difference shown, then web browser updates view what to have in reflection CSS file.The metadata of webpage generally change the most frequently
Numerous.But, the real resource of webpage will be the most current, and in some instances, metadata 132 may not include unit's number
According to nearest change.Complete to be able to verify that the resource discovery procedure of correctness is able to ensure that any nearest change to webpage is by
It is incorporated in eventually in the view presenting to user 102.
In some implementations, the document that the most individually download is included in metadata 132 during resource discovery procedure
Part.Such as, when metadata 132 includes the part of the resource of webpage or these resources, web browser can use metadata
Information in 132, and need not additionally download resource from the server of trustship webpage.Such as, web browser may determine that unit's number
Include, according to 132, the part that shows the CSS file needed for webpage, and as a result, it is possible to determine not indicated from html file
URL downloads CSS file.Metadata 132 may indicate which resource or part or resource are included in metadata 132, to permit
Permitted web browser and determined which resource carries perhaps without by independent underground.
When client device 110 receives and process the additional resource of webpage, client device 100 can provide net
The renewal of the view of page.View can be made multiple increasing resource discovery procedure is ongoing by page layout format engine simultaneously
Amount updates.The additional content of webpage is combined by these renewals with the view in user interface 150.Each renewal can provide
The more full view of webpage.Can add new content, and some elements (placeholder in such as user interface 150) can be by
The actual content of webpage is replaced.By the renewal of this series, user 102 can experience the webpage from user interface 150
Initial or preliminary view is to the seamless transitions of the complete the most finally view of webpage.The use of metadata 132 allows web browser to be just
The final layout that the auto-building html files of beginning view is correct.As a result, make additional content merge or mix to involve to place the content at just
In beginning layout, and page loading procedure can be completed in the case of there is no the backflow of layout of the page or change.
In the stage (G), the web browser of client device 110 find and process in the assembly of webpage all it
After, it is provided that as the user interface 160 being finally completed view of webpage.When providing user interface 150, disabled element is
It is inserted in view.Such as, viewing area 151a, the 152a retained for the most disabled element is by the reality of the page
Hold 151b, 152b (text, image or other content such as, can be shown) to be replaced.Javascript in document and other
Script or instruction are the most called.In the initial views of webpage, (such as click processes example to some user interaction process programs
Journey) it is activated at Javascript or being likely not to have when calling and be postponed of other code.But, along with resource discovery procedure continues
Continue and carry out, process Javascript and add interaction handler and other function aspects of webpage.
It is said that in general, the loading using metadata 132 to accelerate webpage does not require to make the real resource of composition webpage
Any change.Different from the document compression that document rewrites, the example of Fig. 1 involves the original unmodified content of webpage and integrally arrives visitor
The transmission of family end equipment 110.Metadata 132 be as except the webpage provided by content publisher do not change content in addition to benefit
The information of filling provides.Metadata 132 can be only relied on to provide the early stage view of webpage, until web browser has the time to examine
Rope till processing webpage (original metadata provided by the source server of webpage is provided).When discovery procedure completes, carry
The view of the webpage of supply user can be based entirely on the source material of the webpage provided by content publisher.
Additionally, in the example of fig. 1, the original contents of webpage is that the source server (calculating system 120) from webpage receives
, and the flowing of data do not route by the Third party system of such as proxy server or content delivery network or passed
Pass.The flowing between client device 110 and source server of the data of webpage keeps complete, and former independent of webpage
Beginning content transport through single passage to provide metadata 132.As a result, it is possible to (such as, use super literary composition by secure connection
This transportation protocol safety (HTTPS) connects) webpage is sent to client device 110 from content publisher, and be still benefited
In the faster loading using these technology.
The metadata loaded for accelerating document can be generated by third party and provide, and any without include in document
Custom features or any amendment to document.Need not amendment or be adapted to webpage to utilize the technology of Fig. 1.As a result, it is possible to
Enable acceleration by becoming to provide metadata to be easily accomplished by third party's service configuration, and content publisher is not forced any
Limit.As discussed further about Fig. 8, in order to permit that particular webpage is loaded quickly, calculating system can be retrieved described
Webpage, analyzes this page and generates suitable metadata, and this metadata is stored in data storage 135, enabling
This metadata is supplied to miscellaneous equipment.
Fig. 2 A to Fig. 2 C is the example being shown in user interface 200,210,220 shown while loading document
Figure.The example illustrate and in the case of not utilizing any metadata, load document to accelerate by network in web browser
The page is supplied to the view of the document of user while loading.As a result, web browser relies on typical resource discovering mistake exclusively
Journey.
In fig. 2, web browser provides user interface 200 as the initial views of document.Such as, the content of document
A part is shown as the text 202 including in the html file of document.But, web browser not yet finds and processes document
CSS resource in all, and so be not to carry out formatted text according to the pattern defined for the text.Web-browsing
Device has identified the element being still necessary to be retrieved and add to the webpage of view, as by shown in placeholder 204.Receive up to now
To and the content of document that processes do not indicate these elements should be shown size and location in a document.Web browser is led to
Cross limited information can with in the case of estimate that the size and location of element generates layout.
In fig. 2b, web browser provides user interface 210 after finding and process the add-on assemble of document.User
Interface 210 is the more full view of document, but still includes the only a part of document.Title element 212, sidebar 214 and
Footer 216 is added.These add the backflow requiring the page, and such as, element relocating in the page adapts in layout
Change.Show that the region of text 202 has changed in size and shape and moved in document wherein.Layout
Change user can be made to feel uneasy will very may be used because user reads when the text 202 in user interface 200 changes at interface
The place read last time can be forgotten.
In fig. 2 c, web browser provides final as document of user interface 220 after completing resource discovery procedure
View.Along with the most shown element by mobile sizing of laying equal stress on, the change of layout and the process of script are drawn the most again
Play the backflow of the page.The most again change for the viewing area of text 202.Additionally, after processing the CSS content of document,
The text style of text 202 (such as, font size, color, emphatically, font and/or other format) change.In the phase of loading
Between to the layout of document and the change of formatting may be the most unexpected or distractive, and the cloth again to element
Putting can be with the restricted document serviceability to user, until the final full view (such as, user interface 220) of document is provided as
Only.
Fig. 3 A to Fig. 3 C is the figure being shown in the example loading the user interface 300,310,320 illustrated while document.
Shown in this example illustration Fig. 2 A to Fig. 2 C but when web browser uses the metadata being provided to accelerate page loading
The view of identical document during loading document.
In figure 3 a, web browser provides user interface 300 as the initial views of document.Web browser is from document
Source server receive at least some (such as, html file) in the content of document.Web browser connects the most individually
The metadata of the document provided by another source (such as, from third party) is provided.The layout of document content and formatting be based on
Carrying out determining with search file from source server the metadata that processes its resource discovery procedure and provide respectively.
Metadata can include the data extracted from document, such as CSS file or the part of the CSS file needed for rendering document.This
Outward, or as alternative, metadata can include according to final with the page determining the analysis formerly rendered of document
The information that layout is relevant.
Layout and formatted message in metadata are used to dispose and the content of formatted document, and such as html file refers to
Show the text 202 that be displayed to user.The size and shape of the element in metadata instruction document.It has been retrieved
Element (html file of such as document indicates the text 202 being shown) is placed on by the viewing area indicated by metadata
In territory.Even if metadata also indicates element in resource discovery procedure to be not yet found, other element is also disposed in document
In final layout.Retained in layout for the space of these other elements, the viewing area 304 being shown in broken lines refer to
Show.In some implementations, the viewing area 304 retained can include white space (such as, it is shown that the background color of document or
Background image).In some implementations, can include Placeholder elements to indicate to the user that content will be loaded in this region,
Or indicate the type of content to be loaded.
In figure 3b, web browser provides user interface 310 after finding and process the additional resource of document.Web is clear
Device of looking at has made found additional content (such as image file and other assembly) mix with the initial views in user interface 300
Close.Additional elements is added to document and replaces being arranged on the viewing area 304 retained on those element sides in layout.
Even if web browser has been found that and with the addition of new content, the layout of document the most not yet changes.Backflow does not haves, and text
202 are displayed in the same area of document as in user interface 300, and have identical the font and style.Just
User at the text 202 read in user interface 300 can while screen is updated to illustrate user interface 310 not
Read discontinuously.In some implementations, can be along with the additional content of document is mixed with initial views or subsequent view and carries
Multiple medial view for document.
In fig. 3 c, web browser provides final as document of user interface 320 after completing resource discovery procedure
Or full view.The whole of the viewing area 304 retained have been filled with they corresponding elements.Previous figures (such as, Yong Hujie
Face 300,310) in shown element be illustrated with identical size and location as previously.Because metadata allows web
Browser generates layout accurately in the initial views of the page, so the renewal to the page need not change layout, and keeps away
Exempt from backflow.Although initial views imperfect (such as, because some can show that element does not exists), but in supplementary metadata
Using of information allow shown element to be properly displayed.
User interface 320 can also merge the various sightless change to document.For example, it is possible to postpone right
The process of Javascript is to allow to provide user interface 300,310 by the minimum delay.User interaction process program or other merit
Can property may not to activate when user interface 300,310 is provided.To user interface 320 be provided time, in document
Javascript the most processed.As a result, when user interface 320 is provided user interaction process program or other functional can
Can be to activate in a document.Even if Javascript content describes each side of layout or formatting, the most also
Need not the change to layout, because the supplementary metadata being used for generating initial views (such as, user interface 300) has indicated
The characteristic of the final layout after the process of Javascript content.
User interface 320 is identical with user interface 220, because whole in the identical content of document in two examples
(the original CSS file that such as, content publisher provides, Javascript file etc.) be from identical URL retrieval and
Processed by web browser.But, in Fig. 3 A to Fig. 3 C, it is more accurate that metadata allows for the initial of document and medial view
Layout and formatting, so layout can keep consistent with formatting while the remainder of document is gradually added.
Fig. 4 is the figure of the example of the sequential being shown in event when loading document.In this example, web browser is in money
Retrieve and process the various resources of document during Feed Discovery process 402.Web browser is also retrieved in accelerator 404 and locates
Reason attaching metadata, promptly to provide the view with the document of layout accurately.The document being just loaded includes HTML literary composition
Part and be also to render three other assemblies needed for document in single resource.Such as, assembly can be CSS file,
Javascript file, image file and other media file, font file, html file or other type of resource.HTML
File refers to the first assembly, and the second assembly quoted by this first assembly, and the 3rd assembly quoted by this second assembly so that three assembly quilts
Sequentially find.
At time T0, web browser is such as by initiating to make the request of document to html file from the URL of document
Request.Receiving before html file, web browser to another server (such as third party's Metadata Service) make to
Request in the loading accelerating document.Can be before the request to document, in the time roughly the same with the request to document
Or after the request to document, make the request to metadata.Html file and metadata are transmitted parallel, and permissible
It is received in the roughly the same time.In some instances, such as, because metadata can include the number fewer than html file
According to so metadata can be received before html file, and can be by the server system optimized for efficiently transmitting
There is provided.
Web browser uses html file and metadata to generate at time T1The initial views of the document provided.Even if
In the case of need not be by use metadata retrieval three other resources processing document, web browser also be able to provide
The part being illustrated of document is by with correct layout and the view of formatting display.Metadata can include in three assemblies
One or more parts, thus allow web browser to make before real resource is retrieved in resource discovery procedure 402
By the data from assembly.Metadata also can indicate that the size and location of element and the out of Memory relevant with document.
After initial views is provided, resource discovery procedure 402 continues.The three of document are retrieved and processed to web browser
Each in individual add-on assemble, and respectively at time T3、T4And T5Complete to process these assemblies.At time T3、T4And T5In
Each at, web browser provides the renewal view of document so that additional content with previously provided in first layout and
View mixes.In the case of not utilizing metadata, after resource discovery procedure 402 terminates, the layout of document is until the time
T5Till just can terminate.But, by using accelerator 404 promptly to retrieve metadata, such as, initial for document
View, final layout is the most earlier generated.
Fig. 5 is the flow chart illustrating the example for accelerating the process 500 that document loads.Process 500 can be by the visitor of Fig. 1
Family end equipment 110 or another equipment perform.
Equipment is from the resource (502) of the first source request document.Such as, equipment can send the money at the URL of document
The HTTP GET request (such as, " GET http://example.com/HTTP/1.1... ") in source.Can lead in response to user
Boat sends this request to webpage (such as, by with link or other user interface element is mutual).
In asking second, equipment is from the metadata (504) of the second source request document different from the first source.Can respond
The second request is sent alternately in triggering the identical of the first request.Equipment in reception action (502) requested resource it
Front transmission second is asked, it is possible to transmit metadata and the resource of document concurrently or one after the other.Such as, to metadata
The URL just prefetched in action (502) by instruction is asked to identify the document being just loaded.
In some implementations, metadata is independently of what the publisher of document asked from third party.Can be from being configured to
The precalculated position or the server that there is provided the metadata of many different document from many different the Internet domain and content publisher please
Seek metadata.Such as, when document is loaded, equipment may be configured to one from the predetermined set in particular source or source
Request metadata.
Equipment can receive the metadata (506) of the document asked from the second source.Even if equipment is not yet identified or
Specifically requesting resource, received metadata can also include resource (such as, CSS file, the font literary composition from document
Part etc.) the copy of data.This can allow equipment to receive in document before identifying and retrieve the specific resources of composition document
The content of various resources.
Received metadata can include the data of the CSS file from document.Such as, received metadata
The entirety of one or more CSS file can be included, or can only include the data affecting in the CSS file rendered of document
Subset.Received metadata may indicate that layout and the formatted message of document, it may for example comprise the image of document and its
Its element size and location in the final rendering of document.Received metadata can include one or more font literary composition
The data of part, or the URL of the font file used in a document can be identified.Received metadata can identify document
Image or the URL of other element, thus allow web browser more quickly to ask these elements.
In some implementations, received metadata can include the image from document.Such as, metadata can be wrapped
Include the real image of document, or the lower resolution image for using in the early stage view of document or compression can be included
Image.In some implementations, when transmitted image file data in the metadata, only provide the most visible image.
In some instances, it is provided that by the most visible image all or less than.Such as, the subset of the image provided is permissible
Including being positioned at the image of the image of central area of document and/or at least minimal size, and can be got rid of document other
Image.In some implementations, metadata will be only used in display image in a document and is included in the fold line upper area of document
In (such as, before being rolled by user in the top section of visible document or initial views).Can use and want for selection
Other criterion at the image that metadata provides.
Equipment receives the resource (508) of the document asked from the first source.Such as, received resource can be document
Main html file (such as, " the http://example.com/ of document " http://example.com/ "
index.html”)。
Equipment provides the first expression of document for display (510) based on the metadata received from the second source.The
One expression can be the initial views of the document being supplied to user after user initiates the navigation of document.First represents permissible
Including formatting from the metadata received by using or the content of one or more resources of document of layout.
After the first expression providing document, equipment generates and the extention of the first part represented with document is carried out
Second expression (512) of the document of combination.Equipment provides the second expression for display (514).After the first expression is provided,
Equipment can continue to find and process the resource of document.Such as, second represents that can add comfortable first expression is provided it
Rear identification and/or the content of the document of additional resource received.Such as, new element can be inserted in the first expression, generation
For Placeholder elements or be inserted into element and in the space that retains.(size or weight can such as, be reset refluxing
New arrange) first represent shown in element in the case of the second expression is provided.When Javascript or the place of other content
When reason is postponed, equipment can process content.For example, it is possible to add user interaction process program to unit in the first expression
Element.
Such as, because received metadata indicates the correct layout of document, the can be maintained in representing second
One layout represented and formatting.The first expression that may be based only upon initial HTML file and metadata can change along with increment
And seamlessly strengthened, until complete document is illustrated.
Fig. 6 is the block diagram illustrating the example for accelerating the system 600 that document loads.System 600 includes client device
610, system 620 and network 618 are calculated.The figure shows the stage (A) of the flowing of data in graph form to (C), and be shown in visitor
The stage (D) of the user interface illustrated on family end equipment 610.
In the example of fig. 6, the metadata of the loading for accelerating document is the user 602 at client device 610
It is provided before playing the navigation of one or more document.Client device 610 reception includes the link of destination document
Quote document.Load the metadata of the loading quoting document transmission for accelerating destination document.When user with arrive destination document
When linking mutual, metadata (such as, relevant with the layout of destination document and formatting information) Already in client sets
At standby 610.As a result, client device 610 can need not from Metadata Service request metadata in the case of performance objective literary composition
The accelerated loading of shelves.
In the stage (A), client device 610 sends inquiry 612 to calculating system 620.In the stage (B), calculate system
The document that system 620 process inquiry and generation to provide in response to this inquiry.Inquiry can be supplied to search by calculating system 620
Index is held up and receives Search Results from this search engine, or otherwise obtains the information in response to inquiry.Such as, meter
Calculation system 620 can obtain the information identifying the set being identified as search result document associated with the query.Calculating system 620
Generate the document identifying search result document, such as search engine results page.
Calculating system 620 also accesses the data storage 625 comprised for accelerating the metadata that the page loads.Store from data
625, calculating system 620 identifies the one or more metadata in search result document, and this metadata is included in and searches
Index is held up in results page.In some implementations, calculating system 620 includes the metadata of the most top ranked search result document,
Or every in the most top ranked subset of search result document (such as, with first three or document corresponding to first five Search Results)
The metadata of one.In some implementations, calculating system 620 includes in the Search Results identified in search engine results page
The metadata of each or the Search Results identified available in data storage 625 of metadata in the first number of each
According to.
Metadata 632 can include for accelerate the page load type described herein data in arbitrary
Kind, it may for example comprise from search result document CSS file data, instruction search result document in element size and
The information of position, render resource needed for search result document from the data of font file of search result document, instruction
Data etc..
In the stage (C), calculating system 620 provides search engine results page 630, described search engine results page
630 metadata 632 being included in this search engine results page 630 the one or more search result documents identified.One
In a little realizations, metadata 632 is included in the file identical with search engine results page 630.Such as, search-engine results
The html file of the page 630 can include first number of CSS content and the layout information comprising one or more search result document
According to.
In some implementations, can be at one or more literary compositions separate with the html file of search engine results page 630
Metadata 632 provided in part.File can be indicated as search-engine results page as search engine results page
Resource or assembly needed for the loading in face 630 are embedded into.As a result, at client device 610, search engine results page is loaded
630 can make client device 610 retrieve the appended document comprising metadata 632 from calculating system 620 or another system.With
This mode, client device 610 can in advance cache search results document metadata as load search-engine results page
The part in face 630.
In the stage (D), client device 610 provides the user interface of the view including search engine results page 630
650.User interface 650 includes the link each the including corresponding search result document Search Results 652a as login page
To 652c.
When in user 602 with Search Results 652a to 652c is mutual, client device 610 asks searching of correspondence
Rope result document.Client device 610 also uses the metadata 632 of the Search Results of correspondence, and it is at search engine results page
It is sent to client device 610 during the loading of 630, formats accurately and the search knot of layout promptly to generate to have
The really expression of document.Along with resource discovery procedure continues, client device 610 updates the view of search result document, thus will
Its additional content mixes with the initial views using metadata 632 to generate.
In some implementations, calculating system 620 generate search engine results page 630 with include in response to Search Results
In 652a to 652c one is mutual and makes the requested interaction handler of metadata 632.Such as, it not automatically to download unit
Data 632 are as a part for loading search engine results page 630, but user and the friendship linked to search result document
The to search result document first request and both the second requests to suitable metadata 632 can be triggered mutually.
Fig. 7 is the flow chart illustrating the example for accelerating the process that document loads.Process 700 can be by the calculating of Fig. 7
System 620 or another calculating system perform.
Calculating system 620 receives user's input (702).Such as, calculating system 620 can receive the search submitted to by user
Inquiry.
Calculating system 620 obtains the data (704) of response user's input.Data identification to be quoted in response to user's input
Destination document.Such as, calculate system and receive the Search Results of each search result document that instruction is relevant to search inquiry.
Calculating system 620 identifies the metadata (706) of the loading for accelerating destination document.Such as, system 620 energy is calculated
Enough access data storage to identify the data that previously selected relevant with the layout of destination document and formatting.Metadata is designated
Corresponding for the URL with destination document.In some implementations, including multiple destination documents (the most multiple search result document)
Metadata.
Calculating system 620 generates and includes to the link of destination document and also include the document of metadata of destination document
(708).In some implementations, metadata can be a part (such as, in html file) for generated document.At some
In realization, at client device, load the document generated make the metadata of this client device searched targets document.Example
As, calculating system 620 can generate the search engine results page with the link to search result document.Including search engine
The resource of results page can include the one or more metadata in search result document.Alternative, search-engine results page
Face can include so that client device requests the script of the metadata receiving one or more result document or other instruction.
Calculating system 620 provides generated document (710) in response to user's input.Transmission or process are generated
Document can the metadata of transfer destination document.After loading the document generated, when client device navigates to target literary composition
During shelves, at the metadata Already in client device of the loading accelerating destination document.
Fig. 8 is the flow chart illustrating the example for accelerating the process that document loads.The example of Fig. 8 describes and is used for generating literary composition
The metadata of shelves and the technology of this metadata is provided then in response to the request to metadata.
Calculate system retrieval document (802).For instance, it is possible to be crawled webpage so that the data of webpage are obtained.Document energy
Enough obtained for index or other purpose as the part crawled.Calculating system can receive the assembly as document or
Person affects all resources of the display of document.
Calculating system renders document (804).For instance, it is possible to utilize layout engine (such as, the web browser of web browser
Engine or rendering engine) (such as Webkit or Gecko) render document.When rendering document, layout engine obtains and processes
All resources (including CSS file, Javascript file, font file) of document and affect document display all its
Its resource.Calculating system can be produced client device and will be produced by all embedded resources found and produce in document
Identical rendering result.Calculating equipment can use in the case of rendered content does not carry out any visual display
" without a head " pattern generates and renders.In some implementations, layout engine produces render tree and DOM Document Object Model (DOM) tree.
Calculating system use document render the metadata (806) extracting document.Calculating systematic analysis renders, such as,
Check dom tree, render tree and the final layout of document.The metadata extracted can include the layout of the page and formatting
Various characteristics.Such as, calculating system can apply that the collection of pre-defined rule is incompatible determines which element visible and institute in rendering
State the size and location of element.Because finally completely rendering analyzed, so layout character has reflected by the page
Javascript or the process of other instruction and any spatial layout feature of adding or adjusting.
Calculating system can also Walkthrough dom tree and render tree with which resource identifying document be actually used for affecting literary composition
The display of shelves.Additionally, calculating system can determine the display of which the some effects document in specific resources.Such as, system is calculated
System can determine that specific CSS file provides the pattern of document, but the subset of only defined pattern is by for use in virtually document
In.Calculating system includes the CSS data actually affecting the display of document in the metadata, and omission does not affect the aobvious of document
The CSS data shown.Data from the multiple different resource (such as, multiple CSS files, font file etc.) of document can be by
It is included in the metadata being extracted.Metadata can additionally or alternatively indicate the characteristic of dom tree, render tree.
Additionally, or as alternative, unit can be generated based on the data from other user previously having rendered document
Data.Such as, the characteristic rendered on one or more subscriber equipmenies rather than server system can be used to select unit
Data.Such as, formerly render and may indicate that where the fold line of the page is positioned at go the equipment of certain equipment or certain classification, which
Needed for image is displayed on above fold line, image and the size and location of other element, which CSS data render document
Or the out of Memory about document.
The metadata extracted generally gets rid of the visual elements of document.For example, it is possible to get rid of title and main text, but
The CSS data defining the pattern of text can be included.It is likewise possible to get rid of the real image of document, but can include referring to
The information of diagram picture size and location in layout.
Shown element in document changes ground frequently, but the master-plan of document changes the most frequent.As a result, retouch
The metadata of the formatting and layout of stating document is effective in may remain in the time more longer than showing element.Such as, webpage
Can be include the body region comprised including the text being updated continually.But, the text style of body region and size
With position can within a couple of days, a few weeks longer or several months consistent.Similarly, webpage can include image, although and included
Specific image can change frequently, but this webpage can as one man include the image (example with identical position and/or size
As, in 300 pixels take advantage of the upper right corner of 300 pixels).
Omit displayable content can also have the further advantage that.Such as, if document change and metadata are used to raw
Become the initial views of document, then layout and inaccurate in formatting may come compared to such as providing out-of-date image or text
Say and less take sb's mind off sth.Similarly, the layout of document and formatting are typically the most insensitive, and are probably as secure content
And provide.
The metadata (808) of the document that the storage of calculating system is extracted.Such as, calculating system can be by metadata and document
