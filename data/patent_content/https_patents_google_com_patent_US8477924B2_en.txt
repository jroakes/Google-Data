- the caller device 104 transmits at least one list of contacts and at least one list of index values to the communication server 102 .
- the list of contacts may include a contact list of the caller device 104 , a list of calls made to the caller device 104 , a list of calls made by the caller device 104 , a list of calls missed by the caller device 104 , and a customized list of contacts created by a user of the caller device 104 .
- each index value in the list of index values is associated with one or more contacts from the lists of contacts.
- each index value in the list of index values is associated with one or more contacts from the lists of contacts. For example, consider a scenario in which John's phone number is stored in a phone book of the caller device 104 and is assigned a speed-dial number (index value) ‘286’. John's phone number may also appear in the dialed call list and the received call list. In this embodiment, the speed-dial number ‘286’ can be associated with John's phone number in the phone book as well as in the dialed call list or the received call list.
- a separate list of index values corresponding to every list of contacts can be transmitted to the communication server 102 .
- each contact in a list of contacts is associated with an index value from the list of index values associated with the list of contacts. For example, if John's phone number appears in the phone book as well as in the dialed numbers list of the caller device 104 , then John's phone number may have different index values for different lists. John's phone number may have a speed-dial number ‘286’. The same number may have a different index value, for example, ‘25’, associated with it when it appears in the dialed call list.
- the lists of contacts and the lists of index values can be updated on the basis of any changes made to the lists at the caller device 104 after a predefined interval of time, for instance, after every hour. Further, the lists of contacts and the lists of index values can be updated as soon as the caller device 104 initiates a communication session with any other communication device in the communication network 100 . The contact list and the index value list can also be updated as soon as a new contact is added to the contact list of the caller device 104 . Additionally, the lists of contacts and the lists of index values can be updated with the help of out-of-band mechanisms such as Synchronization Markup Language (SyncML), which is a commonly used method to synchronize contact and calendar information.
- Synchronization Markup Language Synchronization Markup Language
- a first-stage communication is initiated between the caller device 104 and the communication server 102 based on an input received at the caller device 104 .
- the input received at the caller device 104 can be an activity at a user interface of the caller device 104 .
- Examples of the activity at the caller device 104 include, but are not limited to, the user of the caller device 104 accessing the phone book or the contact list of the caller device 104 , the user of the caller device 104 accessing the last dialed numbers list, the user of the caller device 104 accessing the missed calls list, the user of the caller device 104 accessing the received calls, the user of the caller device entering digits at the caller device and the user of the caller device 104 touching the touch screen of the caller device 104 .
- the input received at the caller device 104 can also be input of a particular sequence of characters punched by the user on the keypad of the caller device 104 .
- At step 208 at least one set of characters is transmitted to the communication server 102 based on a set of inputs received at the caller device 104 .
- the sets of characters may include an index value associated with the contact number of the called device 106 . For example, let us consider that the user of the caller device 104 wants to establish a call with Smith and Smith's phone number is stored in the phone book of the caller device 104 with a speed-dial number (index value) ‘341’.

- the user of the caller device 104 makes a call with a person whose number is not present in the phone book of the caller device 104 . In this case, the user will input the phone number of the person. As soon as the user inputs individual digits of the person's phone number, the individual digits are transmitted to the communication server 102 . After the person's phone number has been input by the user, the user presses the call key at the caller device 104 . Based on pressing of the call key, an alphanumeric code, for example, al, is transmitted to the communication server 102 .
- the set of characters is transmitted to the communication server 102 immediately after the first stage communication is established following detection of input at the caller device 104 .
- a set of characters associated with the pressed key is transmitted to the communication server 102 as soon as the user presses the first key on the keypad of the caller device 104 .
- the set of characters can be transmitted to the communication server 102 after every predefined time interval, for instance, every one second.
- the first stage of communication is established as soon as a fixed number of digits are punched by the user and the digits are transmitted to the communication server 102 immediately after that. For example, consider a case in which the user needs to dial a number, for instance, ‘6231-1233’. In this case, as soon as user punches ‘623’ of ‘6231-1233’, the first stage is established and the sets of characters associated with ‘623’ can be transmitted to the communication server 102 . The other digits are pulsed after that.
- the communication session can be dropped and the communication channel can be cleared based on predefined criteria. For example, the first communication session will be dropped if no input is received at the caller device 104 within a predefined time frame. This time frame can also be set by the user or the system administrator of the communication network 100 .
- the communication session between the caller device 104 and the called device 106 is established based on the at least one set of characters transmitted to the communication server 102 at step 208 .
