- page 104 includes a three-dimensional profile.
- FIGS. 2A and 2B are diagrams illustrating exemplary text ( FIG. 2A ) and a warped version of the text ( FIG. 2B ).
- the text in FIG. 2A may be thought of as text that is scanned from a flat page that is laid on a flat surface.
- the warped text in FIG. 2B can be thought of as being caused by a scanning process in which the same page was not flat relative to the scanning system.
- the warping shown in FIG. 2B which is particularly acute in the center of the text, may have been caused by the center portion of the page having a “bulge” relative to the scanner.
- the image of the text in FIG. 2A will generally be recognized by OCR conversion software, the image of the text of FIG. 2B may tend to cause conversion errors. That is, conversion software operating on the image of the text of FIG. 2B may result in a string of textual characters other than “text warping.”

- FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary system 400 for optically scanning documents, such as books, to obtain images of the documents.
- System 400 may include cameras 405 and 410 for taking two-dimensional images of a book 401 resting on a platform 402 .
- Documents other than books, such as, for example, magazines or other documents for which it is difficult to generate a flat un-warped image, may also be processed.
- An infra-red (IR) stereo camera 415 may include multiple imaging lenses 420 .
- An IR projector 425 may project IR radiation through a pattern mask 430 onto book 401 .
- Control logic 450 may control the operation of system 400 .
- control logic 450 may control cameras 405 , 410 , and 415 , and receive and process images taken by these cameras. Based on this information, control logic 450 may generate model 455 .
- Model 455 relates the three-dimensional surface of document 401 to an ideal, non-warped two-dimensional image of the surface of document 401 .
- Cameras 405 and 410 may be high definition cameras. In some implementations, only one of cameras 405 and 410 may be used. In other implementations, additional cameras similar to cameras 405 and 410 may be used.
- IR stereo camera 415 by virtue of its multiple imaging lenses 420 , can take multiple images of book 401 , each from different viewpoints.
- the images may be set to be taken in the IR spectrum.
- IR projector 425 may project IR radiation through pattern mask 430 onto book 401 .
- IR stereo camera 415 may take a stereoscopic image of the pattern defined by pattern mask 430 .
- the pattern may then be detected in the resulting image.
- the pattern may include a pattern that resembles a maze. Because the relative positions of imaging lenses 420 are known, the images can be stereoscopically combined (by, for example, control logic 450 ), using known stereoscopic techniques, to obtain a three-dimensional mapping of the pattern.
- the pattern falls on the surface of book 401 , causing the three-dimensional mapping of the pattern to correspond to the three-dimensional surface of the page of the book.
- a projector and camera that projects using radiation other than IR could be used.
- the projector and stereo camera may use any frequency that is not visible in the image taken by high definition cameras 405 and 410 .
- FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary portion of a pattern.
- the pattern may be superimposed on the surface of a three-dimensional page.
- Control logic 450 may detect and record the three-dimensional position of the pattern, which may be used to define the surface of a page 510 in three-dimensional space.

- Communication interface 680 may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables control logic 450 to communicate with other devices and/or systems.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary operations of system 400 in processing a page of a document.
- System 400 may begin by gathering data (act 701 ).
- the gathered data may include high definition two-dimensional images taken by cameras 410 and 405 and stereo images taken by IR stereo camera 415 .
- the stereo images include a predetermined pattern created by transmitting IR radiation from IR projector 425 through pattern mask 430 and onto the surface of the open pages in the document.
- the data gathered in act 701 may be saved to a computer-readable medium, and in the case of the stereo images, may be processed to match the pattern in at least two of the stereo images in order to recover the three-dimensional position of each pixel (point) in the image.
- the three-dimensional image data gathered from IR stereo camera 415 may next be processed to obtain model 455 , which relates the three-dimensional surface of the page to the two-dimensional coordinate of a flat, de-warped version of the page (act 702 ).
- the model may define a three-dimensional/two-dimensional mapping for the page of the document.
- the model may be implemented as pairs of corresponding two-dimensional/three-dimensional coordinate values, such as a pair of values corresponding to every object in the pattern.
- the model should define the three-dimensional surface of the page and a mapping from the three-dimensional to the two-dimensional surface. Techniques to obtain model 455 are described in more detail below.
- the two-dimensional camera data from one or both of cameras 405 and 410 may then be processed based on the model to compensate for warping in the two-dimensional image (act 703 ). More particularly, the two-dimensional images from camera 405 and 410 may be projected to three-dimensional coordinate space based on the three-dimensional coordinate space obtained from IR stereo camera 415 and then re-projected back to two-dimensional coordinate space using the two-dimensional/three-dimensional mapping defined by model 455 .
- FIG. 8 is a diagram conceptually illustrating the operations performed in act 703 . As shown, a two-dimensional image from camera(s) 405 / 410 (block 805 ) is projected to a three-dimensional image space (block 810 ) and then re-projected back to a two-dimensional image (block 815 ) based on the mappings defined by model 455 .
- the de-warped versions of the two-dimensional images that were obtained in act 703 may then be processed by OCR software to identify the characters in the images (act 704 ).
- OCR software may then be processed by OCR software to identify the characters in the images (act 704 ).
- OCR conversion of the image to characters may not be necessary and this would not be performed.
- FIG. 9 is a flow chart illustrating one implementation for processing the three-dimensional data to obtain model 455 , as performed in act 702 ( FIG. 7 ).
- model 455 may be generated for each page or pair of pages of the document.
- the three-dimensional mapping of the pattern that corresponds to the surface of the document may be initially retrieved and processed to generate the correspondence of the three-dimensional points to the known flat two-dimensional pattern (act 901 ).
- This concept is shown in FIG. 10 , in which an exemplary set of nine three-dimensional points 1010 are illustrated along with their corresponding nine two-dimensional points 1020 .
- Three-dimensional points 1010 correspond to nine points from the pattern that are located in three-dimensions based on images from IR stereo camera 415 .
- Points 1010 are labeled as points P 0 through P 8 and are each associated with a three-dimensional coordinate vector (e.g., (X, Y, Z)).
- Points 1020 are labeled as points P′ 0 through P′ 8 and are each associated with a two-dimensional coordinate vector (e.g., (X′, Y′)).
- Measurement and calibration errors may introduce errors into values of points 1010 and 1020 .
- constraints are applied that can be used to generate equations that describe the constraints (act 902 ).
- two constraints may be applied: stretch and shear.
- the stretch constraint assumes the page is not stretched. This implies that distances between two points in three-dimensional space should be equal to the distance in two-dimensional space.
- This constraint can be expressed, for any two points, such as points P 0 and P 1 in FIG. 10 , as: [(P 0 ⁇ P 1 ) 2 ⁇ (P′ 0 ⁇ P′ 1 ) 2 ] 2 . (eq. 1)
- the shear constraint assumes that the angle ⁇ is equal to the angle ⁇ ′ ( FIG. 10 ).
- Equations (1) and (2) may be generated for all or a subset of the pairs, or triplets in the case of equation (2), of points in the three-dimensional image taken by stereo camera 415 .
- the equations may then be solved to minimize the total stretch and shear error (act 903 ).
- the correspondence between the three-dimensional values and the two-dimensional values, illustrated in FIG. 10 may be adjusted based on the system of equations defined by the stretch and shear constraints.
- the final correspondence between the three-dimensional/two-dimensional points defines model 455 .
- FIG. 11 is a flow chart illustrating a second implementation for processing the three-dimensional data to obtain model 455 , as performed in act 702 ( FIG. 7 ).
- Model 455 may be generated for each page or pair of pages of the document.
- Control logic 450 may begin by finding the central groove for a document (act 1101 ).
- the central groove is generally the line centered on the spine of the book.
- FIG. 12 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary three-dimensional page 1200 of a book.
- a central groove is illustrated in FIG. 12 as central groove 1210 .
- the central groove may be detected in a variety of automated or manually ways. For example, an operator may manually specify the location of the central groove. Alternatively, the central groove may be automatically detected by searching for a line in the three-dimensional image that lies in the lowest “valley” in the image.
- Model 455 is generally based on a series of lines that may each be determined by moving a predetermined distance from the previous line along the surface of the page.
- a series of such lines are indicated in FIG. 12 as lines 1230 - 1234 . While lines 1230 - 1234 are shown as parallel to each other, this may not be the case due to the three-dimensional nature of page 1200 .
- the first line may be the three-dimensional line corresponding to central groove 1210 (act 1102 ).
- the next line may then be located by finding a best-fit three-dimensional line that is a predetermined distance, such as 1 millimeter, from the previous line, along the surface of the page (act 1103 ).
- the best-fit three-dimensional line may be fitted to the three-dimensional points that define the surface of a page. More particularly, in performing act 1103 , the surface of the page in the vicinity of the current line may be estimated using for example, a relatively simple model for a curve, such as a quadratic surface. For example, for page 1200 , the surface of the page in the vicinity of the current line may be identified and curve-fitted.
- the corresponding two-dimensional equation of the next line may then be determined (act 1104 ).
- the two-dimensional equation of the next line is determined by locating a plane that best passes through the next line and the previous line, and then using the two-dimensional equation of the previous line and the plane to find the two-dimensional equation of the next line. Acts 1103 and 1104 may be repeated until the end of the page is reached (act 1105 ).
- Model 455 may then be stored as the corresponding pairs of two-dimensional and three-dimensional mappings defined by the pairs of two-dimensional and three-dimensional lines (act 1106 ).
- FIG. 13 is a diagram illustrating one exemplary application of the concepts described herein relating to de-warping documents.
- Books may be scanned using a system such as that shown in FIG. 4 .
- an operator may turn each page of the current book and instruct system 400 to scan and process each page as described above.
- the resulting data may be stored in a document repository as de-warped two-dimensional page images and as corresponding OCR textual data.
- the textual data allows clients 1325 , for example, to perform keyword-based searches on the scanned books through a network 1320 .
- One or both of the OCR textual data and the images of the pages may then be returned to clients 1325 as search results.
- the scanning may involve using a stereoscopic camera system to generate a three-dimensional representation of the open pages.
- a model relating the three-dimensional scanned image space with an un-warped two-dimensional image space can then be generated.
- a series of simultaneous equations generated from page constraints were solved to generate the model.
- a series of three-dimensional lines were fitted to the surface of the page and successive mappings to a series of two-dimensional lines were derived to generate the model.
Abstract
Description
[(P0−P1)2−(P′0−P′1)2]2. (eq. 1)
The shear constraint assumes that the angle α is equal to the angle α′ (
[(P0−P1)·(P2−P0)−(P′0−P′1)·(P′2−P′0)] (eq. 2)
where · represents the dot product. If there is no stretching, equation (1) will equal zero for any corresponding pair of points. Similarly, if there is no shearing and no stretching, equation (2) will be zero.
