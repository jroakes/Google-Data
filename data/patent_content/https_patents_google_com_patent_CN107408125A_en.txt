Embodiment
General introduction
User finds " answer " commonly using search system, rather than extensive information.Answer is in response to the thing in problem
Reality or relation.The difference of " problem inquiry " and information inquiry is that answer is found in problem inquiry, and information inquiry is pin
To request of the theme to various types of information.For example, problem inquires about " how high (the How high is Pikes in Parker peak
Peak) " it is the clear request fact --- the structuralized query of the height at Parker peak.Search system can detect the structure of the inquiry
Change property and the inquiry is construed to problem inquiry, and in response to the inquiry, there is provided particular result, the particular result provide
The answer of the problem, and optionally provide other results.
This paper theme is related to the system shown together with a kind of text answers for identifying associated picture to inquire about with problem.
In operation, the system receives inquiry.If the inquiry is to trigger type --- i.e. " problem inquiry ", the system of text answers
Carry out finding answer process with hypograph.First, system generates the image querying of picture search based on problem inquiry.If should
Theme be definitional type (for example, the instantiation of classification, specific people etc., such as, " cheetah can run how soon(How
fast can a Cheetah run) ", wherein, " cheetah " is theme), then the master that is identified of the image querying based on inquiry
Topic.If problem inquiry is definitional (for example, " what (what is the fastest most fast animals is for inquiry
Animal) ", term " animal " is not instantiation, and it is a classification), then the inquiry received is inquired about as problem.
In some embodiments, problem inquiry is used to search for the web corpus of web page resources.For in response to second
The top n resource inquired about and returned, roving commission then is run for the image in the top n resource to identify image collection.
Again, image querying can be used for the subsequent search as input inquiry.Therefore, image querying is used to find out web page resources collection
Close, and be subsequently used for finding out image in the search for be constrained in the web page resources.
It is then possible to the image that the image of top ranked is used as providing together with answer.However, in other embodiment party
In formula, additional treatments can be carried out and selected with refined image.For example, the system can determine the source money from the corresponding answer of its extraction
Source.If the source resource selects among the top n resource and including one or more image in the resource collection
There is the image in top ranked source resource in the resource collection.As an alternative, additional selection processing, such as, root can be carried out
Further ranking is carried out to the image being included in the resource of source according to selection criterion.For example, selection criterion can include：Image is
Whether the no extrusion position positioned at the page, image are identified as low frame (for example, " clip art (clipart) " or anchor
Point button, icon etc.) etc..Then the image of top ranked is selected, is provided together with answer text.
If source resource does not include image, image can not be provided together with answer, or, as an alternative, it will can scheme
The selection of picture expands to the image being confirmed as in the resource collection in response to problem inquiry.
By being pre-processed before source resource is identified to picture search, system reduces time delay, because in list
The image scoring to the image in the resource of source is completed before only answer generation system identification source resource.
It is delayed when that can allow higher, system can be waited until identifying source resource, and then to being included in
Image in the resource of source is scored.If source resource does not include image, image can not be provided together with answer, or,
As an alternative, can be by search extension to the image from the resource inquired about in response to problem.In other embodiment,
Caused answer text can be used for the resource for the top ranked that search response is identified in image querying.
These features and supplementary features will be described in more detail with lower part.The context being characterized in image
(context) it is described under；However, these features are not limited solely to the context of image and can also be applied to other

For the image of problem inquiry
As described above, some forms of inquiry in problem or the form in implicit question.For example, inquiry " adds profit
The Fu Niya provincial capital (capital of California) " is that (" what the provincial capital in California is to implicit question") shape
Formula.Equally, problem inquiry can be explicit that such as " what the provincial capital of California is(What is the capital
of California) " inquiry situation.Search system 110 includes inquiry issue processor 120, the inquiry issue handling
Whether device 120 is inquiry problem to determine to inquire about using process, also, if it is, is determined whether there is in response to the problem
Answer.Inquiry issue processor 120 can determine whether inquiry is problem and whether has using a variety of algorithms
In response to the specific answer of the problem.For example, inquiry issue processor 120 can utilize language model, machine-learning process, know
Knowledge figure, grammer, search result and the search result resource to be referred to or its combination come determine problem inquiry and answer.
When it is determined that inquiry is problem inquiry, inquiry issue processor 120 calls image processor 122, the image procossing
The image that device 122 and then identification will provide together with answer.
Fig. 2 is the diagram for the example user interface 200 that image is provided together with the answer of problem inquiry.User interface 200
It is search result interfaces, also, in input field 204 has have input inquiry 202 " provincial capital of California is assorted
".The inquiry is identified as problem inquiry by inquiry issue processor 120, also, also identifies answer " Sacramento
(Sacramento)“.In response to determining that the inquiry is problem inquiry and determines to identify answer, with inquiring about issue processor
The search systems 110 of 120 connections furnish an answer frame 206.Answer frame 206 includes the text data of description answer " Sacramento "
208.In addition, answer frame 206 includes, one or more image --- the provincial capital as California is built in this case
One image 210 of the image built.The additional information of such as search result 212 and 214 can also be provided in search results pages
On face.
The selection to image 210 described with reference to figure 3A, Fig. 3 A be provide image together with the answer of problem inquiry be
System flow chart 300.The system flow chart 300 describes the process realized in image processor 122.
Image processor 122 receives the first inquiry for being determined to be problem inquiry, and this can be provided in response to problem inquiry
The corresponding answer (302) of problem inquiry.For example, when it is problem to inquire about issue processor 120 to determine inquiry, such as " Jia Lifu
The sub- provincial capital of Buddhist nun " or " what provincial capital in California is " are intended to the inquiry of problem inquiry, and the problem is inquired about
It is supplied to image processor 122.
Image processor 122 is inquired about (304) according to the first query generation second.Can using various processes come from this first
The inquiry of inquiry export second.Fig. 4 described below is from problem inquiry (the first inquiry) generation image querying (the second inquiry)
The flow chart of instantiation procedure 400.
Image processor 122 cause to use the second inquiry as input come it is completing, to one in first resource corpus
The search (306) of individual or multiple resources.The search is performed by the system outside image processor 122.In some implementations
In mode, processing stage 306 only causes to carry out picture search to the source resource for extracting answer text from it.For example, source resource can
With with multiple images, also, to measure image to the score value of the responsiveness of the second inquiry to score each image.
In other embodiments, using second inquiry come searching resource set, and then by second inquiry come pair
Image in top n response resource is scored.Then, once inquiry issue processor 120 identifies source resource, it is possible to
Image is selected based on the search score value of the second inquiry.Although the alternative process may be to not considering after source resource is determined
Many images scored, still, image is scored due to being completed before source resource is identified, so it still subtracts
Time delay is lacked.The particular implementation is described referring to Fig. 5.
In other embodiment, inquired about using second to search for the resource collection, and then, as above institute
State, the image in top n response resource is scored by the second inquiry.However, in this embodiment, it is selected
Image be not necessarily comprised in the resource of source, also, be chosen independently of source resource.
The search of one or more resource to the first corpus is based at least partially on, image processor 122 selects
The image (308) to be provided together with the answer in response to the first inquiry.Source resource is searched only for as described above, working as or when identification
During the resource of source, the image of top ranked in the resource of source can be selected.As an alternative, can alternatively quilt in top n resource
The image of top ranked among the image of scoring.
It can also select to have responded to inquire about and ranked image in second using additional selection criterion.For example, this
The additional selection criterion of sample can include：Picture position in rendered resource；The image tag of image in the resource；And
Whether image is used as linking., may be on score value to logical relative to the image rendered in middle position for location criteria
Often render the image degradation in the lateral parts of resource.Other positions criterion can also be used.
For image tag criterion, can degrade the label being frequently incorporated into instruction image in multiple web page resources
Image, for example, be denoted as the image of icon, clip art, UI buttons, bar etc., because the instruction of such label is relatively low
The value of information.However, some problems that can indicate the high value of information for such label are inquired about, label standard can be ignored
Then, or, as an alternative, the score value of image can be improved.If for example, the problem is related to icon, for example, " computer icon is
What (What is a computer icon) ", then it can improve the search score value of the thumbnail image with " icon " label.
Equally, if the problem is related to the theme commonly using clip art types of image --- such as in the case of mathematical formulae,
Tab icon criterion can be ignored.
For linking criteria, the image of the anchor point as link can be ignored, or, the value of its score value can be reduced.Can
To adjust the score value of the image in response to the second inquiry, and/or filtering response using other selection criterions in the second inquiry
Image.
Search system 110 provides image (310) together with the answer in response to the first inquiry.For example, selection best result
The image of value provides together with answer.
In some embodiments it is possible to using the actual answer to be provided come to the image returned for picture search
Selected and/or scored adjustment.Fig. 3 B are the system flow charts 350 of the instantiation procedure 350 for being scored image.
Image processor 122 receives data (352) of the instruction in response to the image collection of the second inquiry.For example, search system
System 110 provides the image list for carrying out ranking according to the order of the responsiveness to the second inquiry.Then, image processor 122 can be with
The metadata of access images and the content of description image.
Image processor 122 receives the answer to inquire about and provide in response to problem, wherein, special entity is specified in the answer
(354).For example, image processor receives answer text from inquiry problem processing system, also, examined using any appropriate entity
Survey process --- title identifier, language model, grammer and resolver etc. --- detects the specific reality specified by the answer
Body.For example, special entity can be people, place or things or a kind of people, a kind of place or a kind of things.
Image processor 122 determines whether the image metadata of one or more image specifies special entity (356).Example
Such as, decision process 356 can take into account each image.For example, image processor 122 is by the special entity specified by answer and specifies
The image metadata of (one or more) entity described in image is compared, to determine whether there is matching.The matching can
To be to match completely, or the matching based on measuring similarity.
If the image metadata of one or more image specifies the special entity, image processor 122 performs the
One image selection process (358).First image selection process for each image take into account special entity specified by answer with
The matching (or mismatch) for the entity described in the image.Based on matching or mismatch, image processing system 122 can improve
Or reduce the relevance score of image；Either the image can be included in the selection process or exclude the image；Or can
To perform any other appropriate selection course for the matching (or mismatch) for taking into account entity.
On the other hand, if the not specified special entity of the image metadata of one or more image, image procossing
Device 122 performs the second image selection process (360).Second image selection process can be selected image and need not consider
And the entity specified by answer with for the image come any process of the matching of entity for specifying.
Second query generation
As described above, Fig. 4 is the flow chart according to the instantiation procedure 400 of problem query generation image querying.In operation,
Image processor 122 receives the first inquiry (402).First inquiry is intended to the inquiry of problem inquiry.
The determination problem of image processor 122 inquires about the example (404) for whether specifying classification.In order to make the determination, figure
As processor 122 can use various language models, or access level list and the example for belonging to the category.For example, for
Inquiry " cheetah how soon can run ", image processor 122 can be based on language model or preassigned classification/instance data
To determine that term " cheetah " is the example of classification " animal ".
If inquiry specifies the example of classification, image processor 122 selects the example as the second inquiry (406).
Otherwise, the inquiry of the selection of image processor 122 first is as the second inquiry.
The other methods for determining the second inquiry can also be used.For example, for it is very popular the problem of inquire about, can be advance
Specify the second inquiry.For example, for " moon is apart from how far (the How far from the earth is the of the earth
Moon inquiry) ", it is " moon " that can preassign the second inquiry.
In other embodiment, the second inquiry can be answer text or problem inquiry and answer text
Combination.In the modification of this embodiment, system can receive the answer for being predicted the answer as problem, and will be pre-
The answer of survey is used as the second inquiry.Prediction answer is not necessarily in response to problem inquiry and the actual answer to be provided.Hereafter, when
System receive in response to problem inquiry will provide actual answer when, the system by verify prediction answer matches (completely matching
Or meet similarity score values) actual answer.When acknowledging, selected image is provided together with actual answer.However,
If actual answer does not confirm to predict answer, system can rerun search using actual answer, or, alternative
Ground, selected image can not be provided together with answer text.
The fact that latter embodiment is for may often change is useful.The example for the fact that so change can be with
It is position of people in relation between people, the office of civil servant, tissue etc..
Source resource processing
As described above, in one embodiment, carry out searching resource set using the second inquiry, then, looked into by second
Inquiry is scored the image in top n response resource.Hereafter, once inquiry issue processor 120 identifies source resource, just
Image can be selected based on the search score value of the second inquiry.Fig. 5 is the flow for the process 500 that the embodiment is implemented in description
Figure.
Image processor 122 causes to utilize search (502) of second inquiry to the first corpus.For example, image processor
Second inquiry is submitted to search engine 110 with the index of search and webpage resource by 122.
Image processor 122 receives data (504) of the instruction in response to the resource collection of the second inquiry.For example, search system
System 110 provides the list for the web resource for carrying out ranking according to the order of the responsiveness to the second inquiry.
Image processor 122 causes to be directed to search (506) of the image to Secondary resource corpus.For example, image processor
Second inquiry is submitted to search engine 110 by 122, to be carried out to the web resource for the preceding N rankings being constrained in the resource collection
Picture search.N value can be 100,500 or some other numerals.
Image processor 122 receives data (508) of the instruction in response to the image collection of the second inquiry.For example, search system
System 110 provides the list for the image for carrying out ranking according to the order of the responsiveness to the second inquiry.
Whether the resource that image processor 122 determines to include answer text and rank graph picture is in the resource collection (510).
For example, it is referred to as " source resource " by the resource of answer is extracted from it.Image processor 122 determines whether source resource is being carried out by about
In the top n resource of beam images search.
If image processor 122 determines that the resource for including answer text and rank graph picture in the resource collection, are schemed
As processor 122 selects the image (512) to include together with answer text from the resource.In some embodiments, should
Selection can be based only on the composition ranking of the image in the resource of source.Had responded to for the purpose of this description it will be assumed that source resource has
Carry out five images of ranking in the second inquiry.Corresponding search score value is 0.78,0.73,0.33,0.31 and 0.08, wherein, search
The amplitude of rope score value is proportional to the responsiveness of inquiry to image.Here, image of the search score value for 0.78 will be selected.
In the modification of this embodiment, searching for image can be adjusted based on additional selection criterion as described above
