- The present disclosure relates generally to extracting information from images using an optical character recognition (“OCR”) process, and more particularly to dynamically presenting content that is selected based on information extracted from images using an OCR process and a geolocation associated with the images.
- In many different environments, content providers want to provide content to individuals. In some instances, a content provider may rely on contextual information when making decisions regarding selections of content to provide to an individual. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a mechanism for providing content to the recipient based on the individual's perceived needs.
- In certain example embodiments, a method to cause a mobile computing device to render a user interface that dynamically presents content that is selected based on information extracted from images comprises analyzing an image by performing an optical character recognition (“OCR”) process on the image and extracting converted text from the image. A camera on the mobile computing device captures an electronic image and a geolocation is associated with the image. The mobile computing device monitors locations of the mobile computing device and automatically detects a location of the mobile computing device at a time when the camera captures the image. The associated geolocation comprises the location of the mobile computing device at the time when the camera captured the image. The mobile computing device analyzes the image by performing an OCR process on the image, extracting information from converted text of the image, and determining the geolocation associated with the image. The extracted information, the geolocation, and a request for content are transmitted to a content distribution computing system. The content distribution computing system determines content for transmission to the mobile computing device by analyzing the extracted information, the geolocation, and the request for content. The content distribution computing system transmits a content alert notification to the mobile computing device. The content alert notification causes a content alert to display on the user interface on the mobile computing device. The content alert notifies the user of the mobile computing device that content is available for display based on the user interface. The user interface on the mobile computing device is rendered to present the content available near the geolocation when the content alert is selected.

- The method and system described herein enables a content provider to provide content to a recipient based on information obtained from one or more receipts or transaction records documenting a prior purchase transaction. The system includes a content distribution system, implemented in hardware and/or software. The content distribution system receives content and information from content providers, such as merchants, product manufacturers, and advertisers. Generally, this content can include advertisements, promotional offers, coupons, product brochures, training videos, information regarding product accessories, and product pricing information. As used throughout this specification, the term “product” should be interpreted to include tangible and intangible products, as well as services.
- A selection engine of the content distribution system can select content to provide to a recipient based on information obtained from one or more of the recipient's receipts or other document or record that documents a prior purchase transaction of an item, such as a product or service. A receipt analysis module resident on a user device (or at the selection engine) can analyze an image file to determine whether the image file includes a receipt and extract information from the receipt. The user device can send this extracted information to the content distribution system and request content based on the sent information. For example, an individual can use a camera installed on a smartphone to capture an image of a paper receipt received for the purchase of a television. The receipt module running on the smartphone can determine that the captured image contains a receipt and extract information from the receipt. The receipt module also can send the extracted information to the content distribution system. The selection engine of the content distribution system can identify content associated with the purchased television and send the identified content to the user's smartphone for presentation to the user. For example, the content can include the price of the television at other retailers nearby or at an online merchant, a brochure for the television, a coupon for a related product or accessory to the television, such as a Blu-ray disc player, or information regarding a competing product, such as a television offered by a different manufacturer.
- Users may be allowed to limit or otherwise affect the operation of the features disclosed in the specification. For example, users may be given opportunities to opt-in or opt out of the collection or use of certain data or the activation of certain features. In addition, users may be given the opportunity to change the manner in which the features are employed, including for situations in which users may have concerns regarding their privacy. Instructions also may be provided to users to notify them regarding policies about the use of information, including personally identifiable information, and manners in which they may affect such use of information. Thus, sensitive personal information can be used to benefit a user, if desired, through receipt of targeted advertisements or other information, without risking disclosure of personal information or the user's identity.
- One or more aspects of the exemplary embodiments may include a computer program that embodies the functions described and illustrated herein, wherein the computer program is implemented in a computer system that comprises instructions stored in a machine-readable medium and a processor that executes the instructions. However, it should be apparent that there could be many different ways of implementing the exemplary embodiments in computer programming, and the exemplary embodiments should not be construed as limited to any one set of computer program instructions.

content distribution system 112 is resident on the end user network device 130. In such an offline embodiment, content can be presented to the user without sending receipt information over thenetwork 107. In certain exemplary embodiments, thereceipt module 131 is resident at the informationprovider network device 110 rather than the end user network device 130. In such an embodiment, the end user network device 130 can send an image file for a document containing a receipt to the informationprovider network device 110. In turn, the informationprovider network device 110 can send content to the end user network device 103 based on the contents of the receipt. - The
content distribution system 112 and thereceipt module 131 are described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the method illustrated inFIG. 2 . -
FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting amethod 200 for providing content based on an analysis of information obtained from one or more receipts, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. Themethod 200 is described with reference to the components illustrated inFIG. 1 . - In
block 205, thecontent distribution system 112 maintains acontent repository 118. Thecontent repository 118 includes a data structure, such as one or more databases and/or electronic records, that includes content to provide to a user based on information obtained from one or more of the user's receipts. The content can include advertisements, promotional offers, coupons, product brochures, training videos, information regarding product accessories or related products, product pricing information, digital products, merchant contact information, maps to merchant locations, a survey or form for requesting information, such as a product or service review, and other information related to products, merchants, or manufacturers. The content can be in the form of text, graphics, images, photograph, sound, video, web page files, a bar code, a quick response code (“QR code”), a jpeg, an mpeg, an mp3, and/or other multimedia and data files. - In certain exemplary embodiments, a
receiver module 114 of thecontent distribution system 112 receives information that is included in thecontent repository 118 in electronic data feeds and/or a hard copy provided by one ormore merchants 150, one ormore product manufacturers 170, and/or another information source, such as a specialized information aggregator. For example, themerchant 150, themanufacturer 170, or anotherinformation source 180 may periodically provide batched or unbatched content in an electronic feed to thereceiver module 114. In another example, themerchant 150, themanufacturer 170, or theinformation source 180 may provide content for a special promotion, such as seasonal sales event. - The
receiver module 114 also may receive content from scanned product documentation, catalogs, coupons, advertisements, or other scanned documentation. In certain exemplary embodiments, thereceiver module 114 also may receive the content from a screen scraping mechanism, which is included in or associated with thecontent distribution system 112. For example, the screen scraping mechanism may capture product information, pricing information, deals, promotions, coupons, or other information from merchant, manufacturer, or information provider websites. - In certain exemplary embodiments, the
merchant 150 ormanufacturer 170 can specify conditions for providing the content to a user. For example, amerchant 150 can specify that users that spend a total of $50 at thatmerchant 150 receive a coupon for $10 off their next purchase at thatmerchant 150. Likewise, amanufacturer 170 may specify that users that purchase a television marketed by a different manufacturer are offered a coupon to return the purchased television and buy a similar television offered by themanufacturer 170. - In
block 210, thereceipt module 131 receives an image. In certain exemplary embodiments, a user can execute thereceipt module 131 at the user network device 130 and select an icon to capture an image. In response, thereceipt module 131 can activate thecamera 133. The user can use thecamera 133 to take a picture of an object or a document, such as a paper receipt documenting a purchase transaction or an electronic receipt displayed on a screen. In certain exemplary embodiments, the user scans a paper document, such as a paper receipt, using thescanner 139. Theuser network device 131 can store an image file for the scanned image in thereceipt repository 137 or another storage location. The user can navigate to a stored image file via a user interface of thereceipt module 131. For example, the user can navigate to an image file for a scanned image stored in thereceipt repository 137. In another example, the user may navigate to an image file of a receipt stored on or by adigital wallet 135 of the user network device 130. - In certain exemplary embodiments, the
merchant 150 may provide a receipt or an image file having information to create an electronic image of the receipt electronically to the user. A point of sale (“POS”)device 155 of themerchant 150 may transmit a receipt or image file to the user network device 130 electronically via a wireless technology, such as Bluetooth or infrared or induction wireless. For example, thedigital wallet 135 may interact with thePOS device 155 via a wireless technology to complete the purchase of one or more products. After the transaction is completed, thePOS device 155 can transmit a receipt or an image file for the receipt to thedigital wallet 135. Thedigital wallet 135 can then store the receipt or image file in thereceipt repository 137, at thedigital wallet 135, or at another location. In certain exemplary embodiments, themerchant 155 sends a receipt or an image file for a receipt to the user via e-mail. The user can access the receipt or image file using an e-mail application and store the receipt or image file in thereceipt repository 137 or at another location. The user can then navigate to and select from the receipts or image files stored on the end user network device 130 using thereceipt module 131. The user also can navigate to and select from receipts and image files stored at areceipt repository 195 of thecloud computing environment 190 using thereceipt module 131. - In
block 215, thereceipt module 131 analyzes the received image file to determine whether the image file includes a receipt documenting a prior purchase transaction. In certain exemplary embodiments, thereceipt module 131 analyzes the image to identify any text in the image. For example, thereceipt module 131 may use optical character recognition (“OCR”) to identify text in the image and convert the identified text into machine-encoded text. Thereceipt module 131 analyzes the converted text to determine whether the text indicates that the image includes a receipt.Block 215 is described in more detail hereinafter, with reference toFIG. 3 . - In certain exemplary embodiments, a user can identify the image file as having a receipt. For example, a user may capture an image of a paper receipt using the
camera 133. In response, thereceipt module 131 may prompt the user to select whether an image file has or does not have a receipt. - If the
receipt module 131 determines that the image file includes a receipt (or the user identifies the image file as having a receipt), themethod 200 proceeds to block 230. Otherwise, themethod 200 ends. Of course, additional images can be received and analyzed. - In
block 225, thereceipt module 131 stores the image file and/or the converted text from the image file in thereceipt repository 137 of the user network device 130. In addition, or in the alternative, thereceipt module 131 stores the image file and/or the converted text from the image file at thereceipt repository 195 at thecloud computing environment 190. The user can later access the stored image file and converted text using the user network device 130 or another device connected to the cloud computing environment via thenetwork 107. - In
block 230, thereceipt module 131 sends the converted text from the image file to thecontent distribution system 112 with a request for content. The request for content can be an explicit request made by the user, for example by actuating an icon displayed by thereceipt module 131. The request for content can be an automatic request made by thereceipt module 131 in response to determining that the image includes a receipt. In certain exemplary embodiments, the user can opt in or opt out of automatic requests. - The request for content can include a request for a particular type of content. For example, a user may actuate an icon displayed by the
receipt module 131 to request coupons or deals. In another example, a user may actuate an icon to request the price of a product purchased and identified in the receipt at other merchants. In such a request, thereceipt module 131 may interact with a global positioning system (“GPS”) module (or another location identification module) to identify the user's location and send information identifying the user's location along with the request for content. That way, thecontent distribution system 112 can search for merchants that offer the product near the user's location and return the price for the product at those merchants. In certain exemplary embodiments, thereceipt module 131 is capable of being configured by the user to return certain types of content each time a request for content is made. - In
block 240, theselection engine 116 selects content to return to thereceipt module 131 based on the text from the image file having the receipt and the request for content. Theselection engine 116 can select from content stored in thecontent repository 118. Theselection engine 116 can consider any information and any combination of information obtained from the receipt to select content. This information can include, but is not limited to, product names, merchant names, manufacturer names, SKUs or other product identifiers, price paid for a product, total price paid, time and date of purchase, location of merchant where purchase was made, address identified in receipt, payment method used, and whether a coupon was used.
