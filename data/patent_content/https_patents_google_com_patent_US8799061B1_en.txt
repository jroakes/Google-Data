Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to content presentation.
- Advertisers provide advertisements in different forms in order to attract consumers.
- An advertisement (“ad”) is a piece of information designed to be used in whole or part by a user, for example, a particular consumer.
- Ads can be provided in electronic form. For example, online ads can be provided as banner ads on a web page, as ads presented with search results, or as ads presented in a mobile application.
- An advertising system can include an ad in a webpage, for example, in response to one or more keywords in a user search query input to a search engine. If a user selects the presented ad (e.g., by “clicking” the ad), then the user is generally taken to another location associated with the ad, for example, to another, particular web page.
- This specification describes technologies relating to content presentation.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of determining a location history for a user, where the location history includes a plurality of location data points for the user; analyzing the location history to derive a category for the user; associating the user with the category; and using the user's associated category to boost one or more candidate content items for delivery to the user.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding system, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the candidate content items can be advertisements.
- Determining the location history can include: for each location of a plurality of locations, receiving location information from the user; and analyzing the location information to determine the plurality of location data points.
- the location information can include one or more of: global positioning system (GPS) coordinates from a mobile device, an internet protocol (IP) address, or one or more search queries.
- GPS global positioning system
- IP internet protocol
- Analyzing the location history can include comparing the location history with one or more other location histories having existing associated categories.
- Using the user's associated category to boost the one or more candidate content items can include: receiving a request to serve a content item to the user; determining whether any content items of the one or more candidate content items are associated with the user's associated category; and applying a weight to a score for each content item associated with the user's associated category.
- Each of the plurality of location data points can be associated with one or more times, and one or more additional categories can be derived for the user for each of the one or more times.
- One or more additional location data points can be identified for the user and included in the location history for the user.
- the location history including the additional location data points can be analyzed to derive a new category for the user.
- the user can be associated with the new category.
- the additional location data points can be filtered to determine whether they will influence the user's associated category.
- One or more further location data points can be periodically identified for the user.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a request to serve a content item to a user; determining one or more candidate content items; identifying a category for the user, the category being derived using a location history for the user, the location history including a plurality of location data points for the user; determining whether the category matches the one or more candidate content items; boosting a score of each candidate content item determined to match the category; based on the scores for the candidate content items, selecting a first content item of the one or more candidate content items to serve to the user; and serving the first content item to the user.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding system, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the one or more candidate content items can be advertisements. Each candidate content item can be associated with one or more categories identified using advertiser supplied keywords. Selecting the first content item of the one or more candidate content items can include selecting the content item having the highest score including any boosting.
- Particular embodiments of the invention can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages.
- Users can be classified into one or more categories based on location histories of the users.
- Content items e.g., ads
- Reports can be provided to advertisers describing user categories that are likely lucrative for a given ad campaign.

- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process for updating a user's location history and associated categories.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart of an example process for serving an ad to a user.
- Advertisers seek to have content items (e.g., ads) presented to users likely to be interested in the content items.
- content items can be targeted to users based on the user's location history and characteristics of the user.
- users can be associated with one or more categories indicative of the types or interests of users with related location histories. Content items matched to these categories can be boosted by a system when determining content items to serve to users.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example content presentation system 100 .
- one or more advertisers 102 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track ad information in an advertising management system 104 .
- advertising other forms of content, including other forms of sponsored content, can be delivered by the advertising management system 104 .
- the ads can be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one or more of any of such components, and so on.
- the ads can also include embedded information, such as links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more publishers 106 can submit requests for ads to the advertising management system 104 .
- the advertising management system 104 responds by sending ads to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on, or association with, one or more of the publisher's content items (e.g., web properties).
- Example web properties can include web pages, television and radio advertising slots, or print media space.
- Other entities can provide usage information to the advertising management system 104 , for example, whether or not a conversion (e.g., a purchase or other interaction) or a click-through related to an ad (e.g., a user has selected an ad) has occurred.
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to ads that have been served.
- the advertising management system 104 performs financial transactions, for example, crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- a network 112 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 102 , the advertising management system 104 , the publishers 106 , and the users 108 and 110 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof
- One example publisher 106 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, and so on), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the content server can submit a request for ads to an advertisement server in the advertising management system 104 .
- the ad request can include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request can also include content request information.
- the content request information can include the content itself (e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, and so on), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, and so on), geo-location information, and so on.
- content e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content
- a category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, and so on
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, and so on
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, and so on.
- the content server (or a client browser or the like) can combine the requested content with one or more of the ads provided by the advertising management system 104 .
- the combined content and ads can be served (e.g., sent/rendered) to the users 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can transmit information about the ads back to the advertisement server, including information describing how, when and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., in hypertext markup language (HTML) or JavaScriptTM)
- search service can receive queries for search results.
- the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and can be grouped into a specified number (e.g., ten) of search results.
- the search service can submit a request for ads to the advertising management system 104 .
- the request can include a number of ads desired. This number can depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, and so on. In some implementations, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for ads can also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- the information can include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers of “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, and so on.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, and so on.
- the advertising management system 104 includes an auction process to select ads from the advertisers 102 .
- the advertisers 102 can be permitted to select, or bid, an amount the advertisers are willing to pay for each presentation of or interaction with (e.g., click) of an ad, e.g., a cost-per-click amount an advertiser pays when, for example, a user clicks on an ad.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay for each click of an ad based on a keyword, e.g., a word or words in a query.
- Other bid types can also be used. Based on these bids, ads can be selected and ranked for presentation.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the ads provided by the advertising management system 104 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the users 108 and 110 that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid ads and presumably neutral search results.
- one or more publishers 106 can submit requests for ads to the advertising management system 104 .
- the advertising management system 104 responds by sending ads to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property. For example, if a publisher 106 publishes a sports-related web site, the advertising management system can provide sports-related ads to the publisher 106 .
- the requests can instead be executed by devices associated with the users 108 and 110 , e.g., by the execution of a javascript when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device.
- a mobile application is an application specifically designed for operation on a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone).
- the mobile application can also include ads positioned within the content of the mobile application.
- the ads can be received from the advertising management system 104 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device).
- the advertising management system 104 provides categories to advertisers 102 as targeting choices to the advertiser's 102 ads.
- the advertisers 102 can specify that certain ads or groups of ads are to be targeted to users 108 associated with selected categories.
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram showing an example ad system 202 and example users 206 .
- the ad system 202 can interact with users 206 through a network 208 .
- the network 208 can be, for example, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, one or more telephony networks, cellular networks, or combinations thereof.
- the users 206 can receive one or more ads, directly or indirectly, from the ad system 202 . Additionally, the users 206 can provide location information to the ad system 202 . For example, each user 206 can be associated with a mobile device at a location. The mobile device can provide location information (e.g., global positioning system (GPS) coordinates) to the ad system 202 .
- GPS global positioning system
- Location information for a user can be a geographic place or region and can refer to, for example, GPS coordinates, latitude and longitude, address locations, a region surrounding particular GPS coordinates, and the like.
- a region can be defined as an area within a particular distance (e.g., one hundred feet) of particular GPS coordinates.
- the location can be a semantic location or a region surrounding a semantic location.
- a semantic location can be, for example, a shopping mall, a park, a landmark, or some other area of interest.
- the ad system 202 includes an ad repository 210 and a collection of categories 212 that can be associated with users, ads, or both.
- the ad system 202 includes an ad-category mapping 214 that specifies which categories are associated with which ads.
- the ad system 202 includes records of users and their location histories 216 . Example location histories are described in greater detail below with respect to FIGS. 4A and 4B .
- the ad system 202 includes a user-category mapping 218 that associates each user with one or more categories.
- users 206 control whether the ad system 202 includes records of their location histories 216 .
- the users 206 can send preferences information to the ad system 202 indicating that the ad system 202 is or is not to include or track location histories.
- a user can control the extent to which the ad system 202 maintains that user's location history.
- the user can set a preference that the ad system 202 is only to keep a certain number of specific locations, or only locations at certain times, or only locations at certain places, and so on.
- users 206 can access and change their location histories on the ad system 202 .
- the ad system 202 can provide a web page where users can see their location histories and add or delete locations, times associated with locations, and other information.
- Ad logs 222 allow the ad system 202 to track ads presented to users 206 , conversions associated with the presented ads, and other information.
- the ad logs 222 can identify particular ads presented to individual users (e.g., impressions).
- the ad logs can include an ad identifier, a time stamp, a user identifier (e.g., user ID, device ID, etc.), an advertiser identifier, and the like.
- the ad logs 222 can also include a log of conversions associated with the presented ads (e.g., conversion events associated with particular user actions responsive to a presented ad), categories associated with users 206 , and the like.
- users' locations are logged anonymously.
- information is stored to identify each user.
- Various techniques can be used to protect users' privacy.
- the ad system 202 provides reports to advertisers.
- the reports can indicate information in the ad logs 222 .
- the reports indicate which user categories are particularly lucrative for a given ad campaign.
- FIG. 2B is a block diagram showing an example ad system 202 and example users 206 where users 206 store location histories 220 .
- users maintain their location histories 220 locally, for example, on users' mobile devices. Example location histories are described in greater detail below with respect to FIGS. 4A and 4B .
- users can store categories they are associated with locally, or the system can include a user-category mapping 218 , or both users and the system can store categories.
- some users maintain their location histories locally
- the system 202 includes records of other users (who do not maintain their location histories locally) and their location histories 216 .
- the system 202 can first check its own records 216 and, if it does not have a record for the user, the system 202 can then poll the user's mobile device for a location history.
- Various configurations of location histories and user-category mappings are possible.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process 300 for associating a user with a category.
- the process 300 is performed by a system, e.g., ad system 202 or advertising management system 104 .
- Location information is received from a user at a plurality of locations (step 302 ).
- the explicit location information e.g., discrete location data or a location history
- GPS global positioning system
- a location associated with the user is determined based on other available information, for example, using an internet protocol (IP) address, location coordinates from a router for a wireless local area network (LAN), one or more search queries (e.g., from a search service), or the like.
- IP internet protocol
- LAN wireless local area network
- search queries e.g., from a search service
- location information is received from the user while the user is located at each location.
- location information is received as part of a location history stored on a device associated with the user (e.g., a mobile device).
- a device associated with the user e.g., a mobile device
- the user's mobile device can store location information for one or more of the user's previous locations and provide that location information (e.g., with a request for a content item).
- a location history for the user is determined (step 304 ).
- the location history is the location information for the user at one or more locations including, for example, the current location as well as previously visited locations.
- the system uses the location information to determine location data points for the user. For example, the system can take location information including several geographic names and convert the location information into latitude and longitude coordinates.
- the location history for the user can be specified using various formats and various location data points.
- the location data is filtered (e.g., by an ad system 202 ) in order to remove location data that is not associated with a category.
- FIG. 4A shows a diagram of an example location history 400 for an example user.
- the location history 400 is stored as a table. Rows in the table represent location data points.
- the first row 402 of the table specifies that the example user's home is located at “Address1.”
- the system determines Address1 using various techniques. For example, the system can use the user's location on nights and weekends or other information (e.g., a user's profile can indicate their home address).
- the second row 404 of the table specifies that the example user's work place is located at “Address2.”
- the system determines Address2 using various techniques. For example, the system can use the user's location during working hours (e.g., weekdays between specified hours).
- the third row 406 of the table specifies that the example user's vacation home is located at global positioning system (GPS) coordinates “GPS Coords1.”
- GPS global positioning system
- the system can, for example, search location information from the user for locations where the user goes once or twice a year for about a week.
- the location history 400 can include various other location data points for the example user, using various formats and types of location information (e.g., in the fourth row 408 of the table).
- the location history 400 can include the location of the restaurant where the user most frequently eats lunch, the location of the user's child's school, the location of the user's gym, and so on.
- Other types of locations can include particular regions within a city, e.g., a financial district, downtown, a shopping district, and the like.
- FIG. 4B shows a diagram of an example location history 420 for an example user.
- the location history is stored as a table. Rows 422 in the table represent location data points. Each location data point has an associated timestamp 424 (e.g., including time and date) and a location 426 (e.g., specified by latitude and longitude coordinates).
- timestamp 424 e.g., including time and date
- location 426 e.g., specified by latitude and longitude coordinates.
- the user's location history is analyzed to derive one or more categories for the user (step 306 ).
- the system compares the user's location history with one or more other location histories having existing associated categories. For example, if the user's location history is similar to another location history associated with a category, the user's location history can be associated with that category. So a user who goes to ski-slopes every weekend can be associated with a “skier” category, and a user who goes to grocery stores every weekend can be associated with “coupons,” for example.
- Possible categories can be identified by manual input (e.g., defined by one or more individuals) or according to particular data processing techniques. For example, the categories can be extracted from one or more existing sets of categories or data sets can be processed to derive categories. The categories can be derived by the ad system or can, alternatively, be received from an external source (e.g., an advertiser). Received categories can be filtered to a smaller number of categories according to one or more criteria. Examples of categories include homeowner or renter, income over or under a threshold, spender or saver, conservative or liberal, and so on.
- clustering is used to derive categories for the user.
- the user is associated with a vector of qualities, for instance, location of home, location of vacation, location of ad clicks, commonly frequented locations, time of day for ad conversions, and so on.
- Other users are also associated with vectors of qualities.
- the set of vectors for users can be partitioned into subsets, where the similarity between any two vectors in the subset exceeds the similarity between these vectors and vectors in other subsets.
- Each subset can be assigned a category, and users whose vectors match the subset can be associated with the category.
- Various functions for determining a similarity between two vectors are possible, for example, k-neighborhood algorithms, various Bayesian models, and others.
- the user is associated with the one or more derived categories (step 308 ).
- records of users and their location histories e.g., users and location histories 216
- mappings between users and categories e.g., user-category mapping 218
- the information regarding the derived category is sent to the user (e.g., to the user's mobile device).
- the information can be stored locally with the user and can be sent back to an ad system, for instance, when the user requests a content item (e.g., a request for an ad for the user can identify the one or more categories associated with the user).
- the category is used to boost one or more candidate content items for delivery to the user (step 310 ).
- the system boosts candidate content items that match one or more categories associated with the user. Boosting content items using category-location associations is described in greater detail below with respect to FIG. 6 .
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process 500 for updating a user's location history and associated categories.
- the process 500 is performed by a system (e.g., ad system 202 or advertising management system 104 ).
- Additional location information is periodically checked for (step 502 ).
- the user is polled (e.g., the user's mobile device) for additional location information.
- a publisher e.g., publisher 106
- other entity is polled.
- the additional location information is optionally filtered (step 504 ). An attempt is made to determine whether the additional information will influence a user's existing category or permit derivation of a new category for the user. If the additional information will not influence whether the user is associated with any categories, the additional location information can be discarded (and not included in the user's location history). For example, if the user's home address is known, then additional data indicating that the user is at the home address on a weekend will not influence any categories for the user. In another example, some locations can be associated with no categories; such locations can be filtered from further consideration.
- the location history including the new location information, is analyzed (step 506 ). Three possible actions are taken based on the analysis (step 508 ).
- the user is associated with the new category (in some implementations, in addition to any other categories that the user is already associated with) (step 512 ).
- the existing associated category is altered (step 514 ).
- a category can be changed based on new information (e.g., when a user goes from a renter to a homeowner) or to correct a previous mistake.
- the additional location information is discarded (step 516 ).
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart of an example process 600 for serving an ad to a user.
- the process 600 is performed by a system (e.g., ad system 202 or advertising management system 104 ).
- a request for an ad for a user is received (step 602 ).
- the request is received from, for example, a publisher (e.g., a publisher 106 ) or directly from the user.
- One or more candidate ads are determined (step 604 ).
- Various techniques and information can be used to identify candidate ads. For example, user information (profile, demographics, location generally), publisher content, and the like can be used.
- ads can be associated with particular keywords that can be matched to other content (e.g., search query terms, web page text).
- advertisers specify that certain ads or groups of ads are to be targeted to users associated with certain categories.
- user information (for instance, any categories associated with the user based on the user's location history) can identify likely interests of the user which can be matched to ad keywords.
- candidate ads are scored based on various factors including the advertiser's financial agreements with the ad system (e.g., cost per impression), and the degree to which the ad matches the other content.
- Candidate ads can be ranked in order according to their score.
- a category is identified for the user (step 606 ).
- the category can be retrieved using a user-category mapping (e.g., user-category mapping 216 ).
- the category was derived using a location history for the user, and the location history included location data points for the user.
- the user's location history and category is stored local to a system performing the process 600 (e.g., ad system 202 ).
- the user's location history or category is local to the user, and the user provides it with a request for a content item.
- Categories associated with one or more candidate ads are identified (step 608 ).
- ads can be selected from an ad repository (e.g., ad repository 210 ) and categories associated with those ads can be identified using an ad-category mapping (e.g., ad-category mapping 214 ).
- One or more of the candidate ads matching the user's one or more categories are boosted (step 610 ).
- each candidate ad has an associated score.
- the candidate ads can be ranked in an order defined by the respective scores.
- the score for the candidate ads matching the one or more categories can be adjusted, increasing the score (e.g., by adding an additional weight to a scoring function or by adding a specified amount or percentage to the score).
- the adjusted score will not change the ranking of a matching candidate ad, depending on the score of the ads above the matching candidate ad in the ranking order.
- the amount that each candidate ad's score is boosted is variable and can depend on various criteria.
- candidate ads with closely matching categories can be boosted more than candidate ads with weakly matching categories.
- candidate ads having more categories matching categories associated with the user are boosted more than candidate ads having fewer matching categories.
- some categories are identified as having greater relevance than other categories, and candidate ads matching those categories are boosted a greater amount than other candidate ads.
- One or more ads are selected to serve to the user (step 612 ).
- the highest ranked candidate ad or ads are selected.
- the number of candidate ads selected can depend on the number of ads requested.
- the highest ranked candidate ad or ads were not boosted.
- the difference between two candidate ads in the ranking can be greater than the amount of the change in score from the boosting so that the relative position of the two candidate ads is unchanged.
- the change in score from the boosting can cause the score of a boosted candidate ad to be greater than one or more higher ranked ads.
- the ranking can be reordered to position the boosted ad ahead of those candidate ads.
- the selected ads are served to the user (step 614 ).
- the selected ads are provided directly to the user's device (e.g., for incorporation into content presented on the device).
- a user's mobile browser can integrate the ads into presented web content.
