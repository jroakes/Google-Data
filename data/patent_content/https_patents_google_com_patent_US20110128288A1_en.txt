Definitions
- the disclosed embodiments relate generally to selecting one or more regions of interest in a visual query for processing.
- Text-based or term-based searching wherein a user inputs a word or phrase into a search engine and receives a variety of results is a useful tool for searching.
- term based queries require that a user input relevant terms.
- a user may wish to know information about an image or a particular portion of an image. For example, a user might want to know the name of a person in a photograph, or a user might want to know the name of a flower or bird in a picture. Accordingly, a system that can receive a visual query and provide search results would be desirable.
- a computer-implemented method of processing a visual query includes performing the following steps on a client system having one or more processors, a display, and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors.
- An image is received from a client application.
- the image has a first two-dimensional image resolution.
- the first two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the image.

- the visual query is a drawing produced by a content authoring program ( 736 , FIG. 5 ).
- the user “draws” the visual query, while in other embodiments the user scans or photographs the visual query.
- Some visual queries are created using an image generation application such as Acrobat, a photograph editing program, a drawing program, or an image editing program.
- a visual query could come from a user taking a photograph of his friend on his mobile phone and then submitting the photograph as the visual query to the server system.
- the visual query could also come from a user scanning a page of a magazine, or taking a screen shot of a webpage on a desktop computer and then submitting the scan or screen shot as the visual query to the server system.
- the visual query is submitted to the server system 106 through a search engine extension of a browser application, through a plug-in for a browser application, or by a search application executed by the client system 102 .
- Visual queries may also be submitted by other application programs (executed by a client system) that support or generate images which can be transmitted to a remotely located server by the client system.
- the visual query can be a combination of text and non-text elements ( 208 ).
- a query could be a scan of a magazine page containing images and text, such as a person standing next to a road sign.

- Visual queries may have two or more distinct elements.
- a visual query could include a barcode and an image of a product or product name on a product package.
- the visual query could be a picture of a book cover that includes the title of the book, cover art, and a bar code.
- one visual query will produce two or more distinct search results corresponding to different portions of the visual query, as discussed in more detail below.
- the server system processes the visual query as follows.
- the front end server system sends the visual query to a plurality of parallel search systems for simultaneous processing ( 210 ).
- Each search system implements a distinct visual query search process, i.e., an individual search system processes the visual query by its own processing scheme.
- one of the search systems to which the visual query is sent for processing is an optical character recognition (OCR) search system.
- OCR optical character recognition
- one of the search systems to which the visual query is sent for processing is a facial recognition search system.
- the plurality of search systems running distinct visual query search processes includes at least: optical character recognition (OCR), facial recognition, and another query-by-image process other than OCR and facial recognition ( 212 ).
- the other query-by-image process is selected from a set of processes that includes but is not limited to product recognition, bar code recognition, object-or-object-category recognition, named entity recognition, and color recognition ( 212 ).
- named entity recognition occurs as a post process of the OCR search system, wherein the text result of the OCR is analyzed for famous people, locations, objects and the like, and then the terms identified as being named entities are searched in the term query server system ( 118 , FIG. 1 ).
- images of famous landmarks, logos, people, album covers, trademarks, etc. are recognized by an image-to-terms search system.
- a distinct named entity query-by-image process separate from the image-to-terms search system is utilized.
- the object-or-object category recognition system recognizes generic result types like “car.” In some embodiments, this system also recognizes product brands, particular product models, and the like, and provides more specific descriptions, like “Porsche.” Some of the search systems could be special user specific search systems. For example, particular versions of color recognition and facial recognition could be a special search systems used by the blind.
- the front end server system receives results from the parallel search systems ( 214 ).
- the results are accompanied by a search score.
- some of the search systems will find no relevant results. For example, if the visual query was a picture of a flower, the facial recognition search system and the bar code search system will not find any relevant results.
- a null or zero search score is received from that search system ( 216 ).
- the front end server if it does not receive a result from a search system after a pre-defined period of time (e.g., 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 seconds), it will process the received results as if that timed out server produced a null search score and will process the received results from the other search systems.
- a pre-defined period of time e.g., 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 seconds
- one of the predefined criteria excludes void results.
- a pre-defined criterion is that the results are not void.
- one of the predefined criteria excludes results having numerical score (e.g., for a relevance factor) that falls below a pre-defined minimum score.
- the plurality of search results are filtered ( 220 ).
- the results are only filtered if the total number of results exceeds a pre-defined threshold.
- all the results are ranked but the results falling below a pre-defined minimum score are excluded.
- the content of the results are filtered. For example, if some of the results contain private information or personal protected information, these results are filtered out.
- the visual query server system creates a compound search result ( 222 ).
- a compound search result ( 222 )
- the term query server system ( 118 , FIG. 1 ) may augment the results from one of the parallel search systems with results from a term search, where the additional results are either links to documents or information sources, or text and/or images containing additional information that may be relevant to the visual query.
- the compound search result may contain an OCR result and a link to a named entity in the OCR document ( 224 ).
- the OCR search system ( 112 -B, FIG. 1 ) or the front end visual query processing server ( 110 , FIG. 1 ) recognizes likely relevant words in the text. For example, it may recognize named entities such as famous people or places. The named entities are submitted as query terms to the term query server system ( 118 , FIG. 1 ). In some embodiments, the term query results produced by the term query server system are embedded in the visual query result as a “link.” In some embodiments, the term query results are returned as separate links. For example, if a picture of a book cover were the visual query, it is likely that an object recognition search system will produce a high scoring hit for the book.
- the term query results are presented in a labeled group to distinguish them from the visual query results.
- the results may be searched individually, or a search may be performed using all the recognized named entities in the search query to produce particularly relevant additional search results.
- the visual query is a scanned travel brochure about Paris
- the returned result may include links to the term query server system 118 for initiating a search on a term query “Notre Dame.”
- compound search results include results from text searches for recognized famous images.
- the visual query server system then sends at least one result to the client system ( 226 ).
- the visual query processing server receives a plurality of search results from at least some of the plurality of search systems, it will then send at least one of the plurality of search results to the client system.
- only one search system will return relevant results.
- the OCR server's results may be relevant.
- only one result from one search system may be relevant.
- only the product related to a scanned bar code may be relevant. In these instances, the front end visual processing server will return only the relevant search result(s).
- a plurality of search results are sent to the client system, and the plurality of search results include search results from more than one of the parallel search systems ( 228 ). This may occur when more than one distinct image is in the visual query. For example, if the visual query were a picture of a person riding a horse, results for facial recognition of the person could be displayed along with object identification results for the horse. In some embodiments, all the results for a particular query by image search system are grouped and presented together. For example, the top N facial recognition results are displayed under a heading “facial recognition results” and the top N object recognition results are displayed together under a heading “object recognition results.” Alternatively, as discussed below, the search results from a particular image search system may be grouped by image region.
- the search results may include both OCR results and one or more image-match results ( 230 ).
- the user may wish to learn more about a particular search result. For example, if the visual query was a picture of a dolphin and the “image to terms” search system returns the following terms “water,” “dolphin,” “blue,” and “Flipper;” the user may wish to run a text based query term search on “Flipper.”
- the query term server system 118 , FIG. 1
- the search on the selected term(s) is run.
- the corresponding search term results are displayed on the client system either separately or in conjunction with the visual query results ( 232 ).
- the front end visual query processing server ( 110 , FIG. 1 ) automatically (i.e., without receiving any user command, other than the initial visual query) chooses one or more top potential text results for the visual query, runs those text results on the term query server system 118 , and then returns those term query results along with the visual query result to the client system as a part of sending at least one search result to the client system ( 232 ).
- the front end server runs a term query on “Flipper” and returns those term query results along with the visual query results to the client system.
- results are displayed as a compound search result ( 222 ) as explained above.
- the results are part of a search result list instead of or in addition to a compound search result.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating the process for responding to a visual query with an interactive results document.
- the first three operations ( 202 , 210 , 214 ) are described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- an interactive results document is created ( 302 ).
- the interactive results document includes one or more visual identifiers of respective sub-portions of the visual query.
- Each visual identifier has at least one user selectable link to at least one of the search results.
- a visual identifier identifies a respective sub-portion of the visual query.
- the interactive results document has only one visual identifier with one user selectable link to one or more results.
- a respective user selectable link to one or more of the search results has an activation region, and the activation region corresponds to the sub-portion of the visual query that is associated with a corresponding visual identifier.
- the visual identifier is a bounding box ( 304 ).
- the bounding box encloses a sub-portion of the visual query as shown in FIG. 12A .
- the bounding box need not be a square or rectangular box shape but can be any sort of shape including circular, oval, conformal (e.g., to an object in, entity in or region of the visual query), irregular or any other shape as shown in FIG. 12B .
- the bounding box outlines the boundary of an identifiable entity in a sub-portion of the visual query ( 306 ).
- each bounding box includes a user selectable link to one or more search results, where the user selectable link has an activation region corresponding to a sub-portion of the visual query surrounded by the bounding box.
- search results that correspond to the image in the outlined sub-portion are returned.

- the labels are color coded.
- each respective visual identifiers is formatted for presentation in a visually distinctive manner in accordance with a type of recognized entity in the respective sub-portion of the visual query. For example, as shown in FIG. 13 , bounding boxes around a product, a person, a trademark, and the two textual areas are each presented with distinct cross-hatching patterns, representing differently colored transparent bounding boxes.
- the visual identifiers are formatted for presentation in visually distinctive manners such as overlay color, overlay pattern, label background color, label background pattern, label font color, and border color.

- the interactive results document may include a bounding box around only the bar code.
- the bar code search result is displayed.
- the bar code search result may include one result, the name of the product corresponding to that bar code, or the bar code results may include several results such as a variety of places in which that product can be purchased, reviewed, etc.
- the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include results from a term query search on at least one of the terms in the text.
- the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include one or more of: name, handle, contact information, account information, address information, current location of a related mobile device associated with the person whose face is contained in the selectable sub-portion, other images of the person whose face is contained in the selectable sub-portion, and potential image matches for the person's face.
- the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include one or more of: product information, a product review, an option to initiate purchase of the product, an option to initiate a bid on the product, a list of similar products, and a list of related products.
- a respective user selectable link in the interactive results document includes anchor text, which is displayed in the document without having to activate the link.
- the anchor text provides information, such as a key word or term, related to the information obtained when the link is activated.
- Anchor text may be displayed as part of the label ( 307 ), or in a portion of a bounding box ( 304 ), or as additional information displayed when a user hovers a cursor over a user selectable link for a pre-determined period of time such as 1 second.
- a respective user selectable link in the interactive results document is a link to a search engine for searching for information or documents corresponding to a text-based query (sometimes herein called a term query).
- Activation of the link causes execution of the search by the search engine, where the query and the search engine are specified by the link (e.g., the search engine is specified by a URL in the link and the text-based search query is specified by a URL parameter of the link), with results returned to the client system.
- the link in this example may include anchor text specifying the text or terms in the search query.
- the interactive results document produced in response to a visual query can include a plurality of links that correspond to results from the same search system.
- a visual query may be an image or picture of a group of people.
- the interactive results document may include bounding boxes around each person, which when activated returns results from the facial recognition search system for each face in the group.
- a plurality of links in the interactive results document corresponds to search results from more than one search system ( 310 ). For example, if a picture of a person and a dog was submitted as the visual query, bounding boxes in the interactive results document may outline the person and the dog separately.
- the interactive results document contains an OCR result and an image match result ( 312 ).
- the interactive results document may include visual identifiers for the person and for the text in the sign.
- the interactive results document may include visual identifiers for photographs or trademarks in advertisements on the page as well as a visual identifier for the text of an article also on that page.
- the interactive results document After the interactive results document has been created, it is sent to the client system ( 314 ).
- the interactive results document (e.g., document 1200 , FIG. 15 ) is sent in conjunction with a list of search results from one or more parallel search systems, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the interactive results document is displayed at the client system above or otherwise adjacent to a list of search results from one or more parallel search systems ( 315 ) as shown in FIG. 15 .
- the user will interact with the results document by selecting a visual identifier in the results document.
- the server system receives from the client system information regarding the user selection of a visual identifier in the interactive results document ( 316 ).
- the link is activated by selecting an activation region inside a bounding box.
- the link is activated by a user selection of a visual identifier of a sub-portion of the visual query, which is not a bounding box.
- the linked visual identifier is a hot button, a label located near the sub-portion, an underlined word in text, or other representation of an object or subject in the visual query.
- the search results list is presented with the interactive results document ( 315 )
- the search result in the search results list corresponding to the selected link is identified.
- the cursor will jump or automatically move to the first result corresponding to the selected link.
- selecting a link in the interactive results document causes the search results list to scroll or jump so as to display at least a first result corresponding to the selected link.
- the results list is reordered such that the first result corresponding to the link is displayed at the top of the results list.
- the visual query server system when the user selects the user selectable link ( 316 ) the visual query server system sends at least a subset of the results, related to a corresponding sub-portion of the visual query, to the client for display to the user ( 318 ).
- the user can select multiple visual identifiers concurrently and will receive a subset of results for all of the selected visual identifiers at the same time.
- search results corresponding to the user selectable links are preloaded onto the client prior to user selection of any of the user selectable links so as to provide search results to the user virtually instantaneously in response to user selection of one or more links in the interactive results document.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating the communications between a client and a visual query server system.
- the client 102 receives a visual query from a user/querier ( 402 ).
- visual queries can only be accepted from users who have signed up for or “opted in” to the visual query system.
- searches for facial recognition matches are only performed for users who have signed up for the facial recognition visual query system, while other types of visual queries are performed for anyone regardless of whether they have “opted in” to the facial recognition portion.
- the format of the visual query can take many forms.
- the visual query will likely contain one or more subjects located in sub-portions of the visual query document.
- the client system 102 performs type recognition pre-processing on the visual query ( 404 ).
- the client system 102 searches for particular recognizable patterns in this pre-processing system. For example, for some visual queries the client may recognize colors.
- the client may recognize that a particular sub-portion is likely to contain text (because that area is made up of small dark characters surrounded by light space etc.)
- the client may contain any number of pre-processing type recognizers, or type recognition modules.
- the client will have a type recognition module (barcode recognition 406 ) for recognizing bar codes. It may do so by recognizing the distinctive striped pattern in a rectangular area.
- the client will have a type recognition module (face detection 408 ) for recognizing that a particular subject or sub-portion of the visual query is likely to contain a face.
- the recognized “type” is returned to the user for verification.
- the client system 102 may return a message stating “a bar code has been found in your visual query, are you interested in receiving bar code query results?”
- the message may even indicate the sub-portion of the visual query where the type has been found.
- this presentation is similar to the interactive results document discussed with reference to FIG. 3 . For example, it may outline a sub-portion of the visual query and indicate that the sub-portion is likely to contain a face, and ask the user if they are interested in receiving facial recognition results.
- the client 102 After the client 102 performs the optional pre-processing of the visual query, the client sends the visual query to the visual query server system 106 , specifically to the front end visual query processing server 110 .
- the client if pre-processing produced relevant results, i.e., if one of the type recognition modules produced results above a certain threshold, indicating that the query or a sub-portion of the query is likely to be of a particular type (face, text, barcode etc.), the client will pass along information regarding the results of the pre-processing. For example, the client may indicate that the face recognition module is 75% sure that a particular sub-portion of the visual query contains a face.
- the pre-processing results include one or more subject type values (e.g., bar code, face, text, etc.).
- the pre-processing results sent to the visual query server system include one or more of: for each subject type value in the pre-processing results, information identifying a sub-portion of the visual query corresponding to the subject type value, and for each subject type value in the pre-processing results, a confidence value indicating a level of confidence in the subject type value and/or the identification of a corresponding sub-portion of the visual query.
- the front end server 110 receives the visual query from the client system ( 202 ).
- the visual query received may contain the pre-processing information discussed above.
- the front end server sends the visual query to a plurality of parallel search systems ( 210 ). If the front end server 110 received pre-processing information regarding the likelihood that a sub-portion contained a subject of a certain type, the front end server may pass this information along to one or more of the parallel search systems. For example, it may pass on the information that a particular sub-portion is likely to be a face so that the facial recognition search system 112 -A can process that subsection of the visual query first.
- sending the same information may be used by the other parallel search systems to ignore that sub-portion or analyze other sub-portions first.
- the front end server will not pass on the pre-processing information to the parallel search systems, but will instead use this information to augment the way in which it processes the results received from the parallel search systems.
- the front end server 110 receives a plurality of search results from the parallel search systems ( 214 ). The front end server may then perform a variety of ranking and filtering, and may create an interactive search result document as explained with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3 . If the front end server 110 received pre-processing information regarding the likelihood that a sub-portion contained a subject of a certain type, it may filter and order by giving preference to those results that match the pre-processed recognized subject type. If the user indicated that a particular type of result was requested, the front end server will take the user's requests into account when processing the results.
- the front end server may filter out all other results if the user only requested bar code information, or the front end server will list all results pertaining to the requested type prior to listing the other results. If an interactive visual query document is returned, the server may pre-search the links associated with the type of result the user indicated interest in, while only providing links for performing related searches for the other subjects indicated in the interactive results document. Then the front end server 110 sends the search results to the client system ( 226 ).
- the client 102 receives the results from the server system ( 412 ). When applicable, these results will include the results that match the type of result found in the pre-processing stage. For example, in some embodiments they will include one or more bar code results ( 414 ) or one or more facial recognition results ( 416 ). If the client's pre-processing modules had indicated that a particular type of result was likely, and that result was found, the found results of that type will be listed prominently.
- the user will select or annotate one or more of the results ( 418 ).
- the user may select one search result, may select a particular type of search result, and/or may select a portion of an interactive results document ( 420 ).
- Selection of a result is implicit feedback that the returned result was relevant to the query. Such feedback information can be utilized in future query processing operations.
- An annotation provides explicit feedback about the returned result that can also be utilized in future query processing operations.
- Annotations take the form of corrections of portions of the returned result (like a correction to a mis-OCRed word) or a separate annotation (either free form or structured.)
- the user's selection of one search result is a process that is referred to as a selection among interpretations.
- the user's selection of a particular type of search result generally selecting the result “type” of interest from several different types of returned results (e.g., choosing the OCRed text of an article in a magazine rather than the visual results for the advertisements also on the same page), is a process that is referred to as disambiguation of intent.
- a user may similarly select particular linked words (such as recognized named entities) in an OCRed document as explained in detail with reference to FIG. 8 .
- the user may alternatively or additionally wish to annotate particular search results.
- This annotation may be done in freeform style or in a structured format ( 422 ).
- the annotations may be descriptions of the result or may be reviews of the result. For example, they may indicate the name of subject(s) in the result, or they could indicate “this is a good book” or “this product broke within a year of purchase.”
- Another example of an annotation is a user-drawn bounding box around a sub-portion of the visual query and user-provided text identifying the object or subject inside the bounding box. User annotations are explained in more detail with reference to FIG. 5 .
- the user selections of search results and other annotations are sent to the server system ( 424 ).
- the front end server 110 receives the selections and annotations and further processes them ( 426 ). If the information was a selection of an object, sub-region or term in an interactive results document, further information regarding that selection may be requested, as appropriate. For example, if the selection was of one visual result, more information about that visual result would be requested. If the selection was a word (either from the OCR server or from the Image-to-Terms server) a textual search of that word would be sent to the term query server system 118 . If the selection was of a person from a facial image recognition search system, that person's profile would be requested. If the selection was for a particular portion of an interactive search result document, the underlying visual query results would be requested.
- the server system receives an annotation, the annotation is stored in a query and annotation database 116 , explained with reference to FIG. 5 . Then the information from the annotation database 116 is periodically copied to individual annotation databases for one or more of the parallel server systems, as discussed below with reference to FIGS. 7-10 .
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a client system 102 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the client system 102 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 702 , one or more network or other communications interfaces 704 , memory 712 , and one or more communication buses 714 for interconnecting these components.
- the client system 102 includes a user interface 705 .
- the user interface 705 includes a display device 706 and optionally includes an input means such as a keyboard, mouse, or other input buttons 708 .
- the display device 706 includes a touch sensitive surface 709 , in which case the display 706 / 709 is a touch sensitive display.
- a physical keyboard is optional (e.g., a soft keyboard may be displayed when keyboard entry is needed).
- some client systems use a microphone and voice recognition to supplement or replace the keyboard.
- the client 102 includes a GPS (global positioning satellite) receiver, or other location detection apparatus 707 for determining the location of the client system 102 .
- visual query search services are provided that require the client system 102 to provide the visual query server system to receive location information indicating the location of the client system 102 .
- the client system 102 also includes an image capture device 710 such as a camera or scanner.
- Memory 712 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.
- Memory 712 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 702 .
- Memory 712 or alternately the non-volatile memory device(s) within memory 712 , comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium.
- memory 712 or the computer readable storage medium of memory 712 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof:
- the image region selection module 734 which allows a user to select a particular sub-portion of an image for annotation, also allows the user to choose a search result as a “correct” hit without necessarily further annotating it.
- the user may be presented with a top N number of facial recognition matches and may choose the correct person from that results list.
- more than one type of result will be presented, and the user will choose a type of result.
- the image query may include a person standing next to a tree, but only the results regarding the person is of interest to the user. Therefore, the image selection module 734 allows the user to indicate which type of image is the “correct” type—i.e., the type he is interested in receiving.
- the user may also wish to annotate the search result by adding personal comments or descriptive words using either the annotation text entry module 730 (for filling in a form) or freeform annotation text entry module 732 .
- the optional local image analysis module 738 is a portion of the client application ( 108 , FIG. 1 ). Furthermore, in some embodiments the optional local image analysis module 738 includes one or more programs to perform local image analysis to pre-process or categorize the visual query or a portion thereof. For example, the client application 722 may recognize that the image contains a bar code, a face, or text, prior to submitting the visual query to a search engine. In some embodiments, when the local image analysis module 738 detects that the visual query contains a particular type of image, the module asks the user if they are interested in a corresponding type of search result.
- the local image analysis module 738 may detect a face based on its general characteristics (i.e., without determining which person's face) and provides immediate feedback to the user prior to sending the query on to the visual query server system. It may return a result like, “A face has been detected, are you interested in getting facial recognition matches for this face?” This may save time for the visual query server system ( 106 , FIG. 1 ). For some visual queries, the front end visual query processing server ( 110 , FIG. 1 ) only sends the visual query to the search system 112 corresponding to the type of image recognized by the local image analysis module 738 .
- the visual query to the search system 112 may send the visual query to all of the search systems 112 A-N, but will rank results from the search system 112 corresponding to the type of image recognized by the local image analysis module 738 .
- the manner in which local image analysis impacts on operation of the visual query server system depends on the configuration of the client system, or configuration or processing parameters associated with either the user or the client system.
- the actual content of any particular visual query and the results produced by the local image analysis may cause different visual queries to be handled differently at either or both the client system and the visual query server system.
- bar code recognition is performed in two steps, with analysis of whether the visual query includes a bar code performed on the client system at the local image analysis module 738 . Then the visual query is passed to a bar code search system only if the client determines the visual query is likely to include a bar code. In other embodiments, the bar code search system processes every visual query.
- the client system 102 includes additional client applications 740 .
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a front end visual query processing server system 110 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

- memory 812 or the computer readable storage medium of memory 812 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof:
- the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks the results returned from the one or more parallel search systems ( 112 -A- 112 -N, FIG. 1 ). As already noted above, for some visual queries, only the results from one search system may be relevant. In such an instance, only the relevant search results from that one search system are ranked. For some visual queries, several types of search results may be relevant. In these instances, in some embodiments, the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks all of the results from the search system having the most relevant result (e.g., the result with the highest relevance score) above the results for the less relevant search systems. In other embodiments, the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks a top result from each relevant search system above the remaining results.
- the results ranking and formatting module 824 ranks the results in accordance with a relevance score computed for each of the search results.
- augmented textual queries are performed in addition to the searching on parallel visual search systems.
- textual queries are also performed, their results are presented in a manner visually distinctive from the visual search system results.
- the results ranking and formatting module 824 also formats the results.
- the results are presented in a list format.
- the results are presented by means of an interactive results document.
- both an interactive results document and a list of results are presented.
- the type of query dictates how the results are presented. For example, if more than one searchable subject is detected in the visual query, then an interactive results document is produced, while if only one searchable subject is detected the results will be displayed in list format only.
- the results document creation module 826 is used to create an interactive search results document.
- the interactive search results document may have one or more detected and searched subjects.
- the bounding box creation module 828 creates a bounding box around one or more of the searched subjects.
- the bounding boxes may be rectangular boxes, or may outline the shape(s) of the subject(s).
- the link creation module 830 creates links to search results associated with their respective subject in the interactive search results document. In some embodiments, clicking within the bounding box area activates the corresponding link inserted by the link creation module.
- the query and annotation database 116 contains information that can be used to improve visual query results.
- the user may annotate the image after the visual query results have been presented.
- the user may annotate the image before sending it to the visual query search system. Pre-annotation may help the visual query processing by focusing the results, or running text based searches on the annotated words in parallel with the visual query searches.
- annotated versions of a picture can be made public (e.g., when the user has given permission for publication, for example by designating the image and annotation(s) as not private), so as to be returned as a potential image match hit.
- the information from the query and annotation database 116 is periodically pushed to the parallel search systems 112 , which incorporate relevant portions of the information (if any) into their respective individual databases 114 .
- FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating one of the parallel search systems utilized to process a visual query.

Abstract
A client system receives an image such as a photograph, a screen shot, a scanned image, or a video frame. The image has a first resolution which is likely larger than a maximum resolution for visual queries. As such, if a visual query were created from the image some resolution would be lost. Instead, a user selects a region of interest within the image. The region of interest has a second resolution, which is smaller than the first resolution. The client system then creates a visual query from the region of interest. The visual query has a resolution no larger than a pre-defined maximum resolution for visual queries. Because the visual query is created from the region of interest rather, than the entire received image, most of the resolution is concentrated specifically on the region of interest. The visual query is then sent to a server system.

- The disclosed embodiments relate generally to selecting one or more regions of interest in a visual query for processing.
- Text-based or term-based searching, wherein a user inputs a word or phrase into a search engine and receives a variety of results is a useful tool for searching. However, term based queries require that a user input relevant terms. Sometimes a user may wish to know information about an image or a particular portion of an image. For example, a user might want to know the name of a person in a photograph, or a user might want to know the name of a flower or bird in a picture. Accordingly, a system that can receive a visual query and provide search results would be desirable.
- According to some embodiments, a computer-implemented method of processing a visual query includes performing the following steps on a client system having one or more processors, a display, and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors. An image is received from a client application. The image has a first two-dimensional image resolution. The first two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the image. The client system displays the image on the display. A selection of a region of interest within the image is received from a user. The region of interest has a second two-dimensional image resolution. The second two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to the first and second axes of the region of interest. The client system creates a visual query from the region of interest. The visual query has a third two-dimensional image resolution. The third two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the visual query, such that the first and second components of the third two-dimensional image resolution are each no larger than corresponding components of a predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution for visual queries. The predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to the first and second axes of the visual query. The client system then sends the visual query to a server system.
- In some embodiments, the method further comprises receiving visual query results from the visual query server system corresponding to the region of interest. In some embodiments, the visual query results are displayed concurrently with the region of interest in a results display region of the display.
- In some embodiments, such as after receiving the query results from the first visual query, the method further comprises receiving a selection of a sub-region of interest having a fourth two-dimensional image resolution. The fourth two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the sub-region of interest. The client system creates a new visual query from the sub-region of interest. The new visual query has a fifth two-dimensional image resolution. The fifth two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the new visual query, such that the first and second components of the fifth two-dimensional image resolution are each no larger than corresponding components of the predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution for visual queries. The client system then sends the new visual query to the server system. In some embodiments, the method further comprises receiving visual query results for the new visual query and displaying them.
- In some embodiments, the method further includes receiving an interactive results document from the visual query server system. The interactive results document includes one or more visual identifiers for respective sub-portions of the region of interest. Each visual identifier includes at least one user selectable link to at least one search result corresponding to a recognized entity in the region of interest. The client system displays the interactive results document.
- In some embodiments, when the second two-dimensional image resolution has at least one component that is larger than a corresponding component of the predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution for visual queries, a reduced resolution image corresponding to the region of interest of the image is produced. The reduced resolution image has the third two-dimensional image resolution discussed above.
- In some embodiments, when both components of the second two-dimensional image resolution are smaller than the corresponding components of the predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution for visual queries, a maximum resolution image corresponding to the region of interest of the image is produced. The maximum resolution image has the second two-dimensional image resolution discussed above.
- In some embodiments, the client system includes a touch sensitive display, and the receiving a selection includes receiving a touch by the user on the region of interest on the touch sensitive display. In some embodiments, the receiving the selection includes receiving a selection gesture comprising a line drawn across the region of interest on the touch sensitive display. In some embodiments, the sending is initiated when the user ceases touching the region of interest.
- In some embodiments, the client system comprises a camera. In some embodiments, when the received image comprises a camera preview image, the creating a visual query includes taking a picture with the camera. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the camera focuses on one or more subjects in the region of interest while receiving the selection of a region of interest. If more than one subject is in the region of interest the camera will focus on the most important subject. In some embodiments, the importance is measured based on size, position, context, and/or user profile information. As such, the camera focus time is reduced which further reduces the perceived lag time between selecting a region of interest and receiving corresponding search results for the region of interest.
- In some embodiments, the image is displayed such that the region of interest is visually distinguished from the portion of image not including the region of interest. In some embodiments, the region of interest is visually distinguished by utilizing transparency, shading, color, background pattern, and/or a border.
- According to some embodiments, a client system is provided for processing a visual query. The client system includes one or more central processing units for executing programs, a display, and memory storing one or more programs to be executed by the one or more central processing units. The one or more programs include instructions for performing the following. An image is received from a client application. The image has a first two-dimensional image resolution. The first two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the image. Then the client system displays the image on the display. A selection of a region of interest within the image is received from a user. The region of interest has a second two-dimensional image resolution. The second two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to the first and second axes of the region of interest. The client system creates a visual query from the region of interest. The visual query has a third two-dimensional image resolution. The third two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the visual query, such that the first and second components of the third two-dimensional image resolution are each no larger than corresponding components of a predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution for visual queries. The predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to the first and second axes of the visual query. The client system then sends the visual query to a server system. Such a system may also include program instructions to execute the additional options discussed above.
- According to some embodiments, a computer readable storage medium system for processing a visual query is provided. The computer readable storage medium stores one or more programs configured for execution by a computer, the one or more programs comprising instructions for performing the following. An image is received from a client application. The image has a first two-dimensional image resolution. The first two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the image. Then the client system displays the image. A selection of a region of interest within the image is received from a user. The region of interest has a second two-dimensional image resolution. The second two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to the first and second axes of the region of interest. The client system creates a visual query from the region of interest. The visual query has a third two-dimensional image resolution. The third two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the visual query, such that the first and second components of the third two-dimensional image resolution are each no larger than corresponding components of a predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution for visual queries. The predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to the first and second axes of the visual query. The client system then sends the visual query to a server system. Such a system may also include program instructions to execute the additional options discussed above. Such a computer readable storage medium may also include program instructions to execute the additional options discussed above.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a computer network that includes a visual query server system according to some embodiments. Thecomputer network 100 includes one ormore client systems 102 and a visualquery server system 106. One ormore communications networks 104 interconnect these components. Thecommunications network 104 may be any of a variety of networks, including local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), wireless networks, wireline networks, the Internet, or a combination of such networks. - The
client system 102 includes aclient application 108, which is executed by the client system, for receiving a visual query (e.g.,visual query 1102 ofFIG. 11 ). A visual query is an image that is submitted as a query to a search engine or search system. Examples of visual queries, without limitations include photographs, scanned documents and images, and drawings. In some embodiments, theclient application 108 is selected from the set consisting of a search application, a search engine plug-in for a browser application, and a search engine extension for a browser application. In some embodiments, theclient application 108 is an “omnivorous” search box, which allows a user to drag and drop any format of image into the search box to be used as the visual query. - A
client system 102 sends queries to and receives data from the visualquery server system 106. Theclient system 102 may be any computer or other device that is capable of communicating with the visualquery server system 106. Examples include, without limitation, desktop and notebook computers, mainframe computers, server computers, mobile devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, network terminals, and set-top boxes. - The visual
query server system 106 includes a front end visualquery processing server 110. Thefront end server 110 receives a visual query from theclient 102, and sends the visual query to a plurality ofparallel search systems 112 for simultaneous processing. Thesearch systems 112 each implement a distinct visual query search process and access theircorresponding databases 114 as necessary to process the visual query by their distinct search process. For example, a face recognition search system 112-A will access a facial image database 114-A to look for facial matches to the image query. As will be explained in more detail with regard toFIG. 9 , if the visual query contains a face, the facial recognition search system 112-A will return one or more search results (e.g., names, matching faces, etc.) from the facial image database 114-A. In another example, the optical character recognition (OCR) search system 112-B, converts any recognizable text in the visual query into text for return as one or more search results. In the optical character recognition (OCR) search system 112-B, an OCR database 114-B may be accessed to recognize particular fonts or text patterns as explained in more detail with regard toFIG. 8 . - Any number of
parallel search systems 112 may be used. Some examples include a facial recognition search system 112-A, an OCR search system 112-B, an image-to-terms search system 112-C (which may recognize an object or an object category), a product recognition search system (which may be configured to recognize 2-D images such as book covers and CDs and may also be configured to recognized 3-D images such as furniture), bar code recognition search system (which recognizes 1D and 2D style bar codes), a named entity recognition search system, landmark recognition (which may configured to recognize particular famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and may also be configured to recognize a corpus of specific images such as billboards), place recognition aided by geo-location information provided by a GPS receiver in theclient system 102 or mobile phone network, a color recognition search system, and a similar image search system (which searches for and identifies images similar to a visual query). Further search systems can be added as additional parallel search systems, represented inFIG. 1 by system 112-N. All of the search systems, except the OCR search system, are collectively defined herein as search systems performing an image-match process. All of the search systems including the OCR search system are collectively referred to as query-by-image search systems. In some embodiments, the visualquery server system 106 includes a facial recognition search system 112-A, an OCR search system 112-B, and at least one other query-by-image search system 112. - The
parallel search systems 112 each individually process the visual search query and return their results to the frontend server system 110. In some embodiments, thefront end server 100 may perform one or more analyses on the search results such as one or more of: aggregating the results into a compound document, choosing a subset of results to display, and ranking the results as will be explained in more detail with regard toFIG. 6 . Thefront end server 110 communicates the search results to theclient system 102. - The
client system 102 presents the one or more search results to the user. The results may be presented on a display, by an audio speaker, or any other means used to communicate information to a user. The user may interact with the search results in a variety of ways. In some embodiments, the user's selections, annotations, and other interactions with the search results are transmitted to the visualquery server system 106 and recorded along with the visual query in a query andannotation database 116. Information in the query and annotation database can be used to improve visual query results. In some embodiments, the information from the query andannotation database 116 is periodically pushed to theparallel search systems 112, which incorporate any relevant portions of the information into their respectiveindividual databases 114. - The
computer network 100 optionally includes a termquery server system 118, for performing searches in response to term queries. A term query is a query containing one or more terms, as opposed to a visual query which contains an image. The termquery server system 118 may be used to generate search results that supplement information produced by the various search engines in the visualquery server system 106. The results returned from the termquery server system 118 may include any format. The termquery server system 118 may include textual documents, images, video, etc. While termquery server system 118 is shown as a separate system inFIG. 1 , optionally the visualquery server system 106 may include a termquery server system 118. - Additional information about the operation of the visual
query server system 106 is provided below with respect to the flowcharts inFIGS. 2-4 . -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a visual query server system method for responding to a visual query, according to certain embodiments of the invention. Each of the operations shown inFIG. 2 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or computer readable storage medium. - The visual query server system receives a visual query from a client system (202). The client system, for example, may be a desktop computing device, a mobile device, or another similar device (204) as explained with reference to
FIG. 1 . An example visual query on an example client system is shown inFIG. 11 . - The visual query is an image document of any suitable format. For example, the visual query can be a photograph, a screen shot, a scanned image, or a frame or a sequence of multiple frames of a video (206). In some embodiments, the visual query is a drawing produced by a content authoring program (736,
FIG. 5 ). As such, in some embodiments, the user “draws” the visual query, while in other embodiments the user scans or photographs the visual query. Some visual queries are created using an image generation application such as Acrobat, a photograph editing program, a drawing program, or an image editing program. For example, a visual query could come from a user taking a photograph of his friend on his mobile phone and then submitting the photograph as the visual query to the server system. The visual query could also come from a user scanning a page of a magazine, or taking a screen shot of a webpage on a desktop computer and then submitting the scan or screen shot as the visual query to the server system. In some embodiments, the visual query is submitted to theserver system 106 through a search engine extension of a browser application, through a plug-in for a browser application, or by a search application executed by theclient system 102. Visual queries may also be submitted by other application programs (executed by a client system) that support or generate images which can be transmitted to a remotely located server by the client system. - The visual query can be a combination of text and non-text elements (208). For example, a query could be a scan of a magazine page containing images and text, such as a person standing next to a road sign. A visual query can include an image of a person's face, whether taken by a camera embedded in the client system or a document scanned by or otherwise received by the client system. A visual query can also be a scan of a document containing only text. The visual query can also be an image of numerous distinct subjects, such as several birds in a forest, a person and an object (e.g., car, park bench, etc.), a person and an animal (e.g., pet, farm animal, butterfly, etc.). Visual queries may have two or more distinct elements. For example, a visual query could include a barcode and an image of a product or product name on a product package. For example, the visual query could be a picture of a book cover that includes the title of the book, cover art, and a bar code. In some instances, one visual query will produce two or more distinct search results corresponding to different portions of the visual query, as discussed in more detail below.
- The server system processes the visual query as follows. The front end server system sends the visual query to a plurality of parallel search systems for simultaneous processing (210). Each search system implements a distinct visual query search process, i.e., an individual search system processes the visual query by its own processing scheme.
- In some embodiments, one of the search systems to which the visual query is sent for processing is an optical character recognition (OCR) search system. In some embodiments, one of the search systems to which the visual query is sent for processing is a facial recognition search system. In some embodiments, the plurality of search systems running distinct visual query search processes includes at least: optical character recognition (OCR), facial recognition, and another query-by-image process other than OCR and facial recognition (212). The other query-by-image process is selected from a set of processes that includes but is not limited to product recognition, bar code recognition, object-or-object-category recognition, named entity recognition, and color recognition (212).
- In some embodiments, named entity recognition occurs as a post process of the OCR search system, wherein the text result of the OCR is analyzed for famous people, locations, objects and the like, and then the terms identified as being named entities are searched in the term query server system (118,
FIG. 1 ). In other embodiments, images of famous landmarks, logos, people, album covers, trademarks, etc. are recognized by an image-to-terms search system. In other embodiments, a distinct named entity query-by-image process separate from the image-to-terms search system is utilized. The object-or-object category recognition system recognizes generic result types like “car.” In some embodiments, this system also recognizes product brands, particular product models, and the like, and provides more specific descriptions, like “Porsche.” Some of the search systems could be special user specific search systems. For example, particular versions of color recognition and facial recognition could be a special search systems used by the blind. - The front end server system receives results from the parallel search systems (214). In some embodiments, the results are accompanied by a search score. For some visual queries, some of the search systems will find no relevant results. For example, if the visual query was a picture of a flower, the facial recognition search system and the bar code search system will not find any relevant results. In some embodiments, if no relevant results are found, a null or zero search score is received from that search system (216). In some embodiments, if the front end server does not receive a result from a search system after a pre-defined period of time (e.g., 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 seconds), it will process the received results as if that timed out server produced a null search score and will process the received results from the other search systems.
- Optionally, when at least two of the received search results meet pre-defined criteria, they are ranked (218). In some embodiments, one of the predefined criteria excludes void results. A pre-defined criterion is that the results are not void. In some embodiments, one of the predefined criteria excludes results having numerical score (e.g., for a relevance factor) that falls below a pre-defined minimum score. Optionally, the plurality of search results are filtered (220). In some embodiments, the results are only filtered if the total number of results exceeds a pre-defined threshold. In some embodiments, all the results are ranked but the results falling below a pre-defined minimum score are excluded. For some visual queries, the content of the results are filtered. For example, if some of the results contain private information or personal protected information, these results are filtered out.
- Optionally, the visual query server system creates a compound search result (222). One embodiment of this is when more than one search system result is embedded in an interactive results document as explained with respect to
FIG. 3 . The term query server system (118,FIG. 1 ) may augment the results from one of the parallel search systems with results from a term search, where the additional results are either links to documents or information sources, or text and/or images containing additional information that may be relevant to the visual query. Thus, for example, the compound search result may contain an OCR result and a link to a named entity in the OCR document (224). - In some embodiments, the OCR search system (112-B,
FIG. 1 ) or the front end visual query processing server (110,FIG. 1 ) recognizes likely relevant words in the text. For example, it may recognize named entities such as famous people or places. The named entities are submitted as query terms to the term query server system (118,FIG. 1 ). In some embodiments, the term query results produced by the term query server system are embedded in the visual query result as a “link.” In some embodiments, the term query results are returned as separate links. For example, if a picture of a book cover were the visual query, it is likely that an object recognition search system will produce a high scoring hit for the book. As such a term query for the title of the book will be run on the termquery server system 118 and the term query results are returned along with the visual query results. In some embodiments, the term query results are presented in a labeled group to distinguish them from the visual query results. The results may be searched individually, or a search may be performed using all the recognized named entities in the search query to produce particularly relevant additional search results. For example, if the visual query is a scanned travel brochure about Paris, the returned result may include links to the termquery server system 118 for initiating a search on a term query “Notre Dame.” Similarly, compound search results include results from text searches for recognized famous images. For example, in the same travel brochure, live links to the term query results for famous destinations shown as pictures in the brochure like “Eiffel Tower” and “Louvre” may also be shown (even if the terms “Eiffel Tower” and “Louvre” did not appear in the brochure itself.) - The visual query server system then sends at least one result to the client system (226). Typically, if the visual query processing server receives a plurality of search results from at least some of the plurality of search systems, it will then send at least one of the plurality of search results to the client system. For some visual queries, only one search system will return relevant results. For example, in a visual query containing only an image of text, only the OCR server's results may be relevant. For some visual queries, only one result from one search system may be relevant. For example, only the product related to a scanned bar code may be relevant. In these instances, the front end visual processing server will return only the relevant search result(s). For some visual queries, a plurality of search results are sent to the client system, and the plurality of search results include search results from more than one of the parallel search systems (228). This may occur when more than one distinct image is in the visual query. For example, if the visual query were a picture of a person riding a horse, results for facial recognition of the person could be displayed along with object identification results for the horse. In some embodiments, all the results for a particular query by image search system are grouped and presented together. For example, the top N facial recognition results are displayed under a heading “facial recognition results” and the top N object recognition results are displayed together under a heading “object recognition results.” Alternatively, as discussed below, the search results from a particular image search system may be grouped by image region. For example, if the visual query includes two faces, both of which produce facial recognition results, the results for each face would be presented as a distinct group. For some visual queries (e.g., a visual query including an image of both text and one or more objects), the search results may include both OCR results and one or more image-match results (230).
- In some embodiments, the user may wish to learn more about a particular search result. For example, if the visual query was a picture of a dolphin and the “image to terms” search system returns the following terms “water,” “dolphin,” “blue,” and “Flipper;” the user may wish to run a text based query term search on “Flipper.” When the user wishes to run a search on a term query (e.g., as indicated by the user clicking on or otherwise selecting a corresponding link in the search results), the query term server system (118,
FIG. 1 ) is accessed, and the search on the selected term(s) is run. The corresponding search term results are displayed on the client system either separately or in conjunction with the visual query results (232). In some embodiments, the front end visual query processing server (110,FIG. 1 ) automatically (i.e., without receiving any user command, other than the initial visual query) chooses one or more top potential text results for the visual query, runs those text results on the termquery server system 118, and then returns those term query results along with the visual query result to the client system as a part of sending at least one search result to the client system (232). In the example above, if “Flipper” was the first term result for the visual query picture of a dolphin, the front end server runs a term query on “Flipper” and returns those term query results along with the visual query results to the client system. This embodiment, wherein a term result that is considered likely to be selected by the user is automatically executed prior to sending search results from the visual query to the user, saves the user time. In some embodiments, these results are displayed as a compound search result (222) as explained above. In other embodiments, the results are part of a search result list instead of or in addition to a compound search result. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating the process for responding to a visual query with an interactive results document. The first three operations (202, 210, 214) are described above with reference toFIG. 2 . From the search results which are received from the parallel search systems (214), an interactive results document is created (302). - Creating the interactive results document (302) will now be described in detail. For some visual queries, the interactive results document includes one or more visual identifiers of respective sub-portions of the visual query. Each visual identifier has at least one user selectable link to at least one of the search results. A visual identifier identifies a respective sub-portion of the visual query. For some visual queries, the interactive results document has only one visual identifier with one user selectable link to one or more results. In some embodiments, a respective user selectable link to one or more of the search results has an activation region, and the activation region corresponds to the sub-portion of the visual query that is associated with a corresponding visual identifier.
- In some embodiments, the visual identifier is a bounding box (304). In some embodiments, the bounding box encloses a sub-portion of the visual query as shown in
FIG. 12A . The bounding box need not be a square or rectangular box shape but can be any sort of shape including circular, oval, conformal (e.g., to an object in, entity in or region of the visual query), irregular or any other shape as shown inFIG. 12B . For some visual queries, the bounding box outlines the boundary of an identifiable entity in a sub-portion of the visual query (306). In some embodiments, each bounding box includes a user selectable link to one or more search results, where the user selectable link has an activation region corresponding to a sub-portion of the visual query surrounded by the bounding box. When the space inside the bounding box (the activation region of the user selectable link) is selected by the user, search results that correspond to the image in the outlined sub-portion are returned. - In some embodiments, the visual identifier is a label (307) as shown in
FIG. 14 . In some embodiments, label includes at least one term associated with the image in the respective sub-portion of the visual query. Each label is formatted for presentation in the interactive results document on or near the respective sub-portion. In some embodiments, the labels are color coded. - In some embodiments, each respective visual identifiers is formatted for presentation in a visually distinctive manner in accordance with a type of recognized entity in the respective sub-portion of the visual query. For example, as shown in
FIG. 13 , bounding boxes around a product, a person, a trademark, and the two textual areas are each presented with distinct cross-hatching patterns, representing differently colored transparent bounding boxes. In some embodiments, the visual identifiers are formatted for presentation in visually distinctive manners such as overlay color, overlay pattern, label background color, label background pattern, label font color, and border color. - In some embodiments, the user selectable link in the interactive results document is a link to a document or object that contains one or more results related to the corresponding sub-portion of the visual query (308). In some embodiments, at least one search result includes data related to the corresponding sub-portion of the visual query. As such, when the user selects the selectable link associated with the respective sub-portion, the user is directed to the search results corresponding to the recognized entity in the respective sub-portion of the visual query.
- For example, if a visual query was a photograph of a bar code, there may be portions of the photograph which are irrelevant parts of the packaging upon which the bar code was affixed. The interactive results document may include a bounding box around only the bar code. When the user selects inside the outlined bar code bounding box, the bar code search result is displayed. The bar code search result may include one result, the name of the product corresponding to that bar code, or the bar code results may include several results such as a variety of places in which that product can be purchased, reviewed, etc.
- In some embodiments, when the sub-portion of the visual query corresponding to a respective visual identifier contains text comprising one or more terms, the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include results from a term query search on at least one of the terms in the text. In some embodiments, when the sub-portion of the visual query corresponding to a respective visual identifier contains a person's face for which at least one match (i.e., search result) is found that meets predefined reliability (or other) criteria, the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include one or more of: name, handle, contact information, account information, address information, current location of a related mobile device associated with the person whose face is contained in the selectable sub-portion, other images of the person whose face is contained in the selectable sub-portion, and potential image matches for the person's face. In some embodiments, when the sub-portion of the visual query corresponding to a respective visual identifier contains a product for which at least one match (i.e., search result) is found that meets predefined reliability (or other) criteria, the search results corresponding to the respective visual identifier include one or more of: product information, a product review, an option to initiate purchase of the product, an option to initiate a bid on the product, a list of similar products, and a list of related products.
- Optionally, a respective user selectable link in the interactive results document includes anchor text, which is displayed in the document without having to activate the link. The anchor text provides information, such as a key word or term, related to the information obtained when the link is activated. Anchor text may be displayed as part of the label (307), or in a portion of a bounding box (304), or as additional information displayed when a user hovers a cursor over a user selectable link for a pre-determined period of time such as 1 second.
- Optionally, a respective user selectable link in the interactive results document is a link to a search engine for searching for information or documents corresponding to a text-based query (sometimes herein called a term query). Activation of the link causes execution of the search by the search engine, where the query and the search engine are specified by the link (e.g., the search engine is specified by a URL in the link and the text-based search query is specified by a URL parameter of the link), with results returned to the client system. Optionally, the link in this example may include anchor text specifying the text or terms in the search query.
- In some embodiments, the interactive results document produced in response to a visual query can include a plurality of links that correspond to results from the same search system. For example, a visual query may be an image or picture of a group of people. The interactive results document may include bounding boxes around each person, which when activated returns results from the facial recognition search system for each face in the group. For some visual queries, a plurality of links in the interactive results document corresponds to search results from more than one search system (310). For example, if a picture of a person and a dog was submitted as the visual query, bounding boxes in the interactive results document may outline the person and the dog separately. When the person (in the interactive results document) is selected, search results from the facial recognition search system are retuned, and when the dog (in the interactive results document) is selected, results from the image-to-terms search system are returned. For some visual queries, the interactive results document contains an OCR result and an image match result (312). For example, if a picture of a person standing next to a sign were submitted as a visual query, the interactive results document may include visual identifiers for the person and for the text in the sign. Similarly, if a scan of a magazine was used as the visual query, the interactive results document may include visual identifiers for photographs or trademarks in advertisements on the page as well as a visual identifier for the text of an article also on that page.
- After the interactive results document has been created, it is sent to the client system (314). In some embodiments, the interactive results document (e.g.,
document 1200,FIG. 15 ) is sent in conjunction with a list of search results from one or more parallel search systems, as discussed above with reference toFIG. 2 . In some embodiments, the interactive results document is displayed at the client system above or otherwise adjacent to a list of search results from one or more parallel search systems (315) as shown inFIG. 15 . - Optionally, the user will interact with the results document by selecting a visual identifier in the results document. The server system receives from the client system information regarding the user selection of a visual identifier in the interactive results document (316). As discussed above, in some embodiments, the link is activated by selecting an activation region inside a bounding box. In other embodiments, the link is activated by a user selection of a visual identifier of a sub-portion of the visual query, which is not a bounding box. In some embodiments, the linked visual identifier is a hot button, a label located near the sub-portion, an underlined word in text, or other representation of an object or subject in the visual query.
- In embodiments where the search results list is presented with the interactive results document (315), when the user selects a user selectable link (316), the search result in the search results list corresponding to the selected link is identified. In some embodiments, the cursor will jump or automatically move to the first result corresponding to the selected link. In some embodiments in which the display of the
client 102 is too small to display both the interactive results document and the entire search results list, selecting a link in the interactive results document causes the search results list to scroll or jump so as to display at least a first result corresponding to the selected link. In some other embodiments, in response to user selection of a link in the interactive results document, the results list is reordered such that the first result corresponding to the link is displayed at the top of the results list. - In some embodiments, when the user selects the user selectable link (316) the visual query server system sends at least a subset of the results, related to a corresponding sub-portion of the visual query, to the client for display to the user (318). In some embodiments, the user can select multiple visual identifiers concurrently and will receive a subset of results for all of the selected visual identifiers at the same time. In other embodiments, search results corresponding to the user selectable links are preloaded onto the client prior to user selection of any of the user selectable links so as to provide search results to the user virtually instantaneously in response to user selection of one or more links in the interactive results document.
-
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating the communications between a client and a visual query server system. Theclient 102 receives a visual query from a user/querier (402). In some embodiments, visual queries can only be accepted from users who have signed up for or “opted in” to the visual query system. In some embodiments, searches for facial recognition matches are only performed for users who have signed up for the facial recognition visual query system, while other types of visual queries are performed for anyone regardless of whether they have “opted in” to the facial recognition portion. - As explained above, the format of the visual query can take many forms. The visual query will likely contain one or more subjects located in sub-portions of the visual query document. For some visual queries, the
client system 102 performs type recognition pre-processing on the visual query (404). In some embodiments, theclient system 102 searches for particular recognizable patterns in this pre-processing system. For example, for some visual queries the client may recognize colors. For some visual queries the client may recognize that a particular sub-portion is likely to contain text (because that area is made up of small dark characters surrounded by light space etc.) The client may contain any number of pre-processing type recognizers, or type recognition modules. In some embodiments, the client will have a type recognition module (barcode recognition 406) for recognizing bar codes. It may do so by recognizing the distinctive striped pattern in a rectangular area. In some embodiments, the client will have a type recognition module (face detection 408) for recognizing that a particular subject or sub-portion of the visual query is likely to contain a face. - In some embodiments, the recognized “type” is returned to the user for verification. For example, the
client system 102 may return a message stating “a bar code has been found in your visual query, are you interested in receiving bar code query results?” In some embodiments, the message may even indicate the sub-portion of the visual query where the type has been found. In some embodiments, this presentation is similar to the interactive results document discussed with reference toFIG. 3 . For example, it may outline a sub-portion of the visual query and indicate that the sub-portion is likely to contain a face, and ask the user if they are interested in receiving facial recognition results. - After the
client 102 performs the optional pre-processing of the visual query, the client sends the visual query to the visualquery server system 106, specifically to the front end visualquery processing server 110. In some embodiments, if pre-processing produced relevant results, i.e., if one of the type recognition modules produced results above a certain threshold, indicating that the query or a sub-portion of the query is likely to be of a particular type (face, text, barcode etc.), the client will pass along information regarding the results of the pre-processing. For example, the client may indicate that the face recognition module is 75% sure that a particular sub-portion of the visual query contains a face. More generally, the pre-processing results, if any, include one or more subject type values (e.g., bar code, face, text, etc.). Optionally, the pre-processing results sent to the visual query server system include one or more of: for each subject type value in the pre-processing results, information identifying a sub-portion of the visual query corresponding to the subject type value, and for each subject type value in the pre-processing results, a confidence value indicating a level of confidence in the subject type value and/or the identification of a corresponding sub-portion of the visual query. - The
front end server 110 receives the visual query from the client system (202). The visual query received may contain the pre-processing information discussed above. As described above, the front end server sends the visual query to a plurality of parallel search systems (210). If thefront end server 110 received pre-processing information regarding the likelihood that a sub-portion contained a subject of a certain type, the front end server may pass this information along to one or more of the parallel search systems. For example, it may pass on the information that a particular sub-portion is likely to be a face so that the facial recognition search system 112-A can process that subsection of the visual query first. Similarly, sending the same information (that a particular sub-portion is likely to be a face) may be used by the other parallel search systems to ignore that sub-portion or analyze other sub-portions first. In some embodiments, the front end server will not pass on the pre-processing information to the parallel search systems, but will instead use this information to augment the way in which it processes the results received from the parallel search systems. - As explained with reference to
FIG. 2 , for at some visual queries, thefront end server 110 receives a plurality of search results from the parallel search systems (214). The front end server may then perform a variety of ranking and filtering, and may create an interactive search result document as explained with reference toFIGS. 2 and 3 . If thefront end server 110 received pre-processing information regarding the likelihood that a sub-portion contained a subject of a certain type, it may filter and order by giving preference to those results that match the pre-processed recognized subject type. If the user indicated that a particular type of result was requested, the front end server will take the user's requests into account when processing the results. For example, the front end server may filter out all other results if the user only requested bar code information, or the front end server will list all results pertaining to the requested type prior to listing the other results. If an interactive visual query document is returned, the server may pre-search the links associated with the type of result the user indicated interest in, while only providing links for performing related searches for the other subjects indicated in the interactive results document. Then thefront end server 110 sends the search results to the client system (226). - The
client 102 receives the results from the server system (412). When applicable, these results will include the results that match the type of result found in the pre-processing stage. For example, in some embodiments they will include one or more bar code results (414) or one or more facial recognition results (416). If the client's pre-processing modules had indicated that a particular type of result was likely, and that result was found, the found results of that type will be listed prominently. - Optionally the user will select or annotate one or more of the results (418). The user may select one search result, may select a particular type of search result, and/or may select a portion of an interactive results document (420). Selection of a result is implicit feedback that the returned result was relevant to the query. Such feedback information can be utilized in future query processing operations. An annotation provides explicit feedback about the returned result that can also be utilized in future query processing operations. Annotations take the form of corrections of portions of the returned result (like a correction to a mis-OCRed word) or a separate annotation (either free form or structured.)
- The user's selection of one search result, generally selecting the “correct” result from several of the same type (e.g., choosing the correct result from a facial recognition server), is a process that is referred to as a selection among interpretations. The user's selection of a particular type of search result, generally selecting the result “type” of interest from several different types of returned results (e.g., choosing the OCRed text of an article in a magazine rather than the visual results for the advertisements also on the same page), is a process that is referred to as disambiguation of intent. A user may similarly select particular linked words (such as recognized named entities) in an OCRed document as explained in detail with reference to
FIG. 8 . - The user may alternatively or additionally wish to annotate particular search results. This annotation may be done in freeform style or in a structured format (422). The annotations may be descriptions of the result or may be reviews of the result. For example, they may indicate the name of subject(s) in the result, or they could indicate “this is a good book” or “this product broke within a year of purchase.” Another example of an annotation is a user-drawn bounding box around a sub-portion of the visual query and user-provided text identifying the object or subject inside the bounding box. User annotations are explained in more detail with reference to
FIG. 5 . - The user selections of search results and other annotations are sent to the server system (424). The
front end server 110 receives the selections and annotations and further processes them (426). If the information was a selection of an object, sub-region or term in an interactive results document, further information regarding that selection may be requested, as appropriate. For example, if the selection was of one visual result, more information about that visual result would be requested. If the selection was a word (either from the OCR server or from the Image-to-Terms server) a textual search of that word would be sent to the termquery server system 118. If the selection was of a person from a facial image recognition search system, that person's profile would be requested. If the selection was for a particular portion of an interactive search result document, the underlying visual query results would be requested. - If the server system receives an annotation, the annotation is stored in a query and
annotation database 116, explained with reference toFIG. 5 . Then the information from theannotation database 116 is periodically copied to individual annotation databases for one or more of the parallel server systems, as discussed below with reference toFIGS. 7-10 . -
FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating aclient system 102 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Theclient system 102 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 702, one or more network orother communications interfaces 704,memory 712, and one ormore communication buses 714 for interconnecting these components. Theclient system 102 includes auser interface 705. Theuser interface 705 includes adisplay device 706 and optionally includes an input means such as a keyboard, mouse, orother input buttons 708. Alternatively or in addition thedisplay device 706 includes a touchsensitive surface 709, in which case thedisplay 706/709 is a touch sensitive display. In client systems that have a touchsensitive display 706/709, a physical keyboard is optional (e.g., a soft keyboard may be displayed when keyboard entry is needed). Furthermore, some client systems use a microphone and voice recognition to supplement or replace the keyboard. Optionally, theclient 102 includes a GPS (global positioning satellite) receiver, or otherlocation detection apparatus 707 for determining the location of theclient system 102. In some embodiments, visual query search services are provided that require theclient system 102 to provide the visual query server system to receive location information indicating the location of theclient system 102. - The
client system 102 also includes animage capture device 710 such as a camera or scanner.Memory 712 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.Memory 712 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 702.Memory 712, or alternately the non-volatile memory device(s) withinmemory 712, comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. In some embodiments,memory 712 or the computer readable storage medium ofmemory 712 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof: -
- an
operating system 716 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks; - a
network communication module 718 that is used for connecting theclient system 102 to other computers via the one or more communication network interfaces 704 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on; - a
image capture module 720 for processing a respective image captured by the image capture device/camera 710, where the respective image may be sent (e.g., by a client application module) as a visual query to the visual query server system; - one or more
client application modules 722 for handling various aspects of querying by image, including but not limited to: a query-by-image submission module 724 for submitting visual queries to the visual query server system; optionally a region ofinterest selection module 725 that detects a selection (such as a gesture on the touchsensitive display 706/709) of a region of interest in an image and prepares that region of interest as a visual query; aresults browser 726 for displaying the results of the visual query; and optionally anannotation module 728 with optional modules for structuredannotation text entry 730 such as filling in a form or for freeformannotation text entry 732, which can accept annotations from a variety of formats, and an image region selection module 734 (sometimes referred to herein as a result selection module) which allows a user to select a particular sub-portion of an image for annotation; - an optional content authoring application(s) 736 that allow a user to author a visual query by creating or editing an image rather than just capturing one via the
image capture device 710; optionally, one orsuch applications 736 may include instructions that enable a user to select a sub-portion of an image for use as a visual query; - an optional local
image analysis module 738 that pre-processes the visual query before sending it to the visual query server system. The local image analysis may recognize particular types of images, or sub-regions within an image. Examples of image types that may be recognized bysuch modules 738 include one or more of: facial type (facial image recognized within visual query), bar code type (bar code recognized within visual query), and text type (text recognized within visual query); and - additional
optional client applications 740 such as an email application, a phone application, a browser application, a mapping application, instant messaging application, social networking application etc. In some embodiments, the application corresponding to an appropriate actionable search result can be launched or accessed when the actionable search result is selected.
- an
- Optionally, the image
region selection module 734 which allows a user to select a particular sub-portion of an image for annotation, also allows the user to choose a search result as a “correct” hit without necessarily further annotating it. For example, the user may be presented with a top N number of facial recognition matches and may choose the correct person from that results list. For some search queries, more than one type of result will be presented, and the user will choose a type of result. For example, the image query may include a person standing next to a tree, but only the results regarding the person is of interest to the user. Therefore, theimage selection module 734 allows the user to indicate which type of image is the “correct” type—i.e., the type he is interested in receiving. The user may also wish to annotate the search result by adding personal comments or descriptive words using either the annotation text entry module 730 (for filling in a form) or freeform annotationtext entry module 732. - In some embodiments, the optional local
image analysis module 738 is a portion of the client application (108,FIG. 1 ). Furthermore, in some embodiments the optional localimage analysis module 738 includes one or more programs to perform local image analysis to pre-process or categorize the visual query or a portion thereof. For example, theclient application 722 may recognize that the image contains a bar code, a face, or text, prior to submitting the visual query to a search engine. In some embodiments, when the localimage analysis module 738 detects that the visual query contains a particular type of image, the module asks the user if they are interested in a corresponding type of search result. For example, the localimage analysis module 738 may detect a face based on its general characteristics (i.e., without determining which person's face) and provides immediate feedback to the user prior to sending the query on to the visual query server system. It may return a result like, “A face has been detected, are you interested in getting facial recognition matches for this face?” This may save time for the visual query server system (106,FIG. 1 ). For some visual queries, the front end visual query processing server (110,FIG. 1 ) only sends the visual query to thesearch system 112 corresponding to the type of image recognized by the localimage analysis module 738. In other embodiments, the visual query to thesearch system 112 may send the visual query to all of the search systems 112A-N, but will rank results from thesearch system 112 corresponding to the type of image recognized by the localimage analysis module 738. In some embodiments, the manner in which local image analysis impacts on operation of the visual query server system depends on the configuration of the client system, or configuration or processing parameters associated with either the user or the client system. Furthermore, the actual content of any particular visual query and the results produced by the local image analysis may cause different visual queries to be handled differently at either or both the client system and the visual query server system. - In some embodiments, bar code recognition is performed in two steps, with analysis of whether the visual query includes a bar code performed on the client system at the local
image analysis module 738. Then the visual query is passed to a bar code search system only if the client determines the visual query is likely to include a bar code. In other embodiments, the bar code search system processes every visual query. - Optionally, the
client system 102 includesadditional client applications 740. -
FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a front end visual queryprocessing server system 110 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Thefront end server 110 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 802, one or more network orother communications interfaces 804,memory 812, and one ormore communication buses 814 for interconnecting these components.Memory 812 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.Memory 812 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 802.Memory 812, or alternately the non-volatile memory device(s) withinmemory 812, comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. In some embodiments,memory 812 or the computer readable storage medium ofmemory 812 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof: -
- an
operating system 816 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks; - a
network communication module 818 that is used for connecting the frontend server system 110 to other computers via the one or more communication network interfaces 804 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on; - a
query manager 820 for handling the incoming visual queries from theclient system 102 and sending them to two or more parallel search systems; as described elsewhere in this document, in some special situations a visual query may be directed to just one of the search systems, such as when the visual query includes an client-generated instruction (e.g., “facial recognition search only”); - a
results filtering module 822 for optionally filtering the results from the one or more parallel search systems and sending the top or “relevant” results to theclient system 102 for presentation; - a results ranking and
formatting module 824 for optionally ranking the results from the one or more parallel search systems and for formatting the results for presentation; - a results
document creation module 826, is used when appropriate, to create an interactive search results document;module 826 may include sub-modules, including but not limited to a boundingbox creation module 828 and alink creation module 830; - a
label creation module 831 for creating labels that are visual identifiers of respective sub-portions of a visual query; - an
annotation module 832 for receiving annotations from a user and sending them to anannotation database 116; - an actionable
search results module 838 for generating, in response to a visual query, one or more actionable search result elements, each configured to launch a client-side action; examples of actionable search result elements are buttons to initiate a telephone call, to initiate email message, to map an address, to make a restaurant reservation, and to provide an option to purchase a product; and - a query and
annotation database 116 which comprises the database itself 834 and an index to thedatabase 836.

- The results ranking and
formatting module 824 ranks the results returned from the one or more parallel search systems (112-A-112-N,FIG. 1 ). As already noted above, for some visual queries, only the results from one search system may be relevant. In such an instance, only the relevant search results from that one search system are ranked. For some visual queries, several types of search results may be relevant. In these instances, in some embodiments, the results ranking andformatting module 824 ranks all of the results from the search system having the most relevant result (e.g., the result with the highest relevance score) above the results for the less relevant search systems. In other embodiments, the results ranking andformatting module 824 ranks a top result from each relevant search system above the remaining results. In some embodiments, the results ranking andformatting module 824 ranks the results in accordance with a relevance score computed for each of the search results. For some visual queries, augmented textual queries are performed in addition to the searching on parallel visual search systems. In some embodiments, when textual queries are also performed, their results are presented in a manner visually distinctive from the visual search system results. - The results ranking and
formatting module 824 also formats the results. In some embodiments, the results are presented in a list format. In some embodiments, the results are presented by means of an interactive results document. In some embodiments, both an interactive results document and a list of results are presented. In some embodiments, the type of query dictates how the results are presented. For example, if more than one searchable subject is detected in the visual query, then an interactive results document is produced, while if only one searchable subject is detected the results will be displayed in list format only. - The results
document creation module 826 is used to create an interactive search results document. The interactive search results document may have one or more detected and searched subjects. The boundingbox creation module 828 creates a bounding box around one or more of the searched subjects. The bounding boxes may be rectangular boxes, or may outline the shape(s) of the subject(s). Thelink creation module 830 creates links to search results associated with their respective subject in the interactive search results document. In some embodiments, clicking within the bounding box area activates the corresponding link inserted by the link creation module. - The query and
annotation database 116 contains information that can be used to improve visual query results. In some embodiments, the user may annotate the image after the visual query results have been presented. Furthermore, in some embodiments the user may annotate the image before sending it to the visual query search system. Pre-annotation may help the visual query processing by focusing the results, or running text based searches on the annotated words in parallel with the visual query searches. In some embodiments, annotated versions of a picture can be made public (e.g., when the user has given permission for publication, for example by designating the image and annotation(s) as not private), so as to be returned as a potential image match hit. For example, if a user takes a picture of a flower and annotates the image by giving detailed genus and species information about that flower, the user may want that image to be presented to anyone who performs a visual query research looking for that flower. In some embodiments, the information from the query andannotation database 116 is periodically pushed to theparallel search systems 112, which incorporate relevant portions of the information (if any) into their respectiveindividual databases 114. -

FIGS. 5-10 are intended more as functional descriptions of the various features which may be present in a set of computer systems than as a structural schematic of the embodiments described herein. In practice, and as recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated. For example, some items shown separately in these figures could be implemented on single servers and single items could be implemented by one or more servers. The actual number of systems used to implement visual query processing and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another. - Each of the methods described herein may be governed by instructions that are stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and that are executed by one or more processors of one or more servers or clients. The above identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. Each of the operations shown in
FIGS. 5-10 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or non-transitory computer readable storage medium. -
FIG. 11 illustrates aclient system 102 with a screen shot of an exemplaryvisual query 1102. Theclient system 102 shown inFIG. 11 is a mobile device such as a cellular telephone, portable music player, or portable emailing device. Theclient system 102 includes adisplay 706 and one or more input means 708 such the buttons shown in this figure. In some embodiments, thedisplay 706 is a touchsensitive display 709. In embodiments having a touchsensitive display 709, soft buttons displayed on thedisplay 709 may optionally replace some or all of theelectromechanical buttons 708. Touch sensitive displays are also helpful in interacting with the visual query results as explained in more detail below. Theclient system 102 also includes an image capture mechanism such as acamera 710. -
FIG. 11 illustrates avisual query 1102 which is a photograph or video frame of a package on a shelf of a store. In the embodiments described here, the visual query is a two dimensional image having a resolution corresponding to the size of the visual query in pixels in each of two dimensions. Thevisual query 1102 in this example is a two dimensional image of three dimensional objects. Thevisual query 1102 includes background elements, aproduct package 1104, and a variety of types of entities on the package including an image of aperson 1106, an image of atrademark 1108, an image of aproduct 1110, and a variety oftextual elements 1112. - As explained with reference to
FIG. 3 , thevisual query 1102 is sent to thefront end server 110, which sends thevisual query 1102 to a plurality of parallel search systems (112A-N), receives the results and creates an interactive results document. -
FIGS. 12A and 12B each illustrate aclient system 102 with a screen shot of an embodiment of an interactive results document 1200. The interactive results document 1200 includes one or morevisual identifiers 1202 of respective sub-portions of thevisual query 1102, which each include a user selectable link to a subset of search results.FIGS. 12A and 12B illustrate an interactive results document 1200 with visual identifiers that are bounding boxes 1202 (e.g., bounding boxes 1202-1, 1202-2, 1202-3). In the embodiments shown inFIGS. 12A and 12B , the user activates the display of the search results corresponding to a particular sub-portion by tapping on the activation region inside the space outlined by itsbounding box 1202. For example, the user would activate the search results corresponding to the image of the person, by tapping on a bounding box 1306 (FIG. 13 ) surrounding the image of the person. In other embodiments, the selectable link is selected using a mouse or keyboard rather than a touch sensitive display. In some embodiments, the first corresponding search result is displayed when a user previews a bounding box 1202 (i.e., when the user single clicks, taps once, or hovers a pointer over the bounding box). The user activates the display of a plurality of corresponding search results when the user selects the bounding box (i.e., when the user double clicks, taps twice, or uses another mechanism to indicate selection.) - In
FIGS. 12A and 12B the visual identifiers are boundingboxes 1202 surrounding sub-portions of the visual query.FIG. 12A illustrates boundingboxes 1202 that are square or rectangular.FIG. 12B illustrates abounding box 1202 that outlines the boundary of an identifiable entity in the sub-portion of the visual query, such as the bounding box 1202-3 for a drink bottle. In some embodiments, arespective bounding box 1202 includessmaller bounding boxes 1202 within it. For example, inFIGS. 12A and 12B , the bounding box identifying the package 1202-1 surrounds the bounding box identifying the trademark 1202-2 and all of theother bounding boxes 1202. In some embodiments that include text, also include activehot links 1204 for some of the textual terms.FIG. 12B shows an example where “Active Drink” and “United States” are displayed ashot links 1204. The search results corresponding to these terms are the results received from the termquery server system 118, whereas the results corresponding to the bounding boxes are results from the query by image search systems. -
FIG. 13 illustrates aclient system 102 with a screen shot of an interactive results document 1200 that is coded by type of recognized entity in the visual query. The visual query ofFIG. 11 contains an image of aperson 1106, an image of atrademark 1108, an image of aproduct 1110, and a variety oftextual elements 1112. As such the interactive results document 1200 displayed inFIG. 13 includes boundingboxes 1202 around aperson 1306, atrademark 1308, aproduct 1310, and the twotextual areas 1312. The bounding boxes ofFIG. 13 are each presented with separate cross-hatching which represents differently coloredtransparent bounding boxes 1202. In some embodiments, the visual identifiers of the bounding boxes (and/or labels or other visual identifiers in the interactive results document 1200) are formatted for presentation in visually distinctive manners such as overlay color, overlay pattern, label background color, label background pattern, label font color, and bounding box border color. The type coding for particular recognized entities is shown with respect to bounding boxes inFIG. 13 , but coding by type can also be applied to visual identifiers that are labels. -
FIG. 14 illustrates aclient device 102 with a screen shot of an interactive results document 1200 withlabels 1402 being the visual identifiers of respective sub-portions of thevisual query 1102 ofFIG. 11 . The labelvisual identifiers 1402 each include a user selectable link to a subset of corresponding search results. In some embodiments, the selectable link is identified by descriptive text displayed within the area of thelabel 1402. Some embodiments include a plurality of links within onelabel 1402. For example, inFIG. 14 , the label hovering over the image of a woman drinking includes a link to facial recognition results for the woman and a link to image recognition results for that particular picture (e.g., images of other products or advertisements using the same picture.) - In
FIG. 14 , thelabels 1402 are displayed as partially transparent areas with text that are located over their respective sub-portions of the interactive results document. In other embodiments, a respective label is positioned near but not located over its respective sub-portion of the interactive results document. In some embodiments, the labels are coded by type in the same manner as discussed with reference toFIG. 13 . In some embodiments, the user activates the display of the search results corresponding to a particular sub-portion corresponding to a label 1302 by tapping on the activation region inside the space outlined by the edges or periphery of the label 1302. The same previewing and selection functions discussed above with reference to the bounding boxes ofFIGS. 12A and 12B also apply to the visual identifiers that are labels 1402. -
FIG. 15 illustrates a screen shot of an interactive results document 1200 and the originalvisual query 1102 displayed concurrently with aresults list 1500. In some embodiments, the interactive results document 1200 is displayed by itself as shown inFIGS. 12-14 . In other embodiments, the interactive results document 1200 is displayed concurrently with the original visual query as shown inFIG. 15 . In some embodiments, the list of visual query results 1500 is concurrently displayed along with the originalvisual query 1102 and/or the interactive results document 1200. The type of client system and the amount of room on thedisplay 706 may determine whether the list ofresults 1500 is displayed concurrently with the interactive results document 1200. In some embodiments, theclient system 102 receives (in response to a visual query submitted to the visual query server system) both the list ofresults 1500 and the interactive results document 1200, but only displays the list ofresults 1500 when the user scrolls below the interactive results document 1200. In some of these embodiments, theclient system 102 displays the results corresponding to a user selectedvisual identifier 1202/1402 without needing to query the server again because the list ofresults 1500 is received by theclient system 102 in response to the visual query and then stored locally at theclient system 102. - In some embodiments, the list of
results 1500 is organized intocategories 1502. Each category contains at least oneresult 1503. In some embodiments, the categories titles are highlighted to distinguish them from theresults 1503. Thecategories 1502 are ordered according to their calculated category weight. In some embodiments, the category weight is a combination of the weights of the highest N results in that category. As such, the category that has likely produced more relevant results is displayed first. In embodiments where more than onecategory 1502 is returned for the same recognized entity (such as the facial image recognition match and the image match shown inFIG. 15 ) the category displayed first has a higher category weight. - As explained with respect to
FIG. 3 , in some embodiments, when a selectable link in the interactive results document 1200 is selected by a user of theclient system 102, the cursor will automatically move to theappropriate category 1502 or to thefirst result 1503 in that category. Alternatively, when a selectable link in the interactive results document is selected by a user of theclient system 102, the list ofresults 1500 is re-ordered such that the category or categories relevant to the selected link are displayed first. This is accomplished, for example, by either coding the selectable links with information identifying the corresponding search results, or by coding the search results to indicate the corresponding selectable links or to indicate the corresponding result categories. - In some embodiments, the categories of the search results correspond to the query-by-image search system that produce those search results. For example, in
FIG. 15 some of the categories areproduct match 1506,logo match 1508,facial recognition match 1510,image match 1512. The originalvisual query 1102 and/or an interactive results document 1200 may be similarly displayed with a category title such as thequery 1504. Similarly, results from any term search performed by the term query server may also be displayed as a separate category, such as web results 1514. In other embodiments, more than one entity in a visual query will produce results from the same query-by-image search system. For example, the visual query could include two different faces that would return separate results from the facial recognition search system. As such, in some embodiments, thecategories 1502 are divided by recognized entity rather than by search system. In some embodiments, an image of the recognized entity is displayed in the recognizedentity category header 1502 such that the results for that recognized entity are distinguishable from the results for another recognized entity, even though both results are produced by the same query by image search system. For example, inFIG. 15 , theproduct match category 1506 includes two entity product entities and as such as twoentity categories 1502—a boxed product 1516 and abottled product 1518, each of which have a plurality of corresponding search results 1503. In some embodiments, the categories may be divided by recognized entities and type of query-by-image system. For example, inFIG. 15 , there are two separate entities that returned relevant results under the product match category product. - In some embodiments, the
results 1503 include thumbnail images. For example, as shown for the facial recognition match results inFIG. 15 , small versions (also called thumbnail images) of the pictures of the facial matches for “Actress X” and “Social Network Friend Y” are displayed along with some textual description such as the name of the person in the image. -
FIG. 16 illustrates aclient system 102 displaying animage 1602 including a variety of entities. Theimage 1602 is a photograph taken by a camera, a scan of an image, a video frame, or a camera preview image (i.e., an image shown by a digital camera prior to taking a photograph.) Theimage 1602 is a two dimensional image of three dimensional objects: aproduct package 1604 on a shelf. Theproduct package 1604 includes images of several entities that may or may not be of interest to a user. For example, theproduct package 1604 includes an image of a person drinking 1606, an image of atrademark 1608, an image of aproduct 1610, and a variety oftextual element images 1612. Theimage 1602 has a two-dimensional image resolution which is a first number of pixels corresponding to avertical axis 1614 and a second number of pixels corresponding to ahorizontal axis 1616 of theimage 1602. For example, theimage 1602 may have a resolution of 3456 pixels by 2592 pixels. In some embodiments, the resolution of theimage 1602 will be larger than the actual number of pixels on thedisplay 706 of theclient system 102. In some embodiments, the resolution of the image corresponds to the resolution of theimage capture device 710. Theclient system 102 in this figure includes a touchsensitive display screen 709.FIG. 16 illustrates a user touching touch sensitive thedisplay screen 709. - The maximum number of pixels that a visual query can have is likely to be significantly smaller than the resolution of the image. For example, the maximum resolution of the visual query may be 640×480 pixels, while the initially captured image will typically have a significantly higher resolution. In such an instance, when a visual query is created from the
image 1602 some resolution is lost. However, a user may not be interested in all of the entities in theoriginal image 1602. Therefore, as shown inFIGS. 17A-B and 18 the user can select a particular entity or a region of interest within the image. As explained in more detail below, the region of interest has a second resolution, which is smaller than the resolution of the entireoriginal image 1602. Theclient system 102 then creates a visual query from just the region of interest, or a smaller portion of theimage 1602 that includes the region of interest. Because the visual query is created from the region of interest rather than the entire received image, less resolution is lost when creating the visual query from the region of interest than would have been lost if the visual query were created from the entireoriginal image 1602. In fact, when the region of interest is sufficiently small, no resolution is lost when generating the visual query. -
FIGS. 17A and 17B illustrate one embodiment of receiving a selection of a region ofinterest 1702 on aclient system 102. In this embodiment the selected region ofinterest 1702 contains an image of a person drinking out of abottle 1606.FIGS. 17A and 17B illustrate receiving a selection of a region ofinterest 1702 by receiving a touch by the user on the region of interest on the touchsensitive display screen 709. Specifically, the user touches the touch sensitive display screen at afirst position 1704 and draws a line across the region of interest ending at asecond position 1706. The line from thefirst position 1704 to thesecond position 1706 is a diagonal line extending from a first corner to a second corner of the region ofinterest 1702. In some embodiments, the selection of the region of interest is done on a non-touch sensitive screen by means of a mouse drag. - The region of
interest 1702 has the same resolution level (i.e., density of pixels per inch) as theoriginal image 1602, but it has a lower two-dimensional image resolution because it has a smaller number of pixels in at least one of the two dimensions of theimage 1602. The two-dimensional image resolution of the region of interest corresponds to avertical axis 1714 and ahorizontal axis 1716 of the region ofinterest 1702. Typically, the original image, the region of interest and the visual query all have the same or parallel axes, but have different extents and resolutions. - In some embodiments, the region of
interest 1702 is visually distinguished from the portion ofimage 1602 not including the region of interest.FIG. 17B illustrates a region ofinterest 1702 visually distinguished by means of a partially transparent overlay pattern. In some embodiments, the region ofinterest 1702 may be visually distinguished using transparency, shading, color, background pattern, and/or border. -
FIG. 18 illustrates another embodiment of receiving a selection of a region ofinterest 1702 on aclient system 102. In this embodiment awireframe 1802 is displayed over theimage 1602. Thewireframe 1802 defines sub-portions 1804 of theimage 1602. The user selects a region ofinterest 1702 by selecting one or more sub-portions 1804 defined by thewireframe 1802. In some embodiments, the selection of the sub-portion(s) 1804 is done by touching one or more sub-portions 1804 on a touch sensitive display. The selection may be done with a single linear gesture extending through one or more sub-portions 1804—similar to that explained with reference toFIGS. 17A and 17B . Alternatively, any number of sub-portions 1804 can be selected by individual gestures, for example by tapping eachsub-portion 1804. In other embodiments, thesub-portions 1804 can be selected by means of a mouse click, keyboard arrows, or other selection means. In some embodiments, anysub-portion 1804 selected within a defined period of time, such as 2 seconds, becomes part of the selected region ofinterest 1702. In the embodiment shown inFIG. 18 , only one sub-portion has become the region ofinterest 1702. This region ofinterest 1702 is visually distinguished from the rest of the image by means of a partially transparent overlay pattern. - In some embodiments, a combination of the wireframe selection mechanism shown in
FIG. 18 and the selection gesture shown inFIGS. 17A and 17B is used to by a user to identify a region of interest. For example, a user may drag his finger across a touch sensitive screen and any sub-portion 1804 through which he drags will become a part of the region ofinterest 1702. In this way, non-rectangular regions ofinterest 1702 could be selected. When the wireframe pattern has smaller distances between the wires (also said to be more fine grained or more detailed), the shape of the region ofinterest 1702 can be more detailed or complex. -
FIG. 19 is a flow diagram illustrating the process for receiving a selection of a region of interest and processing it, according to certain embodiments of the invention. Each of the operations shown inFIG. 19 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or computer readable storage medium. Specifically many of the operations shown inFIG. 19 correspond to instructions in the region ofinterest selection module 725 of theclient system 102 shown inFIG. 5 . - The client system receives an image having a first two-dimensional image resolution (1902). The image is received from a client application. In some embodiments, the image is a photograph or a camera preview image. In other embodiments the image is a scan, a screenshot, or a video frame. The first two-dimensional image resolution (of the image) has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the image. The resolution of the image is likely to be relatively large as compared to the maximum size resolution for visual queries.
- The client system displays the image on a display screen (1904). In some embodiments, the display screen is part of a handheld mobile device, such as mobile telephone or smart phone or the like. In other embodiments, the display screen is part of a larger device like a desktop or laptop computer. The display screen may be touch sensitive.
- The client system receives a selection of a region of interest within the image from a user (1906). The region of interest has a second two-dimensional image resolution, the second two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to the first and second axes of the region of interest. In embodiments where the image is a camera preview image, while receiving the user's selection of a region of interest (1906), the camera focuses on one or more subjects in the region of interest (1908). If more than one subject is in the region of interest the camera will focus on the most important subject. In some embodiments, the importance of a subject is calculated based on size, position, context, and/or user profile information. Then after the user has selected the region of interest (and the camera has simultaneously focused on the subject(s) in the region of interest) the camera “takes the picture,” i.e., captures the image in memory. One advantage of concurrently focusing while receiving the region of interest selection is a reduction in perceived lag time. Cameras may take a second or two to focus, if some of the focus time happens while the user selects a region of interest, the total time before the picture is taken can be reduced. This reduces the perceived lag time between the user's selection of a region of interest and receiving visual query results.
- Optionally, the region of interest is displayed in a manner that visually distinguishes it from the portion of image not including the region of interest (1910).
FIGS. 17B and 18 show embodiments illustrating the region of interest displayed in a visually distinctive manner. - The client system 102 (specifically the region of interest selection module 725) creates a visual query from the region of interest (1912). The visual query has a third two-dimensional image resolution. The third two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the visual query, such that the first and second components of the third two-dimensional image resolution are each no larger than corresponding components of a predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution for visual queries. The predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to the first and second axes of the visual query. In some embodiments, the maximum two-dimensional image resolution for a visual query is 640 pixels by 480 pixels. In embodiments where the visual query was a camera preview image, creating the visual query further includes taking a picture with the camera (1914).
- When the second two-dimensional image resolution (of the user-selected region of interest) has at least one component that is larger than a corresponding component of the predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution for visual queries, the client system produces a reduced resolution image corresponding to the region of interest of the image (1916). The reduced resolution image has the third two-dimensional image resolution described above.
- When both components of the second two-dimensional image resolution are smaller than the corresponding components of the predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution for visual queries, the client system produces a maximum resolution image corresponding to the region of interest of the image (1918). The maximum resolution image has the second two-dimensional image resolution described above. In other words, in this circumstance, the resolution of the region of interest and the resolution of the visual query are the same.
- The client system sends the visual query to the server system (1920). In some embodiments, the sending happens automatically without additional user actions. In some embodiments, the sending is initiated when the selection ceases (1922). For example, in some embodiments when the user ceases touching the region of interest (e.g., upon lift off of the user's finger from the display) the visual query is sent to the server system. In some embodiments, the visual query is sent after a specific period of time has elapsed after the region of interest is selected. In other embodiments, the user explicitly initiates a send command. For example, in some embodiments, the visual query not created or sent until a separate command is initiated, such as user selection of a “send visual query” button (e.g., a soft button displayed on the touch sensitive display of the client device or a physical button, such as an electromechanical button, that is distinct from the display of the client device).
- The visual query server system processes the visual query as explained in
FIG. 2 and then returns the visual query results to the client system. The client system receives visual query results, which corresponding to the region of interest, which was the visual query (1924). The client system displays the visual query results (1926). In some embodiments, the visual query results are displayed concurrently with only the region of interest in a results display region of the display. In other embodiments the original image is displayed with the results and the region of interest is highlighted in the image. In yet other embodiments, only the results are displayed. The results may take any form described above including but not limited to a results list and/or an interactive results document. It should be noted that in some embodiments when a variety of subjects are in the visual query, the results returned are ordered according to the importance of each subject. In some embodiments, the importance of a subject in the visual query is estimated based on size, position, context, and/or user profile. - In some embodiments, further processing similar to the steps described above is performed on a sub-region of interest within the original region of interest. This includes receiving a selection of a sub-region of interest and creating a new visual query from the sub-region (1928). In some embodiments, the sub-region of interest is selected after the visual query results are displayed. A selection of a sub-region of interest having a fourth two-dimensional image resolution is received. The fourth two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the sub-region of interest. A new visual query is created from the sub-region of interest. The new visual query has a fifth two-dimensional image resolution. The fifth two-dimensional image resolution has first and second components corresponding to first and second axes of the new visual query, such that the first and second components of the fifth two-dimensional image resolution are each no larger than corresponding components of the predefined maximum two-dimensional image resolution for visual queries. The new visual query is sent to the visual query server system, after which the process results at
operation 1924, as described above. - The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
