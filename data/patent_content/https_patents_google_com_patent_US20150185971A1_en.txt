- FIGS. 5A-E show aspects of an example user-interface 500 , in accordance with an embodiment.
- the user-interface 500 may be displayed by, for example, a wearable computing device, such as any of the wearable computing devices described above.
- FIG. 5A An example state of the user-interface 500 is shown in FIG. 5A .
- the example state shown in FIG. 5A may correspond to a first position of the wearable computing device. That is, the user-interface 500 may be displayed as shown in FIG. 5A when the wearable computing device is in the first position.
- the first position of the wearable computing device may correspond to a position of the wearable computing device when a user of the wearable computing device is looking in a direction that is generally parallel to the ground (e.g., a position that does not correspond to the user looking up or looking down). Other examples are possible as well.
- the user-interface 500 includes a view region 502 .
- An example boundary of the view region 502 is shown by a dotted frame. While the view region 502 is shown to have a landscape shape (in which the view region 502 is wider than it is tall), in other embodiments the view region 502 may have a portrait or square shape, or may have a non-rectangular shape, such as a circular or elliptical shape. The view region 502 may have other shapes as well.
- the view region 502 may be, for example, the viewable area between (or encompassing) the upper, lower, left, and right boundaries of a display on the wearable computing device.
- the view region 502 may thus be said to substantially fill a field of view of the wearable computing device.
- the view region 502 is substantially empty (e.g., completely empty) of user-interface elements, such that the user's view of the user's real-world environment is generally uncluttered, and objects in the user's environment are not obscured.
- the view region 502 may correspond to a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and an area outside the view region 502 may correspond to an area outside the field of view of the user.
- the view region 502 may correspond to a non-peripheral portion of a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and an area outside the view region 502 may correspond to a peripheral portion of the field of view of the user.

- a menu 504 may be outside of or in a peripheral portion of the field of view of the user in the user-interface 500 .
- the menu 504 is shown to be located above the view region. While the menu 504 is shown to be not visible in the view region 502 , in some embodiments the menu 504 may be partially visible in the view region 502 . In general, however, when the wearable computing device is in the first position, the menu 504 may not be fully visible in the view region.
- the wearable computing device may be configured to receive movement data corresponding to, for example, an upward movement of the wearable computing device to a second position above the first position.
- the wearable computing device may, in response to receiving the movement data corresponding to the upward movement, cause one or both of the view region 502 and the menu 504 to move such that the menu 504 becomes more visible in the view region 502 .
- the wearable computing device may cause the view region 502 to move upward and/or may cause the menu 504 to move downward.
- the view region 502 and the menu 504 may move the same amount, or may move different amounts.
- the menu 504 may move further than the view region 502 .
- the wearable computing device may cause only the menu 504 to move. Other examples are possible as well.
- the view region 502 when the view region 502 moves, the view region 502 may appear to a user of the wearable computing device as if mapped onto the inside of a static sphere centered at the wearable computing device, and a scrolling or panning movement of the view region 502 may map onto movement of the real-world environment relative to the wearable computing device.
- the view region 502 may move in other manners as well.
- the upward movement may encompass any movement having any combination of moving, tilting, rotating, shifting, sliding, or other movement that results in a generally upward movement. Further, in some embodiments “upward” may refer to an upward movement in the reference frame of a user of the wearable computing device. Other reference frames are possible as well. In embodiments where the wearable computing device is a head-mounted device, the upward movement of the wearable computing device may also be an upward movement of a user's head such as, for example, the user looking upward.
- the movement data corresponding to the upward movement may take several forms.
- the movement data may be (or may be derived from) data received from one or more movement sensors, accelerometers, and/or gyroscopes configured to detect the upward movement, such as the sensor 122 described above in connection with FIG. 1A .
- the one or more movement sensors may be included in the wearable computing device, like the sensor 122 , or may be included in a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device.
- the movement data may be (or may be derived from) data received from a touch pad, such as the finger-operable touch pad 124 described above in connection with FIG.
- the movement data may comprise a binary indication corresponding to the upward movement.
- the movement data may comprise an indication corresponding to the upward movement as well as an extent of the upward movement, such as a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the upward movement.
- the movement data may take other forms as well.
- FIG. 5B shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving movement data corresponding to an upward movement, in accordance with an embodiment.
- the user-interface 500 includes the view region 502 and the menu 504 .
- the wearable computing device may move one or both of the view region 502 and the menu 504 such that the menu 504 becomes more visible in the view region 502 .
- the view region and/or the menu 504 may be moved in several manners.
- the view region 502 and/or the menu 504 may be moved in a scrolling, panning, sliding, dropping, and/or jumping motion. For example, as the view region 502 moves upward, the menu 504 may scroll or pan into view. In some embodiments, when the view region 502 moves back downward, the menu 504 may be “pulled” downward as well, and may remain in the view region 502 . As another example, as the view region 502 moves upward, the menu 504 may appear to a user of the wearable computing device to slide or drop downward into the view region 502 . Other examples are possible as well.
- a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the scrolling, panning, sliding, and/or dropping may be based at least in part on a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the upward movement.
- the view region 502 and/or the menu 504 may be moved only when the upward movement exceeds a threshold speed, acceleration, and/or magnitude. In response to receiving data corresponding to an upward movement that exceeds such a threshold or thresholds, the view region 502 and/or the menu 504 may pan, scroll, slide, drop, and/or jump to a new field of view, as described above.
- the view region 502 and/or the menu 504 may be moved in other manners as well.
- the wearable computing device could be configured to receive data corresponding to other directional movement (e.g., downward, leftward, rightward, etc.) as well, and that the view region 502 may be moved in response to receiving such data in a manner similar to that described above in connection with upward movement.
- the menu 504 may be positioned outside the view region 502 in other directions (e.g., below, to the left of, to the right of, etc.)
- the menu 502 may have a substantially vertical shape.
- the menu 504 may be positioned to the left of the view region 502 .
- the wearable computing device may be configured to receive data corresponding to a leftward movement, and the view region 502 may be moved leftward, such that the menu 504 becomes more visible in the view region 502 .
- Other examples are possible as well.
- a user of the wearable computing device need not keep the wearable computing device at the second position to keep the menu 504 at least partially visible in the view region 502 . Rather, the user may return the wearable computing device to a more comfortable position (e.g., at or near the first position), and the wearable computing device may move the menu 504 and the view region 502 substantially together, thereby keeping the menu 504 at least partially visible in the view region 502 . In this manner, the user may continue to interact with the menu 504 even after moving the wearable computing device to what may be a more comfortable position.
- the menu 504 includes a number of menu objects 506 .
- the menu objects 506 may be arranged in a ring (or partial ring) around and above the head of a user of the wearable computing device.

- the menu objects 506 may include one or more of people, contacts, groups of people and/or contacts, calendar items, lists, notifications, alarms, reminders, status updates, incoming messages, recorded media, audio recordings, video recordings, photographs, digital collages, previously-saved states, webpages, applications, and shortcuts (e.g., to control the behavior of one or more applications running the foreground or the background (such as a play shortcut, a pause shortcut, a home screen shortcut, a close shortcut, an end shortcut, etc.) or to control one or more parameters on the wearable computing device (such as a shortcut to turn on/off WiFi, a shortcut to turn on/off vibrate, and a shortcut to adjust volume, etc.), as well as tools for controlling or accessing one or more devices, such as a still camera, a video camera, and/or an audio recorder.
- Menu objects 506 may take other forms as well.
- the tools may be located in a particular region of the menu 504 , such as the center. In some embodiments, the tools may remain in the center of the menu 504 , even if the other menu objects 506 rotate, as described above. Tool menu objects may be located in other regions of the menu 504 as well.

- the predetermined movements may be certain movements or sequence of movements of the wearable computing device or peripheral device.
- the predetermined movements may include one or more predetermined movements defined as no or substantially no movement, such as no or substantially no movement for a predetermined period of time.
- one or more predetermined movements may involve a predetermined movement of the user's head that moves the wearable computing device in a corresponding manner.
- the predetermined movements may involve a predetermined movement of a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device.

In still other embodiments, the wearable computing device 610 may provide the second state 612 by moving the view region 602 upward and moving the menu 604 downwards.
- the user 608 may interact with the menu 604 , as described above.
- movement between states of the user-interface may involve a movement of the view region 602 over a static menu 604 or, equivalently, a movement of the menu 604 and within a static view region 602 . Alternately, movement between states of the user-interface may involve movement of both the view region 602 and the menu 604 .
- movement between the states of the user-interface may be gradual and/or continuous. Alternately, movement between the states of the user-interface may be substantially instantaneous. In some embodiments, the user-interface may move between states only in response to movements of the wearable computing device that exceed a certain threshold of magnitude. Further, in some embodiments, movement between states may have a speed, acceleration, magnitude, and/or direction that corresponds to the movements of the wearable computing device. Movement between the states may take other forms as well.

Description
- Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.
- Augmented reality generally refers to a real-time view of a real-world environment that is augmented with additional content. Typically, a user experiences augmented reality through the use of a computing device. The computing device is typically configured to generate the real-time view of the environment, either by allowing a user to directly view the environment or by allowing the user to indirectly view the environment by generating and displaying a real-time representation of the environment to be viewed by the user.
- Further, the computing device is typically configured to generate the additional content. The additional content may include, for example, a user-interface through which the user may interact with the computing device. Typically, the computing device overlays the view of the environment with the user-interface, such that the user sees the view of the environment and the user-interface at the same time.
- In some cases, a user-interface overlaying a view of an environment may obscure one or more objects in the environment or may appear cluttered, which may be undesirable for a user. For this reason, a user-interface that does not obscure or clutter a view of an environment may be beneficial.
- Disclosed is such a user-interface. In one embodiment, the user-interface may include a view region and a menu that is not fully visible in the view region.
- In one aspect, a method is disclosed. The method comprises receiving data corresponding to a first position of a wearable computing device and responsively causing the wearable computing device to provide a user-interface. The user-interfaces comprises a view region and a menu, where the view region substantially fills a field of view of the wearable computing device and the menu is not fully visible in the view region. The method further comprises receiving movement data corresponding to an upward movement of the wearable computing device to a second position above the first position and responsively causing the wearable computing device to move the menu such that the menu becomes more visible in the view region.
- In another aspect, a non-transitory computer readable medium is disclosed having stored therein instructions executable by a computing device to cause the computing device to perform the functions of the method described above.
- In yet another aspect, a wearable computing device is disclosed. The wearable computing device comprises at least one processor and data storage. The data storage comprises instructions executable by the at least one processor to receive data corresponding to a first position of the wearable computing device and responsively cause the wearable computing device to provide a user-interface. The user-interface comprises a view region and a menu, where the view region substantially fills a field of view of the wearable computing device and the menu is not fully visible in the view region. The instructions are further executable by the processor to receive movement data corresponding to an upward movement of the wearable computing device to a second position above the first position and responsively cause the wearable computing device to move the menu such that the menu becomes more visible in the view region.
- These as well as other aspects, advantages, and alternatives, will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description, with reference where appropriate to the accompanying drawings.

- Disclosed is a user-interface that avoids obscuring or cluttering a user's view of an environment. The user-interface may be provided by, for example, a wearable computing device.
- The user-interface may include a view region and a menu. In embodiments where the user-interface is provided by a wearable computing device, the view region may substantially fill a field of view of the wearable computing device. Further, the menu may not be fully visible in the view region. For example, the menu may be above the view region, such that only a bottom portion of the menu is visible in the view region. As another example, the menu may be above the view region, and the menu may not be visible at all in the view region. Other examples are possible as well.
- The wearable computing device may be configured to detect one or more predetermined movements, such as an upward movement of the wearable computing device. In response to detecting the upward movement, the wearable computing device may cause the menu to become more visible in the view region. For example, in response to detecting the movement, one or both of the view region and the menu may move, such that the menu becomes more visible in the view region. Other examples are possible as well.
- An example wearable computing device is further described below in connection with
FIGS. 1A-4 . An example user-interface is further described below in connection withFIGS. 5A-E .

Further, in some embodiments,computing system 400 may include a system bus 406 that communicatively connects theprocessor 402 and thedata storage 404, as well as other components ofcomputing system 400. Depending on the desired configuration, theprocessor 402 may be any type of processor including, but not limited to, a microprocessor (μP), a microcontroller (μC), a digital signal processor (DSP), or any combination thereof. Furthermore,data storage 404 can be of any type of memory now known or later developed including but not limited to volatile memory (such as RAM), non-volatile memory (such as ROM, flash memory, etc.) or any combination thereof. - The

To this end, thedisplay 410 may take the form of any of the lens elements described above in connection withFIGS. 1A-3 . Alternately, in embodiments where thecomputing system 400 is included in a non-wearable computing device (e.g., a mobile phone or tablet computer), thedisplay 410 may comprise a liquid crystal display and/or a touchscreen. Other displays are possible as well. - User-
interface module 422 may be further configured to receive data from and transmit data to (or be otherwise compatible with) one or more user-interface devices 428. The user-interface devices 428 may include, for example, one or more cameras or detectors, one or more sensors, and/or a finger-operable touch pad, which may be included in thecomputing system 400, similar to those described above in connection withFIG. 1A , or may be included in one or more peripheral devices that may be connected to the computing system.

FIGS. 5A-E show aspects of an example user-interface 500, in accordance with an embodiment. The user-interface 500 may be displayed by, for example, a wearable computing device, such as any of the wearable computing devices described above. - An example state of the user-
interface 500 is shown inFIG. 5A . The example state shown inFIG. 5A may correspond to a first position of the wearable computing device. That is, the user-interface 500 may be displayed as shown inFIG. 5A when the wearable computing device is in the first position. In some embodiments, the first position of the wearable computing device may correspond to a position of the wearable computing device when a user of the wearable computing device is looking in a direction that is generally parallel to the ground (e.g., a position that does not correspond to the user looking up or looking down). Other examples are possible as well. - As shown, the user-
interface 500 includes aview region 502. An example boundary of theview region 502 is shown by a dotted frame. While theview region 502 is shown to have a landscape shape (in which theview region 502 is wider than it is tall), in other embodiments theview region 502 may have a portrait or square shape, or may have a non-rectangular shape, such as a circular or elliptical shape. Theview region 502 may have other shapes as well. - The
view region 502 may be, for example, the viewable area between (or encompassing) the upper, lower, left, and right boundaries of a display on the wearable computing device. Theview region 502 may thus be said to substantially fill a field of view of the wearable computing device. - As shown, when the wearable computing device is in the first position, the
view region 502 is substantially empty (e.g., completely empty) of user-interface elements, such that the user's view of the user's real-world environment is generally uncluttered, and objects in the user's environment are not obscured. - In some embodiments, the
view region 502 may correspond to a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and an area outside theview region 502 may correspond to an area outside the field of view of the user. In other embodiments, theview region 502 may correspond to a non-peripheral portion of a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and an area outside theview region 502 may correspond to a peripheral portion of the field of view of the user. In still other embodiments, the user-interface 500 may be larger than or substantially the same as a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and the field of view of the user may be larger than or substantially the same size as theview region 502. Theview region 502 may take other forms as well. - Accordingly, the portions of the user-
interface 500 outside of theview region 502 may be outside of or in a peripheral portion of a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device. For example, as shown, amenu 504 may be outside of or in a peripheral portion of the field of view of the user in the user-interface 500. In particular, themenu 504 is shown to be located above the view region. While themenu 504 is shown to be not visible in theview region 502, in some embodiments themenu 504 may be partially visible in theview region 502. In general, however, when the wearable computing device is in the first position, themenu 504 may not be fully visible in the view region. - In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be configured to receive movement data corresponding to, for example, an upward movement of the wearable computing device to a second position above the first position. In these embodiments, the wearable computing device may, in response to receiving the movement data corresponding to the upward movement, cause one or both of the
view region 502 and themenu 504 to move such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. For example, the wearable computing device may cause theview region 502 to move upward and/or may cause themenu 504 to move downward. Theview region 502 and themenu 504 may move the same amount, or may move different amounts. In one embodiment, themenu 504 may move further than theview region 502. As another example, the wearable computing device may cause only themenu 504 to move. Other examples are possible as well. - In some embodiments, when the
view region 502 moves, theview region 502 may appear to a user of the wearable computing device as if mapped onto the inside of a static sphere centered at the wearable computing device, and a scrolling or panning movement of theview region 502 may map onto movement of the real-world environment relative to the wearable computing device. Theview region 502 may move in other manners as well. - While the term “upward” is used, it is to be understood that the upward movement may encompass any movement having any combination of moving, tilting, rotating, shifting, sliding, or other movement that results in a generally upward movement. Further, in some embodiments “upward” may refer to an upward movement in the reference frame of a user of the wearable computing device. Other reference frames are possible as well. In embodiments where the wearable computing device is a head-mounted device, the upward movement of the wearable computing device may also be an upward movement of a user's head such as, for example, the user looking upward.
- The movement data corresponding to the upward movement may take several forms. For example, the movement data may be (or may be derived from) data received from one or more movement sensors, accelerometers, and/or gyroscopes configured to detect the upward movement, such as the
sensor 122 described above in connection withFIG. 1A . The one or more movement sensors may be included in the wearable computing device, like thesensor 122, or may be included in a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device. As another example, the movement data may be (or may be derived from) data received from a touch pad, such as the finger-operable touch pad 124 described above in connection withFIG. 1A , or other input device included in or coupled to the wearable computing device and configured to detect one or more predetermined movements. In some embodiments, the movement data may comprise a binary indication corresponding to the upward movement. In other embodiments, the movement data may comprise an indication corresponding to the upward movement as well as an extent of the upward movement, such as a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the upward movement. The movement data may take other forms as well. -
FIG. 5B shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving movement data corresponding to an upward movement, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown, the user-interface 500 includes theview region 502 and themenu 504. - As noted above, in response to receiving the movement data corresponding to an upward movement of the wearable computing device, the wearable computing device may move one or both of the
view region 502 and themenu 504 such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. The view region and/or themenu 504 may be moved in several manners. - In some embodiments, the
view region 502 and/or themenu 504 may be moved in a scrolling, panning, sliding, dropping, and/or jumping motion. For example, as theview region 502 moves upward, themenu 504 may scroll or pan into view. In some embodiments, when theview region 502 moves back downward, themenu 504 may be “pulled” downward as well, and may remain in theview region 502. As another example, as theview region 502 moves upward, themenu 504 may appear to a user of the wearable computing device to slide or drop downward into theview region 502. Other examples are possible as well. - In some embodiments, a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the scrolling, panning, sliding, and/or dropping may be based at least in part on a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the upward movement. Further, in some embodiments, the
view region 502 and/or themenu 504 may be moved only when the upward movement exceeds a threshold speed, acceleration, and/or magnitude. In response to receiving data corresponding to an upward movement that exceeds such a threshold or thresholds, theview region 502 and/or themenu 504 may pan, scroll, slide, drop, and/or jump to a new field of view, as described above. - The
view region 502 and/or themenu 504 may be moved in other manners as well. - While the foregoing description focused on upward movement, it is to be understood that the wearable computing device could be configured to receive data corresponding to other directional movement (e.g., downward, leftward, rightward, etc.) as well, and that the
view region 502 may be moved in response to receiving such data in a manner similar to that described above in connection with upward movement. In these embodiments, rather than being positioned above theview region 502, themenu 504 may be positioned outside theview region 502 in other directions (e.g., below, to the left of, to the right of, etc.) Further, in these embodiments, rather than having a substantially horizontal shape, as shown inFIG. 5A , themenu 502 may have a substantially vertical shape. For example, themenu 504 may be positioned to the left of theview region 502. The wearable computing device may be configured to receive data corresponding to a leftward movement, and theview region 502 may be moved leftward, such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. Other examples are possible as well. - In some embodiments, a user of the wearable computing device need not keep the wearable computing device at the second position to keep the
menu 504 at least partially visible in theview region 502. Rather, the user may return the wearable computing device to a more comfortable position (e.g., at or near the first position), and the wearable computing device may move themenu 504 and theview region 502 substantially together, thereby keeping themenu 504 at least partially visible in theview region 502. In this manner, the user may continue to interact with themenu 504 even after moving the wearable computing device to what may be a more comfortable position. - As shown, the
menu 504 includes a number of menu objects 506. In some embodiments, the menu objects 506 may be arranged in a ring (or partial ring) around and above the head of a user of the wearable computing device. In other embodiments, the menu objects 506 may be arranged in a dome-shape above the user's head. The ring or dome may be centered above the wearable computing device and/or the user's head. In other embodiments, the menu objects 506 may be arranged in other ways as well. - The number of menu objects 506 in the
menu 504 may be fixed or may be variable. In embodiments where the number is variable, the menu objects 506 may vary in size according to the number of menu objects 506 in themenu 504. - Depending on the application of the wearable computing device, the menu objects 506 may take several forms. For example, the menu objects 506 may include one or more of people, contacts, groups of people and/or contacts, calendar items, lists, notifications, alarms, reminders, status updates, incoming messages, recorded media, audio recordings, video recordings, photographs, digital collages, previously-saved states, webpages, applications, and shortcuts (e.g., to control the behavior of one or more applications running the foreground or the background (such as a play shortcut, a pause shortcut, a home screen shortcut, a close shortcut, an end shortcut, etc.) or to control one or more parameters on the wearable computing device (such as a shortcut to turn on/off WiFi, a shortcut to turn on/off vibrate, and a shortcut to adjust volume, etc.), as well as tools for controlling or accessing one or more devices, such as a still camera, a video camera, and/or an audio recorder. Menu objects 506 may take other forms as well.
- In embodiments where the menu objects 506 include tools, the tools may be located in a particular region of the
menu 504, such as the center. In some embodiments, the tools may remain in the center of themenu 504, even if the other menu objects 506 rotate, as described above. Tool menu objects may be located in other regions of themenu 504 as well. - The particular menu objects 506 that are included in
menu 504 may be fixed or variable. For example, the menu objects 506 may be preselected by a user of the wearable computing device. In another embodiment, the menu objects 506 may be automatically assembled by the wearable computing device from one or more physical or digital contexts including, for example, people, places, and/or objects surrounding the wearable computing device, address books, calendars, social-networking web services or applications, photo sharing web services or applications, search histories, and/or other contexts. Further, some menu objects 506 may be fixed, while other menu objects 506 may be variable. The menu objects 506 may be selected in other manners as well. - Similarly, an order or configuration in which the menu objects 506 are displayed may be fixed or variable. In one embodiment, the menu objects 506 may be pre-ordered by a user of the wearable computing device. In another embodiment, the menu objects 506 may be automatically ordered based on, for example, how often each
menu object 506 is used (on the wearable computing device only or in other contexts as well), how recently eachmenu object 506 was used (on the wearable computing device only or in other contexts as well), an explicit or implicit importance or priority ranking of the menu objects 506, and/or other criteria. - As shown in
FIG. 5B , only a portion of themenu 504 is visible in theview region 502. In particular, while themenu 504 is vertically inside theview region 502, themenu 504 extends horizontally beyond theview region 502 such that a portion of themenu 504 is outside theview region 502. As a result, one or more menu objects 506 may be only partially visible in theview region 502, or may not be visible in theview region 502 at all. In particular, in embodiments where the menu objects 506 extend circularly around a user's head, like a ring (or partial ring), a number of the menu objects 506 may be outside theview region 502. - In order to view menu objects 506 located outside the
view region 506, a user of the wearable computing device may interact with the wearable computing device to, for example, pan or rotate the menu objects 506 along a path (e.g., left or right, clockwise or counterclockwise) around the user's head. To this end, the wearable computing device may, in some embodiments, be configured to receive panning data indicating a direction. - The panning data may take several forms. For example, the panning data may be (or may be derived from) data received from one or more movement sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and/or detectors configured to detect one or more predetermined movements. The one or more movement sensors may be included in the wearable computing device, like the
sensor 122, or may be included in a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device. As another example, the panning data may be (or may be derived from) data received from a touch pad, such as the finger-operable touch pad 124 described above in connection withFIG. 1A , or other input device included in or coupled to the wearable computing device and configured to detect one or more predetermined movements. In some embodiments, the panning data may take the form of a binary indication corresponding to the predetermined movement. In other embodiments, the panning data may comprise an indication corresponding to the predetermined movement as well as an extent of the predetermined movement, such as a magnitude, speed, and/or acceleration of the predetermined movement. The panning data may take other forms as well. - The predetermined movements may take several forms. In some embodiments, the predetermined movements may be certain movements or sequence of movements of the wearable computing device or peripheral device. In some embodiments, the predetermined movements may include one or more predetermined movements defined as no or substantially no movement, such as no or substantially no movement for a predetermined period of time. In embodiments where the wearable computing device is a head-mounted device, one or more predetermined movements may involve a predetermined movement of the user's head that moves the wearable computing device in a corresponding manner. Alternatively or additionally, the predetermined movements may involve a predetermined movement of a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device. The peripheral device may similarly be wearable by a user of the wearable computing device, such that the movement of the peripheral device may follow a movement of the user, such as, for example, a movement of the user's hand. Still alternatively or additionally, one or more predetermined movements may be, for example, a movement across a finger-operable touch pad or other input device. Other predetermined movements are possible as well.
- In these embodiments, in response to receiving the panning data, the wearable computing device may move the menu based on the direction, such that the portion of the menu moves insides the view region.
-
FIG. 5C shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving panning data indicating a direction, in accordance with an embodiment. As indicated by the dotted arrow, themenu 504 has been moved. To this end, the panning data may have indicated, for example, that the user turned the user's head to the right, and the wearable computing device may have responsively panned themenu 504 to the left. Alternately, the panning data may have indicated, for example, that the user tilted the user's head to the left, and the wearable computing device may have responsively rotated themenu 504 in a counterclockwise direction. Other examples are possible as well. - While the
menu 504 is shown to extend horizontally beyond theview region 502, in some embodiments themenu 504 may be fully visible in theview region 502. - Returning to
FIG. 5B , in some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive from the user a selection of amenu object 506 from themenu 504. To this end, the user-interface 500 may include acursor 508, shown inFIG. 5B as a reticle, which may navigated around theview region 502 to select menu objects 506 from themenu 504. Alternatively, thecursor 508 may be “locked” in the center of theview region 502, and themenu 504 may be static. Then, theview region 502, along with the lockedcursor 508, may be navigated over thestatic menu 504 to select menu objects 506 from themenu 504. In some embodiments, thecursor 508 may be controlled by a user of the wearable computing device through one or more predetermined movements. Thecursor 508 may always be present on the device, or may become visible only at certain times, such as when themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. Accordingly, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive selection data corresponding to the one or more predetermined movements. The selection data may take any of the forms described above in connection with the panning data. - As shown, a user of the wearable computing device has navigated the
cursor 508 to themenu object 506 using one or more predetermined movements. In order to select themenu object 506, the user may perform an additional predetermined movement, such as holding thecursor 508 over themenu object 506 for a predetermined period of time. The user may select themenu object 506 in other manners as well. - In some embodiments, the
menu 504, one or more menu objects 506, and/or other objects in the user-interface 500 may function as “gravity wells,” such that when thecursor 508 is within a predetermined distance of the object, thecursor 508 is drawn towards the object by “gravity.” Additionally, thecursor 508 may remain on the object until a predetermined movement having a magnitude, speed, and/or acceleration greater than a predetermined threshold is detected. In this manner, a user may more easily navigate thecursor 508 to the object and hold thecursor 508 over the object so as to select the object. - Once a
menu object 506 is selected, the wearable computing device may cause themenu object 506 to be displayed in theview region 502 as a selected menu object.FIG. 5D shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving selection data indicating selection of a selectedmenu object 510, in accordance with an embodiment. - As indicated by the dotted arrow, the
menu object 506 is displayed in theview region 502 as a selectedmenu object 510. As shown, the selectedmenu object 510 is displayed larger and in more detail in theview region 502 than in themenu 504. In other embodiments, however, the selectedmenu object 510 could be displayed in theview region 502 smaller than or the same size as, and in less detail than or the same detail as, themenu 504. In some embodiments, additional content (e.g., actions to be applied to, with, or based on the selectedmenu object 510, information related to the selectedmenu object 510, and/or modifiable options, preferences, or parameters for the selectedmenu object 510, etc.) may be showed adjacent to or nearby the selectedmenu object 510 in theview region 502. - Once the selected
menu object 510 is displayed in theview region 502, a user of the wearable computing device may interact with the selectedmenu object 510. For example, as the selectedmenu object 510 is shown as an email inbox, the user may select one of the emails in the email inbox to read. Depending on the selected menu object, the user may interact with the selected menu object in other ways as well (e.g., the user may locate additional information related to the selectedmenu object 510, modify, augment, and/or delete the selectedmenu object 510, etc.). To this end, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive input data corresponding to one or more predetermined movements indicating interactions with the user-interface 500. The input data may take any of the forms described above in connection with the movement data and/or the selection data. -
FIG. 5E shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving input data corresponding to a user input, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown, a user of the wearable computing device has navigated thecursor 508 to a particular subject line in the email inbox and selected the subject line. As a result, theemail 512 is displayed in the view region, so that the user may read theemail 512. The user may interact with the user-interface 500 in other manners as well, depending on, for example, the selected menu object. - While provided in the
view region 502, the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selected menu object 510 (e.g., the email 512) may be “locked” to the center of theview region 502. That is, if theview region 502 moves for any reason (e.g., in response to movement of the wearable computing device), the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selectedmenu object 510 may remain locked in the center of theview region 502, such that the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selectedmenu object 510 appear to a user of the wearable computing device not to move. This may make it easier for a user of the wearable computing device to interact with the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selectedmenu object 510, even while the wearer and/or the wearable computing device are moving. - In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive a request to remove the
menu 504 from theview region 502. The request may take several forms. - In some embodiments, the request may take the form of a time out. To this end, the wearable computing device may be further configured to detect when a predetermined amount of time of inactivity has passed, and, in response to the detection, may remove the
menu 504 from the view region. - In other embodiments, the request may take the form of a request from the user. The user may indicate the request by, for example, selecting a “close” option from the
menu 504 and/or by selecting an object or application outside themenu 504. To this end, the wearable computing device may be further configured to detect when a request has been indicated by the user and, in response to the detection, may remove themenu 504 from theview region 502. - In still other embodiments, the request may take the form of removal data corresponding to one or more predetermined movements. The removal data may take any of the forms described above in connection with the movement data and/or panning data. For example, the removal data may correspond to a repeated movement of the wearable computing device from the left to the right, as if a user of the wearable computing device is shaking his or her head. As another example, the removal data may correspond to a movement detected by the wearable computing device or by a peripheral device connected to the wearable computing device, such as a movement of a user's hand detected by, e.g., a proximity sensor, or a movement across a touchpad. Other examples are possible as well.
- Once the
menu 504 is removed from theview region 502, the user-interface 500 may again appear as shown inFIG. 5A . - Several example user-interfaces have been described. It is to be understood that each of the above-described user-interfaces is merely an exemplary state of the disclosed user-interface, and that the user-interface may move between the above-described and other states according to one or more types of user input to the wearable computing device and/or the user-interface. That is, the disclosed user-interface is not a static user-interface, but rather is a dynamic user-interface configured to move between several states. Movement between states of the user-interface is described in connection with
FIGS. 6A and 6B , which show an example implementation of an example user-interface, in accordance with an embodiment. -
FIG. 6A shows an example implementation of an example user-interface on an examplewearable computing device 610 when thewearable computing device 610 is at a first position, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown inFIG. 6A , auser 608 wears awearable computing device 610. In response to receiving data corresponding to a first position of the wearable computing device 610 (e.g., a position of thewearable computing device 610 when theuser 608 is looking in a direction that is generally parallel to the ground, or another comfortable position), thewearable computing device 610 provides afirst state 600 of a user-interface, which includes aview region 602 and amenu 604. - Example boundaries of the
view region 602 are shown by the dottedlines 606A through 606D. Theview region 602 may substantially fill a field of view of thewearable computing device 610 and/or theuser 608. - As shown, in the
first state 600, theview region 602 is substantially empty. Further, in thefirst state 600, themenu 604 is not fully visible in theview region 602 because some or all of themenu 604 is above theview region 602. As a result, themenu 604 is thus not fully visible to theuser 608. For example, themenu 604 may be visible only in a periphery of theuser 608, or may not be visible at all. Other examples are possible as well. - The
menu 604 is shown to be arranged in a partial ring located above theview region 602. In some embodiments, themenu 604 may extend further around theuser 608, forming a full ring. The (partial or full) ring of themenu 604 may be substantially centered over thewearable computing device 610 and/or theuser 608. - At some point, the
user 608 may cause an upward movement of thewearable computing device 610 by, for example, looking upward. As a result of the upward movement, thewearable computing device 610 may move from a first position to a second position above the first position.FIG. 6B shows an example implementation of an example user-interface on an examplewearable computing device 610 when thewearable computing device 610 is at a second position above the first position, in accordance with an embodiment. - In response to detecting the
upward movement 614, thewearable computing device 610 may provide asecond state 612 of the user-interface. As shown, in thesecond state 612, themenu 604 is more visible in theview region 602, as compared with thefirst state 600. As shown, themenu 604 is substantially fully visible in theview region 602. In other embodiments, however, themenu 604 may be only partially visible in theview region 602. - As shown, the
wearable computing device 610 provides thesecond state 612 by moving theview region 602 upward. In other embodiments, however, thewearable computing device 610 may provide thesecond state 612 by moving themenu 604 downward. In still other embodiments, thewearable computing device 610 may provide thesecond state 612 by moving theview region 602 upward and moving themenu 604 downwards. - While the
menu 604 is visible in theview region 602, as shown in thestate 612, theuser 608 may interact with themenu 604, as described above. - It will be understood that movement between states of the user-interface may involve a movement of the
view region 602 over astatic menu 604 or, equivalently, a movement of themenu 604 and within astatic view region 602. Alternately, movement between states of the user-interface may involve movement of both theview region 602 and themenu 604. - In some embodiments, movement between the states of the user-interface may be gradual and/or continuous. Alternately, movement between the states of the user-interface may be substantially instantaneous. In some embodiments, the user-interface may move between states only in response to movements of the wearable computing device that exceed a certain threshold of magnitude. Further, in some embodiments, movement between states may have a speed, acceleration, magnitude, and/or direction that corresponds to the movements of the wearable computing device. Movement between the states may take other forms as well.

FIG. 7 shows a flowchart depicting anexample method 700 for providing a user-interface, in accordance with an embodiment. -
Method 700 shown inFIG. 7 presents an embodiment of a method that, for example, could be used with the systems and devices described herein.Method 700 may include one or more operations, functions, or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks 702-706. Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order, these blocks may also be performed in parallel, and/or in a different order than those described herein. Also, the various blocks may be combined into fewer blocks, divided into additional blocks, and/or removed based upon the desired implementation. - In addition, for the
method 700 and other processes and methods disclosed herein, the flowchart shows functionality and operation of one possible implementation of present embodiments. In this regard, each block may represent a module, a segment, or a portion of program code, which includes one or more instructions executable by a processor for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process. The program code may be stored on any type of computer readable medium, for example, such as a storage device including a disk or hard drive. The computer readable medium may include a non-transitory computer readable medium, for example, such as computer-readable media that stores data for short periods of time like register memory, processor cache and Random Access Memory (RAM). The computer readable medium may also include non-transitory media, such as secondary or persistent long term storage, like read only memory (ROM), optical or magnetic disks, and compact-disc read only memory (CD-ROM), for example. The computer readable media may also be any other volatile or non-volatile storage systems. The computer readable medium may be considered a computer readable storage medium, a tangible storage device, or other article of manufacture, for example. - In addition, for the
method 700 and other processes and methods disclosed herein, each block may represent circuitry that is wired to perform the specific logical functions in the process. - As shown, the
method 700 begins atblock 702 where a wearable computing device receives data corresponding to a first position of the wearable computing device and responsively causes the wearable computing device to provide a user-interface that comprises a view region and a menu. - The wearable computing device may take any of the forms described above in connection with
FIGS. 1A-4 . In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be a head-mounted device. Other wearable computing devices are possible as well. The user-interface may, for example, appear similar to the user-interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5A . To this end, the view region may substantially fill a field of view of the wearable computing device. Further, the menu may not be fully visible in the view region. For example, the menu may not be visible in the view region at all. The view region may be substantially empty. - The
method 700 continues atblock 704 where the wearable computing device receives movement data corresponding to an upward movement of the wearable computing device to a second position above the first position. The movement data may take any of the forms described above. - At
block 706, the wearable computing device responsively moves the menu such that the menu becomes more visible in the view region. Atblock 706, the user-interface may, for example, appear similar to the user-interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5B . To this end, the menu may be at least partially, and in some cases fully, visible in the view region. For example, the menu may be located above the view region, or may be arranged along an at least partial ring located above the view region. The at least partial ring may be substantially centered over the wearable computing device. In some embodiments, the menu may include a number of menu objects, as described above. Further, in some embodiments, the menu may extend horizontally beyond the view region such that a portion of the menu is outside the view region. - In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive panning data and responsively pan and/or rotate the menu, as described above. In this manner, the wearable computing device may bring into the view region portions of the menu (e.g., menu objects) that are not previously located inside the view region. In some embodiments, after the wearable computing device pans and/or rotates the menu, the user-interface may appear similar to the user-
interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5C . - Further, in some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive selection data indicating a selection of a selected menu object from the menu, as described above. In response to receiving the selection data, the wearable computing device may cause the wearable computing device to provide the selected menu object in the view region. In some embodiments, after the wearable computing device receives the selection data, the user-interface may appear similar to the user-
interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5D . - Still further, in some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive input data corresponding to a user input. The user input may allow the user to, for example, interact with the selected menu object, as described above. In some embodiments, after the wearable computing device receives the input data, the user-interface may appear similar to the user-
interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5E . - Still further, in some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive removal data and may responsively remove the menu from the view region, as described above. In some embodiments, after the wearable computing device removes the menu from the view region, the user-interface may appear similar to the user-
interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5A . -
FIG. 8 shows a flowchart depicting another example method for providing a user-interface, in accordance with an embodiment. - As shown, the
method 800 begins atblock 802 where a computing device receives data corresponding to a first position of the wearable computing device and responsively causes the computing device to provide a user-interface that comprises a view region and a menu. - The computing device may take any of the forms described above in connection with
FIGS. 1A-4 . For example, the computing device may be a handheld or otherwise portable computing device, such as a mobile phone or tablet computer. - The user-interface may take a number of forms. In some embodiments, the view region may substantially fill a field of view of the wearable computing device. Further, the menu may not be fully visible in the view region. For example, the menu may not be visible in the view region at all. The view region may be substantially empty. The menu may be to the left of, to the right of, above and/or below the view region. The menu may have a substantially horizontal shape, or may have a substantially vertical shape. Alternately or additionally, the menu may be arranged in an at least partial ring centered at the computing device.
- The
method 800 continues atblock 804 where the computing device receives movement data corresponding to an movement of the computing device from a first position to a second position. The movement data may take any of the forms described above. - At
block 806, the computing device responsively moves the menu such that the menu becomes more visible in the view region. For example, the computing device may move the menu in a direction opposite the first direction. As another example, the computing device may move the menu in the first direction. As still another example, the computing device may move the menu in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the first direction. As a result of moving the menu, the menu may be at least partially, and in some cases fully, visible in the view region. - In some embodiments, in addition to or instead of moving the menu, the computing device may move the view region. For example, the computing device may move the view region in the first direction or in a direction that is substantially parallel to the first direction. Other examples are possible as well.
- In some embodiments, the menu may be located at the left, right, top, or bottom of the view region. The menu may have a substantially horizontal shape, or may have a substantially vertical shape. Alternately or additionally, the menu may be arranged in an at least partial ring centered at the computing device. In some embodiments, the menu may include a number of menu objects, as described above. Further, in some embodiments, the menu may extend beyond the view region such that a portion of the menu is outside the view region. For example, if the menu has a substantially horizontal shape, the menu may extend horizontally beyond the view region. Similarly, if the menu has a substantially vertical shape, the menu may extend vertically beyond the view region. The menu may take other forms as well.
- While various aspects and embodiments have been disclosed herein, other aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The various aspects and embodiments disclosed herein are for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting, with the true scope and spirit being indicated by the following claims.
