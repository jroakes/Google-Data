Definitions
- This disclosure generally relates to systems and methods that facilitate restricting operation of a client device to parent approved content.
- Parents often allow their children to operate a parent's client device in order to keep the child occupied. For example, when a family is out for dinner or taking a long drive, a parent may let a child play with his mobile phone or tablet device so that the child does not get bored or unruly while waiting for food or to arrive at a destination. In another example, a parent may let the child use the parent's personal computer while the parent is working. However, letting a child use a parent's client device can present several issues for the parent and/or child. From the parent's perspective, the child may have access to content that the parent would not like the child to utilize or view.
- the child may inadvertently access the parent's email or text messaging program and send an inappropriate message to one of the parent's work contacts.
- the child may unintentionally access music, videos, or internet sites which have content that is adult oriented. From the child's perspective, she may not be old enough to understand all of the controls of the client device and accidently place the device in a state from which she does not know how to navigate to content she would like to view.
- a parent may start a video on the client device and give the device to the child. The child may accidentally activate a control that navigates away from the video and have to ask the parent for help to get back to the video. This interruption can become frustrating for the child and parent, especially if occurs repetitively.
- a content selection component receives playlist input specifying content to include in at least one parent approved playlist.
- a mode control component selectively enables a child mode on the mobile device based upon mode control input. The child mode prevents all input to the mobile device except for touchscreen input, and displays a child mode interface that restricts access on the mobile device to the at least one parent approved playlist and content associated with the at least one parent approved playlist.
- a playlist input specifying content to include in at least one parent approved playlist is received.
- a child mode on the mobile device is selectively enabled based upon mode control input, wherein child mode prevents all input to the device except for touchscreen input, and displays a child mode interface that restricts access on the mobile device to the at least one parent approved playlist and content in the at least one parent approved playlist.

- Child mode interface 305 restricts the device to applications, content, or functions that are approved by the parent for the child. In this manner, a child will not be able to accidentally perform an operation on the device that is not approved by the parent, such as sending an e-mail to the parent's co-worker or getting the client device 110 in a state where they cannot navigate to content that they would like to view.
- physical input buttons such as 310 A, 310 B, 310 C, 310 D, 310 E, 310 F, and 310 G can be disabled. It is to be appreciated that a child cannot modify parent approved playlists or parent approved content lists in the child mode interface.
- child mode interface 305 is a simplified interface that limits navigation in a manner that is easy for a child to employ. For example, only background images can be displayed, or only text can be displayed, or a combination of background images and text can be display, such as name of playlist or content associated with the background image. It is to be appreciated that the child mode interface can employ any combination of visual and/or audio elements.
- child mode interface 305 shows background images 320 A, 320 B, 320 C, 320 D, 320 E, 320 F, 320 G, 320 H, and 320 I associated with respective parent approved playlists. It is to be understood that while nine background images are displayed, any number of background images can be included in child mode interface 305 and displayed using suitable navigation controls.
- a child can navigate amongst the background images 320 A, 320 B, 320 C, 320 D, 320 E, 320 F, 320 G, 320 H, and 320 I, for example, using touchscreen swipe navigation.

- swiping up can bring background image 320 H to the center of the display
- swiping left can bring background image 320 F to the center of the display
- swiping right can bring background image 320 D to the center of the display
- likewise swiping in a diagonal direction can bring a respective background image 320 A, 320 C, 320 G, or 320 I to the center of the display depending on the direction of the diagonal swipe.
- each horizontal row of background images represents parent approved content in an associated parent approved playlist. Swiping up or down navigates amongst parent approved playlists, while swiping right or left navigates amongst parent approved content in an associated parent approved playlist.
- a child can select a background image 320 A, 320 B, 320 C, 320 D, 320 E, 320 F, 320 G, 320 H, or 320 I, for example, using suitable touchscreen selection gesture, a non-limiting example of which includes, pressing on the touchscreen interface within a boundary of a background image for a predetermined amount of time.
- mode control component 150 can initiate playing or viewing of the playlist, for example, as depicted in FIGS. 3B and 3C .
- client device 110 with child mode interface 305 is depicted where a child has selected background image 320 E.
- viewing of the content in the playlist is delayed, for example due to processing, downloading, buffering delay of the content.
- mode control component 150 can present an animation 325 in child mode interface 305 to keep the child occupied until the content is ready to be viewed.
- Example animation 325 depicts a puzzle animation made from background image 320 E, however, any animation can be employed.
- mode control component 150 can begin playing of the content, for example, as depicted in FIG. 3C . It is to be understood that playing an animation can be optional.
- child mode interface does not play an animation when playing of content is delayed.
- child mode interface selectively plays an animation, such as, based upon a device or user preference setting.
- child mode interface always plays an animation when playing of content is delayed.
- client device 110 with child mode interface 305 is depicted where a child has selected background image 320 E.
- Mode control component 150 presents child mode interface 305 playing content associated with the playlist associated with background image 320 E.
- playback controls appropriate for the content can be presented.
- slider control 330 A is shown that allows for selection of point of playback of the video content depicted.
- rewind control 330 B, stop control 330 C, pause control 330 D, play control 330 E, fast forward control 330 F are depicted.
- mode control component 150 can limit navigation such that the child upon choosing to stop playing content or to exit a playlist is returned to a display of background images as depicted in FIG. 3A .
- this prevents the child from navigating from an application in which they were viewing parent approved content to an application, content, or function that is not approved by the parent.
- child mode interface 305 can envelop any applications associated with content and limit the functionality of the application. For example, if a child is viewing a video, mode control component 150 can present a child mode interface 305 that envelops the video application and limit the functions of the video application to prevent navigating outside of the child mode interface.

Abstract
This disclosure relates to systems and methods that facilitate restricting operation of a client device to parent approved content.
Description
- This disclosure generally relates to systems and methods that facilitate restricting operation of a client device to parent approved content.
- Parents often allow their children to operate a parent's client device in order to keep the child occupied. For example, when a family is out for dinner or taking a long drive, a parent may let a child play with his mobile phone or tablet device so that the child does not get bored or unruly while waiting for food or to arrive at a destination. In another example, a parent may let the child use the parent's personal computer while the parent is working. However, letting a child use a parent's client device can present several issues for the parent and/or child. From the parent's perspective, the child may have access to content that the parent would not like the child to utilize or view. For example, the child may inadvertently access the parent's email or text messaging program and send an inappropriate message to one of the parent's work contacts. In another example, the child may unintentionally access music, videos, or internet sites which have content that is adult oriented. From the child's perspective, she may not be old enough to understand all of the controls of the client device and accidently place the device in a state from which she does not know how to navigate to content she would like to view. For example, a parent may start a video on the client device and give the device to the child. The child may accidentally activate a control that navigates away from the video and have to ask the parent for help to get back to the video. This interruption can become frustrating for the child and parent, especially if occurs repetitively.
- A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary, non-limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting embodiments in simplified form as a prelude to more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow in the disclosure.
- In accordance with a non-limiting implementation, a content selection component receives playlist input specifying content to include in at least one parent approved playlist. A mode control component selectively enables a child mode on the mobile device based upon mode control input. The child mode prevents all input to the mobile device except for touchscreen input, and displays a child mode interface that restricts access on the mobile device to the at least one parent approved playlist and content associated with the at least one parent approved playlist.
- In accordance with another non-limiting implementation, a playlist input specifying content to include in at least one parent approved playlist is received. A child mode on the mobile device is selectively enabled based upon mode control input, wherein child mode prevents all input to the device except for touchscreen input, and displays a child mode interface that restricts access on the mobile device to the at least one parent approved playlist and content in the at least one parent approved playlist.
- These and other implementations and embodiments are described in more detail below.

It should be understood, however, that certain aspects of this disclosure may be practiced without these specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to facilitate describing this disclosure.
- In accordance with various disclosed aspects, a mechanism is provided for allowing the parent to control content that a child can access and limiting operation of a client device when the parent places the client device in a child mode. Advantageously, the child cannot accidentally access content that the parent has not approved and the child can operate the device without having to ask the parent for assistance. For example, a parent can designate content that is approved for the child to access, and upon placing the client device in a child mode, the user interface will restrict access to the approved content, as well as, disabling controls not required to view the content.
- Content can include, for example, video, audio, image, text, or any combination thereof, non-limiting examples of which include, music, speeches, cartoons, short films, movies, televisions shows, documents, books, magazines, articles, novels, quotes, poems, comics, advertisements, photos, posters, prints, paintings, artwork, graphics, games, applications, or any other creative work that can be captured and/or conveyed through video, audio, image, text, or any combination thereof. In a non-limiting example, a social networking application may contain video or photo content that users have uploaded to share. In another non-limiting example, a music application can contain music available for listening. A further non-limiting example is an education site that contains a combination of text articles, videos, photos, and audio recordings. In another example, a tablet device may have game applications available for playing. Furthermore, the content can be available on an intranet, internet, or can be local content.
- Referring now to the drawings,

It is to be further appreciated thatcontent selection component 140 can automatically select an image as a background image to associate with a playlist. For example, based upon an analysis of the content in a playlist,content selection component 140 can select an image for the playlist that represents the content, for example, based upon criteria predetermined by the system or specified by a user, such as in a user profile. In non-limiting example, criteria can be an image that represents the majority of the content, an image associated with the first content in the playlist, collage of images from the content, or any other criteria. In a further non-limiting example, content selection component can analyze the content of the playlist and determine that a majority of the content is associated with animals and select an animal picture from the content as a background image for the playlist. It is to be appreciated that associating a background image to a playlist can be optional. - Referring to
FIG. 2D in a non-limiting example,user interface 205 is depicted where “PARENT 1” has selected newplaylist selection element 242 fromFIG. 2A or new playlist entry fromplaylist selection menu 250 ofFIG. 2B to create a new playlist.Function title area 235 indicates the current functional area of the application as “PLAYLIST EDITOR”, similar to that depicted inFIG. 2B .User interface 205 further includes aplaylist selection menu 250 that allows for selection of a playlist for editing, this example depicting “NEW” associated with “creating a new playlist.Playlist selection menu 250 can accept input of a name for the playlist, for example, entered in place of “NEW” directly on the drop down menu. However, any suitable mechanism for entering a name for the playlist can be employed.User interface 205 also includes an added toplaylist area 252 that shows content that is currently in the playlist selected inplaylist selection menu 250. In this non-limiting example, added toplaylist area 252 shows “ELEPHANT VIDEO . . . CUTE CLOWNS VIDEO” currently in “NEW” playlist. -
User interface 205 includes anavailable content area 254 that shows content that is available to be added to the playlist selected inplaylist selection menu 250. In this example, shows “HIPPO VIDEO . . . JUMPROPE VIDEO” available to be added to “NEW” playlist. In addition, the user can narrow the list of available content by entering a query insearch area 220, results of which would appear inavailable content area 254. Furthermore, “PARENT 1” can use addcontent selection element 257 and removecontent selection element 257 to configure the content included in “NEW” playlist (playlist input). The configured playlist can be stored bycontent selection component 140. Additionally,user interface 205 includes autoplaylist selection element 270 for automatically adding content to a “NEW” playlist, for example, as depicted inFIG. 2E . - Referring to
FIG. 2E in a non-limiting example,user interface 205 is depicted where “PARENT 1” has selected autoplaylist selection element 270 fromFIG. 2D to automatically add content to a “NEW” playlist.Function title area 235 indicates the current functional area of the application as “PLAYLIST EDITOR”, similar to that depicted inFIGS. 2B and 2D .User interface 205 further includes aplaylist selection menu 250 that allows for selection of a playlist for editing, this example depicting “NEW” associated with “creating a new playlist.Playlist selection menu 250 can accept input of a name for the playlist, for example, entered in place of “NEW” directly on the drop down menu. However, any suitable mechanism for entering a name for the playlist can be employed. -
User interface 205 also includes an added toplaylist area 252 that shows content that is currently in the playlist selected inplaylist selection menu 250. In this non-limiting example, added toplaylist area 252 shows “ELEPHANT VIDEO . . . CLOWN VIDEO” currently in “NEW” playlist which were automatically added to the playlist by suggestion component 160 (playlist input) in response to selection of autoplaylist selection element 270 fromFIG. 2D orFIG. 2E .User interface 205 includes a parent approvedcontent list 272 that shows content that “PARENT 1” has approved for viewing by children and which can be added to the playlist selected inplaylist selection menu 250. In this example, parent approvedcontent list 272 shows “TRUCK VIDEO . . . CIRCUS VIDEO” available to be added to “NEW” playlist. - Referring back to
FIG. 1 ,suggestion component 160 can automatically add content to the playlist by employing artificial intelligence to analyze playlists, content, parent approved content list, logs of previous parent or child interaction with the client device, or other criteria. For example,suggestion component 160 can examine content that “PARENT 1” has added to other playlists and create a playlist with similar content from the parent approved content list based upon an analysis of content in the other playlists or metadata associated with content in the other playlists. In another example,suggestion component 160 can examine content that a child has viewed whileclient device 110 is in child mode and create a playlist with similar content from the parent approved content list based upon an analysis of the content the child has viewed or metadata associated with the content the child has viewed. In this example,suggestion component 160 selects content from the parent approvedcontent list 272 to add to the new playlist, in order to automatically build a parent approved playlist. As such, in one example, the new parent approved playlist can automatically be set as “Enabled for Kids” bycontent selection component 140. - In another example, the new parent approved playlist may require manual setting as “Enabled for Kids” in order to give the parent complete control over which playlists are approved for their children (playlist input). Advantageously,
suggestion component 160 can learn preferences of a parent and/or child and automatically build playlists according to their preferences. In a non-limiting example,suggestion component 160 can employ user preferences stored in a user profile and/or inferred by monitoring user interaction with theclient device 110 to determine content of interest to a user. For example, past interaction with content can indicate a user's interest in particular content. In another example, user profiles for a user and/or friends of a user can provide preference settings or stored inferences of content that is of interest to a user. For example, parents can share or recommend content for children's viewing to their friends. -
Suggestion component 160 can determine content that is likely to be of interest to a user by examining logs storing user interaction with content, non-limiting examples or which include, searches, navigation of a content, viewing content, browsing content, rating content, like indication of content, dislike indication of content, and/or comments or annotations applied to content. It is to be appreciated that any criteria can be employed for determining which content may be of interest to a user. - Continuing with reference to
FIG. 2E , the user can narrow the parent approvedcontent list 272 by entering a search insearch area 220, results of which would appear in parent approvedcontent list 272. Additionally, “PARENT 1” can use addcontent selection element 257 and removecontent selection element 257 to configure the content included in “NEW” playlist (playlist input). For example, the parent can remove one or more content from the “NEW” playlist that was automatically added bysuggestion component 160 or add content that was not suggested bysuggestion component 160. The configured playlist can be stored bycontent selection component 140. - Referring to
FIG. 2F in a non-limiting example,user interface 205 is depicted where “PARENT 1” has navigated to a parent approved content editor using a suitable user interface navigation mechanism.Function title area 235 indicates the current functional area of the application as “PARENT APPROVED CONTENT EDITOR”.User interface 205 includes a parent approvedcontent list 280, similar to parent approvedcontent list 272 ofFIG. 2E , that shows content that is currently in the parent approvedcontent list 280. In this non-limiting example, “ELEPHANT VIDEO . . . CLOWN VIDEO” are currently in the parent approvedcontent list 280.User interface 205 also includes anavailable content area 282 that shows content that is available to be added to the parent approvedcontent list 280. In this example,available content area 282 shows “HIPPO VIDEO . . . SWORD FIGHTING VIDEO” visible to be added the parent approvedcontent list 280. It is to be appreciated that additional content may be available that is not currently visible in the available content list, but can be shown usingscrolling control element 256. “PARENT 1” can use addcontent selection element 257 and removecontent selection element 257 to configure the content included in the parent approved content list 280 (parent approved content input). The configured parent approvedcontent list 280 can be stored bycontent selection component 140. Furthermore,user interface 205 includes suggestselection element 284 for automatically generating a list of suggested content, for example, as depicted inFIG. 2G . - Referring to
FIG. 2G in a non-limiting example,user interface 205 is depicted where “PARENT 1” has selected suggestselection element 284 fromFIG. 2F to automatically generate a list of suggested content.Function title area 235 indicates the current functional area of the application as “PARENT APPROVED CONTENT EDITOR”.User interface 205 includes a parent approvedcontent list 280, that shows content that is currently in the parent approvedcontent list 280. In this non-limiting example, “ELEPHANT VIDEO . . . CLOWN VIDEO” are currently in the parent approvedcontent list 280.User interface 205 also includes a suggestedcontent list 286 that shows content bysuggestion component 160 that is available to be added to the parent approvedcontent list 280. In this example, suggestedcontent list 286 shows “HIPPO VIDEO . . . BASEBALL VIDEO” visible to be added the parent approvedcontent list 280. It is to be appreciated that additional content may be available that is not currently visible in the available content list, but can become visible usingscrolling control element 256. -
Suggestion component 160 can automatically add content to the suggestedcontent list 286 by employing artificial intelligence to analyze playlists, content, parent approved content list, logs of previous parent or child interaction with the client device, or other criteria. For example,suggestion component 160 can examine content that “PARENT 1” has added to other playlists identify similar available content to add to the suggestedcontent list 286 based upon an analysis of content in the other playlists or metadata associated with content in the other playlists. - In another example,
suggestion component 160 can examine content that a child has viewed whileclient device 110 is in child mode and identify similar available content to add to the suggestedcontent list 286 based upon an analysis of the content the child has viewed or metadata associated with the content the child has viewed. “PARENT 1” can use addcontent selection element 257 and removecontent selection element 257 to configure the content included in the parent approved content list 280 (parent approved content input). The configured parent approvedcontent list 280 can be stored bycontent selection component 140. In this example,suggestion component 160 is depicted adding content to a suggestedcontent list 286, and not directly to the parent approvedcontent list 280. Advantageously, this gives the parent complete control over the content that is in the parent approvedcontent list 280. However,suggestion component 160 can add suggested content directly to the parent approved content list 280 (parent approved content input), for example, based upon a preference set by a parent in a parent profile. - Referring back to
FIG. 1 ,mode control component 150 enables and disables a child mode onclient device 110 based upon a mode control input. In a non-limiting example, a specific gesture input can enable or disable child mode, such as touching four corners of a touchscreen interface. In another example, a biometric input can enable or disable child mode based upon recognition of biometric input from a specific user, such as a parent. However, any suitable mechanism for providing mode control input can be employed.Mode control component 150 can allow a parent to define the mode control input that enables or disables child mode, for example, such that their child will not be able perform the mode control input or so that the parent can adjust the mode control input if their child has learned the mode control input (mode control customization input). - In a non-limiting example, a parent can define or modify a touchscreen gesture or biometric input for enabling or disabling child mode. The mode control input is configured such that a child is unable to or it is difficult for the child to perform the mode control input, so they cannot disable the child mode when they are using
client device 110. In response to receiving mode control input specifying to enable child mode,mode control component 150 can enter child mode and present achild mode interface 305, such as depicted inFIGS. 3A-C and disable all user inputs on the device except a touchscreen interface, and optionally biometric interfaces, for example, if biometrics inputs are used for enabling and disabling child mode. Furthermore, biometric inputs can be filtered to only accept input from a parent. For example, if speech recognition is employed to enable to disable child mode, a microphone can remain enabled in child mode and can be configured to only accept input from a recognized parent, such that the child is limited to the touchscreen interface. In another example, all inputs to the device can be disabled except a touchscreen interface, such as, camera, microphone, physical buttons on the device, non-limiting examples of which include power button, volume control button, camera button, menu button, home button, search button, back button, keyboard, joystick, mouse stick, trackball, or any other physical button onclient device 110. In general,client device 110 in child mode is configured such that a child can only interact with the device through a touchscreen interface and the child can only navigate withinchild mode interface 305. - Referring to
FIG. 3A in a non-limiting example,client device 110 withchild mode interface 305 is depicted.Child mode interface 305 restricts the device to applications, content, or functions that are approved by the parent for the child. In this manner, a child will not be able to accidentally perform an operation on the device that is not approved by the parent, such as sending an e-mail to the parent's co-worker or getting theclient device 110 in a state where they cannot navigate to content that they would like to view. For example, physical input buttons, such as 310A, 310B, 310C, 310D, 310E, 310F, and 310G can be disabled. It is to be appreciated that a child cannot modify parent approved playlists or parent approved content lists in the child mode interface. Furthermore,child mode interface 305 is a simplified interface that limits navigation in a manner that is easy for a child to employ. For example, only background images can be displayed, or only text can be displayed, or a combination of background images and text can be display, such as name of playlist or content associated with the background image. It is to be appreciated that the child mode interface can employ any combination of visual and/or audio elements. In a non-limiting example,child mode interface 305 showsbackground images child mode interface 305 and displayed using suitable navigation controls. A child can navigate amongst thebackground images background image 320B to the center of the display, swiping up can bringbackground image 320H to the center of the display, swiping left can bringbackground image 320F to the center of the display, or swiping right can bringbackground image 320D to the center of the display, and likewise swiping in a diagonal direction can bring arespective background image - It is to be appreciated, that while this example presents
background images background image mode control component 150 can initiate playing or viewing of the playlist, for example, as depicted inFIGS. 3B and 3C . - Referring to
FIG. 3B in a non-limiting example,client device 110 withchild mode interface 305 is depicted where a child has selectedbackground image 320E. In this example, viewing of the content in the playlist is delayed, for example due to processing, downloading, buffering delay of the content. As such,mode control component 150 can present ananimation 325 inchild mode interface 305 to keep the child occupied until the content is ready to be viewed.Example animation 325 depicts a puzzle animation made frombackground image 320E, however, any animation can be employed. When the content is ready for viewing,mode control component 150 can begin playing of the content, for example, as depicted inFIG. 3C . It is to be understood that playing an animation can be optional. In one example, child mode interface does not play an animation when playing of content is delayed. In another example, child mode interface selectively plays an animation, such as, based upon a device or user preference setting. In a further example, child mode interface always plays an animation when playing of content is delayed. - Referring to
FIG. 3C in a non-limiting example,client device 110 withchild mode interface 305 is depicted where a child has selectedbackground image 320E.Mode control component 150 presentschild mode interface 305 playing content associated with the playlist associated withbackground image 320E. Optionally, playback controls appropriate for the content can be presented. In this example, slider control 330A is shown that allows for selection of point of playback of the video content depicted. In addition, rewind control 330B, stop control 330C, pause control 330D, play control 330E, fast forward control 330F are depicted. - Additional controls (not depicted) can also be included, non-limiting examples of which include skip to next content in playlist, skip to previous content in playlist, exit playlist, skip to next playlist, or skip to previous playlist. Furthermore,
mode control component 150 can limit navigation such that the child upon choosing to stop playing content or to exit a playlist is returned to a display of background images as depicted inFIG. 3A . Advantageously, this prevents the child from navigating from an application in which they were viewing parent approved content to an application, content, or function that is not approved by the parent. In a non-limiting example,child mode interface 305 can envelop any applications associated with content and limit the functionality of the application. For example, if a child is viewing a video,mode control component 150 can present achild mode interface 305 that envelops the video application and limit the functions of the video application to prevent navigating outside of the child mode interface. -

Thus, embodiments herein are contemplated from the standpoint of an API (or other software object), as well as from a software or hardware object that implements one or more aspects described herein. Thus, various embodiments described herein can have aspects that are wholly in hardware, partly in hardware and partly in software, as well as in software.
- The word “exemplary” is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. For the avoidance of doubt, the aspects disclosed herein are not limited by such examples. In addition, any aspect or design described herein as “exemplary” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs, nor is it meant to preclude equivalent exemplary structures and techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms “includes,” “has,” “contains,” and other similar words are used in either the detailed description or the claims, for the avoidance of doubt, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term “comprising” as an open transition word without precluding any additional or other elements.
- Computing devices typically include a variety of media, which can include computer-readable storage media and/or communications media, in which these two terms are used herein differently from one another as follows. Computer-readable storage media can be any available storage media that can be accessed by the computer, is typically of a non-transitory nature, and can include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable storage media can be implemented in connection with any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, program modules, structured data, or unstructured data. Computer-readable storage media can include, but are not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disk (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or other tangible and/or non-transitory media which can be used to store desired information. Computer-readable storage media can be accessed by one or more local or remote computing devices, e.g., via access requests, queries or other data retrieval protocols, for a variety of operations with respect to the information stored by the medium.
- On the other hand, communications media typically embody computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other structured or unstructured data in a data signal such as a modulated data signal, e.g., a carrier wave or other transport mechanism, and includes any information delivery or transport media. The term “modulated data signal” or signals refers to a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in one or more signals. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media include wired media, such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media.
- As mentioned, the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a combination of both. As used herein, the terms “component,” “system” and the like are likewise intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on computer and the computer can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. Further, a “device” can come in the form of specially designed hardware; generalized hardware made specialized by the execution of software thereon that enables the hardware to perform specific function (e.g., coding and/or decoding); software stored on a computer readable medium; or a combination thereof.
- The aforementioned systems have been described with respect to interaction between several components. It can be appreciated that such systems and components can include those components or specified sub-components, some of the specified components or sub-components, and/or additional components, and according to various permutations and combinations of the foregoing. Sub-components can also be implemented as components communicatively coupled to other components rather than included within parent components (hierarchical). Additionally, it is to be noted that one or more components may be combined into a single component providing aggregate functionality or divided into several separate sub-components, and that any one or more middle layers, such as a management layer, may be provided to communicatively couple to such sub-components in order to provide integrated functionality. Any components described herein may also interact with one or more other components not specifically described herein but generally known by those of skill in the art.
- In order to provide for or aid in the numerous inferences described herein (e.g. inferring relationships between metadata or inferring topics of interest to users), components described herein can examine the entirety or a subset of the data to which it is granted access and can provide for reasoning about or infer states of the system, environment, etc. from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic—that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data.
- Such inference can result in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. Various classification (explicitly and/or implicitly trained) schemes and/or systems (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, etc.) can be employed in connection with performing automatic and/or inferred action in connection with the claimed subject matter.
- A classifier can map an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, as by f(x)=confidence(class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.
- In view of the exemplary systems described above, methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the described subject matter will be better appreciated with reference to the flowcharts of the various figures. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Where non-sequential, or branched, flow is illustrated via flowchart, it can be appreciated that various other branches, flow paths, and orders of the blocks, may be implemented which achieve the same or a similar result. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methodologies described hereinafter.
- In addition to the various embodiments described herein, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments can be used or modifications and additions can be made to the described embodiment(s) for performing the same or equivalent function of the corresponding embodiment(s) without deviating there from. Still further, multiple processing chips or multiple devices can share the performance of one or more functions described herein, and similarly, storage can be effected across a plurality of devices. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited to any single embodiment, but rather can be construed in breadth, spirit and scope in accordance with the appended claims.
