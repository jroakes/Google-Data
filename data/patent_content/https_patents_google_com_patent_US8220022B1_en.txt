- the client 110 executes a web browser 112 .
- the video hosting website 130 comprises a visual video browsing server 132 , a video server 134 , a user information database 136 and a video database 138 .
- Many conventional features, such as firewalls, load balancers, application servers, failover servers, site management tools, and so forth are not shown so as to more clearly illustrate the features of the system.
- the client 110 communicates with the video hosting website 130 via the computer network 120 .
- the client 110 can be a personal computer (PC) in one embodiment, or a mobile handset or other electronic computing devices in other embodiments. While only a single client 110 and web browser 112 are shown, it is understood that very large numbers (e.g., thousands or more) of clients are supported and can be in communication with the website 130 at any time.
- the browser 112 uses a third party video player (e.g., the FlashTM player from Adobe Systems, Inc.), or any other player adapted for the video file formats used on the site 130 .
- a user accesses a video from the site 130 by browsing a catalog of videos, conducting searches on keywords, reviewing playlists from other users or the system administrator (e.g., collections of videos forming channels), or viewing videos associated with particular user groups (e.g., communities).
- browser 112 also accesses a video file indirectly, via an embedded video that is accessed via an embedded hyperlink in a third party website.
- Users of the client 110 and browser 112 can upload content (which can include, for example, video, audio, or still images, or a combination of video and audio and still images) to the site 130 and browse media content stored at the site 130 via the network 120 .
- the uploaded content is processed and placed for storage in the video database 138 .
- This processing can include format conversion, compression, metadata tagging, and other data processing.
- an uploaded content file is associated with the uploading user, and so the user's account record is updated in the user information database 136 as needed.
- other data relating to the user is also placed for storage in database 136 . For example, in one embodiment, a list of videos that have been viewed by the user over the last ten days is associated with a user ID and is kept in the user information database 136 .
- the network 120 enables communications among the client 110 and the video hosting website 130 .

- W-CDMA Wideband Code Division Multiple Access
- CDMA200 Code Division Multiple Access 2000
- GSM Global System for Mobile Communications
- GPRS General Packet Radio Service
- the networking protocols used on the network 120 can include multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), the file transfer protocol (FTP), etc.
- MPLS multiprotocol label switching
- TCP/IP transmission control protocol/Internet protocol
- UDP User Datagram Protocol
- HTTP hypertext transport protocol
- HTTP simple mail transfer protocol
- FTP file transfer protocol
- the data exchanged over the network 120 can be represented using technologies and/or formats including the hypertext markup language (HTML), the extensible markup language (XML), etc.
- all or some of links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as the secure sockets layer (SSL), Secure HTTP and/or virtual private networks (VPNs) or Internet Protocol security (IPsec).
- the entities can use custom and/or dedicated data communications technologies instead of, or in addition to, the ones described above.
- the media content uploaded and browsed by a user will be referred to a “videos” or “video files”, but no limitation on the types of media content that can be uploaded and browsed are intended by this terminology.
- the video hosting website 130 allows users to upload videos to the website 130 and browse the videos stored in the website 130 .
- a suitable website 130 for implementation of the system is the YOUTUBETM website, found at www.youtube.com; other video hosting sites are known as well, and can be adapted to operate according the teaching disclosed herein.
- the various servers are conventionally implemented, whether as a single piece of software or hardware or as multiple pieces of software or hardware. In general, functions described in one embodiment as being performed on the server side can also be performed on the client side in other embodiments if appropriate.
- the visual video browsing server 132 provides an intuitive way for users to quickly visualize and browse of videos of interest.
- the visual video browsing server 132 monitors user interface events, generates video recommendations and visually displays the recommendations to users via a display.
- the visual video browsing server 132 displays the recommended videos in orbit around a central video, i.e., the current focus of interest, with the video most recommended for the central video being the closest in the display.
- the visual video browsing server 132 regenerates the recommendations around the new focus of interest, and visually displays the newly generated recommendations in the display 218 .
- the initial recommendations are kept on the screen so that user can easily and quickly scroll back to them.
- video browsing becomes “live” such that a user can not only visually see a single browsing process of a group of recommendations, but also visualize multiple video browsing processes in the same display area. Further detail on visually displaying the video recommendations is presented in connection with the discussion of FIG. 5 .
- FIG. 2 is a high-level block diagram of a computer 200 for acting as a client 110 , a visual video browsing server 132 , a video server 134 and managers of user information database 136 and video database 138 according to one embodiment. Illustrated are at least one processor 202 coupled to a bus 204 . Also coupled to the bus 204 are a memory 206 , a storage device 208 , a keyboard 210 , a graphics adapter 212 , a pointing device 214 , and a network adapter 216 . In one embodiment, the functionality of the bus 204 is provided by an interconnecting chipset. A display 218 is coupled to the graphics adapter 212 .
- the storage device 208 is any device capable of holding data, like a hard drive, compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), DVD, or a solid-state memory device.
- the memory 206 holds instructions and data used by the processor 202 .
- the pointing device 214 may be a mouse, track ball, or other type of pointing device, and is used in combination with the keyboard 210 to input data into the computer 200 .
- the graphics adapter 212 displays images and other information on the display 218 .
- the network adapter 216 couples the computer 200 to a local or wide area network.
- a computer 200 can have different and/or other components than those shown in FIG. 2 .
- the computer 200 can lack certain illustrated components.
- a computer 200 acting as a server 116 can lack a keyboard 210 , pointing device 214 , graphics adapter 212 , and/or display 218 .
- the storage device 208 can be local and/or remote from the computer 200 (such as embodied within a storage area network (SAN)).
- SAN storage area network
- the exemplary interface includes a video recommendation browsing/display window 500 , a group of video recommendations including a central video 510 , directional display controls 530 and a type of service indication 520 (in this case, it is a video browsing service).
- the video recommendation browsing window 500 is already, in the illustrated case, displaying a group of videos recommended by a recommendation engine. The relative correlation among the recommended videos is also visually displayed.
- each recommended video is represented by a video icon.
- the video icon is a thumbnail image of a key frame to give an overview of the visual content in the recommended video.
- a relatively large video icon of the current central video 510 is displayed in the center of the display window 500 .
- Six more smaller video icons, 512 A- 512 F, each of which represents a recommended video 512 related to the central video 510 are displayed surrounding the central video 510 at its respective distance from the central video 510 .
- the recommended videos 512 related to the central video 510 will be referred to below as an “orbiting videos” of the central video 510 .
- each orbiting video 512 of the central video 510 its displayed distance from the central video 510 represents a probability of being watched next given the current central video 510 being watched further influenced by its correlation to other orbiting videos 512 .
- the orbiting video 512 A which is closest in distance to the central video 510 , is most likely to be watched next by this user among other orbiting videos 512 based on factors discussed further below.
- the relativeness of each orbiting video 512 to the central video 510 is visually displayed in terms of its physical distance from the central video 510 in the display window 500 .
- the relative correlation between each orbiting video 512 is also visually displayed in terms of the relative distance towards each other.
- Each orbiting video 512 has a probability of being watched next given the central video 510 being watched. Such conditional probability associated with each orbiting video 512 is calculated by the recommendation engine 320 of the visual video browsing server 132 . Further detail on generating video recommendations is presented in connection with the discussion of FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating modules within a visual video browsing server 132 according to one embodiment.
- the visual video browsing server 132 includes a visual presentation event manager 310 , a recommendation engine 320 and a recommendation repository 330 .
- Other embodiments can have different and/or additional modules than the ones shown in the figure.
- the functions can be distributed among the modules in a different manner than is described here.
- the visual presentation event manager 310 is configured to monitor visual presentation events.
- One group of the visual presentation events is related to user interface events, such as mouse movements, keyboard inputs, user selections and updates to the display 218 .
- Another group of the visual presentation events is generated by the recommendation engine 320 .
- the event manager 310 is also configured to instruct the recommendation engine 320 to calculate recommendations based on user interface events, receive the recommendations from the recommendation engine 320 , and visually present the recommendations to the user.
- the recommendation engine 320 generates recommendations at a speed in relation to the video frame rate of currently selected central video. For example, the frame rate of the currently selected central video is 15 frames per second.
- the recommendation engine 320 in one embodiment, generates recommendations every 5 minutes.
- the recommendation engine 320 may generates recommendations every 2 minutes. In another embodiment, the recommendation engine 320 generates recommendations upon the instructions from the visual presentation manager 310 . For each group of recommendations generated, the recommendation engine 320 notifies the visual presentation manager 310 and stores the recommendations in the recommendation repository 330 .
- Videos in a video repository such as the video database 138 in the website 130 can be related by the recommendation engine 320 in various ways.
- the recommendation engine 320 may relate various videos based on video content and/or a user's specific interests or past behavior.
- the recommendation engine 320 relates videos using a weighted covisitation measure, and generates a recommendation score for each orbiting video around a central video based on the weighted covisitation measure.
- the recommendation score of an orbiting video represents a conditional probability of being watched next given the central video being watched.
- covisitation in the context of this description refers to an event in which a video watched by a viewer is also watched by other viewers. For example, in a covisitation for A and B, a user watches video A, and then video B. The number of covisitations of videos A and B is then 1, since they are watched by just one user.
- the recommendation score of video B being watched next given video A being watched is equal to the ratio of number of covisitation of both videos A and B to the number of covisitation of video A, which is 1 in this example.
- the recommendation engine 320 calculates the recommendation score of video B using the equation (1) below:
- score ⁇ ( video B ) num_co ⁇ ( video A ⁇ video B ) num_co ⁇ ( video A ) ( 1 )
- score(video B ) is the recommendation score of video B
- num_co(video A ⁇ video B ) represents the number of covisitation of both videos A and B
- num_co(video A ) is the number of covisitation of video A.
- the recommendation engine 320 weights the number of covisitations of video A by a scaling factor. For example, 1000 viewers watch video A, then B. Thus, the number of covisitations of both videos A and B is 1000, but the number of covisitation of video A, i.e., 1000, is weighted by a scaling factor of 0.6.
- the scaled recommendation score for video B is above 15, which is much larger than 1 without scaling.
- the recommendation engine 320 calculates the scaled recommendation score described above using equation (2) below:
- the recommendation engine 320 may also generate recommendation scores based on other factors, such as the length of the video actually watched, length of the video being recommended, and difference in reviewing time between the central video and its orbiting video being measured, etc. For example, a video being recommended is 1 minute long, and a user actually watches 50%, i.e., 30 seconds, of the video at time t 2 , while the user watches the central video at t 1 .
- the recommendation engine 320 in one embodiment, may take above factors into consideration when calculating recommendations.
- the orbiting videos 512 displayed in the display window 500 are not only related to the central video 510 , but also correlated with each other. Such relative correlation is displayed by the relative distance towards each other in the display window 500 .
- Each orbiting video 512 possesses two types of force, i.e., a pulling force and a repelling force, towards another orbiting video 512 . These two types of force of an orbiting video 512 together determine its relative position in the display window 500 towards other orbiting videos 512 .
- the pulling force between two orbiting videos 512 pulls the orbiting videos 512 towards each other.
- the strength of that pulling force is proportional to the recommendation scores of the orbiting videos 512 given the central video 510 .
- the recommendation engine 320 calculates the pulling force of the orbiting videos 512 based on their recommendation scores.
- Each orbiting video 512 of a group of recommended videos also has a repelling force towards other orbiting videos 512 in the group.
- the repelling force pushes the orbiting video 512 away from other orbiting videos 512 .
- the repelling force drops off with the square of distance between two orbiting videos 512 .
- the recommendation engine 320 weights such pulling force and repelling force among them to calculate the relative correlation among the orbiting videos 512 .
- the visual presentation event manager 310 receives a group of recommended videos including a central video 510 and its orbiting videos 512 .
- Each of the orbiting video 512 has its recommendation score and its relative distance towards the central video 510 and towards other orbiting videos determined by the recommendation engine 320 .
- the event manager 310 displays the group of recommendations with the central video 510 centered in the display window 500 and its orbiting videos 512 orbiting at their respective distances from the central video 510 and from each other.
- the event manager 310 uses a script language, such as Javascript, to generate the updated display window 500 with the recommendations.
- the visual presentation event manager 310 is activated upon a user launching his/her web browser 112 .
- the event manager 310 generates a page that visually displays a default group of video recommendations that move in accordance with the factors described above.
- the initial central video of the default group of recommendations can be chosen from various resources.
- the visual presentation manager 310 consults the user information database 136 , and chooses the central video from a list of the most recently reviewed videos by the user, or from a favorite list of videos of the user. In other embodiments, the visual presentation manager 310 chooses the most popular video among the videos in the video database 138 as the central video, or chooses the central video from an arbitrary list.
- the visual presentation manager 310 then instructs the recommendation engine 320 to generate the recommendations centered on the chosen initial central video, stores the recommendations in the recommendation repository 330 , and notifies the visual presentation manager 310 .
- the visual presentation manager 310 visually displays recommendations.
- a user can change a currently selected central video to a new central video by mousing over one of the orbiting videos currently displayed in the browsing window 500 .
- the visual presentation event manager 310 instructs the recommendation engine 320 to recalculate a group of video recommendations around the new central video over which the mouse is currently pointing.
- the visual presentation event manager 310 displays the newly generated group of video recommendations in the same browsing window 500 that currently displays the previous group of video recommendations.
- the video thumbnails move on the display so that the new central video is in the position occupied by video 510 in the display and they are new orbiting videos around the new central video.
- the old orbiting videos with their central video are displayed next to the new central video and corresponding orbiting videos towards one horizontal side of the display.
- the new central video and corresponding orbiting videos move to the display from the various sides of the display screen and gradually settles in their perspective distances determined by the recommendation engine.
- the new video recommendations get displayed right their perspective distances by the presentation event manager 310 .
- the recommendation engine 320 calculates a recommendation score for each recommended video of the new group with the newly selected central video.
- the recommendation engine 320 further calculates the relative distance in display among the videos of the new group of recommendations and the ones of the previous groups. Taking two groups of recommendations as an example, in one embodiment, the recommendation engine 320 calculates a recommendation score for each orbiting video of the newly selected central video using equation (2) described above. Based on the recommendation scores, the recommendation engine 320 evaluates the pulling and repelling force between orbiting videos 512 to determine their relative distance from the newly selected central video and from each other.
- one or more orbiting videos of the newly selected central video is/are the same video(s) as the ones in the previous group of recommendations. That indicates that the same video(s) is/are recommended by multiple recommendations.
- the recommendation score calculation for a multiple-recommended video includes the covisitation data from both central videos and the video itself. For example, if two different orbiting videos are “pulling” on the same video, the orbiting video with higher recommendation score “pulls” the video with larger pulling force. This indicates that the video being pulled has a closer correlation with the orbiting video having larger pulling force than the other pulling orbit video. As a result, the video being pulled is to be displayed closer to the orbiting video with larger pulling force and moves from its current location to its new location.
- a similar procedure is applicable to larger number of groups of recommendations. The recommendations no longer recommended go off the display screen if the total number of recommendations exceeds the limit threshold for the display.
- the default maximum number of videos for each group of recommendations is set to 10, and a total number of videos that can be displayed together in a display is 30.
- the visual presentation event manager 310 In response to reaching the total number of videos limit, the visual presentation event manager 310 automatically discards the videos with the lower recommendations scores from the earliest displayed group of recommendations while keeping the videos from a later group of recommendations in display.
- the visual presentation event manager 310 keeps a global order of recommendation scores of videos currently being displayed. In response to reaching the total number of videos limit, the visual presentation event manager 310 automatically discards videos with lower recommendation scores starting with the lowest one among all recommendation scores.
