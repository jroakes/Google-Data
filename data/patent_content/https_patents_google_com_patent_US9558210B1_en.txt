- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which a quality measure of a location may be determined.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating an example method of determining a quality measure of a location.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating another example method of determining a quality measure of a location.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a block diagram of an example computer system.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a quality measure of a location may be determined.
- the example environment 100 includes a communication network 101 that facilitates communication between the various components in the environment.
- the communication network 101 may include the Internet, one or more intranets, and/or one or more bus subsystems.
- the communication network 101 may optionally utilize one or more standard communications technologies, protocols, and/or inter-process communication techniques.
- the example environment also includes a search engine 110 , a quality measure engine 120 , a content database 130 , a computing device 140 , and a ranking engine 150 .
- the quality measure engine 120 may determine a quality measure of a given location based on a time investment one or more users are willing to make to visit the given location. As discussed herein, in some implementations the quality measure of a given location may optionally be based on additional factors such as reviews from one or more users about the given location, and/or pure popularity signals of the given location. In some implementations, determination of a quality measure of a given location based at least in part on a time investment one or more users are willing to make to visit the given location minimizes biases related to certain quality measures based solely on pure popularity signals and/or user reviews. For example, many locations receive visitors proportional to their number of seats and crowds adjust behavior based on availability. Thus, a pure popularity signal may not entirely capture the quality of such a location. Also, for example, a higher-end restaurant may attract much less traffic than a fast food restaurant, and a pure popularity signal may not capture the desirability of such a location.
- the quality measure engine 120 and/or the search engine 110 may identify a given location and location data for the given location.
- the given location may be a physical location such as a restaurant, a school, a hospital, a theater, a department store, or a laundry service.

- the location data may be identified via one or more databases such as content database 130 .
- the database may include a listing of service entities and location data for those service entities.
- the quality measure engine 120 and/or the search engine 110 may identify an Italian restaurant in downtown Chicago and identify its physical address via a location database.

- Each anticipated distance value is indicative of the anticipated travel time that one or more users would be expected to invest to reach the given location.
- an anticipated distance value may be based on the time taken and/or distance traveled by an identified group of users to reach locations that share one or more characteristics with the given location.
- the anticipated distance value may be the average time or the average distance traveled by an identified group of users in indicating travel to similar locations within a geographic area of the given location.
- the anticipated distance value may be the mean time or the mean distance traveled by an identified group of users in traveling to similar locations within a geographic area of the given location.
- outliers may optionally be omitted in determining an anticipated value.
- the identified group of users may be, for example, all users whose initial location was within a certain geographic distance of the given location.
- the users may be all users indicating travel to similar locations, wherein the users' initial locations were within 100 miles of the given location, within the same city as the given location, within the same state of the given location, and/or within the same country as the given location.
- an anticipated distance value may provide an indication of the anticipated number of individuals that would travel an anticipated time range to reach the given location.
- the anticipated distance value may provide an indication of the percentage of users that would travel more than the statistical mean traveled by an identified group of users in traveling to similar locations within a geographic area of the given location.
- the statistical mean for an identified group of users in traveling to similar locations within a geographic area of the given location may be identified as five miles, it may be determined that 40% of the users traveled more than five miles, and 40% may be identified as the anticipated distance value.
- the anticipated distance value may provide an indication of the percentage of users indicating traveling more than 110% over the statistical mean traveled by an identified group of users in traveling to similar locations within a geographic area of the given location.
- each anticipated distance value may provide an indication of the anticipated number of individuals that would travel an anticipated time range to reach the given location.
- a first anticipated distance value may provide an indication of the anticipated number and/or percentage of users that would travel 0-1 minutes to reach a given location
- a second anticipated distance value may provide an indication of the anticipated number and/or percentage of users that would travel 1-2 minutes to reach a given location, etc.
- a first anticipated distance value may provide an indication of the anticipated number and/or percentage of users that would travel less than 90% of a statistical mean traveled by an identified group of users in traveling to similar locations within a geographic area of the given location;
- a second anticipated distance value may provide an indication of the anticipated number and/or percentage of users that would travel within 90% and 110% of the statistical mean;
- a third anticipated distance value may provide an indication of the anticipated number and/or percentage of users that would travel more than 110% of the statistical mean.
- an anticipated distance value for an Italian restaurant in downtown Chicago may be identified based on indicated travel times of users in traveling to other restaurants in the same neighborhood as the Italian restaurant.
- the anticipated distance value for the Italian restaurant may be based on average indicated travel times of users to other Italian restaurants that are in the same zip code as the Italian restaurant.
- the anticipated distance value for the Italian restaurant may be based on average indicated travel time of users to other restaurants that are in a similar price range as the Italian Restaurant and are within a two mile radius of the Italian restaurant.
- the anticipated distance value may be identified via one or more database such as content database 130 .
- the anticipated distance value for a given location may be identified based on actual location data of one or more users who have visited and/or indicated a likelihood of visiting a given location, such as all such users, users in a geographic region, and/or users with certain user characteristics. For example, in some implementations the anticipated distance value for a given location may be based on indicated travel times for a group of navigational queries in which the destination is a similar type of location within a certain distance of the given location.
- the anticipated distance value may be represented as one or more distributions. Such distributions may be continuous and/or discrete. Additionally, and/or alternatively, in some implementations, one or more distribution may be represented using discrete values. In the example described earlier, the first, second, and third anticipated distance values may, in some implementations, be discrete values representing a continuous distribution.
- an anticipated distance value for a location may additionally and/or alternatively be based on one or more characteristics of a region of the location, the users of the location, and/or the location itself.
- the anticipated distance value of the identified location may be based on characteristics of a region associated with an identified location. For example, the anticipated distance value to a place serving breakfast in rural Utah may be much longer than the anticipated distance value to a breakfast place in Berkeley due to greater population density in Berkeley. Also, for example, the anticipated distance value for a breakfast place in Washington D.C. may take into account multiple transportation options (walking, car, bike, public transportation) whereas the anticipated distance value for a remote breakfast place may only take into account a single transportation option.
- the anticipated distance value to a location may be based on a number of competing locations that are geographically proximal to the location.
- an anticipated distance value for a fine dining establishment in Washington D.C. may be based on the number of fine dining establishments that are within a given distance of the fine dining establishment (e.g., two miles, same neighborhood, same zip code).
- the region characteristic may include one or more of the density of population in the region, the network of roads, network of sidewalks, network of public transportation options, traffic patterns, population density, the types and/or distribution of one or more locations, the types and distribution of members of the population, population demographic data, public transportation data, and income data for members of the population.
- One or more aspects of such geographic region characteristic may optionally be utilized in identifying an anticipated distance value. Additional and/or alternative geographic region characteristics may be provided.
- a geographic region may include a zip code, a county, a business district, a city, a township, a municipal area, a state, and/or a country.
- the geographic region may include one or more of the eastern, southern, Midwestern, southwestern, central, and/or pacific regions of the United States.
- other designations such as “small town”, “medium-sized town”, “small city”, and “large city” may be used.
- the quality measure engine 120 may identify region characteristics from one or more sources such as mapping services, online web pages, tourist guides, government publications, census data, published brochures, weather data services, and news agencies.
- the geographic region and/or geographic region characteristics may be identified via a database such as content database 130 .
- an anticipated distance value for an identified location may additionally and/or alternatively be based on one or more location characteristics of the identified location. For example, an anticipated distance value to a restaurant in Greenwich Village in New York may be much less than the anticipated distance value to a drive-through fast food restaurant in rural New York, based at least in part on the greater likelihood of individuals driving to the fast food restaurant (e.g., due to the drive-through, more parking spots). Also, for example, an anticipated distance value for a fine dining establishment may be greater than the anticipated distance value for a fast food restaurant due to a lower density of fine dining establishments relative to fast food restaurants.
- an anticipated distance value of an identified location may additionally and/or alternatively be based on user characteristics of users that have visited to the identified location. For example, for a given restaurant in downtown Chicago, the anticipated distance value may take into account modes of transportation of visitors to the location. For example, if 50% of visitors are identified as walkers and 50% of visitors are identified as public transportation users, then the anticipated distance value may take into account differences in distance and/or time between the walkers and the public transportation users. For example, the anticipated distance value may be based on an average of walking and public transportation anticipated distance values. Also, for example, in some implementations different anticipated distance values may be defined for different groups based on the mode of transportation associated with the group such as walking, biking, car, and/or public transportation.
- a first anticipated distance value may be identified for walkers and a second anticipated value may be identified for bus riders.
- the anticipated distance value may be determined by the quality measure engine 120 based on data from the content database 130 . Additional and/or alternative methods of determining anticipated distance values may be utilized.
- the quality measure engine 120 may also identify at least one actual distance value for a given location for each of one or more members in a population. Each actual distance value for a given location is indicative of actual time for the respective member to reach the given location.
- the search engine 110 may identify residents of Chicago that have indicated a visit to the Italian restaurant in downtown Chicago and determine the anticipated and/or actual time taken for each such resident to reach the restaurant.
- an actual distance value for one or more residents may be based on time and/or distance from an initial user location to the restaurant.
- an actual distance value for one or more residents may be based on time and/or distance from the restaurant to a final user location.
- an actual distance value for one or more residents may be based on an average of time and/or distance from an initial location to the restaurant and from the restaurant to a final user location.
- the actual distance value may be represented as one or more distributions. Such distributions may be continuous and/or discrete. Additionally, and/or alternatively, in some implementations, one or more distributions may be represented using discrete values.
- the anticipated distance value and/or the actual distance value may be determined by the quality measure engine 120 .
- the quality measure engine 120 may identify the anticipated distance value and/or the actual distance value from a database such as content database 130 .
- search engine 110 may identify one or more of the anticipated distance values and actual distance values for one or more locations and provide the values to content database 130 .
- anticipated distance values and/or actual distance values for a given location may be based on one or more distances and/or times determined via a mapping system.
- an actual distance value for a given location may be based on a navigational query of one or more users of a mapping service seeking directions to the given location.
- the actual distance value may be based on an average travel distance of a plurality of navigational queries of a mapping service seeking directions to the given location.
- an anticipated distance value for a given location may be based on a plurality of navigational queries of a mapping service seeking directions to other locations that are geographically proximal to the given location.
- the anticipated distance value may be based on a mean of the distance of a plurality of navigational queries of a mapping service seeking directions to similar locations within one mile of the given location.
- one or more of the anticipated distance value and/or the actual distance values may be compared by the search engine 110 and/or quality measure engine 120 and stored in the content database 130 .
- the term “database” will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data.
- the data of the database does not need to be structured in any particular way, or structured at all, and it can be stored on storage devices in one or more locations.
- the content database 130 may include multiple collections of data, each of which may be organized and accessed differently.
- the quality measure engine 120 determines a quality measure for the given location based on a comparison of the anticipated distance value and the identified actual distance value.
- the quality measure may be based on subtracting the anticipated distance value from the actual distance value. For example, if the actual distance value for a given location is equal to or within a certain range of the anticipated distance value, then it may be determined that users are traveling an expected distance to visit and an average quality measure may be associated with the given location. Also, for example, if the actual distance value for a given location is greater than the anticipated distance value and outside of the certain range of the anticipated distance value, then it may be determined that users are going out of their way to visit and a quality measure indicative of high quality may be associated with the given location.
- the actual distance value for a given location is less than the anticipated distance value and outside of the certain range of the anticipated distance value, then it may be determined that users are not going even the average distance to visit and a quality measure indicative of low quality may be associated with the given location.
- the certain range may be based on a number of factors including, for example, the statistical variance from any determined anticipated distance value.
- a determined anticipated distance value may be a statistical mean that is one mile, and may be associated with one standard deviation that includes distance values between 0.8 miles and 1.2 miles, and the range may include values between 0.8 miles and 1.2 miles.
- the system may compute a weighted difference of the actual distance value and the anticipated distance value. Other relevant comparisons may also be used.
- the quality measure engine 120 may identify at least one anticipated distance value X.
- the actual distance value and/or the anticipated distance value may additionally and/or alternatively be based on distance. For example, the actual distance value may be two miles or may be based on a combination of the distance and the time.
- the quality measure engine 120 may identify actual visits by n users to the Italian restaurant, and identify actual distance values Y 1 , Y 2 , . . . , Y n for each of the n users visiting the Italian restaurant.
- the quality measure engine 120 may identify the average Y of the actual distance values Y 1 , Y 2 , . . . , Y n . The quality measure engine 120 may then determine the quality measure based on comparison of the average Y and X (e.g., Y ⁇ X, wherein a greater score is more indicative of quality). In some implementations the quality measure engine 120 may identify the mean Y of the actual distance values Y 1 , Y 2 , . . . , Y n . The quality measure engine 120 may then determine the quality measure based on comparison of the mean Y and X (e.g., Y ⁇ X, wherein a greater score is more indicative of quality). Any average, mean, and/or other statistical calculation may optionally remove outliers.
- the quality measure engine 120 may determine the quality measure based on an average of the differences Y 1 ⁇ X, Y 2 ⁇ X, . . . , Y n ⁇ X. For example, in some implementations, the quality measure engine 120 may identify a distribution for the differences Y 1 ⁇ X, Y 2 ⁇ X, . . . , Y n ⁇ X and use the distribution to determine a quality measure.
- the quality measure engine 120 may identify one or more ranges and identify how many of the differences Y 1 ⁇ X, Y 2 ⁇ X, . . . , Y n ⁇ X fall within each range. The quality measure engine 120 may use this data to determine a quality measure. For example, the quality measure engine 120 may determine how many of the differences Y 1 ⁇ X, Y 2 ⁇ X, . . . , Y n ⁇ X indicate an investment value that satisfies a threshold. For example, it may be determined how many of the differences indicate an investment value that is 20% greater than an anticipated distance value, at least 10 minutes more than an anticipated distance value, and/or is at least 2 miles more than an anticipated distance value.
- the quality measure may be based on a number and/or percentage of the difference that satisfy the threshold. For example, if 50% of the differences for restaurant A satisfy the threshold it may be indicative of a higher quality measure than if only 10% of the differences satisfied the threshold.
- the threshold may be based on a geographic region characteristic of a given location. For example, in a rural area a threshold of 10 miles may be considered appropriate whereas in Manhattan a threshold of 5 miles may be considered appropriate.
- the ranges for the Italian restaurant in downtown Chicago may be identified as ( ⁇ 10) minutes to ( ⁇ 1) minutes, ( ⁇ 1) minute to 1 minute, 1 to 10 minutes, and 10 minutes or more.
- the quality measure engine 120 may identify that, 30% of the users were within the ( ⁇ 10) to ( ⁇ 1) minutes range, 5% of the users were within the ( ⁇ 1) minute to 1 minute range, 35% of the users were within the 1 to 10 minutes range, while the remaining 30% of the users were in the 10 minutes or more range.
- the ranges may be based on a geographic region characteristic of a given location.
- quality measure may be based on the percentage of users determined to have traveled greater than 1 minute over the Y value to have reached the given location. For example, assuming a quality weighting of 0 to 1, the quality may be identified as 1*(percentage of the users were determined to have traveled greater than 1 minute over the Y value), which would equal 0.65 in the above example.
- the quality may be identified as [( ⁇ 0.5*percentage of users within the ( ⁇ 10) to ( ⁇ 1) minutes range)+(0.6*percentage of users within the ( ⁇ 1) to 1 minutes range)+(0.85*percentage of users within the 1 to 10 minutes range)+(1*percentage of users in the 10 minutes or over range), which would equal 0.775 in the above example. Additional and/or alternative determinations of quality measure may be made based on distributions.
- the quality measure engine 120 may determine the quality measure based on comparison of a plurality of anticipated distance values for a given location and a plurality of actual distance values for the given location. For example, in some implementations the quality measure engine 120 may identify multiple anticipated distance values for a given location, with each indicating an anticipated percentage of users that have anticipated travel times within a certain range. For example, anticipated distance values X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X n may be identified for ranges R 1 , R 2 , . . . , R n .
- Y 1 may be identified as 40% for an R 1 of 0 minutes to 1 minutes; Y 2 may be identified as 5% for an R 2 of 1 minute to 4 minutes; Y 3 may be identified as 5% for an R 3 of 4 minutes to 6 minutes; and Y 4 may be identified as 50% for an R 4 of 4 minutes to 6 minutes; etc.
- One or more of the actual distance values may be compared to one or more of the anticipated distance values to determine a quality measure.
- Y 4 may be compared to X 4 to determine a quality measure. For example, it may be determined that Y 4 is at least a threshold greater than X 4 and a quality measure indicative of quality should therefore be assigned with the given location.
- each of X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X n may be compared to each of Y 1 , Y 2 , . . . , Y n to determine a quality measure. Additional and/or alternative comparisons may be made.
- the given location may be an upscale restaurant in downtown Chicago, and an analysis of the difference Y 1 ⁇ X 1 may indicate that the difference may be a result of the restaurant sharing the same building with an office with highly paid employees. Likewise, an analysis of the difference Y 4 ⁇ X 4 may indicate that the restaurant is also popular among employees from another office building a couple of blocks away.
- the quality measure engine 120 may determine the quality measure based on comparison of a plurality of anticipated distance values for a given location and a plurality of actual distance values for the given location, where one or more anticipated/actual distance values in the plurality of anticipated/actual distance values may be a distribution.
- X and Y may be continuous distributions.
- the quality measure engine 120 optionally adjusts the quality measure, determines additional characteristics about a location, and/or associates a determined quality measure with one or more users based on one or more user characteristics. For example, in some implementations quality measure engine 120 may determine one or more characteristics of a given location based on a distribution of differences between anticipated distance values and actual distance values. For example, if one or more distribution grouping contains a substantial number of users having a common characteristic it may provide an indication that the common characteristic is indicative of user's who place quality in the location. For example, if 90% of the users in the over 10 minutes range are in an age range of 25-35, but do not make up a disproportionate amount of the other ranges, it may indicate that 25-35 year olds associate this restaurant with high quality.
- the quality measure engine 120 may associate an adjusted quality measure with one or more users based on one or more user characteristics. For example, if 90% of the users in the over 10 minutes range are in an age range of 25-35, but do not make up a disproportionate amount of the other ranges, it may associate a higher quality measure with the given location for those users who are in an age range of 25-35 than it would for those users who are not in that age range.
- one or more actual distance values may be weighted and/or the differences based on such actual distance values may be weighted.
- the average actual distance value may be weighted more heavily in favor of data associated with certain users.
- the average actual distance value for a given location may be weighted more heavily in favor of data associated with users for whom it can be verified they actually visited the given location as compared to those who just provided an indication of intent to visit the given location.
- certain differences may be weighted more heavily in favor of actual distance values associated with certain users.
- the quality measure engine 120 optionally weights one or more actual distance values differently based on the initial location and/or the final location associated with the distance values. For example, a first user who travels two miles more than an anticipated distance value to visit an Italian restaurant in downtown Chicago may take a path wherein he passes (or comes within a defined diversion distance of) three different Italian restaurants on his way to the Italian restaurant. The actual distance value of the first user travelling two miles more than an anticipated distance value may be more indicative of quality than a second user who also travels two miles more than an anticipated distance value but does not take a path wherein he passes (or comes within a defined diversion distance of) any different Italian restaurants on his way to the Italian restaurant. For example, the actual distance value of the first user travelling two miles more than the anticipated distance value may be weighted more heavily in a quality measure determination in some implementations than would the second user also travelling two miles more than anticipated.
- a first user who travels 10 minutes more than an anticipated distance value to visit a fine dining establishment may have had 20 other fine dining establishments that were closer to such user's starting location, 5 of which are highly rated.
- the first user travelling 10 minutes may be more indicative of quality than a second user who also travels 10 minutes more than an anticipated distance value but only has 8 fine dining establishments that were closer to such user's starting location, only 1 of which is highly rated.
- the actual distribution value of the first user travelling 10 minutes more than anticipated may be weighted more heavily in a quality measure determination in some embodiments than that of the second user also travelling 10 minutes more than anticipated.
- the quality measure for a given location may be based on the time investment a user is willing to make to visit the given location and an identified rank of the given location.
- the rank is indicative of the number of competing locations bypassed by one or more users to reach the given location. As discussed herein, in some implementations such a rank may optionally be utilized in determining one or more anticipated distance values and/or actual distance values associated with a given location.
- the quality measure engine 120 may independently determine a rank associated with a given location and utilize such rank as a further basis for determining the quality measure for the location.
- the rank for a given restaurant may be based on a number of competing restaurants within a certain distance of the given restaurant. For example, the rank for a given restaurant may be based on density of competing restaurants within five miles of the given restaurant. In some implementations the rank for a given restaurant may be based on user location data such as location data utilized to determine anticipated distance values and/or actual distance values. For example, data from users who indicate travel to a given location may be utilized to determine paths of the users and, for each path, how many competing locations were passed (or within a defined diversion distance) along the path. A greater number of competing locations passed may lead to a quality measure more indicative of quality for the location.
- data from users who indicate travel to a given location may be utilized to determine, for each user, a starting location of the user and how many competing locations were geographically closer to the user (time and/or distance) than the given location. A greater number of competing locations that were geographically closer to users may lead to a quality measure more indicative of quality for the given location.
- the quality measure engine 120 may determine an additional quality measure for each of one or more identified additional locations.
- the additional quality measure for each of one or more locations in the additional locations may be determined by the quality measure engine 120 in a manner similar to the determination of the quality measure for the given location.
- the additional quality measures may be optionally stored in the content database 130 and/or provided to the ranking engine 150 for further processing. In some implementations, the quality measures may be mapped with respective locations in the content database 130 .
- the ranking engine 150 may optionally rank one or more locations based on the respective quality measures. For example, in response to a search for an Italian restaurant in downtown Chicago, the search engine 110 may identify a plurality of search results for various Italian restaurants in downtown Chicago. One or more of the search results may be ranked based at least in part on a quality measure based on time investment one or more users are willing to make to visit the respective search results, as described herein. For example, ratings from 1 to 5 may be provided in the search results, each accompanied with one of the Italian restaurants. The particular rating applied to one or more of the Italian restaurants may be based at least in part on time investment one or more users are willing to make to visit the respective search results. Also, for example, the display order of one or more of the Italian restaurants may be based at least in part on time investment one or more users are willing to make to visit the respective search results.
- a star rating based at least in part on time investment one or more users are willing to make to visit a given Chinese restaurant may be displayed in response to a map based search that includes the given Chinese restaurant.
- the quality measure and additional quality measure may be utilized by the ranking engine 150 to modify ratings and/or rankings related to the given location and the one or more additional locations.
- a rating scheme may rate all the Italian restaurants in downtown Chicago based on other rating criteria, such as pure popularity signals, authoritative ratings, and user feedback.
- the ranking engine 150 may utilize the respective quality measures to boost the ratings of one or more of these restaurants, keep some ratings the same, and/or lower the ratings of others.
- the search engine 110 may utilize the modified ratings to identify one or more search result documents related to the location and/or to display in combination with one or more search results.
- the ranking engine 150 may rank search result documents responsive to a search query based at least in part on determined ratings.
- the quality measure engine 120 may identify one or more user characteristics of the members in the population. These user characteristics may include one or more latent types that have no natural interpretation, or may be semantically meaningful types. For example, the members in the population may all be from a common age group, a common gender, and/or a common income class.
- the quality measure engine 120 may select a group of members of the population based on whether they share the one or more desired user characteristics.
- the desired user characteristics could be dog lovers, gamblers at a local casino, a particular age group, theater lovers, local church-goers, and/or fans of a particular college or professional basketball team. Accordingly, any determined quality measures may optionally be specific to a particular group.
- the quality measure engine 120 may determine a quality measure for a given location based on that particular selected group of members of the population. For example, anticipated distance values and/or actual distance values may be based only on data from a particular group.
- the user characteristics may be used to link selected groups of members to a given location and/or particularize a quality measure for a location based on the user. For example, when a 25 year old searches for a restaurant to visit, the search engine 110 may search in the content database 130 to identify a list of relevant restaurants. In some implementations, these restaurants may have quality measures and/or additional quality measures associated with them that are specific to one or more user characteristics of the user.
- the quality measure engine 120 may identify an actual distance value of one or more users to a given location based on a comparison of multiple user distance values associated with the given location. For example, in some implementations, a first distance value of a user may be indicative of actual time taken and/or distance traveled for the user to reach the given location from an initial location, and a second distance value may be indicative of actual time taken and/or distance traveled for the user to reach a final location from the given location. The quality measure engine 120 may utilize the first distance value and the second distance value to determine an actual distance value in visiting the given location. For example, assume a user who travels from location P 1 , to a given location P 2 , then to location P 3 .
- the actual distance value for a user to the given location may be indicative of how far the user went out of his way in visiting the location. For example, assume a user leaves home (P 1 ) in Milwaukee to travel to Gary, Ind. (P 3 ) and diverts two miles or five minutes to eat at a restaurant (P 2 ) in Chicago. The actual distance value for the user associated with P 2 would be two miles or five minutes, since that is all the user diverted from the trip from P 1 to P 3 to visit P 2 . Also, for example, assume a user leaves home (P 1 ) in Milwaukee, drives directly to a restaurant (P 2 ) in Chicago, then travels directly back to home (P 3 ) in Milwaukee.
- each initial location is within a threshold of distance of each respective final location.
- the quality measure engine 120 may identify an actual distance value of one or more users to a given location based on a comparison of multiple user distance values associated with the given location and one or more additional locations. For example, a first distance value of a user may be indicative of actual time taken and/or distance traveled for the user to reach a first given location from an initial location, a second distance value of a user may be indicative of actual time taken and/or distance traveled for the user to reach a second given location from the first given location, a third distance value of a user may be indicative of actual time taken and/or distance traveled for the user to reach a final location from the second given location.
- the quality measure engine 120 may utilize the first, second, and third distance values to determine an actual distance value in visiting the first given location and/or an actual distance value in visiting the second given location. For example, assume a user who travels from location P 1 , to a first given location P 2 , then to a second given location P 3 , then to a location P 4 .
- the actual distance value for a user to the first and second given locations may be indicative of how far the user went out of his way in visiting the locations.
- This actual distance value may be utilized to assign an actual distance value to the first given location and the second given location.
- the first given location may be assigned the actual distance value and the second given location may be assigned the actual distance value.
- actual distance values for a given location that are split between one or more locations may be provided less weight in determining a quality measure. For example, actual distance values for a given location that are split between one or more locations may be weighted less heavily in determining an overall average actual distance value for the given location.
- the first given location may be assigned a percentage of the actual distance value and the second given location may also be assigned the other percentage of the actual distance value. For example, assuming the actual distance value for a user to the first and second given locations is ten minutes, five minutes may be assigned as the actual distance value for the first given location and five minutes may be assigned as the actual distance value for the second given location. Also, for example, in some implementations the first given location may be assigned a percentage of the actual distance value and the second given location may also be assigned a percentage of the actual distance value.
- the actual distance value for a user to the first and second given locations is ten minutes
- eight minutes (80%) may be assigned as the actual distance value for the first given location and eight minutes (80%) may also be assigned as the actual distance value for the second given location.
- a weighting and/or distribution of the actual distance value between two or more given locations may be based on determination of importance of the given locations in the user's trip. For example, in some implementations the determination of importance for two locations may be based on a location characteristic of those locations such as location type. For example, assuming a first location is a restaurant and the second location is a theatre near the restaurant, it could be determined that the actual distance value may be weighted or distributed more heavily toward the theatre based on the theatre being the likely impetus for the restaurant visit.
- the determination of importance for two locations may be based on additional data associated with the user who visited the two locations. For example, data from a user's social network profile may be utilized to determine that that the user discussed the first given location, but did not discuss the second given location. Accordingly, the first given location may be weighted more heavily than the second given location. Also, for example, the user may check in to the first given location via the social network but not check into the second given location, and the first given location weighted more heavily than the second given location. Also, for example, data from a user's search history and/or browsing history may be utilized to determine that the actual distance value should be weighted more heavily to and/or assigned a greater distribution to the first given location. For example, when the first given location is a restaurant and the user has viewed a menu of the restaurant and searched for reviews of the restaurant, it may indicate that the first given location should be weighted more heavily than the second given location.
- any determined quality measures for a given location may be mapped with the given location in one or more databases such as, for example, the content database 130 .
- the content database 130 may be private and optionally not read accessible via the Internet.
- the quality measures and/or given location may optionally be mapped to one or more location characteristics and/or user characteristics. For example, in some implementations a quality measure may be determined based on members of a population in a common grouping and the quality measure may be mapped to that common grouping in the database.
- Content database 130 may include, for each of one or more locations: data indicative of actual distance values and/or anticipated distance values for the location.
- content database 130 may include: an average distance and/or time traveled by a grouping of users to the location from an initial location and/or an average distance and/or time traveled by a grouping of users from the location to a final location.

- the indication of the distance and/or duration of travel from the source to the destination may be based on, for example, a determined distance and/or duration of travel as determined by a mapping service. In some implementations any determined duration of travel may optionally take into account travel conditions at the time of the navigational query and/or after the navigational query.
- any data associated with a direction query of a user may contain more than two locations.
- the user may seek directions from point A to point B to point C.
- the user may seek directions from point A to point B then seek directions from point B to point C, indicating a likelihood of traveling from point A to point B to point C.
- any utilized direction queries may optionally be verified based on additional data to increase a confidence level that the user will actually travel from the source location to the destination location.
- geolocation data from a mobile device of a user associated with the direction query may be utilized to verify that the user actually went from the source location to the destination location.
- data from a user's social network profile may be utilized to verify that the user went from the source location to the destination location.
- the user may check in to the destination location via the social network, and/or may post a comment related to the destination location.
- data from a user's search history and/or browsing history may be utilized to verify that the user will actually travel from the source location to the destination location.

For example, a two minute stop at a restaurant may indicate that the user picked up a carry-out order and/or that the user left the restaurant due to a long wait and/or other reason. A two minute stop may alternatively indicate that the user left the restaurant.
- This data may be correlated with any data related to anticipated distance values and/or actual distance values to weight such data. For example, location data may not be utilized in determining an actual value or may be lightly weighted if it is data indicating a visit may have occurred outside the restaurant's hours of operations or the restaurant may have been be filled to capacity.
