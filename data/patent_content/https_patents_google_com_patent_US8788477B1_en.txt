Definitions
- Search engines provide search results in response to a search query from a user.
- the search results are often presented in a ranked list, based on the search query from the user.
- an “authoritative” web page e.g., a web page that is trusted by users who submit a search query, a web page that includes a large amount of information about the search query, etc.
- a user may submit a search query that identifies an actor who has been in the news recently.
- a search based on the actor's name may return a search result from a news web site as the top search result(s).
- an authoritative web page about the actor e.g., a web page which may list a biography of the actor, a filmography of the actor, a list of links to other web sites about the actor, etc.
- an authoritative web page about the actor may be further down in the search results, and may, thus, not be as easily accessible to the user. Additionally, a user may not be able to quickly identify which search result is an authoritative web page.
- a method may include extracting, from a query log, query log information associated with a first search query.
- the extracted query log information may include information regarding the first search query, and information regarding search results that were provided in response to the first search query.
- the method may include calculating, based on the query log information, one or more metrics derived from one or more selections of the particular search result when the particular search result was provided in response to the first search query.
- the method may further include determining, based on the one or more metrics derived from one or more selections of the particular search result when the particular search result was provided in response to the first search query, that the particular search result corresponds to an authoritative web page associated with the first search query.
- the method may include identifying, upon determining that the particular search result corresponds to an authoritative web page associated with the first search query, a title associated with the particular search result.

- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example environment in which systems and/or methods described herein may be implemented
- FIG. 3 shows an example of a generic computer device and a generic mobile computer device
- FIGS. 4 and 5 are flowcharts of example processes for identifying authoritative web pages that are associated with search queries
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an example process for retrieving a Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) and title for an authoritative web page in response to a search query;

- FIG. 7 is a flowchart of an example process for providing search results and an authoritative web page in response to a search query.
- FIG. 8 is a diagram of an example user interface that displays search results and an authoritative web page in response to a search query.
- Users of search engines often desire to view “authoritative” web pages that are associated with search queries (e.g., trusted web pages that include a relatively large amount of information regarding a given topic associated with a search query). For example, when a user provides the search query, “White House,” the user may desire to access the authoritative web page for the White House (located at the Uniform Resource Locator, or “URL,” www.whitehouse.gov), regardless of where that web page falls within the search results for the search query.
- a system and/or method, described herein, may enable a search engine to determine whether a search query is associated with an authoritative web page. If the search query is associated with an authoritative web page, an address (e.g., a URL) and/or title for the authoritative web page may be presented on a search result page, in conjunction with a list of search results that are responsive to the search query.
- the address and/or title for the authoritative web page may be specifically identified on the search result page. For example, the address and/or title for the authoritative web page may be placed in a prominent location on the search results page (e.g., placed in a position above the list of search results on the search result page).
- other indicators may be used to visually distinguish the authoritative web page from the rest of the search results (e.g., words, such as “Authoritative web page” may identify the authoritative web page; formatting, such as bold, larger font, and/or different color(s), may be used; a divider, such as a horizontal line, may be inserted between the address and/or title for the authoritative web page and the list of search results, etc.).
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an overview of an example system 100 described herein.
- System 100 may include a query log 105 , address-title repository 110 , query-address-title generator 115 , query-address-title repository 120 , and authoritative web page presentation component 125 .
- Query log 105 may store data relating to past queries and search results associated with the past queries.
- the data may include information for many search queries (e.g., millions of search queries).
- the data for a particular query may identify a quantity of times the search query was received over a particular duration of time (e.g., within the past 180 days, within the past 30 days, within the past week, etc.), a quantity of times that particular search results associated with the particular search query were selected (e.g., clicked), a total quantity of times that any search result associated with the particular search query was selected, a position of each search result in a ranked/ordered list of search results that were returned for the particular search query, or any other data associated with the particular search query.
- Any information collected regarding actions of users may be anonymized and collected only after the users opt in (i.e., the users expressly request to have information regarding their actions collected).
- Query log 105 may also store information associated with search results that are responsive to (e.g., have been identified as relevant to) search queries stored by query log 105 .
- Such information may include addresses (e.g., URLs) for the search results.
- Address-title repository 110 may store information that associates addresses with titles.
- a title may refer to a name associated with a web page.
- a title of a web page is commonly provided, by a search engine, when the web page is presented in a list of search results.
- Titles, for web pages can be identified in many different ways. For example, a title may be identified within a “title” field of a web page. Additionally, or alternatively, a title may be located at a particular location on a web page (e.g., at the top of the web page).
- Address-title repository 110 may associate the title with the address of the web page with which the title corresponds.
- Query-address-title generator 115 may analyze information in query log 105 in order to identify search queries that are associated with authoritative web pages. Query-address-title generator 115 may extract ⁇ query, address> pairs for these authoritative web pages. Query-address-title generator 115 may retrieve a title for a given address (from a ⁇ query, address> pair) from address-title repository 110 . Query-address-title generator 115 may provide a ⁇ query, address, title> triplet, based on the retrieved ⁇ query, address> pair and the retrieved title, to query-address-title repository 120 .
- Query-address-title repository 120 may store information that associates queries, addresses, and titles. For example, a particular query may be associated with an address, which is associated with a title (as identified by information stored by address-title repository 110 ).
- Query-address-title repository 115 may store the ⁇ query, address, title> triplets provided by query-address-title generator 120 .
- Authoritative web page presentation component 125 may receive a search query (e.g., a search query entered by a user). Authoritative web page presentation component 125 may request an ⁇ address, title> pair, which corresponds to the query, from query-address-title repository 120 . If query-address-title repository 120 locates stored information that includes a ⁇ query, address, title>triplet that matches the search query, query-address-title repository 120 may provide the address and title from the ⁇ query, address, title> triplet (e.g., as an ⁇ address, title> pair) to authoritative web page presentation component 125 .
- a search query e.g., a search query entered by a user.
- Authoritative web page presentation component 125 may request an ⁇ address, title> pair, which corresponds to the query, from query-address-title repository 120 . If query-address-title repository 120 locates stored information that includes a ⁇ query, address, title
- Authoritative web page presentation component 125 may then provide the query, the address, and the title (e.g., as a ⁇ query, address, title> triplet), to a search engine (not pictured). Alternatively, authoritative web page presentation component 125 may provide the ⁇ address, title> pair to the search engine. The search engine may provide the address and title, in conjunction with a list of search results, in response to the search query.
- a user is easily able to identify and view authoritative web pages that are associated with the user's search queries. Additionally, by not searching for the title of an authoritative web page until the authoritative web page, for a search query, is identified, system 100 is able to efficiently process query logs to identify authoritative web pages (e.g., which authoritative web pages are associated with search queries, the titles of the authoritative web pages, and the addresses of the authoritative web pages).
- authoritative web pages e.g., which authoritative web pages are associated with search queries, the titles of the authoritative web pages, and the addresses of the authoritative web pages.

- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example process 400 for determining information regarding authoritative web pages.
- process 400 may be performed by query-address-title generation server 215 .
- process 400 may be performed by one or more other components instead of, or possibly in conjunction with, query-address-title generation server 215 .
- some or all of process 400 may be performed by server 230 .
- process 400 may include extracting information from a query log to identify search queries and a selection count of search results associated with identified search queries (block 405 ).
- query-address-title generation server 215 may analyze a query log (e.g., query log 105 ) to identify one or more search queries stored in the query log.
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may also identify search results that were returned for each of the queries.
- query-address-title generation server 215 may identify the search query “White house” in query log (e.g., a query log stored at query log server 205 ).
- query-address-title generation server 215 may identify, based on information extracted from query log server 205 , that three web pages—Web page A, Web page B, and Web page C—were returned as search results for the search query “White house.”
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may also determine, based on information extracted from query log server 205 , which of the web pages were returned as a top-listed search result. In other words, query-address-title generation server 215 may determine which of the web pages were returned as the highest ranking (e.g., most relevant, and/or most highly scored, based on any of a number of different ranking metrics) search result.
- query-address-title generation server 215 may identify a selection count.
- a selection count for a particular search result may indicate how many times the search result was selected (e.g., how many times the particular search result was “clicked,” hovered over for a particular amount of time, and/or otherwise identified as desirable to a user) when presented as a search result for the search query.
- Web page A may have been selected 200 times after being presented as a search result for the search query “White house”
- Web page B may have been selected 50 times
- Web page C may have been selected 30 times.
- Web page A has a selection count of 200
- Web page B has a selection count of 50
- Web page C has a selection count of 30.
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may also identify an overall selection count for the search results of the search query.
- the search query “White house” would have an overall selection count of 280, because the sum of the selection counts of Web page A, Web page B, and Web page C is 280.
- query-address-title generation server 215 may analyze only the search queries (and their associated search results) that were submitted within a particular time frame. For example, query-address-title generation server 215 may analyze only the search queries (and their associated search results) that were submitted within the last 180 days, 365 days, 90 days, etc.
- query-address-title generation server 215 may use a programming language that facilitates the parsing of query logs. For example, query-address-title generation server 215 may execute a script that includes the “Sawzall” programming language.
- process 400 may include filtering queries associated with a quantity of entries that is below a threshold (block 410 ). Some search queries may have been entered so few times, that the search queries may be deemed irrelevant/insignificant when identifying authoritative web pages.
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may identify, based on query counts of search queries, such insignificant search queries by identifying search queries, in query log server 205 , that were entered less than a threshold quantity of times.
- the threshold quantity may be a configurable quantity, such as 1,000, 5,000, or any other integer.
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may exclude the irrelevant/insignificant search queries from further processing relating to authoritative web pages. As a result of the filtering, query-address-title generation server 215 may be left with a set of search queries to process further.
- query-address-title generation server 215 may identify, based on information extracted from query log server 205 , that the search query “White house purple monkey dishwasher” has been submitted to a search engine 23 times over the past 180 days.
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may compare the quantity 23 to the threshold quantity (e.g., 1,000).
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may determine, based on this comparing, that the search query “White house purple monkey dishwasher” should be excluded from further processing, because 23 is less than 1,000.
- query-address-title generation server 215 may identify, based on information extracted from query log server 205 , that the search query “White house” has been submitted to a search engine 9,876 times over the past 180 days.
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may compare the quantity 9,876 to the threshold quantity (e.g., 1,000).
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may determine, based on this comparing, that the search query “White house” should be not be excluded from further processing because 9,876 is greater than 1,000.
- query-address-title generation server 215 may again extract information from query log server 205 , excluding the filtered search queries (not pictured). Additionally, or alternatively, after filtering the search queries (at block 410 ), query-address-title generation server 215 may simply flag the filtered search queries as “filtered.”
- Process 400 may further include identifying ⁇ query, address> pairs for search queries that correspond to authoritative web pages (block 415 ).
- query-address-title generation server 215 may, for instance, analyze information, extracted from query log server 205 and associated with the set of search queries, to identify addresses of authoritative web pages that are associated with search queries. For example, query-address-title generation server 215 may identify that the search query “White house” is associated with an authoritative web page, which may be located at the address, “www.whitehouse.gov.”
- query-address-title generation server 215 may also identify (at block 415 ) that other search queries may not be associated with an authoritative web page. For example, query-address-title generation server 215 may determine that the search query “How many calories should I eat a day,” while popular (e.g., the search query may have been submitted a quantity of times that is greater than the above-mentioned threshold quantity), may not be associated with an authoritative web page.
- Process 400 may further include notifying a query-address-title repository of search queries that are not associated with authoritative web pages (block 420 ).
- query-address-title generation server 215 may notify query-address-title server 220 that the search query “How many calories should I eat a day” is not associated with an authoritative web page.
- Query-address-title server 220 may determine whether an association exists in query-address-title server 220 between the search query and an address and/or title. If such an association exists, the notification from query-address-title generation server 215 may indicate that the association should no longer exist (e.g., query-address-title generation server 215 has determined that the search query is no longer associated with an authoritative web page).
- Query-address-title repository may delete the association upon such a notification.
- Process 400 may additionally include retrieving titles, corresponding to identified ⁇ query, address> pairs, from an address-title repository (block 425 ).
- query-address-title generation server 215 may retrieve a title, associated with the ⁇ query, address> pair ⁇ “White house”, “www.whitehouse.gov”>from address-title server 210 .
- query-address-title generation server 215 may cause a search to be executed on information stored in address-title repository 110 .
- query-address-title generation server 215 may provide the address “www.whitehouse.gov” to address-title server 210 .
- Address-title server 210 may perform a search on the information stored in address-title repository, using the address as a primary key in the search. Upon identifying an association between the address and a corresponding title (e.g., “The White House”). Address-title server 210 may provide the corresponding title to query-address-title generation server 215 .
- query-address-title generation server 215 may form a ⁇ query, address, title> triplet. For instance, further to the above example, query-address-title generation server 215 may form a ⁇ query, address, title> triplet of ⁇ “White house”, “www.whitehouse.gov”, “The White House”>.
- Process 400 may further include providing ⁇ query, address, title> triplets to a query-address-title repository (block 430 ).
- query-address-title generation server 215 may provide ⁇ query, address, title> triplets, that correspond to search queries for which authoritative web pages were identified (e.g., ⁇ “White house”, “www.whitehouse.gov”, “The White House”>) to query-address-title repository 120 .
- process 400 was described as including the above-mentioned blocks 405 - 430 , some or all of these blocks may be considered optional.
- block 410 may be omitted (e.g., queries may not be filtered).
- certain blocks may be performed in parallel with other blocks.
- block 420 may be performed while block(s) 425 and/or 430 are performed.
- process 400 may be performed on multiple (e.g., hundreds, thousands, millions, etc.) search queries within a query log. Alternatively, or additionally, process 400 may be performed concurrently on multiple search queries within a query log.
- titles may be retrieved only for those web pages that are identified as authoritative web pages. By only retrieving titles for these identified web pages, time and processing power may be saved, as opposed to an implementation that determines titles for pages that are not identified as authoritative.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example process 500 for identifying authoritative web pages that are associated with search queries.
- block 415 , of process 400 may include a portion of, or the entirety of, process 500 .
- process 500 may be performed by query-address-title generation server 215 .
- process 500 may be performed by one or more other components instead of, or possibly in conjunction with, query-address-title generation server 215 .
- some or all of process 500 may be performed by server 230 .
- process 500 may include selecting a candidate query from a query log (block 505 ).
- query-address-title generation server 215 may select a candidate search query of “White house” from query log server 205 .
- Process 500 may further include determining a query count for the candidate search query (e.g., a quantity of times that the candidate search query was submitted) over a particular period of time, such as within the last 180 days (block 510 ).
- query-address-title generation server 215 may determine, based on information extracted from query log server 205 , that the search query “White house” was submitted as a search query 9,876 times over the past 180 days.
- process 500 may include determining a click-through-rate (“CTR”) of a first search result associated with the candidate search query (e.g., a highest ranked (top-listed) search result, out of a list of search results that is generated in response to the candidate search query) over a particular period of time (e.g., 180 days) (block 515 ).
- CTR click-through-rate
- This particular period of time may be the same period of time discussed above with respect to block 510 .
- the CTR of the first search result may be determined based on the quantity of times that the candidate search query was submitted, and the quantity of times that the first search result was selected (e.g., “clicked,” “hovered over,” etc.) when presented as the first search result for the candidate search query. Specifically, for instance, the CTR of the first search result may be determined by dividing the quantity of times that the first search result was selected by the quantity of times that the candidate search query was submitted.
- query-address-title generation server 215 may identify that a first search result (e.g., a search result corresponding to the web page located at the address of “www.whitehouse.gov”) was selected 4,321 times when presented as a first search result for the search query “White house” within the last 180 days.
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may divide the quantity of times that the identified first search result was selected (e.g., 4,321 in this example) by the quantity of times that “White house” was submitted as a search query (e.g., 9,876 in this example).
- the CTR for “www.whitehouse.gov,” when presented as a first search result for “White house” over the last 180 days would be (4,321/9,876 ⁇ 0.4375).
- Process 500 may further include determining a click ratio of the first search result associated with the candidate search query (block 520 ).
- the click ratio may be determined based on the quantity of times that the first search result was selected (e.g., “clicked,” “hovered over,” etc.) when presented as the first search result for the candidate search query and a total quantity of times that any search result was selected when presented as a search result for the candidate query.
- the click ratio the first search result may be determined by dividing the quantity of times that the first search result was selected by the total quantity of times that any search result was selected when presented as a search result for the candidate query.
- the click ratio may be determined based on selections made over a particular period of time (e.g., within the last 180 days). This particular period of time may be the same period of time discussed above with respect to blocks 510 and/or 515 .
- query-address-title generation server 215 may identify that a first search result (e.g., a search result corresponding to the web page located at the address of “www.whitehouse.gov”) was selected 4,321 times when presented as a first search result for the search query “White house” within the last 180 days.
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may further identify that 6,543 total selections were made of any search result that was presented as search results for the search query “White house.” Specifically, in this example, 4,321 selections were made on the first search result (“www.whitehouse.gov”), while 2,222 (i.e., 6,543-4,321) selections were made on other search results.
- the click ratio for “www.whitehouse.gov,” when presented as a first search result for “White house” over the last 180 days would be (4,321/6,543 ⁇ 0.6604).
- Process 500 may further include determining, based on one or more conditions, whether the first search result, discussed above with respect to one or more of block(s) 510 - 520 , corresponds to an authoritative web page associated with the candidate search query (block 525 ).
- the conditions may include whether the query count (determined at, e.g., block 510 ) is above a first threshold, whether the first search result CTR (determined at, e.g., block 515 ) is above a second threshold, and/or whether the first search result click ratio (determined at, e.g., block 520 ) is above a third threshold.
- One or more of these thresholds may be the same. Additionally, or alternatively, some or all of these thresholds may be different. Any of these thresholds may be human-configurable.
- the conditions may include one or more compound conditions (e.g., a condition that is based on one or more other conditions).
- the conditions may include one or more Boolean conditions (such as AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
- the first search result may be determined to correspond to an authoritative web page associated with the candidate search query if:
- query-address-title generation server 215 may identify that the query count for the search query “White house” (e.g., 9,876 in this example) is above a first threshold (e.g., 1,000). Query-address-title generation server 215 may further identify that the first search result CTR for the search result corresponding to the address “www.whitehouse.gov” (e.g., 0.4375 in this example) is above a second threshold (e.g., 0.4000). Query-address-title generation server 215 may further identify that the first search result click ratio for the search result “www.whitehouse.gov” (e.g., 0.6604) is above a third threshold (e.g., 0.5000). When the conditions shown in block 525 are satisfied (block 525 —YES), the first search result corresponding to the address “www.whitehouse.gov” may be identified as an authoritative web page associated with the candidate search query (block 530 ).
- a first threshold e.g., 1,000
- the first search result may be identified as not an authoritative web page associated with the candidate search query (block 540 ).
- query-address-title generation server 215 may further identify the candidate search query as a search query that is not associated with an authoritative web page.
- process 500 may include determining whether another search result is an authoritative web page (block 545 ). For instance, query-address-title generation server 215 may repeat one or more of blocks 510 - 540 for the candidate search query, using one or more lower-ranked search results instead of the first search result.
- query-address-title generation server 215 may determine a CTR of a second search result (e.g., a next-to-highest ranked (next-to-top-listed) search result, out of a list of search results that is generated in response to the candidate search query), in a list of search results that is presented in response to the candidate search query (similar to block 515 ), determine a click ratio of the second search result (similar to block 520 ), etc. If the conditions are met for the second search result (block 525 —YES), query-address-title generation server 215 may identify the second search result as the authoritative web page associated with the candidate query (block 530 ). Otherwise, query-address-title generation server 215 may continue blocks 510 - 540 for other search results.
- a second search result e.g., a next-to-highest ranked (next-to-top-listed) search result, out of a list of search results that is generated in response to the candidate search query
- Query-address-title generation server 215 may only attempt to determine an authoritative web page for a candidate search query a predetermined quantity of times. In other words, if an authoritative web page is not determined by a particular iteration (e.g., by the first iteration, the second iteration, the third iteration, etc.) of blocks 510 - 540 , query-address-title generation server 215 may determine that the candidate search query is not associated with an authoritative web page (block 540 ).
- process 500 was described as including the above-mentioned blocks 505 - 545 , some or all of these blocks may be considered optional.
- one or more of blocks 510 - 520 may be omitted.
- different conditions may be used at block 525 . For instance, if block 515 is omitted (i.e., if a first search result CTR is not determined), block 525 may include a condition that does not include the first search CTR.
- certain blocks may be performed in parallel with other blocks. For instance, one or more of blocks 510 - 520 may be performed while any other one(s) of blocks 510 - 520 is/are performed.
- block 545 may be omitted in one implementation.
- query-address-title generation server 215 would only examine first search results when determining an authoritative web page associated with a candidate search query.

- Process 600 may further include retrieving an address and title for an authoritative web page that is associated with the search query (block 610 ).
- authoritative web page presentation server 225 may cause a search to be executed on information stored by query-address-title repository 120 .
- the search may include using the search query as a key in order to locate an entry, stored by query-address-title repository 120 , that associates a search query with an address and a title (e.g., an entry that includes a ⁇ query, address, title> triplet).
- the key (i.e., the search query) may be, for example, “White house,” and the located information, stored by query-address-title repository 120 , may associate the search query “White house” with the address “www.whitehouse.gov” and the title “The White House.”
- Query-address-title repository 120 may store the ⁇ query, address, title> triplet, ⁇ “White house”, “www.whitehouse.gov”, “The White House”>.
- query-address-title repository 120 may provide some or all of the information (e.g., the address and the title) to authoritative web page presentation server 225 .
- Process 600 may also include providing the retrieved address and title associated with the authoritative web page (block 615 ).

- the address and title may be formatted as an ⁇ address, title> pair.
- search queries may not be associated with an authoritative web page.
- it may be determined (e.g. by authoritative web page presentation server 225 and/or by query-address-title repository 120 ) that query-address-title repository 120 does not include an association between a particular search query and an authoritative web page (e.g., query-address-title repository 120 may not store a ⁇ query, address, title> triplet that corresponds to the particular search query).
- authoritative web page presentation server 225 may inform the search engine that the search query is not associated with an authoritative web page.
- process 600 was described as including the above-mentioned blocks 605 - 615 , some or all of these blocks may be considered optional. Furthermore, certain blocks may be performed in parallel with other blocks. For instance, block 420 may be performed while block(s) 425 and/or 430 are performed.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart of an example process 700 for presenting information regarding an authoritative web page in response to a search query.
- process 700 may be performed by a search engine (e.g., a search engine implemented at search engine server 230 ).
- process 700 may be performed by one or more other components instead of, or possibly in conjunction with, the search engine.
- process 700 may include receiving a search query (block 705 ).
- the search engine may receive the search query from a client (e.g., a client implemented at one or more of client devices 235 or 240 ), via, e.g., a web browser at the client.
- a client e.g., a client implemented at one or more of client devices 235 or 240
- Process 700 may also include receiving search results that are responsive to the search query (block 710 ).
- the search engine may receive a list of web pages that are responsive to (e.g., that are relevance to, and/or are otherwise responsive to) the search query “White house.”
