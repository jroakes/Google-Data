Background technology
The mobile system of future generation and the business that are commonly called the third generation or 3G system and business are walked to go on the stage.The 3G mobile technology provides voice, internet and the relevant multimedia service of better quality.Specification requirement, standard and spectrum allocation may and the relative program of 3G system are determined and have been ratified to be used under the IMT-2000 (International Telecommunications Union-2000) in International Telecommunication Union and industrial bodies cooperation.
CDMA2000 is the 3G system that comes from existing wireless standard (for example IS-95) development, this system allows cellular carrier that the business of enhancing is provided in the environment that with new markets dynamically is feature, and described new markets trend strengthens equipment and relevant to the wireless access of internet with mobility, the mobility of enhancing.CDMA2000 has stipulated air interface and core network technology, is used for the business that is improved by the needed level of the mobile subscriber who increases is day by day transmitted.
Will recognize that according to various communication architectures commonly used, the CDMA2000 system has comprised for example a plurality of layers in seven layer protocol stacks, wherein this seven layer protocols stack is interpreted as open system (OSI) interconnected model by those of ordinary skills usually.A layer in the above-mentioned OSI stack architecture that occurs in the CMDA2000 system is a physical layer, and wherein in exemplary receiver, signal is received, despreading, demodulation, decoding, channelizing, framing or the like.When the decoded and channelizing of information, frame is constructed or structure again according to relevant criterion.Other layers according to bottom-up order in common hierarchy comprise MAC layer, safe floor, articulamentum, session layer, fluid layer and application layer.Exemplary CDMA2000 system can further operate in single carrier and the multicarrier environment, and can be according to Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) operation.
Realize physical layer channel independently, and prefix " R " is illustrated in up link or the reverse chain channel part that extends to the base station in the RAN from travelling carriage (MS), and " F " expression extends to down link or the forward link channel part of MS from the base station.For the sake of simplicity, can not use prefix herein, use title that channel is made explanations and only replace.Should further note, although a channel strip mostly just is discussed at every turn, for example forward direction part or oppositely part, the forward direction and the oppositely combination of part of the explanation general reference channel of channel.
Physical channel can be divided into special use and common signal channel.For example, DPCH (DPCH) provide the point-to-point connection, and public physic channel (CPCH) provides the visit of putting multiple spot.In common CDMA2000 system, there is multiple channel type, and lists and be described following briefly.Common CDMA2000 system provides DPCH (DHCH); Primary channel (FCH) is used to transmit exclusive data; Auxiliary channel (SCH) is used for satisfying required data rate by dynamic assignment; Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH) is used to transmit the control information of travelling carriage special use; And special-purpose Auxiliary Pilot Channel (DAPICH), use with antenna beam formation and beam position technology alternatively, in order to increase coverage or data rate towards the specific user.As noted above, above-mentioned channel is all effective on forward direction and backward channel.As following pointed, additional channel is with specific forward direction or the backward channel of being used for.
Pilot channel (R-PICH) provide the ability relevant with coherent detection; Forward Pilot Channel (F-PICH) provides the ability of soft handover and coherent detection; The public Auxiliary Pilot Channel of forward direction (F-CAPICH) provides the ability of soft handover and coherent detection; Forward Paging Channel (F-PCH) provides the paging function that utilizes short bursty data communication; Forward Common Control Channel (F-CCCH) provides paging function and the short bursty data communication function of supporting different pieces of information speed; Forward Sync Channel (F-SYNC) provides system information and synchronous to MS; Reverse Access Channel (R-ACH) provide the multiple access access channel, and MS can transmit the message to the base station in the multiple access access channel; And Reverse Common Control Channel (R-CCCH), it is similar to R-ACH, but it is configured to communicating control information.
In common communication, the MS in the RAN and two interested channels between base station or other stations or the node comprise SCH and FCH/DCCH.As mentioned above, FCH can be used to transmit exclusive data, and DCCH is used to transmit the travelling carriage dedicated control information.FCH and DCCH are characterised in that high reliability, low data rate channel, and SCH is used for satisfying required data rate and it is characterized in that lower reliability and the high data rate channel by dynamic assignment.According to reliability, to the signal relevant with each channel accurately degree compare.According to design, the SCH channel is applicable to and is used to transmit the bigger traffic under the situation of less concern accuracy.
Yet, problem has appearred on frame classification, and whether transmission for example appears, for example continuously/discontinuous transmission (TX/DTX) classification, and whether the speed evaluation algorithm operates on each channel independently.Further, the TX/DTX classification is used for the purpose of power control and radio link protocol (RLP), and accurate classification has numerous branches in whole RAN thus.Because SCH is the lower channel of reliability, may any sacrifice in performance when speed misjudgment that the SCH channel is made.Usually, because being used for the data of the high-capacity high speed data relevant with business, transmits the SCH channel, wherein said business may have the data division that transmits on other channels, therefore judge for the speed of the mistake of SCH channel or any channel and may reduce throughput, power efficiency, bandwidth availability ratio or the like, and generally whole system has been produced negative effect thus.For example, the power increase that is caused by unsuitable channel classification may cause the increase that cochannel disturbs.On the contrary, relevant with unsuitable classification loss of data may destroy protocol operation, error correction, data recovery or the like.Therefore wish to increase the accuracy of frame classification, can improve the overall performance of RAN thus.
Embodiment
On the whole, the present invention focus in the wireless access network (RAN) with each equipment between the classification of the relevant received frame of the communication carried out, for example in CDMA2000 RAN.This classification is preferably carried out in the receiver section of receiver or wireless set, and wherein this wireless set can be arranged in communication apparatus RAN, for example travelling carriage (MS) or base station (BS).As will be understood, this MS can comprise communication apparatus, for example static or fixing mobile receiver, and mobile mobile receiver, static or mobile communication unit, terminal, mobile phone or the like, and this BS can comprise fixed base stations etc.When the physical layer hardware pair signal relevant with the information that is sent by receiver receives, when demodulation, despreading, decoding etc., can be to make some hypothesis or classification about data recovered.For example, if seem not occur signal, then can specify discontinuous transmission (DTX) state.Do not occur if seem data to occur, then relevant frame can be appointed as the deletion state.Classified information can upwards be passed to higher protocol layer.Classification can be carried out on various channels, for example the various channels such as auxiliary channel, control channel, Traffic Channel etc. is exerted an influence.Utilize to allow transmitter to receive the power control channel of the information relevant, can classify according to this, classify again etc. with power control, to the appropriate section of channel on signal transmit relevant transmit power level and regulate.Therefore in exemplary receiver, the classification relevant with channel can be based on the corresponding classification of cochannel and changed forcibly, and when the preliminary classification on the channel is under the situation of mistake, can regulate power level, and this will be described in more detail following.
Thus, the present invention relates to be used to reduce the method and the equipment of above-mentioned misclassification.Should be pointed out that according to conventional methods delay is significant significant problem.For example, rely on monitoring frame quality standard and rely on the certainty and the semidefiniteness method of the false causality analysis of frame quality standard to need the back received frame to handle, thereby determine whether to have satisfied standard, said method illustrates in U.S. Patent application No.US20020086692.If do not satisfy, further carry out about the judgement of the frame classification of mistake whether occurring.In other system, for example disclosed in U.S. Patent application No.20020160782, for the frame of each demodulation sign indicating number is determined appropriate original data rate.This appropriate data rate is related each other, and is associated with the maximum likelihood combination of corresponding protocol standard and speed.In these and other conventional system, because delay has suppressed the adjusting for the real-time or near real time of system parameters (for example transmitting power), this in addition will when making full use of channel or a plurality of channel or system made full use of as a whole, cause bigger gain, therefore follow the delay of above-mentioned processing to limit the validity of judging for error condition.In addition, these previous methods are not distinguished TX/DTX and deletion.

The principle of discussing and describing and notion can be applied to receiver particularly and relevant access terminal, communication unit, equipment and multiple systems, described system disposition has or has utilized the system, data of voice communication to transmit or carries out messaging delivery services according to various standards on RAN, described standard for example be CDMA (code division multiple access) with and modification, GSM (global system for mobile communications), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), the 3G system of for example UMTS system (universal mobile telecommunications service), integrated digital strengthen network and modification or evolution.The principles described herein and notion can further be applied to have in the equipment or system short-range communication capabilities, that be commonly called the W-LAN ability, for example IEEE802.11, bluetooth or Hiper-LAN or the like, it has preferably utilized code division multiple access, frequency hopping, OFDM or TDMA access technology and one or more talk various network protocols, for example TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet Protocol), IPX/SPX (packet exchange between net/order packet switch), NetBIOS (NetBIOS) or other protocol architectures.
As described in more detail below, in the RAN channel relevant, use various creative principles to reduce or eliminate wrong frame classification with receiver, and power level is controlled more accurately, thereby further provide the efficient that improves RAN by classification again based on frame.In addition, when applied in reverse, inventive principle disclosed herein and that describe can be used to further improve performance, for example based on the classification relevant with first channel (for example channel of low reliability) by forcibly second channel (for example channel of high reliability) being classified again.
According to various exemplary and alternate exemplary embodiment, a kind of method is provided, be used for reducing the erroneous frame classification relevant with the communication of wireless access network (RAN).Preferably, for example according to transmission whether occurring or according to transmission/discontinuous transmission (TX/DTX) state, to first frame relevant with communication on first channel with first data rate with the second channel with second data rate on second frame of being correlated with of communicating by letter classify.Do you note TX? the DTX state may be called as transmission/discontinuous transmission state alternatively.To be appreciated that,, just make such classification in case frame has been carried out the demodulation sign indicating number by the hardware and software of physical layer.Based on the classification of second frame, first frame can be categorized as again second state (for example DTX state) of first frame from first state (for example relevant with first frame deletion state) of first frame.Should be pointed out that data rate that first data rate channel has can be relatively higher than the data rate of second data rate channel.Based on the classification of first frame, also second frame can be categorized as again second state (for example DTX state) of the second relevant frame of communicating by letter with this from first state (for example relevant with second frame deletion state) of second frame.Should be understood that, according to various exemplary embodiments, first channel preferably includes the perhaps lower Traffic Channel of high power capacity, reliability, auxiliary channel (SCH) for example, and second channel comprises the channel of low capacity, high reliability, for example control or signaling channel, it comprises primary channel (FCH) or Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH), it is known that they are relevant with the CDMA structure that comprises cdma2000 etc.
When respectively first frame and second frame being carried out the branch time-like, can use some blocking routines, comprise according to transmission/discontinuous transmission (TX/DTX) state each and classifying respectively first and second frames.Next, can determine frame rate parameter, and determine the frame quality subsequently.When the TX/DTX classification error, for example be judged as mistakenly when being in the TX state when channel, further misclassification may appear.Thus, as mentioned above, first state preferably includes wrong deletion state, and second state comprises discontinuous transmission (DTX) state, and this discontinuous transmission state is appropriate state for the channel transmitted that not have activation.When dividing time-like again, to classify again based on it, receiver can be configured to be easy to the power controlling level is regulated, wherein said power controlling level and first channel and may be relevant with intrasystem other channels.
According to other exemplary and alternate exemplary embodiment, for example by determining the first rate parameter relevant (full rate for example with first frame, half rate, / 4th speed, / 8th speed or the like), and by determining that second rate parameter relevant with second frame determine the error condition in the radio communication, wherein said first frame is to receive having on first channel of first data rate, and described second frame is to receive on the second channel with second data rate, and this second data rate can be less than first data rate.Can further comprise that to first state relevant with first channel this error condition judges, the result for example can be categorized as second state with first state again according to the value relevant with second rate parameter.Can further comprise that to first state relevant this error condition judges, and first state relevant with second channel can be categorized as second state again according to the first rate parameter with second channel.Should be understood that, particularly, when relevant with the cdma system of for example cdma2000, first channel for example comprises the Traffic Channel that high power capacity, reliability are perhaps lower, auxiliary channel (SCH) for example, and second channel comprises the signaling channel of low capacity, high reliability, for example primary channel (FCH) or Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH).Therefore,, preferably use second parameter, and second parameter comprises one of them the relevant full rate parameter with primary channel (FCH) and Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH) when dividing time-like again to first state on first channel.When dividing time-like again, use the first rate parameter in certain embodiments, and the first rate parameter comprises the full rate parameter relevant with auxiliary channel (SCH) to first state on the second channel.In order to obtain higher system effectiveness, for example, according to the classification again of first state on first channel and the second channel, this exemplary receiver can be regulated the power controlling level relevant with transmission on first channel and the second channel.
According to other exemplary and optional exemplary embodiments, preferably in base station (BS) or similar fixed station or travelling carriage (MS) or similar accessing terminal, provide a kind of equipment, in wireless access network (RAN), be used to reduce the frame classification of the mistake relevant with communication.This exemplary equipment can comprise a kind of interface, for example standard compliant or special-purpose air interface, it can be with MS or the downlink portion that access terminal and be connected with RAN and support communication, perhaps the base station is connected to MS and RAN and support uplink part on first channel and second channel at least.As the skilled person will be understood, this evaluation method selecting optimal equipment ground comprises memory and processor, wherein the both by certain for example the mechanism of bus etc. be connected to this interface.This memory is preferably stored a plurality of instructions, the software program that for example comprises routine etc., it can be carried out successively, and the term of execution may make this processor determine and the second relevant parameter of first frame on the second channel, and definite thus first classification state relevant with first frame on first channel is wrong.Should be pointed out that according to second parameter first classification state relevant with first frame on first channel is categorized as the second classification state again, and, to classify again according to this, the adjusting of for example relevant with first channel power controlling level can be more prone to.These a plurality of instructions can further make processor determine first parameter relevant with first channel, and determine that the first classification state (for example delete state) relevant with second channel first frame is wrong, this has caused according to first parameter first classification state relevant with first frame of second channel being categorized as for example second state of DTX state again.Classify according to this, the adjusting of the power level relevant with second channel becomes and is more prone to again.Those skilled in the art will be appreciated that, when first channel comprises that high capacity channel and second channel comprise the low capacity channel, increase that can implementation efficiency, the Traffic Channel that for example comprises the low reliability of high power capacity when first channel, auxiliary channel (SCH) for example, and comprise the control or the signaling channel of low capacity, high reliability when second channel, for example when primary channel (FCH) or Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH).

Invent that most function and many creationary principles are to use or realize that so that the mode of software program or instruction and integrated circuit (IC) is optimum described integrated circuit for example is processor and special-purpose IC.Predictable, although for example may impel and make significant effort and multiple design alternative for the consideration of effective time, current techniques and economic aspect, but when according to the instructing of notion disclosed herein and principle, those skilled in the art can make such software instruction and program and IC at an easy rate with minimum experiment.Therefore, for simplicity and make according to principle of the present invention and the unclear any risk of notion and become minimum, will be defined to about the principle used by preferred embodiment and the essence of notion for the further discussion of above-mentioned software and IC (if any).
With reference to figure 1, show exemplary Figure 100, the wireless access network (RAN) that comprises (BS) 110 that have the base station and travelling carriage (MS) 120, described base station (BS) 110 and travelling carriage (MS) 120 have the wireless connections 130 of being set up by air interface, can set up this air interface by supporting the wireless air interface standard, wherein said wireless air interface standard for example is the air-interface standard relevant with cdma2000, can be entitled as in " cdma2000 HighRate Data Air Interface Specification " and find example at the document C.S0024 of the third generation partnership project 2 (3GPP2) of 2.0 versions on October 27th, 2000.It is also understood that simultaneously and can utilize special-purpose air interface specification or agreement to set up described connection.Fig. 1 also shows the some additional MS120 that for example appears at usually among the multi-user RAN.
According to various exemplary embodiments, as shown in the block diagram 200 of Fig. 2, can in the receiver of communication apparatus, carry out frame classification.MS201 and BS202 are equipped with radiating portion 210 and receiving unit 220.To be appreciated that, receiving unit 220 among the MS201 is configured to receive the forward direction or the downlink portion of first channel 230 and second channel 231, and the receiving unit 220 among the BS202 is configured to receive the reverse or uplink portion of first channel 232 and second channel 233.Corresponding radiating portion 210 is configured to send data according to the related protocol standard on first channel 230 and 232 and on second channel 231 and 233.Notice that the data that sent can comprise the power level control data, are used for the reverse part adjusted transmitter power level at channel, this is known.Thus, according to the exemplary physical layer protocol (wherein exemplary RAN is according to described technical specification work) that is included in cdma2000 technical specification or the similar techniques standard, on power control channel etc., oppositely send relevant information by relevant transmitter section 210, thereby receiver section 220 can influence transmitting power.In order better to understand some advantage relevant with various embodiment, should be understood that the preferably relatively low and less channel of capacity thus of data rate of first channel 230 and 232, this channel is relevant with for example business, signaling and control, for example primary channel of stipulating among the cdma2000 (FCH) or Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH). Second channel 231 and 233 preferably includes higher data speed and the bigger channel of capacity thus, and this channel is relevant with for example high-speed data transfer, the auxiliary channel of for example stipulating among the cdma2000 (SCH).Each receiver section 220 further comprises memory 221, processor 222, air interface 223, all connects via bus 224.Each instruction can be stored in and be used in the memory 221 on processor 222 carrying out, and the program of herein describing in conjunction with various exemplary embodiments by for example interacting with air interface 223, can carrying out relevant with frame classification etc. etc.Here exemplary program is not discussed in detail, and suppose that this program is conventionally known to one of skill in the art, described exemplary process comprises demodulation, decoding or the like, is used for information recovery, error correction and sets up a plurality of frames according to the physical layer part of relevant criterion and particularly relevant criterion.Suppose that air interface 223 and demodulation method accurately irrespectively transmit a plurality of standard compliant frames, wherein said frame has a plurality of indicating devices relevant with deletion and speed, therefore can call exemplary process related to the present invention, thereby make the frame classification that carries out in physical layer meticulousr.
When channel classification function independently for example is integrated in the chipset usually, some combination of channel and channel data modulation technique may lead to errors, and classification is rapid to be increased, and the use of wherein said chipset is relevant with higher functions (for example correlation function of radio link protocol (RLP)) with the additional function of power control.Misclassification can the divide into several classes and is represented as probability usually.For example, P (D|G) can refer to the probability of the DTX classification when having sent frame, and P (D|E) is meant the probability of the DTX classification when sending bad frame (deletion), and P (E|D) is meant the probability of deletion classification when the DTX state exists.In common system, P (D|E) is higher relatively, almost reaches 0.85, just has 85% probability that delete frame is categorized as the DTX state mistakenly.Should be pointed out that because data may lose thereby cause to comprise a large amount of problems of RLP fracture, therefore relevant with P (D|E) misclassification produces very disadvantageous consequence for the operation of RAN.Operations according to the instant invention shown P (D|E) has been reduced to negligible level, and the probability that delete frame is categorized as mistakenly the DTX frame is from 0.0 to 0.01 or 1%, and seldom or can not cause the increase of P (E|D).
For the operation of understanding example frame classification better and the advantage that is obtained, Figure 30 0 of Fig. 3 is described.Exemplary transmitter section 210 can be to access terminal etc. or the transmitter section of base station terminal etc., and it is configured to data are sent to for example above-mentioned receiver section 220 that accesses terminal etc. during RAN inserts session.Here, channel 230 is shown as FCH/DCCH channel described above, and this channel 230 can transmit regular traffic or signal in frame 304 and 305.Here, channel 231 also is shown as auxiliary channel described above (SCH), and for example in frame 301, this channel 231 is sent to subsidiary communications on the channel 230 with high data rate.For illustration purposes, the span between transmitter 210 and the receiver 220 can be regarded as the corresponding time span with a plurality of frame periods represented by vertical line.As illustrated, for example the business of frame 305 just transmits on channel 230.At one time, frame 302 just transmits on channel 231.For example, if made the classification relevant with the DTX state, then the hatching of frame 302 partly illustrates the zone that misclassification may occur.More particularly, when near the emission state to channel 230 time domain of frame 305 carries out the branch time-like, owing to just therefore should obtain the TX state in transport service.Therefore, the cochannel principle of similitude discussed in more detail below, if the state of the frame on the channel 231 302 is categorized as the DTX state independently, owing to have inconsistency with classification in the high reliability channel of for example channel 230, therefore classification error takes place probably.According to various exemplary embodiments, according to the classification state of the frame 305 on channel 230 (cochannel), owing to locate transmitting the stronger possibility of data the blanking time on channel 231, so the state of frame 302 should be categorized as deletion again.To be appreciated that, when receiver is attempted to recover non-existent frame, the DTX frame will be categorized as the increase that the delete frame relevant with the TX state will cause transmit power level mistakenly.The transmitting power increase that is produced will cause the increase of cochannel interference and the inefficiency of power utilization.Classify situation again when above-mentioned when the operational efficiency aspect of exemplary RAN provides advantage from DTX to deletion, can use similar approach in the relevant situation so that further advantage to be provided.
If do not have business at channel 230, the frame classification that is produced will be DTX so, and this shows the transmission that does not have well afoot.On channel 231, if the state of frame 303 is categorized as for example deletion independently, owing to have inconsistency with classification in the high reliability channel of for example channel 230, therefore classification error takes place probably so.Therefore, according to various exemplary embodiments,, therefore frame 303 should be categorized as DTX again from deletion owing on channel 230 (cochannel), do not have data to be sent out.To be appreciated that, and be categorized as mistakenly and show do not have the DTX frame that transmits to control self adaptation and the correlation radio link protocol conformance causes serious problems power with appearing at delete frame on effective TX channel.
For example, with such as the relevant frame of the high capacity channel of SCH channel again the classification exemplary process as shown in Figure 4.Exemplary method 400 originates in 401, wherein handles high capacity channel independently and such as the low capacity channel of FCH.For example, at 402 places, determine classification for high capacity channel.In 403, storage and the relevant information of determining at 402 places of variable, described variable for example is SCH_TX/DTX, SCH_Rate and SCH_Quality.Notice that SCH_TX/DTX, SCH_Rate and SCH_Quality are meant auxiliary channel respectively, the TX/DTX state classification that is used for present frame is TX or DTX, scope as one of them frame rate of possible frame rate is from being up to minimum speed limit (for cdma2000, at full speed, partly, the frame of 1/4th or 1/8th speed all is possible), and the Quality variable is binary value, and it has represented frame or bad frame (deletion).Good frame and bad frame usually respectively expression exist to the high confidence level of frame with to the low confidence level of frame.Various algorithm known are used to make binary quality evaluation, and these algorithms usually consider to have deletion or the synthetic standards of bad frame or the result of channel error coding techniques, and this result shows that those error coded algorithms can not provide effective frame.Other attributes that can use some signal to noise ratio of common dependence or signal-to-jamming ratio or rely on above-mentioned decoding standard to estimate (energy of the every chip of Ec/Io=is divided by specified interference) provide credit rating.As above-mentioned proposition, quality can be regarded as the expression to the confidence level of the frame that is obtained by decoding.Therefore, very low or expression may approach zero to the confidence level of frame to the confidence level of frame for low-quality frame of deleted representation or expression.
Test to determine whether the frame classification variable SCH_TX/DTX on the high capacity channel represents the DTX classification 404.If not, then sentence common mode 405 immediately and carry out power control.If variable SCH_TX/DTX has represented the DTX classification really, then can classify again at 410 places.For example should be pointed out that if the cochannel parameter can be used, the classification again at 410 places can utilize one or more cochannel parameters with the form of the additional result in parallel processing path, described parallel processing path will be discussed at once hereinafter.At 406 places, can determine classification independently such as the low capacity channel of FCH.At 407 places, storage and the relevant information of determining at 406 places, that determine at 406 places for example is FCH_Rate, FCH_Quality and FCH_Content.Notice that these variablees or parameter are corresponding to primary channel and be similar to the above-mentioned variable of mentioning.Supplementary variable FCH_Content is illustrated in the content that FCH goes up the frame that occurs, and ordinary representation carrying or payload data or signaling data.Therefore be also noted that FCH is TX always, do not show the TX/DTX variable, yet if second or the low capacity channel be DCCH, variables D CCH_TX/DTX will be effectively.
Test the classification of whether representing full rate with the frame classification variable FCH_Rate on definite low capacity channel at 408 places.If like this, can for example be in the above-mentioned classification again and use rate information 410, the SCH_TX/DTX classification does not have the DTX that transmits to become TX and deletion from expression thus, and the data that its expression should be received originally are not received, and these data that for example should retransfer.If the FCH_Rate parameter is not a full rate, then carry out the control of FCH power immediately at 409 places.After on 409 place's high capacity channel and on 405 place's low capacity channels, classifying again, also carry out power control.
According to exemplary process as shown in Figure 5, can to classify again such as the relevant frame of the low capacity channel of FCH channel.Exemplary sorting technique again 500 originates in 501, as mentioned above, wherein high capacity channel and low capacity channel such as SCH is handled independently.For example, at 502 places, determine classification for high capacity channel.In 503, the information relevant with the variable of determining at 502 places to be stored, described variable is SCH_TX/DTX, SCH_Rate and SCH_Quality.Test to determine whether the frame classification variable SCH_TX/DTX on high capacity channel represents the classification of TX and the classification whether SCH_Quality represents GOOD at 504 places.If not, then sentence common mode 505 immediately and carry out power control.If variable SCH_TX/DTX has represented the classification of TX and the classification that SCH_Quality has represented GOOD really, then can classify again at 510 places of low capacity channel.For example should be pointed out that except that the classification relevant with the low capacity channel, the classification again at 510 places can utilize described one or more cochannel parameter, this will be described hereinafter.At 506 places, can determine the classification of low capacity channel independently.At 507 places, the information relevant with the FCH_Rate, the FCH_Quality that determine at 506 places and FCH_Content is stored.Test at 508 places to determine whether frame classification variable FCH_Rate on the low capacity channel represents the classification whether classification and FCH_Quality less than full rate represent BAD.If like this, can be used in the classification again at 510 places from the information of high capacity channel, the FCH_Rate classification becomes full rate from the value less than full rate thus.If the FCH_Rate parameter is full rate and FCH_Quality is GOOD, then carry out the control of FCH power immediately at 509 places.As mentioned above, after on 509 place's high capacity channel and on 505 place's low capacity channels, classifying again, also carry out power control.
According to various alternate exemplary embodiment, as Fig. 6 shown in more preferably, according to the classification of low capacity, high reliability cochannel, specifically with reference to the classification again of high capacity channel, can with optionally again sort program join in the basic test.Exemplary method 600 originates in 601, wherein independently the frame relevant with the low capacity channel with high power capacity is classified with 608 places 602.As mentioned above, can generate the value that these variablees are distributed in relevant variable of various classification and generation, this value for example is illustrated in the existing classification of the received frame on the particular channel.Those skilled in the art will be appreciated that, in the time of main concern present frame classification value, also can keep historical frame classification data and will use when judging according to the present invention.Therefore, for example on exemplary high capacity channel (for example SCH channel), can keep the value of variable SCH_TX/DTX, SCH_Rate and SCH_Quality at 603 places for present frame and previous frame.For exemplary low capacity channel,, can be the value of present frame retention frame classified variable FCH_Rate, FCH_Quality and FCH_Content at 609 places such as the FCH channel.
The explanation high capacity channel is tested at 604 places now, is used for determining whether the present frame classification is illustrated in the transmission that existence activates on the high capacity channel.Therefore, for example at 610 places, according to frame classification variable FCH_Rate is at least greater than the positive test result of the value of minimum transfer rate, if frame classification variable SCH_TX/DTX=DTX and at least the low capacity channel be judged as and transmit, then the present frame on 613 place's high capacity channel is categorized as TX again from DTX, and frame classification variable SCH_Quality is categorized as deletion more simultaneously.On the other hand, if SCH_TX/DTX=TX carries out another test so to determine the state of frame classification variable SCH_Rate at 605 places.If SCH_Rate=GoodFrame then carries out the power control on the high capacity channel at 607 places.If SCH_Rate is not equal to GoodFrame, then carry out another test to determine the state of frame classification variable SCH_Quality at 606 places.If SCH_Quality=BadFrame (deletion) then according to the information from the low capacity cochannel, can change the frame classification of described high capacity channel.If low capacity channel frame sorting result trends towards representing not exist the transmission of activation, then can be converted into DTX rather than deletion at 614 SCH_TX/DTX of place.If frame classification variable SCH_Quality does not represent BadFrame, then can on high capacity channel, carry out power control at 607 places.If in 614 classification of having carried out frame classification variable SCH_TX/DTX again, then can be in and carry out power control on high power capacity and the low capacity channel, and program can finish up to next frame is classified 616 607 and 615.
How this specification be used for explaining according to the invention process and utilize various embodiment, and be not in order to limit real, expectation and reasonably protection range and spirit thereof of the present invention.Above-mentioned specification is not that attempt limits the invention to disclosed clear and definite form.Can make remodeling or modification according to above-mentioned instruction.Embodiment (a plurality of embodiment) selected and that describe is used to provide the best illustration to principle of the present invention and practical application thereof, and is used to make those skilled in the art to utilize the present invention according to the various embodiment desired, that be suitable for special-purpose and the mode of various remodeling.When by reasonable, the legal and scope of giving equitably these remodeling and modification being made an explanation according to these remodeling and modification; remodeling that all are such and modification all fall into protection scope of the present invention, protection scope of the present invention by appending claims and have the purpose of applying for a patent during modification and the equivalent thereof done determined.
