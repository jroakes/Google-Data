- Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to a computing system that can be used to suggest travel routes to a user partly on the basis of a set of criteria associated with the user's familiarity with the travel routes between a set of locations.
- the disclosed technology can be used to generate suggested travel routes to a user selected destination based on a user's familiarity with previously traveled routes and the similarity of a suggested route to a previously traveled route.
- the disclosed technology can provide a user with helpful indications including whether a suggested route is likely to be familiar to the user and the similarity of a suggested route to a previously traveled route.
- the disclosed technology can use the current location of a user (e.g., a user associated with a navigation device which can include a smartphone or an in-vehicle navigation system) to determine a set of routes to a destination requested by a user.
- the set of routes may be constrained by distance and/or the time required to travel the set of routes. For example, when the shortest route to a destination is twenty (20) kilometers the set of routes may be constrained to a distance of no more than fifty percent (50%) longer than the shortest route (e.g., thirty (30) kilometers). In this way, excessively long but familiar routes may be eliminated from the outset.
- a user's amount of familiarity with the set of routes can then be determined on the basis of the user's familiarity with previously traveled routes and the similarity of the set of routes to the previously traveled routes. For example, certain routes may be more familiar to a user based on the frequency of the user previously traveling similar routes, the recency of the user traveling similar routes, and the similarity of features of a current route to features of previously traveled routes. For example, a user that is a long-haul trucker may be more familiar with routes involving extensive highway travel. Further, the set of routes that are familiar can be compared to the previously traveled routes to determine the similarity between the set of routes and the previously traveled routes.
- Suggested routes can then be determined on the basis of the set of routes that satisfy a set of criteria associated with the familiarity and similarity of the set of routes.
- the suggested routes may include the set of routes that include the greatest portion of the total travel distance that is the same as the previously traveled routes or that include the greatest portion of the total travel distance that is of the same type (e.g., highway travel) that is the same as the previously traveled routes.
- the computing system can access data which can include route data.
- the route data can include information associated with a starting location and/or a destination.
- the route data can include a latitude, longitude, and/or altitude associated with one or more locations including the starting location and/or the destination.
- the route data can include information associated with one or more maps of a geographic area that includes the starting location and/or the destination.
- the route data can include a map of a city that includes one or more locations of one or more roads (e.g., streets, highways, cycle paths, and/or foot paths), bodies of water (e.g., lakes, rivers, and/or ponds), waterways (e.g., canals), buildings (e.g., office buildings, residential buildings, and/or houses), bridges, tunnels, overpasses, and/or underpasses.
- the route data can include information associated with traffic regulations (e.g., speed limits in a region) and/or traffic flow patterns (e.g., the direction and/or amount of pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic in a geographic area).
- the computing system can determine one or more routes from a starting location (e.g., the current location of a user) to a destination (e.g., a location selected by the user to which the user would like to travel).
- the one or more routes from the starting location to the destination can be determined based at least in part on the route data. For example, one or more routes between the starting location and the destination can be determined by accessing the route data and determining one or more roads that connect the starting location and the destination.
- the one or more time constraints can include a threshold travel time (e.g., a maximum travel time) for the user to travel each of the one or more routes.
- a threshold travel time e.g., a maximum travel time
- the maximum time (travel time) can be one and a half (1.5) times the minimum estimated travel time between the starting location and the destination. If the estimated travel time between the starting location and the destination is thirty (30) minutes, the one or more routes will not include a route with a travel time that is greater than forty-five (45) minutes duration.
- the computing system can determine, based at least in part on historical route data, one or more amounts of familiarity with one or more historical routes that were previously traveled by a user.
- the one or more amounts of familiarity can indicate an extent of familiarity, a degree of familiarity, and/or a level of familiarity.
- one or more amounts of familiarity can be substituted with and/or used interchangeably with the following terms: “an extent of familiarity” in which an extent of familiarity can be positively correlated with the one or more amounts of familiarity such that a greater extent of familiarity can correspond to a greater amount of familiarity; “one or more degrees of familiarity” in which a greater degree of familiarity can be positively correlated with a greater amount of familiarity such that a greater degree of familiarity can correspond to a greater amount of familiarity; and/or “one or more levels of familiarity” in which a level of familiarity can be positively correlated with the one or more amounts of familiarity such that a greater level of familiarity can correspond to a greater amount of familiarity.
- the one or more amounts of familiarity can be positively correlated with the extent to which a user is familiar with the one or more historical routes.
- the one or more amounts of familiarity can be based at least in part on the user's previous experience with the one or more historical routes including the user's experiences as an active traveler in navigating a historical route (e.g., the driver of a vehicle) and/or as a non-active traveler that traveled the historical route as the passenger of a vehicle (e.g., a train passenger, automobile passenger, or bus passenger).
- the historical route data can be strongly encrypted, anonymized (e.g., any personal information associated with the user's identity is either not collected or is deleted after being received), and maintained in a privacy enhancing way (e.g., stored on an encrypted storage component of a local device of the user).
- the one or more amounts of familiarity can be positively correlated with a frequency of the user traveling the one or more historical routes and/or a recency of the user traveling the one or more historical routes. For example, a historical route that a user has traveled one-hundred (100) times may be associated with a greater amount of familiarity than a historical route a user has traveled once. Further, a historical route that a user has traveled three (3) times in the past week may be associated with a greater amount of familiarity than a historical route that a user traveled once a year ago.
- the historical route data can include information associated with one or more historical routes that were previously traveled by the user including one or more locations that the user previously traveled, one or more identifiers associated with the one or locations (e.g., a street address and/or an informal location identifier such as “the office” or “home”), one or more features of the one or more locations (e.g., features associated with the appearance of a location), and/or a number of times that the user traveled to the one or more locations.
- the historical route data can include one or more frequency weights of the one or more historical routes. For example, the one or more historical routes that were more frequently traveled will have a greater frequency weight than the one or more historical routes that were less frequently traveled.
- the computing system can determine one or more similarities between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes. In some embodiments, the computing system can determine an extent or amount of similarity between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes. The one or more similarities and/or the amount of similarity can be based at least in part on the historical route data. For example, the computing system can access the historical route data and perform one or more comparisons of the one or more routes to the one or more historical routes. The one or more similarities or amount of similarity can be based at least in part on the number of ways or extent to which each of the one or more routes is similar to the one or more historical routes.
- the computing system can determine one or more similarities and/or an amount of similarity based on a variety of factors including: the one or more locations that are similar or common to the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes (e.g., a route and a historical route that share the same destination and pass by the same location midway through the route), one or more types of road that are similar or common to the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes (e.g., the user mostly drove on a highway on both a route and a historical route), and/or one or more modes of travel that are similar or common to the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes (e.g., the user rode a bicycle along both a route and a historical route).
- the one or more locations that are similar or common to the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes e.g., a route and a historical route that share the same destination and pass by the same location midway through the route
- one or more types of road that are similar or common to the one or more
- the similarity can be associated with a similarity value that ranges from zero (0) to one (1), with one indicating complete similarity (e.g., the route has the same one or more features as the historic route) and no similarity (e.g., the route does not share any of the one or more features of the historic route).
- determining one or more similarities and/or the amount of similarity between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes can include determining one or more features of the one or more routes that are similar to one or more features of the one or more historical routes.
- the computing system can access route data that includes one or more features of the one or more routes.
- the computing system can access historic route data that includes one or more features of the one or more historic routes. The computing system can then determine which of the one or more features of the one or more routes match and/or are similar to the one or more features of the one or more historic routes. A greater number of matching features and/or similar features between the one or more routes and the one or more historic routes can be positively correlated with a greater number of the one or more similarities and/or amount of similarity.
- the determination of the one or more features that match and/or are similar can be based at least in part on the use of one or more machine-learned models.
- the one or more machine-learned models can be configured and/or trained to receive input including the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes; perform one or more operations including analyzing the one or more features of the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes; and generate an output including the one or more similarities between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes.
- the one or more features of the one or more routes that are similar to one or more features of the one or more historical routes can include one or more visual features associated with one or more roads and/or one or more visual features associated with one or more areas that are visible from the one or more roads.
- the one or more visual features of the one or more historical routes can include one or more road markings (e.g., lane markings, cross walks, and/or parking lines), one or more buildings that are visible from the one or more historic routes, one or more landmarks that are visible from the one or more historic routes, and/or one or more natural features (e.g., mountain ranges, lakes, and/or rivers) that are visible from the one or more historic routes.
- the computing system can determine one or more suggested routes.
- the one or more suggested routes can be based at least in part on the one or more routes that satisfy one or more criteria associated with the one or more amounts of familiarity and the one or more similarities.
- the one or more criteria can include a threshold amount of familiarity (e.g., the one or more suggested routes exceed a threshold amount of familiarity), a threshold number of the one or more similarities between a route and each of the one or more historical routes, and/or a threshold amount of similarity between a route and each of the one or more historical routes.
- the one or more criteria can be based at least in part on one or more user preferences.
- the one or more user preferences can be determined based at least in part on user input (e.g., the user indicating that a high level of familiarity is weighted more heavily than a low travel time).
- the computing system can generate output based at least in part on the one or more suggested routes.
- the output can include one or more indications associated with the user traveling the one or more suggested routes.
- the computing system can generate output including a map of the geographic area including the starting location, the destination, and the one or more suggested routes between the starting location and the destination.
- the output can include a description of any of the one or more suggested routes.
- the output can include visual and/or auditory descriptions indicating “THIS SUGGESTED ROUTE PASSES BY YOUR OFFICE” and/or “THIS SUGGESTED ROUTE WILL PASS BY POINT PLEASANT PARK” that can be provided via a display device and/or an audio output device (e.g., loudspeakers).
- the computing system can determine a ranking of the one or more suggested routes.
- the ranking can be based at least in part on the one or more similarities between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes. For example, the one or more routes that are more similar to the one or more historical routes can be more highly ranked than the one or more routes that are less similar to the one or more historical routes.
- the computing system can present the one or more suggested routes in an order based at least in part on the ranking. For example, the computing system can generate a visual and/or auditory representation of the one or more suggested routes based on the ranking.
- a visual representation of the ranking of the one or more suggested routes can include a list including the names and/or addresses associated with the one or more suggested routes with the one or more routes that are similar to the one or more historical routes closer to the top of the list and the one or more suggested routes that are less similar to the one or more historical routes closer to the bottom of the list.
- the one or more suggested routes can be arranged in different ways including the most similar suggested route on the left with less similar routes to the right of the most similar suggested route, and/or the most similar suggested route at the bottom with less similar routes on above the most similar suggested route.
- the ordering of the one or more suggested routes can be based at least in part on a combination of factors and/or criteria including the respective amounts of familiarity, the respective distances, and/or the respective estimated travel times of the one or more suggested routes.
- the top ranked suggested route can be the suggested route that is the most familiar
- the second ranked suggested route can be the suggested route that is the shortest distance to the destination
- the third ranked suggested route can be the suggested route that has the shortest estimated time to arrive at the destination.
- the suggested route that is most similar to a historical route can be at the top of the list
- the route that is the second most similar to a historical route can be second in the list
- the suggested route that is least similar to a historical route can be at the bottom of the list.
- an auditory representation of the ranking of the one or more suggested routes can announce the suggested route that is most similar to a historical route first, with subsequent suggested routes announced in an order corresponding to their similarity to the one or more historical routes.
- a predetermined number of the one or more suggested routes with a threshold ranking can be emphasized.
- Emphasis of the one or more suggested routes that satisfy a threshold ranking can include emphasizing one or more visual properties of an indication associated with the one or more suggested routes that satisfy the threshold ranking.
- the one or more visual properties can include a particular color (e.g., unique color or a color that is different from the colors used for indications associated with other suggested routes that are not the highest ranked), a particular or distinctive text size, a particular or distinctive shape, and/or a particular or distinctive pattern.
- the suggested route with the highest ranking can be indicated in a unique color (e.g., the highest ranked route is highlighted in bright green), associated with a different style of font (e.g., bold font or italics for the highest ranked suggested route), and/or presented in a larger size (e.g., a larger font size for the highest ranked suggested route).
- a unique color e.g., the highest ranked route is highlighted in bright green
- a different style of font e.g., bold font or italics for the highest ranked suggested route
- a larger size e.g., a larger font size for the highest ranked suggested route
- the computing system can determine one or more types of road associated with the one or more suggested routes. The determination of the one or more types of road can be based at least in part on the historical route data. For example, the computing system can access the historical route data that includes information associated with one or more types of road that the user previously traveled. Further, the historical route data can include information associated with what amount and/or portion of each of the one or more historical routes comprises the one or more types of road.
- the one or more types of road can include a highway, an urban road, a suburban road, and/or a rural road.
- the computing system can determine, based at least in part on the historical route data, whether the one or more suggested roads include one or more types of road that the user is familiar with. For example, the computing system can access the historical route data that includes information associated with one or more types of road that the user previously traveled. Further, the historical route data can include information associated with what portions and/or amounts of each of the one or more historical routes comprises the one or more types of road. The computing system can then determine whether the user is familiar with the one or more road types based at least in part on the frequency and/or the recency with which the user traveled on the one or more road types. For example, a threshold for familiarity with a road type can be thirty-five percent (35%) of total distance or total time spent on a particular type of road.
- the threshold for familiarity can include an absolute amount of time.
- the threshold for familiarity can include a threshold number of hours traveled in a time period (e.g., the number of hours traveled in a week, month, or year) and/or a threshold amount of distance traveled in a time period (e.g., a threshold number of kilometers traveled in the past week, month, or year).
- the computing system can then generate one or more indications of the one or more suggested routes that use the one or more types of road that are the same as the one or more types of road that the user is familiar with.
- the computing system can include a notification indicating the type of road (e.g., highway) next to the one or more suggested routes for which the user is familiar with that type of road.
- the indication of the type of road type may indicate to the user the types of road with which the user is familiar, thereby assisting the user in the process of selecting a suggested route.

Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to the generation of routes for navigation. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to generating routes based on a determination of user familiarity with potential routes.
- Operations associated with the state of a geographic area can be implemented on a variety of computing devices. These operations can include processing data associated with the geographic area for later access and use by a user or computing system. Further, the operations can include exchanging data with remote computing systems. However, the types of operations that are performed and the way in which the operations are performed can vary over time, as can the underlying hardware that implements the operations. It is often the case that processing and/or exchanging data associated with the geographic area can be repeated for the same geographic area or route at each new user request, thereby causing unnecessary processing and/or transmission of data. Accordingly, there are different ways to leverage computing resources associated with the state of a geographic area.

- Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to a computing system that can be used to suggest travel routes to a user partly on the basis of a set of criteria associated with the user's familiarity with the travel routes between a set of locations. In particular, the disclosed technology can be used to generate suggested travel routes to a user selected destination based on a user's familiarity with previously traveled routes and the similarity of a suggested route to a previously traveled route. Further, the disclosed technology can provide a user with helpful indications including whether a suggested route is likely to be familiar to the user and the similarity of a suggested route to a previously traveled route.
- For example, a suggested route can be provided to the driver of a vehicle based on the user having previously traveled certain portions of the route in the past. Further, the suggested routes can be based in part on a user's familiarity with types of routes that share features other than common locations. For example, a user that travels extensively on highways may be determined to be more familiar with new routes that traverse other highways that the user had not previously traveled. As such, the disclosed technology can improve the user's sense of comfort and safety by providing the user with suggested routes that are more likely to be familiar to the user. Further, the user's familiarity with a route allows the user to travel efficiently, without the excessive expenditure of time or energy that may result from navigation of an unfamiliar route.
- The disclosed technology can be implemented in a computing system (e.g., a navigation computing system) that is configured to access data, perform operations on the data (e.g., determine suggested routes), and generate output including the suggested travel routes. Further, the computing system can leverage one or more machine-learned models that have been configured to generate output including suggested routes that are more likely to be familiar to a user. The computing system can be included in a vehicle (e.g., an in-vehicle navigation system) or as part of a system that includes a server that receives data associated with a starting location (e.g., a user's current location) and a destination from a client device (e.g., a smart phone), performs operations based on the data and sends output including suggested routes back to the client device, which can be configured to display the suggested routes to a user and receive user feedback regarding the user's familiarity with the suggested routes.
- By way of example, the disclosed technology can use the current location of a user (e.g., a user associated with a navigation device which can include a smartphone or an in-vehicle navigation system) to determine a set of routes to a destination requested by a user. Further, the set of routes may be constrained by distance and/or the time required to travel the set of routes. For example, when the shortest route to a destination is twenty (20) kilometers the set of routes may be constrained to a distance of no more than fifty percent (50%) longer than the shortest route (e.g., thirty (30) kilometers). In this way, excessively long but familiar routes may be eliminated from the outset.
- A user's amount of familiarity with the set of routes can then be determined on the basis of the user's familiarity with previously traveled routes and the similarity of the set of routes to the previously traveled routes. For example, certain routes may be more familiar to a user based on the frequency of the user previously traveling similar routes, the recency of the user traveling similar routes, and the similarity of features of a current route to features of previously traveled routes. For example, a user that is a long-haul trucker may be more familiar with routes involving extensive highway travel. Further, the set of routes that are familiar can be compared to the previously traveled routes to determine the similarity between the set of routes and the previously traveled routes. Suggested routes can then be determined on the basis of the set of routes that satisfy a set of criteria associated with the familiarity and similarity of the set of routes. For example, the suggested routes may include the set of routes that include the greatest portion of the total travel distance that is the same as the previously traveled routes or that include the greatest portion of the total travel distance that is of the same type (e.g., highway travel) that is the same as the previously traveled routes.
- An output can then be generated (e.g., displayed on a user interface presented to the user) and the user can select one of the suggested routes. The output can include indications that let a user know how familiar a suggested route is likely to be or whether a suggested route is similar to a route that was previously traveled by the user. For example, a suggested route may be described as “SIMILAR TO YOUR COMMUTE FROM HOME TO YOUR OFFICE” or “THE KIND OF ROUTE THAT YOU HAVE TRAVELED IN THE PAST.” Furthermore, the computing system can receive user feedback including the suggested routes that were selected by the user. The user selected routes can be included as part of historical route data that can be adjusted on the basis of the user's selections. As such, the disclosed technology can provide more effective suggested routes based on a determination of the likely familiarity of those routes to a user.
- Accordingly, the disclosed technology can improve the user experience by providing the user with suggested routes that can be constrained based on the determined familiarity of the routes to the user. Further, the disclosed technology can assist a user in more effectively performing the technical task of using suggested routes as a way to facilitate navigation from one location to another by means of a continued and/or guided human-machine interaction process.
- The computing system can access data which can include route data. The route data can include information associated with a starting location and/or a destination. For example, the route data can include a latitude, longitude, and/or altitude associated with one or more locations including the starting location and/or the destination. Further, the route data can include information associated with one or more maps of a geographic area that includes the starting location and/or the destination. For example, the route data can include a map of a city that includes one or more locations of one or more roads (e.g., streets, highways, cycle paths, and/or foot paths), bodies of water (e.g., lakes, rivers, and/or ponds), waterways (e.g., canals), buildings (e.g., office buildings, residential buildings, and/or houses), bridges, tunnels, overpasses, and/or underpasses. Further, the route data can include information associated with traffic regulations (e.g., speed limits in a region) and/or traffic flow patterns (e.g., the direction and/or amount of pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic in a geographic area).
- The computing system can determine one or more routes from a starting location (e.g., the current location of a user) to a destination (e.g., a location selected by the user to which the user would like to travel). The one or more routes from the starting location to the destination can be determined based at least in part on the route data. For example, one or more routes between the starting location and the destination can be determined by accessing the route data and determining one or more roads that connect the starting location and the destination.
- In some embodiments, the one or more routes that are determined can include the one or more routes that satisfy one or more travel criteria. The one or more travel criteria can include one or more distance constraints and/or one or more time constraints. The one or more distance constraints can include a threshold distance (e.g., a maximum distance) associated with the one or more routes. The maximum distance can be based at least in part on some multiplier of the minimum distance between the starting location and the destination (e.g., a minimum distance along one or more roads or a shortest straight distance between the starting location and the destination). For example, the maximum distance can be one and a half (1.5) times the minimum driving distance between the starting location and the destination. If the driving distance between the starting location and the destination is twenty (20) kilometers, the one or more routes will not include a route that is greater than thirty (30) kilometers long.
- Further, the one or more time constraints can include a threshold travel time (e.g., a maximum travel time) for the user to travel each of the one or more routes. For example, the maximum time (travel time) can be one and a half (1.5) times the minimum estimated travel time between the starting location and the destination. If the estimated travel time between the starting location and the destination is thirty (30) minutes, the one or more routes will not include a route with a travel time that is greater than forty-five (45) minutes duration.
- The computing system can determine, based at least in part on historical route data, one or more amounts of familiarity with one or more historical routes that were previously traveled by a user. As used herein, the one or more amounts of familiarity can indicate an extent of familiarity, a degree of familiarity, and/or a level of familiarity. Further, the term “one or more amounts of familiarity” can be substituted with and/or used interchangeably with the following terms: “an extent of familiarity” in which an extent of familiarity can be positively correlated with the one or more amounts of familiarity such that a greater extent of familiarity can correspond to a greater amount of familiarity; “one or more degrees of familiarity” in which a greater degree of familiarity can be positively correlated with a greater amount of familiarity such that a greater degree of familiarity can correspond to a greater amount of familiarity; and/or “one or more levels of familiarity” in which a level of familiarity can be positively correlated with the one or more amounts of familiarity such that a greater level of familiarity can correspond to a greater amount of familiarity.
- The one or more amounts of familiarity can be positively correlated with the extent to which a user is familiar with the one or more historical routes. The one or more amounts of familiarity can be based at least in part on the user's previous experience with the one or more historical routes including the user's experiences as an active traveler in navigating a historical route (e.g., the driver of a vehicle) and/or as a non-active traveler that traveled the historical route as the passenger of a vehicle (e.g., a train passenger, automobile passenger, or bus passenger).
- The historical route data can be strongly encrypted, anonymized (e.g., any personal information associated with the user's identity is either not collected or is deleted after being received), and maintained in a privacy enhancing way (e.g., stored on an encrypted storage component of a local device of the user).
- Furthermore, the one or more amounts of familiarity can be positively correlated with a frequency of the user traveling the one or more historical routes and/or a recency of the user traveling the one or more historical routes. For example, a historical route that a user has traveled one-hundred (100) times may be associated with a greater amount of familiarity than a historical route a user has traveled once. Further, a historical route that a user has traveled three (3) times in the past week may be associated with a greater amount of familiarity than a historical route that a user traveled once a year ago.
- The historical route data can include information associated with one or more historical routes that were previously traveled by the user including one or more locations that the user previously traveled, one or more identifiers associated with the one or locations (e.g., a street address and/or an informal location identifier such as “the office” or “home”), one or more features of the one or more locations (e.g., features associated with the appearance of a location), and/or a number of times that the user traveled to the one or more locations. In some embodiments, the historical route data can include one or more frequency weights of the one or more historical routes. For example, the one or more historical routes that were more frequently traveled will have a greater frequency weight than the one or more historical routes that were less frequently traveled.
- The computing system can determine one or more similarities between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes. In some embodiments, the computing system can determine an extent or amount of similarity between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes. The one or more similarities and/or the amount of similarity can be based at least in part on the historical route data. For example, the computing system can access the historical route data and perform one or more comparisons of the one or more routes to the one or more historical routes. The one or more similarities or amount of similarity can be based at least in part on the number of ways or extent to which each of the one or more routes is similar to the one or more historical routes. By way of further example, the amount of similarity can be based at least in part on one or more similarity scores that are determined on the basis of the similarity of one or more features of the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes. Higher similarity scores can be associated with a greater amount of similarity.
- Further, the computing system can determine one or more similarities and/or an amount of similarity based on a variety of factors including: the one or more locations that are similar or common to the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes (e.g., a route and a historical route that share the same destination and pass by the same location midway through the route), one or more types of road that are similar or common to the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes (e.g., the user mostly drove on a highway on both a route and a historical route), and/or one or more modes of travel that are similar or common to the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes (e.g., the user rode a bicycle along both a route and a historical route).
- The computing system can determine the one or more similarities between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes based at least in part on one or more machine-learned models. The one or more machine-learned models can be configured and/or trained to determine the one or more similarities between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes. In some embodiments, the one or more machine-learned models can be used to optimize the historical route data. In particular, the one or more machine-learned models can optimize the historical route data to include the one or more historical routes that are determined to be more likely to be useful in the determination of a user's familiarity with a newly proposed route. For example, the one or more machine-learned models can cluster together the one or more routes that are determined to be more useful in the determination of a user's familiarity with a newly proposed route. Further, various clustering techniques including K-Means clustering can be used.
- In some embodiments, the one or more similarities between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes can be determined based at least in part on providing an input including information and/or data associated with at least one of the one or more routes and at least one of the one or more historical routes. The information and/or data associated with the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes can include one or more images (e.g., a set of geotagged street-level images of the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes) and/or maps of the geographic area (e.g., the geographic area including the starting location and the destination) that can be provided as input to one or more machine-learned models. Further, the information and/or data associated with the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes can include street-related metadata (e.g., locations of traffic signals, locations of traffic signs), traffic behavior at one or more locations, traffic flow along one or more routes, and/or lane width along the one or more routes. The one or more machine-learned models can be configured and/or trained to detect, identify, and/or recognize one or more features depicted in the images and determine one or more similarities between at least one of the one or more routes and at least one of the one or more historic routes. For example, the similarity can be associated with a similarity value that ranges from zero (0) to one (1), with one indicating complete similarity (e.g., the route has the same one or more features as the historic route) and no similarity (e.g., the route does not share any of the one or more features of the historic route).
- In some embodiments, determining one or more similarities and/or the amount of similarity between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes can include determining one or more features of the one or more routes that are similar to one or more features of the one or more historical routes. For example, the computing system can access route data that includes one or more features of the one or more routes. Further, the computing system can access historic route data that includes one or more features of the one or more historic routes. The computing system can then determine which of the one or more features of the one or more routes match and/or are similar to the one or more features of the one or more historic routes. A greater number of matching features and/or similar features between the one or more routes and the one or more historic routes can be positively correlated with a greater number of the one or more similarities and/or amount of similarity.
- In some embodiments, the determination of the one or more features that match and/or are similar can be based at least in part on the use of one or more machine-learned models. The one or more machine-learned models can be configured and/or trained to receive input including the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes; perform one or more operations including analyzing the one or more features of the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes; and generate an output including the one or more similarities between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes.
- In some embodiments, the one or more features of the one or more routes that are similar to one or more features of the one or more historical routes can include one or more visual features associated with one or more roads and/or one or more visual features associated with one or more areas that are visible from the one or more roads. For example, the one or more visual features of the one or more historical routes can include one or more road markings (e.g., lane markings, cross walks, and/or parking lines), one or more buildings that are visible from the one or more historic routes, one or more landmarks that are visible from the one or more historic routes, and/or one or more natural features (e.g., mountain ranges, lakes, and/or rivers) that are visible from the one or more historic routes.
- The computing system can determine one or more suggested routes. The one or more suggested routes can be based at least in part on the one or more routes that satisfy one or more criteria associated with the one or more amounts of familiarity and the one or more similarities. The one or more criteria can include a threshold amount of familiarity (e.g., the one or more suggested routes exceed a threshold amount of familiarity), a threshold number of the one or more similarities between a route and each of the one or more historical routes, and/or a threshold amount of similarity between a route and each of the one or more historical routes. In some embodiments, the one or more criteria can be based at least in part on one or more user preferences. The one or more user preferences can be determined based at least in part on user input (e.g., the user indicating that a high level of familiarity is weighted more heavily than a low travel time).
- The computing system can generate output based at least in part on the one or more suggested routes. The output can include one or more indications associated with the user traveling the one or more suggested routes. For example, the computing system can generate output including a map of the geographic area including the starting location, the destination, and the one or more suggested routes between the starting location and the destination. Further, the output can include a description of any of the one or more suggested routes. For example, the output can include visual and/or auditory descriptions indicating “THIS SUGGESTED ROUTE PASSES BY YOUR OFFICE” and/or “THIS SUGGESTED ROUTE WILL PASS BY POINT PLEASANT PARK” that can be provided via a display device and/or an audio output device (e.g., loudspeakers).
- The computing system can determine a ranking of the one or more suggested routes. The ranking can be based at least in part on the one or more similarities between the one or more routes and the one or more historical routes. For example, the one or more routes that are more similar to the one or more historical routes can be more highly ranked than the one or more routes that are less similar to the one or more historical routes.
- The computing system can present the one or more suggested routes in an order based at least in part on the ranking. For example, the computing system can generate a visual and/or auditory representation of the one or more suggested routes based on the ranking. A visual representation of the ranking of the one or more suggested routes can include a list including the names and/or addresses associated with the one or more suggested routes with the one or more routes that are similar to the one or more historical routes closer to the top of the list and the one or more suggested routes that are less similar to the one or more historical routes closer to the bottom of the list. In other embodiments, the one or more suggested routes can be arranged in different ways including the most similar suggested route on the left with less similar routes to the right of the most similar suggested route, and/or the most similar suggested route at the bottom with less similar routes on above the most similar suggested route.
- Further, the ordering of the one or more suggested routes can be based at least in part on a combination of factors and/or criteria including the respective amounts of familiarity, the respective distances, and/or the respective estimated travel times of the one or more suggested routes. For example, the top ranked suggested route can be the suggested route that is the most familiar, the second ranked suggested route can be the suggested route that is the shortest distance to the destination, and the third ranked suggested route can be the suggested route that has the shortest estimated time to arrive at the destination. For example, the suggested route that is most similar to a historical route can be at the top of the list, the route that is the second most similar to a historical route can be second in the list, and the suggested route that is least similar to a historical route can be at the bottom of the list. By way of further example, an auditory representation of the ranking of the one or more suggested routes can announce the suggested route that is most similar to a historical route first, with subsequent suggested routes announced in an order corresponding to their similarity to the one or more historical routes.
- In some embodiments, a predetermined number of the one or more suggested routes with a threshold ranking (e.g., the suggested route with the highest ranking) can be emphasized. Emphasis of the one or more suggested routes that satisfy a threshold ranking can include emphasizing one or more visual properties of an indication associated with the one or more suggested routes that satisfy the threshold ranking. The one or more visual properties can include a particular color (e.g., unique color or a color that is different from the colors used for indications associated with other suggested routes that are not the highest ranked), a particular or distinctive text size, a particular or distinctive shape, and/or a particular or distinctive pattern. For example, the suggested route with the highest ranking can be indicated in a unique color (e.g., the highest ranked route is highlighted in bright green), associated with a different style of font (e.g., bold font or italics for the highest ranked suggested route), and/or presented in a larger size (e.g., a larger font size for the highest ranked suggested route).
- The computing system can determine one or more types of road associated with the one or more suggested routes. The determination of the one or more types of road can be based at least in part on the historical route data. For example, the computing system can access the historical route data that includes information associated with one or more types of road that the user previously traveled. Further, the historical route data can include information associated with what amount and/or portion of each of the one or more historical routes comprises the one or more types of road. The one or more types of road can include a highway, an urban road, a suburban road, and/or a rural road.
- The computing system can determine, based at least in part on the historical route data, whether the one or more suggested roads include one or more types of road that the user is familiar with. For example, the computing system can access the historical route data that includes information associated with one or more types of road that the user previously traveled. Further, the historical route data can include information associated with what portions and/or amounts of each of the one or more historical routes comprises the one or more types of road. The computing system can then determine whether the user is familiar with the one or more road types based at least in part on the frequency and/or the recency with which the user traveled on the one or more road types. For example, a threshold for familiarity with a road type can be thirty-five percent (35%) of total distance or total time spent on a particular type of road. As such, a user (e.g., a long distance truck driver) that spent ninety-five percent (95%) of their time traveling on highways can be determined to be familiar with highways. In some embodiments, the threshold for familiarity can include an absolute amount of time. For example, the threshold for familiarity can include a threshold number of hours traveled in a time period (e.g., the number of hours traveled in a week, month, or year) and/or a threshold amount of distance traveled in a time period (e.g., a threshold number of kilometers traveled in the past week, month, or year).
- The computing system can then generate one or more indications of the one or more suggested routes that use the one or more types of road that are the same as the one or more types of road that the user is familiar with. For example, the computing system can include a notification indicating the type of road (e.g., highway) next to the one or more suggested routes for which the user is familiar with that type of road. As such, the indication of the type of road type may indicate to the user the types of road with which the user is familiar, thereby assisting the user in the process of selecting a suggested route.
- The computing system can determine the one or more suggested routes that the user previously traveled. The one or more suggested routes that the user previously traveled can include one or more historical routes that the user traveled as an active traveler (e.g., the passenger of a vehicle) and/or one or more historical routes that the user traveled as a non-active traveler (e.g., a passenger). The computing system can then determine the one or more suggested routes that match a predetermined portion of the one or more historical routes (e.g., a suggested route matches at least half (50%) of a historical route). For example, the historical route data can include information associated with the user's role and/or status during a trip along a route. In particular, the historical route data can include an indication of whether the user was an active traveler and/or a non-active traveler of a historical route.
- The computing system can generate one or more indications of the one or more suggested routes that the user previously traveled. For example, the computing system can generate one or more indications including a list of the one or more suggested routes that includes one or more suggested routes that were previously traveled in a first color (e.g., green) and the one or more suggested routes that were not previously traveled routes in a different second color (e.g., red). Further, the computing system can generate one or more indications including a portion of a suggested route that the user previously traveled. For example, the computing system can indicate that “YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY TRAVELED HALF OF THE SUGGESTED ROUTE” and/or “HALF OF THE SUGGESTED ROUTE IS FAMILIAR TO YOU.” By way of further example, the computing system can generate one or more indications including text stating “YOU TRAVELED THIS ROUTE ON A PREVIOUS OCCASION” in order to notify a user that one or more suggested routes were previously traveled.
- In some embodiments, the one or more indications of the one or more suggested routes that the user previously traveled can include one or more images of one or more locations that the user was able to view previously (e.g., view while traveling the one or more historical routes) that are visible from the one or more suggested routes. For example, the one or more images can include an image of a recognizable landmark (e.g., a famous historical building) and/or personally recognizable location (e.g., a user's office building) that is visible from a suggested route.
- The computing system can determine one or more suggested routes that include one or more locations that the user has traveled to and/or passed by more than a threshold number of times. For example, the threshold number of times can be three (3) and the one or more suggested routes with one or more locations that the user has traveled to and/or traveled by can be more than three (3) times. Determination of the one or more suggested routes that include one or more locations that the user has traveled to and/or passed by more than a threshold number of times can include a determination of the one or more locations associated with each of the one or more suggested routes that are common to, shared with, or present in one or more portions of the one or more historical routes. The computing system can then compare the one or more locations of a suggested route to each of the one or more historical routes that shares some threshold number of locations (e.g., at least one location in common or three (3) locations in common). The computing system can then determine the one or more suggested routes that include one or more locations that the user has traveled to and/or passed by more than the threshold number of times.
- In some embodiments, the threshold number of times can vary based at least in part on the user. For example, the threshold number of times can be greater for a user that tends not to be familiar with a route until the route is traveled many times (e.g., the user is not familiar with a route until the user has traveled the route ten (10) times). Further, the threshold number of times can be lower for a user that tends to become familiar with a route after traveling the route a single time or a small number of times (e.g., the user is familiar with a route after traveling a route twice).
- The computing system can then generate one or more indications of the one or more locations that the user has traveled to more than the threshold number of times. For example, the one or more indications can include text stating “YOU HAVE TRAVELED PAST THE SUGGESTED ROUTE THREE TIMES.” By way of further example, the one or more indications can include an audible indication that includes the announcement “YOU HAVE TRAVELED TO SEVERAL LOCATIONS IN THE SUGGESTED ROUTE ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION.”
- The computing system can determine one or more suggested routes that satisfy one or more similarity criteria and/or were traveled by the user in a direction that is different from a direction of travel of the one or more historical routes. Satisfying the one or more similarity criteria can include one or more locations along the one or more suggested routes being within a predetermined distance (e.g., fifteen meters) of one or more locations along the one or more historical routes. Further, the one or more similarity criteria can be satisfied if there are a predetermined number of the one or more locations that are common between the one or more suggested routes and the one or more historical routes.
- Furthermore, the computing system can access historical route data that includes one or more indications of the direction of travel along the one or more historical routes. In some embodiments, the direction of travel along the one or more historical routes can be used to determine the one or more amounts of familiarity with the one or more routes. For example, a suggested route that satisfies the one or more similarity criteria and is in the same direction of travel as the direction of travel that a user had used on a historic route can have an associated amount of familiarity that is greater than that of a suggested route that is in the opposite direction of travel as the direction of travel that a user had used on a historic route. For example, a user can be more familiar with a suggested route that returns from the destination to the starting location of a suggested route that was traveled earlier on the same day than a suggested route that returns to the starting location along an arbitrary different route.
- Further, the computing system can generate one or more indications of the one or more suggested routes that satisfy the one or more similarity criteria and were traveled by the user in a direction of travel that is different from the direction of travel of the one or more historical routes. For example, the computing system can indicate that the user had previously traveled on a suggested route in a different direction. Further, the computing system can indicate the date and/or time that the user traveled on the suggested route.
- The computing system can determine one or more modes of travel associated with the user and/or the one or more suggested routes. The one or more modes of travel can include foot travel, automobile travel, train travel, streetcar travel, bus travel, boat travel, airplane travel, and/or cycling. In some embodiments, the one or more modes of travel can adjust and/or modify the amount of familiarity associated with a route. For example, if a user that is going to use an automobile to travel to a destination had previously traveled a historical route by bicycle, the historical route can have an amount of familiarity to the user that is greater than if the user did not travel the route at all and lower than if the user had traveled the historical route by automobile. Accordingly, the amount of familiarity with a historical route can be associated with the one or more modes of travel that were used to travel the historical route. Further, the amount of familiarity with a historical route can be positively correlated with a similarity between a mode of travel that will be used to travel a route to a destination (e.g., a suggested route to a destination) and the mode of travel used to travel the historical route.
- In some embodiments, the one or more modes of travel can be determined based at least in part on user input (e.g., the user providing a mode of travel in response to a request for the user to provide the one or more modes of travel), and/or the vehicle, device, and/or application that the user is currently using (e.g., detecting the vehicle a user is in).
- The computing system can generate one or more indications of the one or more suggested routes that use a mode of travel that is the same as the mode of travel associated with the user. For example, the one or more indications can state “YOU CYCLED ON THE SUGGESTED ROUTE LAST WEEK” or “YOU WALKED ON THE SUGGESTED ROUTE A MONTH AGO” to notify the user how and/or when the user had previously traveled a suggested route in the past. Further, the one or more indications of the one or more suggested routes can include an indication of the starting location and/or destination that was used in a historical route that included the same starting location or destination. For example, the one or more indications can state “YOU WALKED TO THE GROCERY STORE ALONG THE SUGGESTED ROUTE.”
- In some embodiments, the one or more indications associated with traveling the one or more suggested routes can include one or more portions of the one or more suggested routes that overlap one or more portions of the one or more historical routes. For example, the computing system can generate a map of a region including the starting location and the destination. The map can include one or more indications in which the one or more portions of the one or more suggested routes that overlap one or more portions of the one or more historical routes are highlighted in a different color from the one or more portions of the one or more historical routes that are not overlapped by the one or more suggested routes.
- The computing system can generate a prompt requesting feedback comprising an amount of familiarity that the user has with at least one suggested route of the one or more suggested routes. For example, the computing system can generate a prompt on a display device. The prompt can include a request for the user to “PLEASE SELECT THE SUGGESTED ROUTES THAT APPEAR FAMILIAR TO YOU.” The user can then touch a touch screen device to indicate the one or more suggested routes that appear familiar to the user.
- In some embodiments, the computing system can determine when the user has arrived at the destination. When the user is determined to have arrived at the destination, a prompt requesting feedback from the user can be generated. The feedback requested from the user can include an amount of familiarity that the user has with the route that was traveled. For example, the computing system can use location data (e.g., location data including the current latitude and longitude of the computing system) and determine that the user has arrived at their destination when the latitude and longitude of the current location matches the latitude and longitude associated with the destination. The computing system can then generate a textual prompt on a display device. The textual prompt can ask the user “WAS THE ROUTE THAT WAS JUST TRAVELED FAMILIAR TO YOU?” or “PLEASE RATE THE FAMILIARITY OF THE ROUTE THAT WAS TRAVELED FROM 1 TO 10 (1 INDICATING THE LOWEST FAMILIARITY AND 10 INDICATING THE GREATEST FAMILIARITY).”
- The computing system can adjust the historical route data based at least in part on the feedback. For example, the historical route data can include one or more locations and/or routes that are respectively associated with one or more amounts of familiarity. Feedback indicating that a particular location and/or route is associated with a particular amount of familiarity can be used to adjust the one or more amounts of familiarity associated with the one or more locations and/or the one or more routes. For example, a route that a user had previously traveled that had not been recorded as part of the historical route data may be familiar to the user but may also be indicated in the historical route data as being unfamiliar to the user. Based on the user's feedback, the computing system can adjust the historical route data to indicate that the user is familiar with the route.
- In some embodiments, the output can include one or more indications of when each of the one or more suggested routes was recently (e.g., within a predetermined range of recency) or most recently traveled by the user. For example, the output can include a date and/or time at which the user most recently traveled each of the one or more suggested routes. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the output can include one or more indications of whether each of the one or more suggested routes was traveled as an active traveler (e.g., the driver of a vehicle) or as a non-active traveler (e.g., the passenger of a vehicle).
- The computing system can receive an input from a user. Further, the input can include a user selected route that is selected from the one or more suggested routes. For example, the computing system can include a touch screen display device that is configured to display one or more textual indications of the one or more suggested routes and receive one or more touch inputs from a passenger to select at least one of the one or more suggested routes as their preferred route to the destination.
- The computing system can generate one or more navigation directions and/or navigation instructions from the starting location to the destination along the user selected route. For example, the computing system can use the user selected route to determine the one or more roads and/or user accessible areas (e.g., parking lots, cycle paths, foot paths, and/or paved areas) between the starting location and the destination. The computing system can then determine one or more navigation directions including one or more indications of how the user should follow the user selected route. For example, the one or more navigation directions can include one or more locations to which the user can travel that will allow the user selected path to be followed in a safe manner (e.g., the user will travel the user selected route in a manner that abides with traffic regulations). In some embodiments, the one or more navigation directions can include turn-by-turn instructions that indicate how the user should follow the user selected path including instructions for when a user should turn (e.g., an instruction to turn left at the next intersection).
- Further, the one or more navigation directions can include one or more directions and/or one or more instructions that indicate how a vehicle should operate along the user selected route. For example, the one or more navigation directions can indicate a recommended velocity for a vehicle at one or more locations along the user selected route, one or more locations at which the vehicle should accelerate and/or decelerate, one or more locations at which the vehicle should turn, and/or one or more locations at which the vehicle should brake, and/or when the vehicle should signal (e.g., use vehicle signal lights to indicate a vehicle's future actions).
- The computing system can control operation of a vehicle based at least in part on the one or more navigation directions and/or the user selected route. Operation of the vehicle can include controlling where the vehicle travels including controlling navigation of the vehicle from the starting location to the destination along the user selected route and/or in accordance with the one or more navigation directions. For example, the computing system can control an autonomous vehicle's computing system that can safely direct the vehicle from the starting location to the destination along the user selected route.
- Further, controlling operation of the vehicle can include controlling one or more notification systems that can generate one or more notifications associated with the user selected route. For example, the one or more notifications can include an auditory acknowledgement of receipt of the user selected route (e.g., a synthetic voice or text indicating, “USER SELECTED ROUTE ACKNOWLEDGED. NAVIGATION TO THE DESTINATION WILL COMMENCE SHORTLY.”) and an auditory and/or visual indication associated with traveling to the user selected route (e.g., an estimated time of arrival at the destination and/or a distance remaining to the destination).
- The disclosed technology can include a computing system (e.g., a navigation computing system) that is configured to perform various operations associated with the generation of suggested routes. In some embodiments, the computing system can be associated with various computing systems and/or computing devices that use, send, receive, and/or generate suggested routes and/or indications associated with the suggested routes. Furthermore, the computing system can access, generate, process, modify, and/or communicate (e.g., send, and/or receive) data and/or information including data and/or information associated with suggested routes that can include maps of one or more geographic regions through which the suggested routes will pass.
- The computing system can include specialized hardware and/or software that enable the performance of one or more operations specific to the disclosed technology. The computing system can include one or more application specific integrated circuits that are configured to perform operations associated with determining a user's familiarity with previously traveled routes, determining the similarity of new routes to the previously traveled routes, determining suggested routes, and generating output that can allow a user to select a suggested route based on the user's familiarity. By way of example, the computing system can be configured to control one or more vehicle systems of a vehicle based at least in part on the user's selection of a suggested route. The one or more vehicle systems can include operational systems that are used to control operation of a vehicle and guide the vehicle to a destination along a suggested route that the user selected.
- Additionally, the computing system can be configured to generate data used to implement one or more indications associated with the suggested travel routes. The one or more indications can include one or more visual indications and/or one or more auditory indications associated with the suggested routes. For example, the computing system can generate one or more visual indications including a list of the suggested routes in which the shortest route and the route that is determined to be most familiar to the user are highlighted.
- The systems, methods, devices, apparatuses, and tangible non-transitory computer-readable media in the disclosed technology can provide a variety of technical effects and benefits including an improvement in the determination of routes to suggest to a user. In particular, the disclosed technology may assist a user (e.g. a user of a navigation device) in performing technical tasks by means of a continued and/or guided human-machine interaction process in which suggested routes are provided to a user on the basis of the user's familiarity with previously traveled routes and user feedback in response to queries regarding the familiarity of a traveled route. Furthermore, the disclosed technology may also provide additional benefits including better resource usage efficiency, a reduction in environmental impact, and improved safety.
- The disclosed technology can improve the efficiency of resource consumption (e.g., reduce energy used in processing by a computing system, reduce bandwidth utilization over a network, reduce fuel and electrical energy consumption by various devices). In particular, by generating output including suggested routes that a user is more likely to be familiar with, portions of historical routes and navigation directions for historical routes are more likely to be included in subsequent routes. As a result, since these portions of historical routes and navigation directions for historical routes have already been computed and/or received before by the computing system, the computational load on the one or more processors of the computing system and/or the amount of data that needs to be received from a server in order to generate subsequent routes are reduced. Therefore, the technology brings about reduced processing and/or bandwidth utilization. Additionally, generating output including suggested routes that a user is more likely to be familiar with, can save the user from energy consuming detours that may result from the user traveling an unfamiliar route. For example, the user traveling a familiar route can result in a reduction in the amount of energy (e.g., fuel and/or electric energy) associated with making course corrections due to user unfamiliarity.
- The disclosed technology can also be used to reduce the adverse environmental impact associated with frequent stops and course corrections that may occur when a route is unfamiliar to a user. For example, an amount of user familiarity with a route may be negatively correlated with the amount of vehicle exhaust (and thereby the amount of air pollution) associated with traveling along a travel route. The disclosed technology can thus be used to reduce the amount of pollution that is associated with travel.
- Further, the disclosed technology can provide the technical effect of improving the efficiency with which tasks that require a user to follow a route to perform the task. For example, delivery drivers may more efficiently follow navigational instructions that are associated with suggested routes that are more familiar to the driver, which can increase the likelihood that a timely delivery is made and reduce the incidence of down-time in which the driver examines unfamiliar navigational instructions. Further, the computing system associated with generating the suggested routes and navigational instructions can be continuously be updated in response to user feedback and/or learning of patterns and/or types of routes that are familiar and/or more likely to be familiar to a user. For example, one or more machine-learned models can be used to determine routes that include features (e.g., the primary type of road for a route and/or familiar landmarks) that are more familiar to a user. Further, the one or more machine-learned models can be continuously trained and/or updated in response to a user's use of the suggested routes and/or in response to direct feedback from the user.
- The disclosed technology can improve the safety of navigating a vehicle by suggesting routes that a user is more familiar with, thereby reducing the user's need to divert their attention from the familiar environment through which the user guides a vehicle. For example, the disclosed technology can suggest a route that includes a location that the user is familiar with (e.g., a restaurant the user regularly patronizes) as a midway point to a destination, followed by more specific instructions for portions of the suggested route that are less familiar to the user. In this way the user can operate a vehicle more safely by focusing more attention on driving the vehicle and less attention on receiving instructions. Therefore, the disclosed technology produces an effect which does not depend on psychological or subjective factors, but on physical and objective parameters based on human physiology.
- As such, the disclosed technology may assist the user of a navigation device in more effectively performing a variety of tasks with the specific benefits of reduced resource consumption, reduced environmental impact, and improved safety. Further, any of the specific benefits provided to users can be used to improve the effectiveness of a wide variety of devices and services including route determination devices and/or route determination services that provide navigational routes. Accordingly, the improvements offered by the disclosed technology can result in tangible benefits to a variety of devices and/or systems including mechanical, electronic, and computing systems associated with routing and/or providing routes for use in navigation.
- With reference now to the Figures, example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in further detail.
