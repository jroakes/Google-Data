Description
- The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/327,644 (Attorney Docket No. 0026-0194), entitled “Server Bookmarks” and filed Jan. 9, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- 1. Field of the Invention
- Implementations described herein relate generally to document browsing and, more particularly, to using bookmarks used for document browsing in ranking search results.
- 2. Description of Related Art
- The World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly.
- Search engines attempt to return hyperlinks to web pages in which a user is interested. Generally, search engines base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user. The goal of the search engine is to provide links to high quality, relevant results (e.g., web pages) to the user based on the search query. Typically, the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web pages. Web pages that contain the user's search terms are “hits” and are returned to the user as links. Each “hit” may be ranked by the search engine based on various factors, such as, for example, the relevance of the “hit” to the search query.
- “Bookmarks” or “favorites” are typical ways for a browser executed at a client to remember documents (e.g., web pages) that a user has visited when browsing documents located on a network, such as, for example, the Internet. For example, bookmarks or favorites may be used by a user to remember search results obtained from the execution of a search by a search engine. Bookmarks or favorites permit the user to return to the bookmarked document easily.
- According to one aspect, a method may include receiving bookmarks associated with one or more documents or sites and searching a corpus of documents to obtain search results. The method may further include ranking the search results using the received bookmarks.
- According to another aspect, a method may include receiving bookmarks associated with one or more documents or sites and receiving user input defining how or if the bookmarks are to effect search results. The method may further include searching a corpus of documents to obtain search results and ranking the search results using the bookmarks based on the user input.
- According to a further aspect, a method may include obtaining a user's bookmarks, wherein the bookmarks identify documents associated with the user and executing a search based on a first search query received from the user to obtain search results. The method may further include ranking the search results and re-ranking the search results using the user's bookmarks.
- The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate one or more embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, explain the invention. In the drawings,
-
FIG. 1 is an exemplary diagram of an overview of an implementation of the invention; -
FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a network in which systems and methods consistent with principles of the invention may be implemented; -
FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of a client or server ofFIG. 2 according to an implementation consistent with principles of the invention; -
FIG. 4 is a diagram of an exemplary toolbar that includes bookmarks of documents browsed or selected by a user consistent with principles of the invention; -
FIGS. 5-8 are diagrams of the use of the exemplary toolbar ofFIG. 4 for user specification of how and if bookmarks may be used in ranking search results consistent with principles of the invention; -
FIG. 9 is a diagram of exemplary bookmark records stored at a server consistent with principles of the invention; -
FIG. 10 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for ranking search results using user bookmarks consistent with principles of the invention; and -
FIG. 11 is a diagram illustrating the use of bookmarks in ranking search results consistent with principles of the invention. - The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.
- Consistent with aspects of the invention, documents selected or browsed by a user may be “bookmarked,” using the user's browser, such that the user can easily return to the bookmarked documents. The bookmarked documents may then be selectively used in ranking search results that result from a search query issued by the user. For each of a user's bookmarks, the user may specify how and if each document bookmark should be used when ranking the user's search results. Thus, in some implementations, documents corresponding to a user's bookmarks may be ranked higher within a set of search results than un-bookmarked documents in the set of search results.
- A “document,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may include, for example, an e-mail, a website, a business listing, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, a web advertisement, a digital map, etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page. Documents often include textual information and may include embedded information (such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as Javascript, etc.). A “link” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any reference to/from a document from/to another document or another part of the same document.

A user using atoolbar 105 at a client (not shown) may browse multiple different documents (not shown) via a browser and, among the browsed documents, may select one or more documents to be “bookmarked” for future access and browsing. Each of thedocument bookmarks 110 may be sent bytoolbar 105 to a remote server (not shown) for storage. The user may additionally specify how and if eachdocument bookmark 110 may be used when ranking search results. - The user may subsequently send a search query to the server to execute a search of a corpus of documents (e.g., web pages, images, products and/or services, music, videos). The server may execute the search, using existing document searching techniques, to return a set of search results. The set of search results may include documents that are relevant to the search query sent by the user. Using existing ranking techniques, the server may rank the search results to, for example, put them in order from “most” relevant to “least” relevant, thus, producing ranked
search results 115. The server may then access the user's stored bookmarks and, possibly, the user indications of how and if eachdocument bookmark 110 should be used when ranking search results. The server may usebookmarks 110, and the user indications of how and if eachdocument bookmark 110 should be used, in re-ranking the search results to produce re-rankedsearch results 120. The user'sbookmarks 110, thus, may be selectively used in promoting corresponding documents in rankedsearch results 115. -

FIG. 4 is a diagram that depicts anexemplary browser toolbar 105 at aclient 205. Among other features,toolbar 105 may include a “bookmark”button 410, the selection of which by a user atclient 205 may produce abookmark window 420. Bookmarkwindow 420 may include a list ofmultiple bookmarks 430 associated with the user. The user, when browsing a given document, may select “Bookmark this page . . . ” frombookmark window 420 to add the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the given document as one of thebookmarks 430 inbookmark window 420. A bookmarked document may contain any type of document, such as, for example, images, products and/or services, music items, video items, etc. Bookmarks contained in the list ofbookmarks 430 may be obtained by techniques other than the user browsing and “bookmarking” a respective document. Bookmarks contained in the list ofbookmarks 430 may be obtained by importation of bookmarks from another browser, or via sharing of bookmarks between users. Sharing and importation of bookmarks is disclosed in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 11/327,644 (Attorney Docket No. 0026-0194), entitled “Server Bookmarks.” -
FIGS. 5-8 are diagrams that depict the use ofbrowser toolbar 105 for specification of how and if a user's bookmarks may be used in ranking search results. As shown inFIG. 5 , each bookmark may include an associatedwindow 500 which permits the user to define how and if the selected bookmark will be used in ranking search results.FIG. 5 illustrates user selection of the option “Move to top of search results for all queries” 510 for bookmark_1 fromwindow 500. Selection of thisoption 510, as shown inFIG. 5 , by placement of a “check mark” next to it, directsserver 230 to promote bookmark_1 upwards within a set of ranked search results. -
FIG. 6 illustrates user selection of the option “Move to top of search results for selected queries” 600 for bookmark_1 fromwindow 500. Selection of thisoption 600, as shown inFIG. 6 by placement of a “check mark” next to it, in conjunction with user entry of a list of queries inwindow 610, directsserver 230 to promote bookmark_1 upwards within a set of ranked search results that result from execution of a search using a search query that matches the queries entered inwindow 610. Thus, using this option, only whensearch engine 235 ofserver 230 executes a search on a search query that is the same, or possibly similar, to a set of search queries selected by the user doessearch engine 235 promote the corresponding given bookmark upwards within the ranked search results. -
FIG. 7 illustrates user selection of the option “Move to top of search results all URLs from a same site” 700 for bookmark_1 fromwindow 500. Selection of thisoption 700, as shown inFIG. 7 by placement of a “check mark” next to it, directsserver 230 to promote bookmark_1, and all search results from a same site as bookmark_1, upwards within a set of ranked search results. Therefore, all documents hosted on the same site as bookmark_1 may be promoted within the search results.FIG. 8 illustrates user selection of the option “Do not use for re-ranking search results” 800 for bookmark_1 fromwindow 500. Selection of thisoption 800, as shown inFIG. 8 by placement of a “check mark” next to it, directsserver 230 to not promote bookmark_1 upwards within a set of ranked search results. - The user's specification of how and if a user's bookmarks may be used in ranking search results, as depicted above in
FIGS. 5-8 , may be sent fromtoolbar 105 toserver 230 for storage in memory. For example, the user's specification may be stored in association with the user's entries inbookmarks records 240, described further below. -
FIG. 9 illustratesexemplary bookmark records 240 consistent with principles of the invention. Bookmarkrecords 240 may include bookmarks received atserver 230 from one or more users atclients 205, with each user being identified by a different, unique user identifier 920-1 through 920-M. Bookmarks records 240 may, for example, be stored in a computer-readable medium associated withserver 230. User ID 920 may include, for example, an Internet Protocol (IP) address associated with a user, a user log-in identifier, or any other type of unique data for identifying the user. As shown inFIG. 9 , each user ID 920-1 through 920-M may have one or more record entries 910 associated with it. Each record entry 910 may include abookmark name 930, abookmark address 940, and one ormore labels 950.Bookmark name 930 may include any name designated by the user for the particular bookmark. For example, if a user bookmarks the document www.google.com, the user may name the bookmark “Google.”Bookmark address 940 may include the address (e.g., URL) of the document bookmarked by the user.Labels 950 may include one or more different designated textual labels given by the user to the bookmark. - Each record entry 910 may further include data (not shown in
FIG. 9 ) related to the user's specification of how and if a respective bookmark may be used in ranking search results. For example, each record entry 910 may include a flag entry indicating whether the “Move to top of search results for all queries”option 510, the “Move to top of search results for selected queries”option 600, the “Move to top of search results all URLs from a same site” 700 option, or the “Do not use for re-ranking search results”option 800 has been selected for a respective bookmark. If the “Move to top of search results for selected queries”option 600 has been selected, a corresponding record entry 910 may further include (not shown inFIG. 9 ) data corresponding to the search queries selected by the user. -
FIG. 10 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for ranking search results using user bookmarks consistent with principles of the invention. The process exemplified byFIG. 10 may be performed byserver 230. - The exemplary process may begin with the receipt of a search query (block 1000)(
FIG. 10 ). A user at aclient 205 may send a search query tosearch engine 235 ofserver 230 vianetwork 220. A corpus of documents may be searched based on the search query to obtain search results (block 1010). The corpus of documents may include, for example, a repository of documents crawled byserver 230.Server 230 may use existing search techniques for searching the corpus of documents using the search query received from the user.FIG. 11 depicts an illustrative example in whichsearch query 1100 is used to obtain a set of search results 1110. In addition to the corpus of documents, or instead of the corpus of documents, a corpus of bookmarks, that may include the user's bookmarks or other users' bookmarks (e.g., obtained as described below with respect to block 1030), may be searched. The search results resulting from the search may include bookmarks from the corpus of bookmarks. - The search results may be ranked in ranked order (block 1020).
Server 230 may use existing ranking techniques for placing the documents of the search results in ranked order. For example,server 230 may order the search results based on a determination of the relevance of each of the search results to the search query. Those results that are more relevant to the search query may, thus, be ranked higher than less relevant results. - User bookmark(s) may be obtained (block 1030). Bookmarks associated with the user that sent the search query to
server 230 may have been previously stored in bookmark records 240.Server 230 may retrieve the user's bookmarks from bookmark records 240.Server 230 may additionally retrieve, for each of the bookmarks, the corresponding indications received from the user that specify how and if a user's bookmarks should be used in ranking search results. As shown inFIG. 11 , abookmark 1120, associated withdocument 1130 may be obtained.Document 1130, as shown inFIG. 11 , is also included in search results 1110. In some implementations, categorizations associated with the obtained bookmarks may also be determined. A given bookmark may have one or more categories associated with it. For example, a bookmark to a University of Nevada-Las Vegas Running Rebels web page may be associated with the category “NCAA Basketball,” and possibly other categories. In further implementations, host names or sites associated with a bookmark may also be obtained. - The search results may be re-ranked based on the obtained user bookmark(s) (block 1040). In one implementation, if documents corresponding to the user bookmark(s) are contained in the search results, then those documents may be promoted higher in the ranked search results relative to other of the search results. In other implementations, the user's specification, for each bookmark, may be used to determine how and if the user's bookmarks should be used in re-ranking the search results. For example, if the user had selected the “Move to top of search results for all queries” option for a given bookmark in
window 500 oftoolbar 105, thenserver 230 may promote the given bookmark upwards within the set of ranked search results. In further implementations, if documents corresponding to the category(ies) (determined inblock 1030 above) associated with the user bookmark(s) are contained in the search results, then those documents may be promoted higher in the ranked search results relative to other of the search results. A document may correspond to a category(ies) associated with the user bookmark if it is determined to relate to the category(ies). - As another example, if the user had selected the option “Move to top of search results for selected queries” 600 for a given bookmark from
window 500 oftoolbar 105, thenserver 230 may promote the given bookmark upwards within a set of ranked search results that result from execution of a search using a search query that matches the queries that the user had entered inwindow 610. As yet another example, if the user had selected the “Move to top of search results all URLs from a same site”option 700 for a given bookmark fromwindow 500 oftoolbar 105, thenserver 230 may promote the given bookmark, and all other search results from a same site as the bookmark, upwards within the set of ranked search results. As a further example, if the user had selected the “Do not use for re-ranking search results”option 800 for a given bookmark fromwindow 500 oftoolbar 105,server 230 may not promote the given bookmark upwards within the set of ranked search results. In the illustrative example ofFIG. 11 ,document 1130, associated withbookmark 1120, is ranked first among the re-ranked search results 1140. - The re-ranked search results may be provided to the user (block 1050). For example, the ranked search results may be placed in rank order in a document and sent to the user at
client 205 vianetwork 220. - The foregoing description of implementations consistent with principles of the invention provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.
