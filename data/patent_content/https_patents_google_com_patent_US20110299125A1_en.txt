- the present disclosure relates to scanners, and more particularly to content retrieval that results from scanning.
- a device identifier is scanned from a device and the device is identified as an associated device of the scanner.
- a service provider receives a request including scanned information, to associate the portable scanner with the device and identifies the device as an associated device of the portable scanner.
- a service provider receives a device identifier scanned using a portable scanner, and receives additional information scanned using the portable scanner.
- the service provider identifies a network address of a device identified by the device identifier, and sends content to the network address in response to receiving the additional information scanned using the portable scanner.
- the system associates nearby devices with the user's scanner such that the nearby devices may be used for user input/output (I/O) in response to scans of a printed document.
- the nearby I/O devices thus become part of the user interface (UI) for the portable scanner.
- An embodiment of the disclosed innovations may serve as an adaptive distributed user interface for a portable scanning device. Nearby displays, computers, cellphones, printers, public terminals, audio devices (speakers, microphones), etc, may be associated with the user's scanner to provide a flexible user interface that utilizes the I/O devices in its vicinity.
- Some embodiments of the disclosed innovations may apply nearby I/O devices to enable the delivery of many types of multimedia content (music, video, etc.) that would not normally be suitable for rendering by a small portable device.
- a web browser (or other session-oriented application capable of exchanging information via a network with a server application) is associated with a session ID code displayed on the screen of the device session-oriented application providing the application.
- the session-oriented application communicates a request for a session ID to the server.
- the session ID request is correlated with the network address of the device providing the application.
- the server communicates a unique session ID back to the device providing the application, and records the network address to which the session ID is sent (and with which, therefore, it is associated).
- the session ID code is scanned from the display of the device using a portable scanner and communicated by the scanner (via its currently active communication channel) to the server, requesting the server to communicate content related to subsequent scans of information to the network address associated with the session ID.
- Subsequent actions of the portable scanner result in the server retrieving the network address of the session-oriented application previously associated with the session ID and communicating content related to these subsequent actions to the associated network address, where the content is displayed, played, or otherwise rendered (e.g., on a display of the device providing the application).
- information is received about a physical location of a portable scanner.
- a device near the portable scanner is identified, and the device is identified as an output device for information resulting from actions of the portable scanner.
- a device is identified from a database of devices previously registered with the server and known to be associated with the owner of the scanner.
- a nearby display is associated with a portable scanner for purposes of delivering information to the user of the portable scanner.
- the user scans a code on the display with the portable scanner.
- the code may be shown on the display screen or a physical tag, such as a sticker with a barcode.
- This code and a user identifier are sent to a service provider where the association is recorded in address translation tables or databases. Subsequent information intended for the user is sent to the display until the association is terminated.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system to associate a scanning device with one or more other devices.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system to associate a browsing session with a scanning device.
- FIG. 3 is an action flow diagram of an embodiment of a process of providing content to a scanner-associated device.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system to associate a scanning device with one or more other devices.
- a mobile device 118 may incorporate or interact with a portable scanner function 110 .
- the portable scanner 110 which is a scanner designed for convenient transport by a person, may be a pen-style device, a mouse, a remote control, or a portable phone, to name just a few of the possibilities.
- the portable scanner 110 may comprise short-range communication capability (e.g., short range RF such as BluetoothTM, short range wire-line such as USB, etc.) which it may use to communicate with the mobile device 118 .
- the scanner includes a user ID code 122 that uniquely identifies the scanner among other such scanners known to the system.
- Examples of mobile devices 118 include laptop, notebook, or sub-notebook computers; a hand-held computer such as a personal digital assistant (PDA); or a cellular or other wireless telephone.
- PDA personal digital assistant
- Information captured by the portable scanner 110 in one or more scans, possibly along with other information, is communicated to the network 102 , from which it is communicated to the content location and retrieval service 106 .
- this information may initiate a content request/location/retrieval action.
- the information from at least one of the scans may come from a printed source, for example, a newspaper, magazine, flyer, book, manual, brochure, label, or advertisement.
- the information from one or more of the scans may also come from electronically or digitally displayed information, for example, text, barcodes, icons, glyphs, or other information from an electronic display.
- the mobile device 118 provides longer-range communication capability to the network 102 .
- Examples of such communication comprise the standard public switched telephone network (using a dial-up modem, for example), digital subscriber line, asynchronous digital subscriber line, cable modem, Ethernet, wide-area LAN technology, wireless LAN technology such as IEEE 802.11, and wireless cell phone technology.
- the network 102 comprises communication switching, routing, and data storage capabilities.
- the network 102 inter alia, routes and propagates information between components of the system.
- the network 102 may comprise the Internet, an intranet or intranets, wire-line and/or wireless network portions.
- the device database 104 comprises information about devices that may be associated with the portable scanner 110 , and, in some embodiments and/or under some conditions, the mobile device 118 .
- the device database 104 provides an association of device identifiers with device addresses.
- the device database 104 may also provide an association of device identifiers with supported content types.
- Some embodiments of the device database 104 comprise one or more of a relational database, an index, a mapping table, and an enhanced domain name service.
- the device association 108 comprises associations between portable scanners and input/output (I/O), storage, or processing devices.
- the device database 104 and the device association 108 are distinct functions which may be separately accessed by other functions, for example, by content retrieval 106 .
- the device association 108 and the device database 104 may be incorporated into a common functional component.
- the content retrieval 106 communicates with the device database 104 and the device association 108 to obtain, inter alia, device information and device association information.
- the device database 104 and/or the device association 108 may communicate with the content retrieval 106 using a network such as network 102 .
- the device database 104 , the device association 108 , and the content retrieval 106 may comprise a “service provider.”
- a service provider is a network-accessible provider of information and/or services in fulfillment of client requests. Service providers may provide subscription-based, advertising supported, pay-per-use, and/or pay-per-transaction access to content and/or communication services.
- the content retrieval 106 comprises content location and retrieval functionality.
- Content is at least one of text, digital sound or music, or one or more digital images or video.
- the content retrieval 106 locates content corresponding to, related to, and/or identified by information scanned by the portable scanner 110 .
- the content retrieval 106 communicates with the network 102 and provides the located content to an I/O, storage, or processing device associated with the portable scanner 110 .
- the associated device may be, inter alia, an image/video rendering system 112 or audio rendering system 114 .
- Some devices e.g., a combined device 116
- Examples of such combination devices 116 include a laptop computer, a desktop computer, televisions, multi-user computer systems, or a kiosk.
- a data storage device 120 or a printer.
- Examples of a data storage device 120 comprise a computer hard drive, portable flash storage device, portable music and/or video and/or e-book player (e.g., portable content player), and optical storage media.
- Computing resources such as a laptop, desktop, or network-based computer or computers, may also be associated with the portable scanner 110 in order to enhance the processing capabilities associated with the scanner 110 .
- Identifying a device to which content will be delivered may involve receiving a device identifier for the associated device.
- the device identifier may be provided by the scanner 110 or mobile device 118 associated with the scanner. Examples of a device identifier are a barcode, unique device serial number, a network address such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address, an alphanumeric code, or a unique device name.
- IP Internet Protocol
- the network address of the associated device is necessary but an identifier for the associated device is not.
- the system may function without full knowledge of the capabilities of the associated device in some cases. In other cases, the capabilities may be inferred. For example, if the device requests a communication session identifier via a web browser, and a scanner subsequently submits the communication session identifier to the system, it is likely that the device has a display from which the session identifier was scanned.
- one or more devices are “registered” by the user of a scanner so that they are associated with the unique user (or device) ID that identifies the scanner.
- a laptop computer that is owned by a user of a scanner may be registered as “Device #1” associated with the scanner's unique user and/or device ID (thus the associated device identifier may be quite simple given the limited number of devices registered by a single user).
- the associated device may comprise logic that automatically registers its current network address with the service provider (since that network address may frequently change when, for example, a laptop is moved to a new location and establishes a new connection with the Internet).
- selecting a device from the small domain of devices associated with a given scanner (and/or user) makes it possible to use alternative methods to identify the desired device. For example, a device may be identified by scanning a selected icon or by performing a distinct gesture with the scanner.
- a device identifier may be provided by scanning it and then communicating it to the content location and retrieval 106 (service provider) system.
- a device identifier may be made to appear on a visual display of the device so that it may be scanned by the portable scanner 110 .
- the device identifier may be scanned from a serial number affixed to the device, scanned from a barcode affixed to the device, and so on.
- the identifier of the associated device may be provided with or prior to a content request/location/retrieval action by the scanner 110 .
- one or more of the devices that will be associated with a portable scanner 110 will be selected, at least in part, because they are nearby the location of the portable scanner 110 . Identifying the location of the portable scanner 110 may occur, at least in part, using GPS satellite location information, information triangulated using multiple RF transceivers, and/or location of Wi-Fi or other wireless access points used by or nearby to the portable scanner 110 .
- one or more associated devices may be selected or not selected at least in part by examining characteristics of the located content type (for example, is it text, video, or audio) and determining whether a candidate nearby device supports rendering of that content type.
- the device identifier for the associated device is used, at least in part, to identify the network address of the associated device.
- the device identifier may be a unique ID that distinguishes the device from all other devices known to the system, or it may be an identifier that, in combination with the unique user and/or device ID 122 associated with the scanner 110 , serves to uniquely identify the device to the system.
- the network address may comprise, among other possibilities, an IP address, a MAC address, a Uniform Resource Locator, or a device name or identifier which is recognized by the network 102 as being a particular device to which information may be sent.
- Delivering the located content to the associated device may comprise configuring the associated device for exclusive use by a person using the portable scanner 110 for as long as the portable scanner 110 is associated with the device. Configuring the associated device for exclusive access by the person using the scanner 110 may be particularly important in public or semi-public environments.
- the portable scanner 110 and/or associated mobile device 118 may be provided with access to information for which access is controlled by the associated I/O or storage device. Examples of such information are information to enable and/or facilitate functionality of the scanner 110 , possibly including keyword definitions, document indexes, tables and parameters to facilitate OCR and/or voice recognition.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system to associate a query session between a scanning device and a service provider.
- the session-oriented application comprises a web browser.
- a portable scanner 110 interacts with and captures information from a computer system comprising a display 202 .
- Examples of the computer system include a desktop, laptop, or handheld computer, a PDA, or a cellular or other wireless phone.
- the computer system comprises web browser 204 logic.
- the web browser 204 typically communicates via a network with a server.
- the server may comprise, inter alia, a web server, CGI script server, a private network (intranet) server, or a server of a wire-line or wireless telephone support network.
- a web browsing session may be characterized by a session identifier (session ID 206 ).
- the session ID 206 is a code that uniquely identifies a browser communication session. Examples of session ids 206 are HTTP session IDs as well as other protocol session IDs.
- the service provider 208 records the network address associated with the request from the web browser 204 , and returns a web page on which is displayed a unique session ID code 206 .
- the service provider 208 records (for example, in device association database 108 ) the association between the unique session ID code 206 and the network address of the device providing the web browser 204 application.
- the session identifier 206 may be displayed to a user of the browser 204 . Specific functionality may be provided to the web browser 204 so that the session identifier 206 may be displayed.
- the portable scanner 110 may scan the displayed session ID 206 code.
- the scanner 110 communicates the scanned unique session ID code 206 to the service provider 208 , together with the unique scanner and/or user ID 122 , using any of the one or more network communication channels by which the scanner 110 communicates with the service provider 208 . This may comprise a request to the service provider 208 to initiate a query session. Responses to subsequent scans (e.g., subsequent queries) are communicated to the web browser 204 at the network address previously associated with session ID 206 .
- the system may respond with a query session initiation request acknowledgement that may be displayed on web browser 204 confirming to the user that the system has correctly identified the user and his intention to initiate a query session via associated the device 202 .
- a query session initiation request acknowledgement may be displayed on web browser 204 confirming to the user that the system has correctly identified the user and his intention to initiate a query session via associated the device 202 .
- an “end session” icon or command may be scanned from the display of the associated device 202 and communicated to the service provider 208 to terminate the current session.
- the service provider 208 may then communicate a command to the web browser 204 to clear the display (removing any potentially sensitive information previously displayed in the session) and display a new unique session ID code 206 that may be scanned to initiate a new query session.
- the session may automatically time-out and be similarly terminated.
- the portable scanner 110 may scan information from a printed source.
- the scanned information may include text, a barcode, glyph, and/or other identifier of a printed source.
- the scanned information may include a product name, barcode, company name, logo, trademark, or other identifier of a product.
- the scanned information may include song name, artist name, anthology name, and/or other identifier of musical content.
- the scanned information may include an image name, caption, heading, and/or other identifier of image content, or a movie name, actor name, producer name, director name, studio name, product name, or other identifier of video content.
- Information captured by the at least one scans may be incorporated in a content request.
- the scanned information may be communicated to a service provider 208 in one or more communications.
- the service provider 208 may apply the session ID code 206 to, at least in part, direct content back to the web browser 204 . This may result in the web browser 204 receiving content communicated as a result of actions of the portable scanner 110 .
- Content communicated may include an electronic version of a printed document from which information was scanned, digital music associated with information of a scan, a digital voice recording, audio news or commentary, audio product information, or other recorded or synthesized sound, at least one of digital image, digital photo, product image or video, video of news reports or commentary, or other digital images or video.
- FIG. 3 is an action flow diagram of an embodiment of a process of providing content to a scanner-associated device.
- a display device comprising web browser logic communicates a request to the service provider (e.g., a system comprising the device association and/or device database) to generate a unique session ID code, which is recorded in the device association database along with a network address associated with the browser.
- the service provider e.g., a system comprising the device association and/or device database
- a unique session ID is generated and communicated back to the browser at its associated network address.
- the unique session ID is scanned from its displayed location, and at 308 a query session initiation request is communicated to the service provider that includes both the unique user and/or scanner ID and the unique session ID code.
- the service provider applies the unique session ID code contained in the request 308 to identify the network address recorded in the device association database, and a query session acknowledgement is communicated at 310 to the device at the identified network address.
- the browser displays the query session request acknowledgement to the user of the scanner.
- the service provider also records, in the device association database, that the unique session ID is now “owned” by the user of the scanner, e.g., that other portable scanning devices may not become associated with this session ID.
- the service provider associates the unique user and/or scanner ID with the currently active session ID code and the associated network address.
- the scanner communicates scanned information (REQ) to the content retrieval function.
- Content retrieval determines content to provide in response to the scanned information.
- the type of the content is communicated to the device database at 314 .
- Content type may be used, at least in part, in determining which associated device or devices is most suited to render the content when more than one device is currently actively associated with scanner.
- a link to such content or the content itself may be stored in a database, emailed to a predetermined address for the user, or otherwise retained, so that such content may be accessed at a later time when an appropriate rendering device is available.
- the device database communicates an associated device address or addresses, or a network address or addresses, to content retrieval.
- content retrieval provides the content to the associated device.
- the system may associate storage devices with the user's scanner for the purpose of storing electronic content (audio, video, digital documents, etc.) delivered by the system in response to a scan of a printed document. For instance, by scanning an identifier that uniquely identifies a device having storage capability (such as a computer with a hard drive, writable DVD, CD-ROM, etc.), the system may modify its databases so that future deliveries of content in response to scans of printed documents (originating from the portable scanner) will be delivered to the corresponding storage device and archived for later retrieval.
- a device having storage capability such as a computer with a hard drive, writable DVD, CD-ROM, etc.
- the system determines the user's location and which nearby devices may be associated with the user's portable electronic device.
- the system may determine the user's location by way of on-board GPS in portable device, by triangulation of wireless signals, by determining the location of the communication network transceiver serving the device, by querying the user, or any other suitable method.
- the system maintains a device database that has location information for I/O devices that may be used in conjunction with a portable scanning device.
- the system receives a request from a portable scanner for association with an I/O device, the system determines the location of the portable scanner and then identifies appropriate candidates by referring to the device database.
- the user may preset the associations of devices with the portable scanner.
- the user may want to have his home computer designated as the recipient for content requests that originate from his scanner.
- the user may access the service provider's website and manually enter identifiers of the devices and data repositories (e.g., the home computer) that are to receive responses to his scanned queries.
- the recipient devices may be automatically identified by the various scanning methods discussed throughout this document.
- a public kiosk displays a dynamic session ID.
- the kiosk is connected to a communication network such as the Internet or a corporate intranet.
- the connection may be via cable modem, telephone system (PSTN, ADSL, DSL, etc), wireless local area network (WLAN, IEEE802.11, etc.) or any other suitable access method.
- the session ID changes periodically but at least every time that the kiosk is used so that a new session ID is displayed to every new user.
- the user scans in the session ID displayed by the kiosk; by scanning the session ID, the user informs the system that he wishes to temporarily associate the kiosk with his scanner for the delivery of content resulting from scans of printed documents.
- the scanner may communicate the session ID and other information authenticating the scanner (such as a serial number, account number, or other identifying information) directly to the system (perhaps via a wireless communication such as a cellular Short Message Service (SMS) message) or by using the kiosk's links to the communication network.
- the scanner may apply the kiosk's communication link by transferring the session initiation information to the kiosk (perhaps via short range RF such as BlueToothTM, etc.).
- the kiosk communicate then communicates the session initiation information to the service provider's system via its Internet connection.
- the scanner may communicate directly (where “directly” means without passing the message through the kiosk) with the service provider's system by communicating the session initiation message through the user's cellphone (which may be paired with the user's scanner via Bluetooth) or other wireless communication device.
- the system may prevent others from using a device associated with a scanner during the period (session) in which the device is associated with the scanner. This feature is especially useful to prevent others from using a public kiosk before a previous session has ended.
- the user may initiate the session by scanning the session ID from the kiosk display (or entering it via a keypad or touchscreen on the portable scanner); and the system associates in its databases the session ID with the serial number (or other identifier that uniquely identifies the user and/or the user's scanner) of his scanner so another scanner cannot scan the session ID and use the kiosk during his session.
- the scanner may be in communication (through wireless link such as BluetoothTM, a hardwired link such as a docking station, etc.) with a computer associated with the display or may be in direct (i.e., without going through the computer) communication with the service provider's system via another means such as cellular, etc.
- a portable scanner's functions may vary depending upon the associated devices. For example, if a portable scanner is associated with a nearby computer that has optical character recognition (OCR) capability, the scanner may communicate scanned image data to the computer, whereas if the associated computer did not have OCR capability, the portable scanner may apply an on-board OCR function to convert the scanned images to text before communicating the text to the service provider.
- OCR optical character recognition
- the scanner may obtain the communication session identifier from the computer by wireless communications (e.g., a BluetoothTM link) rather than scanning.
- wireless communications e.g., a BluetoothTM link
- the computer may use the Bluetooth connection to communicate the communication session identifier to the scanner, rather than displaying it on the computer display for the user to scan with the portable scanner.
- the system enhances the user interface for portable electronic devices by associating other devices that have better video or audio capability than the portable electronic device. For example, a subscriber waiting for a flight in an airport may browse a television guide and notice a show that he wishes to watch. Using the web browser on his computer to browse to the service provider's website, the subscriber may get a communication session identifier communicated to his laptop computer. Scanning the communication session identifier and information identifying the show from the television guide, the subscriber identifies the laptop computer as the location where he wishes to have the video content (the television show) delivered.
- the system may check whether the subscriber has the proper permissions to access the content (e.g., does he have a ‘cable television’ service contract; if broadband Internet access is necessary to deliver the video, does he have a broadband service contract with an Internet Service Provider, etc.) prior to sending it to the laptop computer.
- the subscriber has the proper permissions to access the content (e.g., does he have a ‘cable television’ service contract; if broadband Internet access is necessary to deliver the video, does he have a broadband service contract with an Internet Service Provider, etc.) prior to sending it to the laptop computer.
- a signal bearing media include, but are not limited to, the following: recordable type media such as floppy disks, hard disk drives, CD ROMs, digital tape, and computer memory; and transmission type media such as digital and analog communication links using TDM or IP based communication links (e.g., packet links).
- electrical circuitry includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein), electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of random access memory), and/or electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, or optical-electrical equipment).
- a computer program e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein
- electrical circuitry forming a memory device
- any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as “associated with” each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components.
- any two components so associated can also be viewed as being “operably connected,” or “operably coupled,” to each other to achieve the desired functionality.

- The present disclosure relates to scanners, and more particularly to content retrieval that results from scanning.
- A proliferation of portable scanning devices enables many new applications involving the interaction of the printed and digital world. However, the portability of such devices necessarily involves compromises on the capabilities inherent therein.
- The following summary is intended to highlight and introduce some aspects of the disclosed embodiments, but not to limit the scope of the invention. Thereafter, a detailed description of illustrated embodiments is presented, which will permit one skilled in the relevant art to make and use aspects of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art may obtain a full appreciation of aspects of the invention from the subsequent detailed description, read together with the figures, and from the claims (which follow the detailed description).
- In some embodiments, a device identifier is scanned from a device and the device is identified as an associated device of the scanner. A service provider receives a request including scanned information, to associate the portable scanner with the device and identifies the device as an associated device of the portable scanner.
- In some embodiments, a service provider receives a device identifier scanned using a portable scanner, and receives additional information scanned using the portable scanner. The service provider identifies a network address of a device identified by the device identifier, and sends content to the network address in response to receiving the additional information scanned using the portable scanner.
- In some embodiments, the system associates nearby devices with the user's scanner such that the nearby devices may be used for user input/output (I/O) in response to scans of a printed document. The nearby I/O devices thus become part of the user interface (UI) for the portable scanner. An embodiment of the disclosed innovations may serve as an adaptive distributed user interface for a portable scanning device. Nearby displays, computers, cellphones, printers, public terminals, audio devices (speakers, microphones), etc, may be associated with the user's scanner to provide a flexible user interface that utilizes the I/O devices in its vicinity. Some embodiments of the disclosed innovations may apply nearby I/O devices to enable the delivery of many types of multimedia content (music, video, etc.) that would not normally be suitable for rendering by a small portable device.
- In some embodiments, a web browser (or other session-oriented application capable of exchanging information via a network with a server application) is associated with a session ID code displayed on the screen of the device session-oriented application providing the application. The session-oriented application communicates a request for a session ID to the server. The session ID request is correlated with the network address of the device providing the application. The server communicates a unique session ID back to the device providing the application, and records the network address to which the session ID is sent (and with which, therefore, it is associated). The session ID code is scanned from the display of the device using a portable scanner and communicated by the scanner (via its currently active communication channel) to the server, requesting the server to communicate content related to subsequent scans of information to the network address associated with the session ID. Subsequent actions of the portable scanner result in the server retrieving the network address of the session-oriented application previously associated with the session ID and communicating content related to these subsequent actions to the associated network address, where the content is displayed, played, or otherwise rendered (e.g., on a display of the device providing the application).
- In some embodiments, information is received about a physical location of a portable scanner. A device near the portable scanner is identified, and the device is identified as an output device for information resulting from actions of the portable scanner. For example, a device is identified from a database of devices previously registered with the server and known to be associated with the owner of the scanner.
- In some embodiments, a nearby display is associated with a portable scanner for purposes of delivering information to the user of the portable scanner. To create the association, the user scans a code on the display with the portable scanner. The code may be shown on the display screen or a physical tag, such as a sticker with a barcode. This code and a user identifier are sent to a service provider where the association is recorded in address translation tables or databases. Subsequent information intended for the user is sent to the display until the association is terminated.
- The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the claimed invention.
- In the drawings, the same reference numbers and acronyms identify elements or acts with the same or similar functionality for ease of understanding and convenience. To easily identify the discussion of any particular element or act, the most significant digit or digits in a reference number refer to the figure number in which that element is first introduced.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system to associate a scanning device with one or more other devices. - A
mobile device 118 may incorporate or interact with aportable scanner function 110. Theportable scanner 110, which is a scanner designed for convenient transport by a person, may be a pen-style device, a mouse, a remote control, or a portable phone, to name just a few of the possibilities. Theportable scanner 110 may comprise short-range communication capability (e.g., short range RF such as Bluetooth™, short range wire-line such as USB, etc.) which it may use to communicate with themobile device 118. The scanner includes auser ID code 122 that uniquely identifies the scanner among other such scanners known to the system. - Examples of
mobile devices 118 include laptop, notebook, or sub-notebook computers; a hand-held computer such as a personal digital assistant (PDA); or a cellular or other wireless telephone. - Information captured by the
portable scanner 110 in one or more scans, possibly along with other information, is communicated to thenetwork 102, from which it is communicated to the content location andretrieval service 106. In some embodiments, this information may initiate a content request/location/retrieval action. The information from at least one of the scans may come from a printed source, for example, a newspaper, magazine, flyer, book, manual, brochure, label, or advertisement. The information from one or more of the scans may also come from electronically or digitally displayed information, for example, text, barcodes, icons, glyphs, or other information from an electronic display. - The
mobile device 118 provides longer-range communication capability to thenetwork 102. Examples of such communication comprise the standard public switched telephone network (using a dial-up modem, for example), digital subscriber line, asynchronous digital subscriber line, cable modem, Ethernet, wide-area LAN technology, wireless LAN technology such as IEEE 802.11, and wireless cell phone technology. - The
network 102 comprises communication switching, routing, and data storage capabilities. Thenetwork 102, inter alia, routes and propagates information between components of the system. Thenetwork 102 may comprise the Internet, an intranet or intranets, wire-line and/or wireless network portions. - The
device database 104 comprises information about devices that may be associated with theportable scanner 110, and, in some embodiments and/or under some conditions, themobile device 118. In some embodiments, thedevice database 104 provides an association of device identifiers with device addresses. Thedevice database 104 may also provide an association of device identifiers with supported content types. Some embodiments of thedevice database 104 comprise one or more of a relational database, an index, a mapping table, and an enhanced domain name service. - The
device association 108 comprises associations between portable scanners and input/output (I/O), storage, or processing devices. In some embodiments thedevice database 104 and thedevice association 108 are distinct functions which may be separately accessed by other functions, for example, bycontent retrieval 106. In some embodiments thedevice association 108 and thedevice database 104 may be incorporated into a common functional component. - The
content retrieval 106 communicates with thedevice database 104 and thedevice association 108 to obtain, inter alia, device information and device association information. In some embodiments thedevice database 104 and/or thedevice association 108 may communicate with thecontent retrieval 106 using a network such asnetwork 102. - The
device database 104, thedevice association 108, and thecontent retrieval 106 may comprise a “service provider.” A service provider is a network-accessible provider of information and/or services in fulfillment of client requests. Service providers may provide subscription-based, advertising supported, pay-per-use, and/or pay-per-transaction access to content and/or communication services. - The
content retrieval 106 comprises content location and retrieval functionality. Content is at least one of text, digital sound or music, or one or more digital images or video. Thecontent retrieval 106 locates content corresponding to, related to, and/or identified by information scanned by theportable scanner 110. - The
content retrieval 106 communicates with thenetwork 102 and provides the located content to an I/O, storage, or processing device associated with theportable scanner 110. - The associated device may be, inter alia, an image/
video rendering system 112 oraudio rendering system 114. Some devices (e.g., a combined device 116) may include both audio and imaging/video systems 112 114. Examples ofsuch combination devices 116 include a laptop computer, a desktop computer, televisions, multi-user computer systems, or a kiosk. - Other devices that may be associated with the
portable scanner 110 include adata storage device 120 or a printer. Examples of adata storage device 120 comprise a computer hard drive, portable flash storage device, portable music and/or video and/or e-book player (e.g., portable content player), and optical storage media. Computing resources, such as a laptop, desktop, or network-based computer or computers, may also be associated with theportable scanner 110 in order to enhance the processing capabilities associated with thescanner 110. - Identifying a device to which content will be delivered may involve receiving a device identifier for the associated device. The device identifier may be provided by the
scanner 110 ormobile device 118 associated with the scanner. Examples of a device identifier are a barcode, unique device serial number, a network address such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address, an alphanumeric code, or a unique device name. - In some embodiments, the network address of the associated device is necessary but an identifier for the associated device is not. The system may function without full knowledge of the capabilities of the associated device in some cases. In other cases, the capabilities may be inferred. For example, if the device requests a communication session identifier via a web browser, and a scanner subsequently submits the communication session identifier to the system, it is likely that the device has a display from which the session identifier was scanned.
- In some embodiments, one or more devices are “registered” by the user of a scanner so that they are associated with the unique user (or device) ID that identifies the scanner. For example, a laptop computer that is owned by a user of a scanner may be registered as “Device #1” associated with the scanner's unique user and/or device ID (thus the associated device identifier may be quite simple given the limited number of devices registered by a single user). The associated device may comprise logic that automatically registers its current network address with the service provider (since that network address may frequently change when, for example, a laptop is moved to a new location and establishes a new connection with the Internet). This simplifies the user's task when initiating a new session with the service provider, because the user need only scan the associated device's identifier and automatically communicate a command to the service provider to look up the associated device, retrieve its current network address, and communicate subsequent system responses to the indicated device. Furthermore, the management of the service provider's system is simplified because there is no need to create and maintain a set of identifiers that are unique among all devices known to the service provider. Each user of the service may simply register any devices that are to be used without having to apply for (and subsequently apply) a more-complex device identifier, such as a lengthy serial number.
- Furthermore, selecting a device from the small domain of devices associated with a given scanner (and/or user) makes it possible to use alternative methods to identify the desired device. For example, a device may be identified by scanning a selected icon or by performing a distinct gesture with the scanner.
- A device identifier may be provided by scanning it and then communicating it to the content location and retrieval 106 (service provider) system. In some embodiments, a device identifier may be made to appear on a visual display of the device so that it may be scanned by the
portable scanner 110. The device identifier may be scanned from a serial number affixed to the device, scanned from a barcode affixed to the device, and so on. The identifier of the associated device may be provided with or prior to a content request/location/retrieval action by thescanner 110. - In some embodiments, one or more of the devices that will be associated with a
portable scanner 110 will be selected, at least in part, because they are nearby the location of theportable scanner 110. Identifying the location of theportable scanner 110 may occur, at least in part, using GPS satellite location information, information triangulated using multiple RF transceivers, and/or location of Wi-Fi or other wireless access points used by or nearby to theportable scanner 110. - In some embodiments, one or more associated devices may be selected or not selected at least in part by examining characteristics of the located content type (for example, is it text, video, or audio) and determining whether a candidate nearby device supports rendering of that content type.
- In some embodiments, the device identifier for the associated device is used, at least in part, to identify the network address of the associated device. The device identifier may be a unique ID that distinguishes the device from all other devices known to the system, or it may be an identifier that, in combination with the unique user and/or
device ID 122 associated with thescanner 110, serves to uniquely identify the device to the system. The network address may comprise, among other possibilities, an IP address, a MAC address, a Uniform Resource Locator, or a device name or identifier which is recognized by thenetwork 102 as being a particular device to which information may be sent. - Delivering the located content to the associated device may comprise configuring the associated device for exclusive use by a person using the
portable scanner 110 for as long as theportable scanner 110 is associated with the device. Configuring the associated device for exclusive access by the person using thescanner 110 may be particularly important in public or semi-public environments. - The
portable scanner 110 and/or associatedmobile device 118 may be provided with access to information for which access is controlled by the associated I/O or storage device. Examples of such information are information to enable and/or facilitate functionality of thescanner 110, possibly including keyword definitions, document indexes, tables and parameters to facilitate OCR and/or voice recognition. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system to associate a query session between a scanning device and a service provider. In this example, the session-oriented application comprises a web browser. - A
portable scanner 110 interacts with and captures information from a computer system comprising adisplay 202. Examples of the computer system include a desktop, laptop, or handheld computer, a PDA, or a cellular or other wireless phone. The computer system comprisesweb browser 204 logic. Theweb browser 204 typically communicates via a network with a server. The server may comprise, inter alia, a web server, CGI script server, a private network (intranet) server, or a server of a wire-line or wireless telephone support network. - A web browsing session may be characterized by a session identifier (session ID 206). The
session ID 206 is a code that uniquely identifies a browser communication session. Examples ofsession ids 206 are HTTP session IDs as well as other protocol session IDs. In some embodiments, when theweb browser 204 is directed to load a web page from a URL designating a web site belonging toservice provider 208, theservice provider 208 records the network address associated with the request from theweb browser 204, and returns a web page on which is displayed a uniquesession ID code 206. Theservice provider 208 records (for example, in device association database 108) the association between the uniquesession ID code 206 and the network address of the device providing theweb browser 204 application. - The
session identifier 206 may be displayed to a user of thebrowser 204. Specific functionality may be provided to theweb browser 204 so that thesession identifier 206 may be displayed. Theportable scanner 110 may scan the displayedsession ID 206 code. Thescanner 110 communicates the scanned uniquesession ID code 206 to theservice provider 208, together with the unique scanner and/oruser ID 122, using any of the one or more network communication channels by which thescanner 110 communicates with theservice provider 208. This may comprise a request to theservice provider 208 to initiate a query session. Responses to subsequent scans (e.g., subsequent queries) are communicated to theweb browser 204 at the network address previously associated withsession ID 206. In some embodiments, the system may respond with a query session initiation request acknowledgement that may be displayed onweb browser 204 confirming to the user that the system has correctly identified the user and his intention to initiate a query session via associated thedevice 202. When the user finishes a query session, for example, an “end session” icon or command may be scanned from the display of the associateddevice 202 and communicated to theservice provider 208 to terminate the current session. Theservice provider 208 may then communicate a command to theweb browser 204 to clear the display (removing any potentially sensitive information previously displayed in the session) and display a new uniquesession ID code 206 that may be scanned to initiate a new query session. Similarly, after a pre-determined time interval during which no communication is received by theservice provider 208 from thescanner 110, the session may automatically time-out and be similarly terminated. - Subsequent to communicating a query session initiation request, the
portable scanner 110 may scan information from a printed source. The scanned information may include text, a barcode, glyph, and/or other identifier of a printed source. The scanned information may include a product name, barcode, company name, logo, trademark, or other identifier of a product. The scanned information may include song name, artist name, anthology name, and/or other identifier of musical content. The scanned information may include an image name, caption, heading, and/or other identifier of image content, or a movie name, actor name, producer name, director name, studio name, product name, or other identifier of video content. - Information captured by the at least one scans (including the scanned session ID 206), with possibly additional information, may be incorporated in a content request. The scanned information may be communicated to a
service provider 208 in one or more communications. Theservice provider 208 may apply thesession ID code 206 to, at least in part, direct content back to theweb browser 204. This may result in theweb browser 204 receiving content communicated as a result of actions of theportable scanner 110. - Content communicated may include an electronic version of a printed document from which information was scanned, digital music associated with information of a scan, a digital voice recording, audio news or commentary, audio product information, or other recorded or synthesized sound, at least one of digital image, digital photo, product image or video, video of news reports or commentary, or other digital images or video.
-
FIG. 3 is an action flow diagram of an embodiment of a process of providing content to a scanner-associated device. - At 302 a display device comprising web browser logic communicates a request to the service provider (e.g., a system comprising the device association and/or device database) to generate a unique session ID code, which is recorded in the device association database along with a network address associated with the browser. At 304, a unique session ID is generated and communicated back to the browser at its associated network address. At 306, the unique session ID is scanned from its displayed location, and at 308 a query session initiation request is communicated to the service provider that includes both the unique user and/or scanner ID and the unique session ID code. The service provider applies the unique session ID code contained in the
request 308 to identify the network address recorded in the device association database, and a query session acknowledgement is communicated at 310 to the device at the identified network address. The browser displays the query session request acknowledgement to the user of the scanner. The service provider also records, in the device association database, that the unique session ID is now “owned” by the user of the scanner, e.g., that other portable scanning devices may not become associated with this session ID. The service provider associates the unique user and/or scanner ID with the currently active session ID code and the associated network address. - At 312 the scanner communicates scanned information (REQ) to the content retrieval function. Content retrieval determines content to provide in response to the scanned information.
- In some embodiments, the type of the content is communicated to the device database at 314. Content type may be used, at least in part, in determining which associated device or devices is most suited to render the content when more than one device is currently actively associated with scanner. When content is identified for which no currently available device is suitable, a link to such content or the content itself may be stored in a database, emailed to a predetermined address for the user, or otherwise retained, so that such content may be accessed at a later time when an appropriate rendering device is available.
- At 316 the device database communicates an associated device address or addresses, or a network address or addresses, to content retrieval. At 318 content retrieval provides the content to the associated device.
- In some embodiments, the system may associate storage devices with the user's scanner for the purpose of storing electronic content (audio, video, digital documents, etc.) delivered by the system in response to a scan of a printed document. For instance, by scanning an identifier that uniquely identifies a device having storage capability (such as a computer with a hard drive, writable DVD, CD-ROM, etc.), the system may modify its databases so that future deliveries of content in response to scans of printed documents (originating from the portable scanner) will be delivered to the corresponding storage device and archived for later retrieval.
- In some embodiments, the system determines the user's location and which nearby devices may be associated with the user's portable electronic device. The system may determine the user's location by way of on-board GPS in portable device, by triangulation of wireless signals, by determining the location of the communication network transceiver serving the device, by querying the user, or any other suitable method.
- In some embodiments, the system maintains a device database that has location information for I/O devices that may be used in conjunction with a portable scanning device. When the system receives a request from a portable scanner for association with an I/O device, the system determines the location of the portable scanner and then identifies appropriate candidates by referring to the device database.
- In some embodiments, the user may preset the associations of devices with the portable scanner. As one example, the user may want to have his home computer designated as the recipient for content requests that originate from his scanner. To accomplish this, the user may access the service provider's website and manually enter identifiers of the devices and data repositories (e.g., the home computer) that are to receive responses to his scanned queries. Alternatively, the recipient devices may be automatically identified by the various scanning methods discussed throughout this document.
- In some embodiments, a public kiosk displays a dynamic session ID. The kiosk is connected to a communication network such as the Internet or a corporate intranet. The connection may be via cable modem, telephone system (PSTN, ADSL, DSL, etc), wireless local area network (WLAN, IEEE802.11, etc.) or any other suitable access method. The session ID changes periodically but at least every time that the kiosk is used so that a new session ID is displayed to every new user. To use the kiosk, the user scans in the session ID displayed by the kiosk; by scanning the session ID, the user informs the system that he wishes to temporarily associate the kiosk with his scanner for the delivery of content resulting from scans of printed documents. The scanner may communicate the session ID and other information authenticating the scanner (such as a serial number, account number, or other identifying information) directly to the system (perhaps via a wireless communication such as a cellular Short Message Service (SMS) message) or by using the kiosk's links to the communication network. For example, the scanner may apply the kiosk's communication link by transferring the session initiation information to the kiosk (perhaps via short range RF such as BlueTooth™, etc.). The kiosk communicate then communicates the session initiation information to the service provider's system via its Internet connection. The scanner may communicate directly (where “directly” means without passing the message through the kiosk) with the service provider's system by communicating the session initiation message through the user's cellphone (which may be paired with the user's scanner via Bluetooth) or other wireless communication device.
- In some embodiments, the system may prevent others from using a device associated with a scanner during the period (session) in which the device is associated with the scanner. This feature is especially useful to prevent others from using a public kiosk before a previous session has ended. As an example of this concept related to use of a computer at an internet café, the user may initiate the session by scanning the session ID from the kiosk display (or entering it via a keypad or touchscreen on the portable scanner); and the system associates in its databases the session ID with the serial number (or other identifier that uniquely identifies the user and/or the user's scanner) of his scanner so another scanner cannot scan the session ID and use the kiosk during his session. The scanner may be in communication (through wireless link such as Bluetooth™, a hardwired link such as a docking station, etc.) with a computer associated with the display or may be in direct (i.e., without going through the computer) communication with the service provider's system via another means such as cellular, etc.
- In some embodiments, a portable scanner's functions may vary depending upon the associated devices. For example, if a portable scanner is associated with a nearby computer that has optical character recognition (OCR) capability, the scanner may communicate scanned image data to the computer, whereas if the associated computer did not have OCR capability, the portable scanner may apply an on-board OCR function to convert the scanned images to text before communicating the text to the service provider.
- In some embodiments, the scanner may obtain the communication session identifier from the computer by wireless communications (e.g., a Bluetooth™ link) rather than scanning. For example, after a portable scanner makes a Bluetooth™ connection with a computer, the computer may use the Bluetooth connection to communicate the communication session identifier to the scanner, rather than displaying it on the computer display for the user to scan with the portable scanner.
- In some embodiments, the system enhances the user interface for portable electronic devices by associating other devices that have better video or audio capability than the portable electronic device. For example, a subscriber waiting for a flight in an airport may browse a television guide and notice a show that he wishes to watch. Using the web browser on his computer to browse to the service provider's website, the subscriber may get a communication session identifier communicated to his laptop computer. Scanning the communication session identifier and information identifying the show from the television guide, the subscriber identifies the laptop computer as the location where he wishes to have the video content (the television show) delivered. The system may check whether the subscriber has the proper permissions to access the content (e.g., does he have a ‘cable television’ service contract; if broadband Internet access is necessary to deliver the video, does he have a broadband service contract with an Internet Service Provider, etc.) prior to sending it to the laptop computer.
- Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and/or systems described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and/or firmware, collectively, logic), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes are deployed. For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a hardware and/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a solely software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware. Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will require optically-oriented hardware, software, and or firmware.
- The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and/or examples.
