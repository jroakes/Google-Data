- the fingerprint module 302 includes code and routines that, when executed by processor 235, generates one or more fingerprints for an uploaded content file (e.g., a video file) and stores generated fingerprints in the fingerprint storage 128.
- the fingerprint is data that is an identifier of the uploaded content file.
- the fingerprint is data such as an audio signature or a combination of an audio signature and a video signature for a video file. Other fingerprints are known in the art.
- the uploaded content file can be any type of content file.
- an uploaded content file includes one or more UGVCs such as clips, homage videos, parodies and any other short form videos that are uploaded by users 125.
- the fingerprint identifies the uploaded content file.
- the uploaded content file also includes one or more of canonical music videos, interviews and trailers that are uploaded by content providers 1 18.
- one or more of the canonical music videos, interviews and trailers are related to a target content file (e.g., a long form video such as a full version movie).
- the fingerprint module 302 also generates fingerprints for long form content files, such as full version movies, shows, television programs, etc.
- the fingerprint module 302 transmits generated fingerprints to the fingerprint storage 128 and stores the fingerprints there for future use.
- the fingerprint module 302 generates fingerprints for uploaded content files periodically at a pre-determined time interval (such as, an hour, a day, a week, etc.). For example, the fingerprint module 302 analyzes the uploaded video files and generates the fingerprints for the video files in batches. In another embodiment, the fingerprint module 302 generates a fingerprint for an uploaded content file contemporaneous to the uploading of the content file by a user 125 or a content provider 1 18.
- the user activity module 304 includes code and routines that, when executed by the processor 235, retrieves data describing user activity in relation to the uploaded content file (e.g., social data) from the user activity storage 192 and analyzes the data to determine data describing the target content file (e.g., metadata such as a title of the target content file). For example, the user activity module 304 retrieves data describing user activity regarding a video file included on one or more third party sites 186 (such as social network sites, blog websites, microblog websites, messaging boards, e-mail services, video hosting sites, etc.) and other video hosting sites such as the asset hosting site 100 (as described above with reference to the user activity storage 192).
- the data can describe, for example, comments, blog and microblog posts and video responses made by one or more users 125 with reference to a video file.
- the data can also include profile information and registration information of a user 125 who uploaded the video file.
- the user activity module 304 retrieves data describing the websites visited by a user 125 before, during and after viewing a video file, a history of websites visited by viewers 125, the searches done by a user 125 before, during and after viewing a video file, a viewers' 125 search history, etc.
- the data retrieved by the user activity module 304 includes metadata associated with the uploaded content file, such as metadata describing a title, an artist, an actor/actress, a director, a band, an upload entity that uploaded the content file, a tag, etc.
- the user activity module 304 analyzes the retrieved data that is associated with the uploaded content file. In one embodiment, the user activity module 304 determines one or more topics and/or one or more keywords from the data associated with the uploaded content file. The user activity module 304 maps videos to the topics and/or keywords. If there is a mapping between a video and at least one of the topics and/or keywords, the user activity module 304 determines the video as one target content file. In this way, the user activity module 304 determines one or more target content files. [0130] Assume, for example, that a long form movie exists and is titled "Space Aliens
- a user 125 is on an asset hosting site 100 and posts a comment for a short form video that states "This is my favorite scene from the movie ' Space Aliens Attack Mountain View' ! From the keyword/topic in the comment, the user activity module 304 determines that there is a mapping to the movie "Space Aliens Attack Mountain View.” Therefore, the user activity module 304 determines the long form version of the movie as the target content file. The user activity module 304 transmits metadata describing the target content file, such as the title of the movie, to the matching module 306.
- the target content file includes other related content files as well as the long form content file.
- a long form or full version movie is determined as a target content file.
- a trailer of the full version movie, an interview of an actor in the movie and other videos in relation to the full version movie are also determined as target content files.
- other short form videos and clips related to the uploaded content file are determined as target content files.
- the user activity module 304 retrieves data describing user activities in relation to one or more uploaded content files from the user activity storage 192 and analyzes the retrieved data periodically at an interval (such as, an hour, a day, a week, etc.) defined by an administrator of the asset hosting site 100.
- the user activity module 304 retrieves data describing user activities in relation to an uploaded content file from the user activity storage 192 and analyzes the retrieved data
- the user activity module 304 is described in more detail below with reference to Figure 7.
- the matching module 306 includes code and routines that, when executed by the processor 235, determines one or more target content files matching an uploaded content file.
- the matching module 306 determines one or more target content files (e.g., one or more long form video files) related to the uploaded content file.
- the uploaded content file is a UGVC, e.g., with a title "Favorite action movies" including three clips from three different action movies that are the user's 125 favorites. Accordingly, the matching module 306 determines the three full version action movies as target content files.
- the matching module 306 determines one or more matching target content files by searching and identifying matching fingerprints. For example, a user 125 uploads a short form video file (e.g., any type of UGVC) to the asset hosting site 100. The fingerprint module 302 generates a first fingerprint for the uploaded short form video file and communicates with the matching module 306 to transmit the generated fingerprint to the matching module 306. The matching module 306 receives a first fingerprint for the uploaded content file and queries the fingerprint storage 128 for existing fingerprints matching the first fingerprint. Based at least in part on one or more of the existing fingerprints matching the first fingerprint, the matching module 306 determines one or more matching target content files (such as, a full version movie from which the clip was taken) for the uploaded content file.
- a short form video file e.g., any type of UGVC
- the matching module 306 determines one or more matching target content files based at least in part on one or more determinations of the user activity module 304. For example, the matching module 306 receives a title of a full version movie from the user activity module 304 and determines it as the target content file. In yet another embodiment, the matching module 306 determines the matching target content file based on both fingerprints matching and one or more determinations of the user activity module 304. [0136] In one embodiment, the matching module 306 queries the video database 1 16 for the matching target content file (such as a full version movie and various videos related to the full version movie) after determining the matching target content file. In one embodiment, the matching module 306 queries the video database 1 16 to identify all the matching video files uploaded by the users 125 (i.e., videos having the same content as the matching target content files).
- the matching module 306 searches the video database 1 16 for other related videos. For example, a short form video is related to a long form video of an episode of a television show, and the episode is not stored in the video database 116. In this case the matching module 306 searches the video database 1 16 for other related videos, such as other episodes from the same show.
- the matching module 306 transmits a request for the target content file and/or a request for the target data describing the target content file to the query module 155 via the communication interface 202.
- the matching module 306 queries the universal database 161 included in the asset hosting site 100 for the target content file and/or the target data describing the target content file.
- the matching module 306 queries the universal database 161 for the target data and the target content file using a search query that includes a title and/or a content identifier ("content ID") of the target content file.
- the matching module 306 retrieves the target content file and/or the target data from the universal database 161.
- the target data is described above with reference to the query module 155.
- the matching module 306 transmits the matching results to the GUI module 126.
- the matching results are any combination of a long form video related to the short form uploaded video (e.g., a full version movie, an episode of a television show, etc.) and various other videos related to the long form video (e.g., trailers, interviews, etc.).
- the matching results also include target data that describes the target content file.
- the matching module 306 also transmits the results to the authority module 308 and the linking enablement module 310.
- the authority module 308 includes code and routines that, when executed by the processor 235, determines a territory limitation for a target content file. For example, a user 125a uploads a first video file and indicates that the first video can only be viewed by other users 125 in certain geographic territories. The geographic territory of a user 125 is identifiable by the authority module 308, for example, by the internet protocol ("IP") address of the user 125.
- IP internet protocol
- the uploading user 125a also uploads other versions of the first video file (one or more other versions of the first video file are referred to collectively as the second video) and indicates that they are viewable by other users 125 in territories different than those identified for the first video.
- the first video is indicated as viewable by users 125 in the United States and Canada, but the second video is indicated as viewable by users 125 in Mexico and Honduras.
- the authority module 308 analyzes the target content files and determines the territorial limitations for the target content files. In one embodiment, the authority module 308 queries the video database 116 for one or more video files that (1) have content that is the same as the target content file and (2) have territorial limitations that are different than that of the target content file. In this way the authority module 308 identifies different content files having the same content but different territorial limitations.
- the authority module 308 identifies an alternative target content file that has the same content as the target content file and has a different territorial limitation that allows it to be viewed in the United Kingdom. [0143] In one embodiment, the authority module 308 identifies in the video database
- the link generation module 206 identifies all the content files that have the same content as the target content file, identifies the territories in which these files can be played, and generates at least one link per identified territory. These links are then embedded in one or more web pages including a playable version of the uploaded content file.
- the authority module 308 also determines if the target content file is a private file or a public file.
- a private file is a file (e.g., a video file) that is uploaded by an uploading entity such as a content provider 118 or a user 125 and identified by the uploading entity as being private and not authorized for viewing by others.
- the authority module 308 identifies a content ID such as a video ID for the target content file in the video database 116. The authority module 308 uses the content ID as an index to check if the content file is specified by its uploading entity as being private.
- the authority module 308 determines that the target content file is a private file, the authority module 308 identifies an alternative public target content file having content that is the same as the private file. For example, the authority module 308 identifies an input by the user 125 (or the content provider 1 18) specifying that the target video file is private. The authority module 308 queries the video database 1 16 to identity a public video file having the same content as the private target video file.
- the authority module 308 transmits to the linking enablement module 310 one or more public target content files that have territorial limitations applicable to a user 125 who requests a GUI showing an uploaded content file on a client device 115.
- the linking enablement module 310 includes code and routines that, when executed by the processor 235, retrieves the linking inputs from the user enablement inputs storage 196 and determines if the linking is enabled. For example, the authority module 308 determines a public target content file that has an applicable territorial limitation, the linking enablement module 310 queries the user enablement inputs 196 and determines whether linking to the public target content file is enabled by its owner. In another example, the linking enablement module 310 implements the above steps after the matching module 306 determines a matching target content file.

- the uploaded content file is a UGVC, such as a clip, a homage video, a parody, etc.
- the targeting module 204 determines one or more target content files. In one embodiment, the targeting module 204 determines a group of target content files for a group of uploaded content files periodically at a pre-determined interval. In another embodiment, the targeting module 204 determines a target content file for an uploaded content file contemporaneous to the receiving of the uploaded content file.
- the link generation module 206 generates one or more links to the target content file. For example, the link generation module 206 receives a determination from the targeting module 204. If the determination indicates that the linking to the target content file is enabled, the link generation module 206 then generates a link to the target content file. If the determination indicates that the linking to the target content file is not enabled, the link generation module 206 does not generate the link accordingly.
- the GUI module 126 adds the link to one or more web pages. For example, the GUI module 126 generates a web page that includes a playable version of the uploaded content file.

In one embodiment, the matching module 306 searches existing fingerprints stored in the fingerprint storage 128 for one or more fingerprints matching the first fingerprint. At step 610, the matching module 306 determines a matching target content file based at least in part on the existing fingerprints matching the first fingerprint. In one embodiment, the matching target content file has a fingerprint matching the first fingerprint. In another embodiment, the matching module 306 determines more than one matching target content files that have fingerprints matching the first fingerprint. [0166] At step 612, the linking enablement module 310 receives one or more linking inputs for the matching target content file from the user enablement inputs 196.
- a linking input indicates whether the publisher or the owner (e.g., a content provider 118, a user 125) of the target content file has an authorized linking to the matching target content file. If more than one matching target content files have been determined by the matching module 306 at step 610, the linking enablement module 310 receives linking inputs for the more than one matching target content files.
- the linking enablement module 310 determines whether the linking is enabled based at least on the one or more linking inputs. If the linking is not enabled (i.e., the owner or the publisher does not have an authorized linking to the matching target content file), then the method 600 proceeds to step 616.

- the user activity module 304 analyzes the data describing user activities in relation to the uploaded content file and determines a matching target content file. For example, the user activity module 304 parses comments for an uploaded video clip and determines that the uploaded video clip is related to a long form version of a movie.
- the uploaded content file is a clip made from a long form version of a movie and a comment for the clip states "Wow, this clip is from 'Aliens Attack Mountain View.'"
- the user activity module 304 therefore determines based at least in part on the keyword of this comment that the clip is related to the long form version of the movie "Aliens Attack Mountain View.”
- the user activity module 304 determines the long form version of the movie "Aliens Attack Mountain View” as the matching target content file.
- the linking enablement module 310 receives one or more target content file linking inputs.
- the linking enablement module 310 determines whether the linking is enabled by the publisher or owner of the matching target content file according to the one or more linking inputs. If the linking is not enabled, then the method 700 proceeds to step 716.
- the link generation module 206 does not generate a link to the matching target content file. If the linking is enabled, then the method proceeds to step 718.
- the link generation module 206 generates a link to the matching target content file.
- the GUI module 126 adds the link to a web page. In one embodiment, the GUI module 126 adds the link to a web page for playing the uploaded content file. In another embodiment, the GUI module 126 adds the link to a web page including a target content file pipeline.
- Figures 8A-8B are flow diagrams depicting one embodiment of a method 800 for generating links of content files for different territories.
- the method 800 also starts with that the upload server 108 receives and stores 802 an uploaded content file.
- the method 800 is the same as that described above in the method 700 with reference to steps 704-710. Accordingly, this description will not be repeated here.
- the authority module 308 identifies content identifier for the target content file. For example, the authority module 308 identifies a video ID for a target video file by querying the video database 1 16.
- the authority module 308 determines whether the target content file is a private file or a public file. For example, the authority module 308 queries the video database 1 16 using a video ID for the target video file as the search criteria and retrieves the specification of the target video file. Based on the specification, the authority module 308 determines if the target video file is specified by its owner or publisher as a public file. If the target content file is a public file, the method 800 proceeds to step 816.
- the authority module 308 determines territories for the target content file. For example, the authority module 308 analyzes the IP address of the user 125 who requests to view the uploaded content file and determines the geographic territory of the user 125, such as in the United States. In one embodiment, the authority module 308 also determines a territorial limitation for the target content file, such as a territorial limitation that allows the target content file to be viewable to the users 125 in the United Kingdom.
- step 818 the authority module 308 identifies an alternative public file in the video database 116 and then the method 800 proceeds to step 816.
- the alternative public file has the same content as the private file.
- the authority module 308 identifies one or more alternative public files for each territory. In one embodiment, if the territorial limitation for the target content file (such as being viewable in the United Kingdom) is not applicable to the geographic territory of the user 125 (such as the in the United States), the authority module 308 identifies an alternative public target content file with a applicable territorial limitation (such as being viewable in the United States) in the video database 116.
- the authority module 308 identifies one or more alternative public files with territorial limitations other than the territorial limitation of the target content file in order for more users 125 to view the same content as that of the target content file.
- the public content files for different territories are different, although they have the same contents.
- the authority module 308 identifies an alternative public file for the users 125 in the United States and Canada. Therefore the authority module 308 determines the alternative public target content file to enlarge the number of viewers.
- the step 820 is depicted in Figure 8B using a dotted line to indicate that it is an optional step of the method 800.
- the linking enablement module 310 receives one or more target content file linking inputs for each territory.
- the linking enablement module 310 determines whether the linking to the target content file for each territory is enabled by the publisher or owner according to the one or more linking inputs. If the linking to the target content file for a territory is not enabled, then the method 800 proceeds to step 826.
- step 826 the link generation module 206 does not generate a link to the target content file for the territory. If the linking to the target content file for a territory is enabled, then the method 800 proceeds to step 828.
- the link generation module 206 generates a link to the target content file for the territory.
- the GUI module 126 adds the link to a web page. In one embodiment, the GUI module 126 adds the link to a web page for playing the uploaded content file. In another embodiment, the GUI module 126 adds the link to a web page including a target content file pipeline.
- FIG. 9 is a flow diagram depicting one embodiment of a method 900 for generating a rich web page for a target content file.
- the method 900 also starts with that the upload server 108 receives and stores 902 an uploaded content file.
- the method 900 is the same as that described above in the method 700 with reference to steps 704-706.
- the method 900 is the same as that described above in the method 700 with reference to step 710. Accordingly, this description will not be repeated here.
- the matching module 306 retrieves target data for the target content file from the universal database 161.
- the matching module 306 queries the universal database 161 for the target data using a search query that includes a title and/or a content ID of the target content file.
- the matching module 306 retrieves the target data for the target content file from the universal database 161.
- the GUI module 126 generates a rich web page based at least in part on the target data.
- the GUI module 126 receives the retrieved target data from the matching module 306.
- the GUI module 126 generates a rich web page using the target data such as title data, movie release data, synopsis data, movie production data, review data, playback option data and related content file data.
- the rich web page includes the user interface shown in the Figure 4B or the Figure 4C.
- modules, routines, features, attributes, methodologies and other aspects of the disclosure can be implemented as software, hardware, firmware or any combination of the three.
- a component an example of which is a module, of the specification is implemented as software
- the component can be implemented as a standalone program, as part of a larger program, as a plurality of separate programs, as a statically or dynamically linked library, as a kernel loadable module, as a device driver, and/or in every and any other way known now or in the future to those of ordinary skill in the art of computer programming.
- the disclosure is in no way limited to implementation in any specific programming language, or for any specific operating system or environment. Accordingly, the disclosure is intended to be illustrative, but not limiting, of the scope of the specification, which is set forth in the following claims.
