The application requires to enjoy in the application No.60/744 that submitted on March 31st, 2006 according to 35U.S.C. § 119 (e), and 091 and the application No.11/427 that submits on June 29th, 2006,678 rights and interests, this paper is incorporated in described application by reference into.
Technical field
The present invention relates generally to information retrieval system, relate more specifically to the disambiguation (disambiguation) of the named entity (named entity) in document and inquiry.
Background technology
Search to named entity is that Web goes up one of modal search.The search of these types comprises the search to people, place (comprising geographic position and city, state, country etc.), enterprise and other tissue, product, books, film or the like.Usually, named entity is to have the proper noun (or noun phrase) that is associated with it or anything of proprietary name.The search of named entity typically returned have about having the search result set with the relevant information of any entity of the identical title (or even its part) of inquiry.Therefore, to the inquiry of " Long Beach (long beach) " return probably about the document in the coastal cities of New York Long Island, about the document in the coastal cities of Southern California and with word " long (length) " and " beach (seabeach) " relevant document.Similarly, to the inquiry of " John Williams (John's WILLIAMS-DARLING Ton) " will return document about composer, about wrestler's document and venture capitalist, they share this title; To the inquiry of " Python (python) " will return with the programming language document associated, with snake document associated and film.So potential problem is the inquiry to named entity ambiguity is arranged typically, and can refer to the different instances (different people that for example, has same names) of identical type or refer to things (for example kind of snake, programming language or film) in variety classes.
The Search Results that is used for named entity typically sorts according to frequency, page rank or the other factors of query terms, and does not consider the different meanings (for example different entities of name referring) of inquiring about.The Search Results relevant with different entities is easy to be mixed together.In addition, still because the different meanings of search system nonrecognition title, even so the user just typically searches for the best document (page) of describing named entity (or different entities of same names), Search Results also may not necessarily comprise such document or that such document ranking is very not high.
Summary of the invention
In one aspect of the invention, use the knowledge base of named entity article to come at searching period to the disambiguation of entity title.Knowledge base is to make up according to the database of document (article).Article comprises and the relevant article of named entity, entity that has such as the proprietary name of " John Williams " (people), " Long Beach " (place), " Python " (film, programming language and fatal snake).Some feature that provides the ability of other ambiguity entity title disambiguation is provided knowledge base.The text of article provides the context that is associated with the certain sense of title.Article also is included in the example of entity title and is linked to link between the article of this title.Article also comprises the redirected article that the alternative of title or another name is associated with specific named entity article.Article also comprises the disambiguation article to the different meaning disambiguations of ambiguity title.Partly use link information between the article that is associated that each example and title in the entity title be linked to learn relation between the certain sense of context and title.In the scoring model, safeguard the relation of being learned.
By the entity title in the identification inquiry, and use the scoring model to discern article with the close association of this entity title, so can be to comprising the search inquiry disambiguation of entity title and additional keyword.Use the title of disambiguation and the article the discerned Search Results that increases then, for example according to the entity grouping of being discerned or organize relevant documentation.
In another aspect of the present invention, the article (therefore also with named entity) in knowledge base is associated with classification.Learn the dynamics of the relation between named entity and classification and incorporate it into scoring model, and also use it to come comprising the inquiry disambiguation of entity title.
In another aspect of the present invention, the scoring model can be used for discerning the entity that is not included in the knowledge base.
The present invention has various embodiment, and it comprises as computer implemented process, as computer equipment, as integrated circuit and as the computer program of carrying out on universal or special processor.

Only be used for illustrative purposes, accompanying drawing has been described various embodiment of the present invention.Those skilled in the art will recognize from following argumentation easily, can use the alternate embodiment in structure shown in this and method under the situation that does not deviate from principle of the present invention described here.
Embodiment
Refer now to Fig. 1, show the system architecture of information retrieval system according to an embodiment of the invention.In this embodiment, system 100 comprises directory system 110, search system 120, display systems 130, front-end server 140, named entity knowledge base 150, dictionary module 155, named entity dictionary 160, disambiguation module 170 and data preparation module 180.System 100 is connected with knowledge base 200 interfaces of article, and described article comprises the article about named entity.System 100 is couple to network, and can be visited by the client terminal device of any kind by such network.
This system has two basic operational phases: generate the set of named entity of disambiguation and the disambiguation rank model 230 of the relation between representation feature and the named entity; And the second, during query processing, use disambiguation rank model 230 to discern and to comprising the inquiry disambiguation of entity title.
Whole operations during generation phase are as follows.The dictionary (data set) that dictionary module 155 is extracted named entity from knowledge base 200 forms named entity dictionary 160.From knowledge base 200 extract be included in named entity dictionary 160 the article that is associated of named entity form named entity knowledge base 150.Structure of hyperlinks between the context (more universal characteristics) of data preparation module 180 use named entity dictionaries 160 and article in named entity knowledge base 150 and named entity article is created disambiguation data set 220.Disambiguation data set 220 also can comprise the classification information that is used to discern the classification that is associated with each named entity.Disambiguation module 170 uses disambiguation data sets 220 to learn from the contextual word of inquiry with from the dynamics of the relation between the classification of category classification.Disambiguation rank model 230 is used for to comprising (any kind) inquiry disambiguation of title, so that help retrieval document associated with the query.
Whole operations of subordinate phase are as follows.As the pioneer who handles inquiry, by visiting various websites 190 and other collection of document, directory system 110 is responsible for coming document is carried out index according to document content (for example word, word, medium); Directory system 110 establishment index and content data base 115 are for using in retrieval.Front-end server 140 receives inquiry from the user of client 175, and these inquiries are offered search system 120.Inquiry can be the information for any kind, but interested at this is the inquiry that comprises the title of (or potential comprising) entity, in named entity knowledge base 150, have the named entity article for the title of described entity.
Under situation of the present invention, to use term " article ", and it is understood to include can searched engine index and the medium of any kind of retrieval, comprises web document, image, multimedia file, text document, PDF or other picture format file or the like.Term " article " also can exchange with term " document " and use.Document can have one or more pages, subregion, sections or other assembly, to be suitable for its content and type.Ground of equal value, document can be called as " page ", as is commonly used to refer to the document on the Internet.The use of generic term " document " or " article " does not hint the restriction about scope of the present invention.System 100 operates on the large-scale article storehouse such as the Internet and WWW, but it also can be used in more limited set, such as the collection of document that is used for library or individual enterprise.In either case, should be appreciated that article typically is distributed in a plurality of different departments of computer science and unifies on the website.So do not lose generality, do not consider form or position (for example which website or database), article will be collectively referred to as storehouse or collection of document usually.Each article has the identifier that is associated of unique identification this article; Identifier is URL preferably, but also can use the identifier (for example number of documents) of other type.In the disclosure, suppose and use URL to discern article.
Because specific entity or notion described in each article, so term " entity " or " named entity " also will be used to refer to the entity of article description; Term " named entity article " will be used to refer to the article about the specific named entity.Term " entity title " will be used to refer to the proprietary name of named entity, and it also can be the title (or title can be obtained from the entity title, or vice versa) of named entity article.In the situation of estimating inquiry, should be appreciated that named entity in the identification inquiry (or article) is the title process of appearance in inquiry (or article) whether of determining named entity.
Symbol below now introducing:
The collection of all named entities of E=in knowledge base 200.
Any named entity of e ∈ E=.
E.title=is about the title of the article of e.
E.text=is about the text of the article of e (also can be represented as e.T, wherein T is the text set of all articles of being associated with e).
Usually, between title and entity, there is the multi-to-multi correspondence.These relations promptly are redirected article and disambiguation article by two additional structures and are trapped in the knowledge base 200.
Be redirected article and refer to that for being used to each alternative title of the entity in the knowledge base 200 exists.The alternative title is used as the title of article, and this article comprises the redirect link of sensing about the actual named entity article of entity.The alternative title also can be understood that the another name of the title of entity.The alternative title can comprise synonym, misspelling or alternative spelling, initialism, common title, full name, slang title, translation or indicate any alternate manner of special entity.For example, title " John Towner Williams (John Tao Na WILLIAMS-DARLING Ton) " is full name of composer John Williams, therefore is used as composer's alternative title.Therefore, the redirected article with title " John Towner Williams " is included in the knowledge base 200, and it comprises the redirect link (or other pointer) of the named entity article of sensing " John Williams (composer) ".Another example that can have the entity of a plurality of direct pages is named entity " United States (U.S.) ".The misspellings that the redirected page also can be used to title (for example, " Untied States "), initialism (for example, " USA ", " U.S. ", " U.S.A. ") and translation is (for example, " LosEstados Unidos "), synonym (for example, " America (U.S.) ").The collection symbolically of all alternative titles of and named entity article that be redirected to this entity that be associated with given named entity e is e.R.
For example, for entity " United States ", below be suitable for:
e＝United?States
e.title＝″United?States″
e.R＝{″USA″，″U.S.A″，″U.S.″，″US″，″Estados?Unidos″，″America″，″Untied?States″，...}
As mentioned above, some entity titles have ambiguity, because it can refer to the different instances of the things of identical type, or even not congener things.In the situation of knowledge base 200, the ambiguity title can refer to two or more different articles.Therefore, for each ambiguity title, knowledge base 200 further comprises enumerating of different meanings that the ambiguity title can have.In one embodiment, the enumerating of different meanings that in the disambiguation page, has title.As an alternative, it can be expressed as the disambiguation page and list all the named entity articles that can be represented by specific ambiguity entity title.For each different meaning of ambiguity title, there is the description that is associated of title with this meaning.For example, for named entity " John Williams ", the disambiguation page can be listed a plurality of different entities with this same names.As another example, consider entity Venus (Venus), and title " Morning Star (stars at dawn) " and " Evening Star (evening star) ".Each all has ambiguity these titles, but the both refers to entity Venus; Therefore each of these titles all has the ambiguity page that is associated, and the described ambiguity page comprises as " Venus " that quote (and sensing is about link of the named entity article of " Venus ").
Therefore,, will exist as by being redirected the indicated non-ambiguity title collection that is associated with this entity of title of the page, and this special entity will be listed as one additional ambiguity title collection in the meaning of ambiguity title for given named entity.For given entity e, e.D is the title collection that its disambiguation page comprises the link (or as an alternative, listing e at least) of pointing to e.
The other feature of knowledge base 200 is uses of classification.Each article in knowledge base 200 all is associated with one or more classifications.With theme-subtopic level (being also referred to as category classification), preferably come tissue class with directed acyclic graph.Can be by class formative (label) be associated with each article, or carry out association by the independent tabulation that maintenance is included in the article in each classification, described tabulation is included in the title of the entity in this classification or points to the URL of its article separately (or the quoting of other type, for example document id).For example, composer John Williams can be associated with classification " Star Wars music (Star War music) ", " 20th century classical composers (classic composer of 20th century) ", " Film scorecomposer (film sound tracks composer) ", " Music (music) " or the like.Classification also can have the title identical with named entity.Therefore, " Venus " both can be classification, also can be the named entity that has the named entity article for it; Can be with named entity article " Venus " with more generally classification " Planets (planet) " and " Solar System (solar system) " be associated.For given named entity e, e.C is the collection of the classification that belongs to of e.Entity is considered to belong to its direct classification and all its higher level (ancestor) classifications in the classification level.Fig. 2 show a plurality of named entity e (in " title " row, listing), with and the redirected title that is associated (in " being redirected " row, listing), the title (in " disambiguation " row, listing) of listing the disambiguation page of entity and the example of its classification that is associated (in " classification " is listed as, listing).
Article in knowledge base 200 will comprise usually for it and exist the carrying of named entity of corresponding named entity article to state (or " example ").When mentioning the named entity of this class, the title of this named entity is linked to corresponding named entity article via hyperlink.Preferably use two types link: link and pipeline chaining.Fig. 3 shows from the code extracts 300 of the article in the knowledge base 200 and the example of its corresponding videotex 302.The title of character string " Rome " the expression named entity article in link 306, so this character string also appears in the videotex 302 as anchor point (anchor) text (be depicted as and underline) of hypertext link.In pipeline chaining 304, the title of named entity article " Vatican City (the Vatican) " is illustrated in pipeline symbol " | " before; Character string after the pipeline symbol " Vatican " is the character string that occurs as contact names in videotex 302.The use of pipeline chaining allows the author of the article in the knowledge base 200 to use various title to quote or be linked to given named entity article.Link also provides the useful disambiguation example of training disambiguation module.
In one embodiment, dictionary module 155 is following from knowledge base 200 generation title d.Fig. 6 shows this process.The group name that dictionary module 155 is used for detecting named entity claims recognition rule to handle the title of each article of 600 knowledge bases 200.In one embodiment, the title recognition rule is as follows:
If e.title is many words title, then only when all notional words be capitalization at the first bruss e be named entity;
If e.title comprises at least two uppercase word titles, then e is a named entity;
If the title at least 75% that occurs in article is the capitalization beginning, then e is a named entity.
The named entity of first rule identification such as " United States " or " Name of the Rose (name of rose) ".It should be noted that at this and not consider stop word (for example, preposition, article or the like).The initialism of second rule identification such as " NATO " or " LAGQ ".Three sigma rule is identified in the title of the entity in other situation, and wherein title does not satisfy preceding two rules, but the usage of title indication author thinks that title is proprietary name phrase (so it is with the capitalization beginning) in article; Certainly use the threshold quantity except that 75%.The rule that can use other or add more freely or more conservatively discerns named entity, and can use other rule to other Languages, and it uses different agreements (phraseological and syntactical) to represent proprietary name.
Preferably, this identifying takes place automatically; Do not need operator artificially review result (may surpass in the large scale knowledge base of 500,000 named entities especially therein).In addition, when knowledge base 200 is added new article, can call dictionary module 155 each time and whether determine it about named entity, and identification be included in named entity in the main body of article add carry and stating.
The title d.title of named entity article,
Title collection d.R, it is the redirected title of d, and
Title collection d.D, it is the disambiguation title of d.
Therefore, for given title d, the entity set d.E that exists d in knowledge base 200, to represent; And if only if d=e.title or d is one of the redirected title of e (d ∈ e.R) or d when being one of title to the e disambiguation (d ∈ e.D), and specific named entity e is included among this collection d.E.
From named entity dictionary 160 and knowledge base 200, named entity article collection (being that its title is included in the article the named entity dictionary 160), (for example, extract, duplicate, index or the like) named entity knowledge base 165 that dictionary module 155 creates 604.Therefore, this knowledge base 165 all disambiguation articles of comprising all named entity articles (comprising its hyperlink), being redirected to all redirected articles of any named entity article and comprising the title (or point to its link) of named entity article.For each named entity, for the certain articles of the signification that is used for title, article, its redirected title with and the disambiguation title between carry out association.Therefore, a kind of mode that this stage is considered is, knowledge base 200 cut apart (or mirror image) and become only to comprise subdata base (150) about the article of named entity.Its by to the contextual analysis based on heuristic method of the title of article and such title by program finish.
Aspect generation phase next, data preparation module 180 is created 606 disambiguation data sets 220, and it is used as the training data of disambiguation module 170.Data preparation module 180 is examples that are used to generate the device of disambiguation data set.An embodiment of data preparation module 180 operates as follows.
As mentioned above, for given title (" John Williams "), the article that comprises the example of this title in the various contexts will be existed in.When discussing composer in the article some can comprise title " John Williams "; Other article can comprise identical title when discussing the wrestler.In each case, according to the named entity knowledge base of discussing with reference to figure 3 in the above 150 (or as an alternative, also in knowledge base 200) structure, these examples are linked (via link or pipeline chaining) to suitable named entity article, promptly about the article of the entity just discussed.In addition, the context that occurs therein of entity title (sentence, paragraph or the like that for example, comprise this title) provides the data source of the signification with the particular instance that is used for title.Therefore, data preparation module 180 uses these aspects of named entity knowledge base 150 to make up disambiguation data set 200.This data set has following structure.
For illustrative purposes, and do not lose any generality, term " inquiry " is used for the appearance of presentation-entity title in article at this.If in inquiry q, have the entity title, make represented entity set q.E comprise at least two entities, one of them is the correct entity q.e that is linked to the appearance of title, then will inquire about q and be included in data centralization.More properly, if q.E comprises n named entity e
1, e
2..., e
nTitle, then utilize n to { q, e
kCome amplification data collection 200, be expressed as follows:
{q，e
k}＝[δ(e
k，q.e)|q.text|e
k.title]
It is the word that occurs in the finite length window at center that territory q.text is included in the proprietary name.In one embodiment, window size is set to 55, and it is the value that optimum performance can be provided in striding the inter-related task that document quotes mutually, although can use other value far and away.Work as e
kWith link in the entity q.e that quotes when identical, your (Kronecker) δ function δ (e of Kronecker
k, be 1 q.e).In other words, when existence has a plurality of different entities of same names (for example " John Williams "), then for the given article of the link example that comprises this title, such as the article of description classical music, to be 1 for your the δ function setup of Kronecker of named entity article " John Williams (composer) ", in fact linking of wherein being associated with the title example be linked to this named entity article.For all other named entity articles that are associated with title " John Williams ", be 0 with the δ function setup.Therefore, from can all entities by the title case representation, the entity of this mark indicating correct.Therefore, disambiguation data set 220 provides the collection to the data of each example disambiguation of the entity title in the named entity knowledge base 150.
In one embodiment, data preparation module 180 uses following method to make up disambiguation data set 220.For each the named entity article in the named entity knowledge base 150, the text of data preparation module 180 traversal articles is with identification hyperlink wherein.Handle text and comprise other expression of process source code, DOM Document Object Model, index or article at this.For example, by comprising＜href〉and other known markers can in HTML, discern hyperlink.In each hyperlink of discerning, with the title that exists as the entity of the anchor text that links.
For each entity title of discerning, data preparation module 180 is via the next definite one group of article that is associated with this entity title searched in named entity dictionary 160.In these named entities one will be the named entity of the title of the article that is linked to by hyperlink; All the other will be other articles (title that for example, has non-coupling).By the article that linked be entity title (for example " John Williams ") example, example context (for example, " BostonPops conductor John Williams led the symphony in the debut of TreeSong, (the conductor John of Boston orchestra WILLIAMS-DARLING Ton is commanded symphony to Concerto for Violin and Orchestra. in the first performance of the song of violin and orchestral concerto tree.) ") and himself positive example of (" John Williams (composer) ") of named entity article.For this tuple, δ function mark is set to " 1 ".For each residue tuple, it is another the combination in entity title, same context and the article, and mark is set to " 0 ".
Fig. 4 shows the sub-fraction 400 of disambiguation data set 220, only is used for illustrative purposes.At this, selected data 400 comprise three different tuples (OK) of data, are produced by the example of title " John Williams " three various combinations with three different articles (being illustrated by three in row 406 different named entity article titles) of this entity title of coupling.Query text (q.text) 404 that comprises current example is shown in the middle column.In the mode of foregoing description, the example of " John Williams " will be link, and this link will cover quoting of named entity article.
For first tuple, hyperlink comprises the named entity article that the article quoted in its title " John Williams (composer) " and the hyperlink is complementary.For this tuple, δ function mark 402 is set to " 1 ".Other article of " John Williams " that two other clauses and subclauses are used to have the entity title, for example, clauses and subclauses are used for the named entity article of " John Williams (wrestler) " and " John Williams (VC) ".Because the title of these articles is not complementary with the title that is included in the hyperlink, so mark 402 is set to " 0 ".Though this is the basic example of the content of disambiguation data set 220, what expect is also can comprise additional context data, metadata or out of Memory.
At first, certain part with disambiguation data set 220 is chosen as training part (another part can be chosen as model validation).For simple purpose, will this part be called disambiguation data set 220.
For each tuple in the data set 220, disambiguation module 170 is applied to inquiry (for example, the example of the entity title in the article) with score function and names the combination of article self, i.e. score (q, e
k).Score function is a function of determining the correlativity (or similarity) of inquiry and article, and therefore context-article similarity score value is provided.Can use any correlativity or similarity score function, and different disambiguation methods within the scope of the invention can use different score functions, because employed specific function is not crucial.
An operable score function is based on the cosine similarity between the text of the context of inquiry and article:
In this embodiment, expression component q.text and e in the standard vector space model
k.text, wherein each component is corresponding with the word in the vocabulary, and term weighing is standard tf * idf score value.The vocabulary V of word (word or expression) is that the article storehouse from knowledge base 200 obtains.For each stem w, determine its document frequency df (w).Abandon stop word and too frequently or too rare word.Generic document (article) d is represented as the vector of length then | and V|, wherein each vocabulary word has a position.If f (w) is the frequency of word w in document d, and N is the sum of the article in the knowledge base 200, and then the weight of word w is in tf * idf of d represents:
Use all score functions as the aforementioned, disambiguation module 170 can be operated as follows.For given inquiry (entity title), module is from named entity dictionary 160 definite entities that are associated with title.For each such entity, the score function that disambiguation module 170 calculates between the context of named entity article and inquiry.This produces for example cosine similarity score value (or other correlativity type score value) between named entity article and this inquiry.Via following main ranking function, the highest scoring named entity article is identified as the correct article that is used for the title disambiguation:
If ê=q.e, then ê provides the named entity of the signification of q.
Refer again to Fig. 1, an embodiment of query processing now is described in further detail.During the query processing to general search, search system 120 will receive the generic inquiry from client 175.This inquiry can comprise entity title (or a plurality of entity title).Therefore, search system 120 is delivered to dictionary module 155 with inquiry and determines to use the title recognition rule whether inquiry comprises the entity title.This rule can be applied to whole inquiry, or is applied to its part (for example, using moving window on query terms).If discerned the entity title, then dictionary module 155 is returned the tabulation of named entity to search system 120.Search system 120 is delivered to disambiguation module 170 with the tabulation of named entity with whole inquiry.Disambiguation module 170 uses disambiguation scoring model 230 to handle inquiry and named entity.Disambiguation module 170 returns the result of the identification of the entity that can comprise correct disambiguation to search system 120, and top n scoring entity.Search system 120 uses these results to organize and the rank document relevant with Search Results, for example according to the rank of the forward scoring entity document that divides into groups.
In another embodiment of the present invention, further use the classification information that is associated with each named entity article to come to the named entity disambiguation.When the same word of using in the inquiry about such entity of no use of the word in being included in article was described named entity, this feature was useful.For example, word " conduct (commander) " and " concert (concert) " may be because some be former thereby do not occur in the article about composer John WILLIAMS-DARLING Ton.If receive the inquiry of " John Williams concert (concert of John's WILLIAMS-DARLING Ton) ", then for identification this article so that to title " John Williams " disambiguation, these words will be can be therefore not useful.If for example article is too brief, imperfect or only use synonym, then related words may not can occur in article.
More formally, at q and e
kBetween cosine similarity (or other relevance score) can be counted as from the contextual word of inquiry q and be used for given named entity e
kThe named entity article between the expression of total degree of association.When because be used for named entity e
kArticle do not comprise and e
kAll relevant words and when making association too low, at context words and e
kAssociation between the classification that belongs to is considerable.
With reference to figure 5, show explanation to the potential inquiry of title " John Williams ".For fear of confusion, Fig. 5 has only described two entities 500 with title " JohnWilliams " in named entity knowledge base 150, composer and wrestler.On each entity, show in its classification that is associated 502 in the classification level (being respectively " Film scorecomposers (film sound tracks composer) " and " Professional wrestlers (Pro Wrestling sportsman) "), with and superclass 504 in some (for example, " composers (composers) " and " wrestlers (wrestler) ").Also show sample query context 506.In inquiry, word " concert (concert) " highlights.This word with and as the classification height correlation that is associated at left shown " John Williams (composer) ", and word with and as to have minuent in the classification that right-hand shown " John Williams (wrestler) " is associated related.Disambiguation module 170 is further learned the association between word and classification, then described association is included in the scoring model 230.
Proper vector Φ (q, e
k) comprise the feature that is used for context-article similarity score value
And with from the word w of vocabulary V and corresponding from the combination of the classification c of classification level C | V| * | the C| feature
Therefore, for each combination of word w in V and the classification c in C, if word w is included in the text of article q and c is in the classification of article one, then with proper vector
Therefore, in one embodiment, disambiguation module 170 is carried out the following processing of classification information.For each classification c, disambiguation module 170 definite article d that are associated with classification c; As above indicated, each in these articles has the word vector with it.Disambiguation module 170 is determined the categorization vector C as the vector sum of these article vectors d
iThis at first carries out the classification as the leaf of classification level, the classification at each superclass place is carried out again.This process is that all categories in the category classification has been set up not vector of a category.
Weight vectors W is to proper vector Φ (q, e
k) feature in each value modeling, comprise the weight of each word-classification association.Learn weight vectors by disambiguation data set 220 is trained, disambiguation data set 220 is amplified as mentioned above and comprises word-category feature.The weight vectors of being learned is used in the scoring model 230 then.
Refer again to Fig. 1, as previously mentioned, search system 120 can offer inquiry disambiguation module 170 and be used for disambiguation.Disambiguation module 170 uses the expansion embodiment of the scoring model 230 that comprises word-category feature, and returns one group of top n scoring entity, comprises the classification information that is used for each such entity.Points-scoring system 120 uses institute to discern also the entity and the classification information of disambiguation and organizes Search Results, and Search Results is offered display systems 130.
As another feature of system, disambiguation module 170 can be configured to discern the title of entity, does not have corresponding named entity article for described entity in named entity knowledge base 150.For example, as implied above, can have a plurality of articles relevant, but wherein neither one can be famous saxophonist about same names with " John Williams ".Therefore, can discern that not have the example of named entity of the article of the suitable meaning with title for it be useful.These " not in the know " entities are by single particular entity e
OutExpression.
In order to carry out such identification, disambiguation module 170 obtains the score value of the named entity article that is used to have same names as previously mentioned, according to its score value it is carried out rank then.Before the highest scoring named entity article was identified as correct article, disambiguation module 170 compared this score value and threshold value.Only when this score value during greater than threshold value, this article just is identified as correct article.If highest score is less than threshold value, then the neither one entity is correct.
More formally, the detection of entity not in the know can be included in the scoring model 230 in the following manner.For entity e
Out, its feature is set to null value, for example article text e
Out.T=" ", and classification collection e
Out.C={}.Upgrade basic ranking function (1) then, if make this score value greater than threshold tau, then it returns the named entity with highest score, and then it returns e to other situation
Out:
Wherein general ranking function (2) is to use the incompatible realization of set of weights of fundamental function, then should change at proper vector Φ (q, e
k) the middle feature of adding that produces
φ
out(q，e
k)＝δ(e
k，e
out)
In a word, scoring model 230 can be designed any combination that considers the different characteristic group to the disambiguation of entity title the time changeably: be illustrated in the similarity between the context of article and inquiry feature, be illustrated in article and with classification that this article is associated between related feature and the feature of representing entity not in the know.Additional feature also can be included in the scoring model 230 as one sees fit.For example, additional feature (for example can comprise link structure tolerance, page rank), based on the tolerance of theme, based on the epidemic popularity metric of score value, article of phrase, (for example, article author's reputation) reputation measures, tolerance (based on time limit of article) or the like recently.Therefore, the scoring model 230 at this should be understood that to adapt to neatly supplementary features and the realization that is used for to the named entity disambiguation.
The learning algorithm that is used by disambiguation module 170 may be implemented as support vector machine (SVM) or other supervised learning algorithm.As above indicated, can use kernel function at this.An embodiment uses the kernel version of the big allowance arrangement method of describing in 133-142 page or leaf (2002) Joachims in about the 8th the ACM SIGKDD international conference collection of thesis of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (Knowledge Discovery and data mining) " Optimizing search engines using click-through data (use point to advance data and come the optimization searching engine) ", and it solves the optimization problem of setting forth below:
Minimize:
Obey:
w(Φ(q，q.e)-Φ(q，e
k))≥1-ξ
q，k
ξ
q，k≥0
The purpose of this formula is to find weight vectors w, makes 1) minimize violated from the rank of disambiguation data set 220 constraint w Φ (q, q.e) 〉=w Φ (q, e
k) quantity, and 2) ranking function w Φ (q, e
k) far super training data comes vague generalization.In the superincumbent optimization problem, C allows the wrong compromise parameter of allowance size and training.The quantity of linear rank constraint be q (| q.E|-1).As example, each in three inquiries shown in Fig. 4 all generates two constraints.
The w that is learned is proper vector Φ (q, e
k) linear combination, it allows to use kernel.It illustrates intuitively: at two proper vector Φ (q, e
k) and Φ (q ', e '
k) between dot product and total word in the context of two inquiries quantity and long-pending between the quantity of the total classification of two named entities added that the long-pending of two cosine similaritys equates.Corresponding rank kernel is:
K((q，e
k)，(q′，e′
k))＝|q.T∩q′.T|·|e
k.C∩e′
k.C|
+cos(q.T，e
k.T)·cos(q′.T，e′
k.T)
For fear of numerical problem, the first condition of kernel is that standardization and second condition are to multiply by constant, for example α=10
8, as follows:
