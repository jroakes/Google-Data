Definitions
- the present invention is directed to an apparatus, system and method for reporting field replaceable unit (FRU) replacement.
- FRU field replaceable unit
- the present invention is directed to an apparatus, system and method for informing a user which FRUs, that may be the source of a system error, have already been replaced within a given period of time.
- FRU field replaceable unit
- a fault e.g., a network card, sound card, video card, modem, and the like.
- FRU field replaceable unit
- processor cards can plug into and make use of a common system bus where additional memory modules may also be plugged into the common system bus. If a fault occurs on a memory controller, the fault can appear to be caused by a fault on itself or one of the FRUs of the common bus.
- the ideal FRU bucket contains a single FRU. However, in reality, many FRU buckets will consist of more than one FRU since a symptom may be the result of a failure of any of a number of FRUs.
- failure probability order When a FRU bucket contains more than one FRU, the FRUs are listed in a failure probability order. This failure probability order is referred to as the FRU Replacement Order and typically lists the most probable source of a failure first in the FRU bucket with other FRUs listed in decreasing probability of source of failure.
- FRUs are replaced one at a time in the order set forth in the FRU Replacement Order until the failure is cured and the failure source is identified.
- a second customer engineer may not be aware that a first engineer has already replaced a particular FRU only a few days, weeks, etc., before.
- customer engineers log their actions in a binder that is kept physically next to the system under repair.
- this manner of logging replacements of FRUs proves troublesome in that the log binder may be overlooked, lost, or not maintained in an up-to-date manner.
- the present invention provides an apparatus, system and method for reporting field replaceable unit (FRU) replacements to a user.
- the present invention identifies a FRU Replacement Order for an identified system error and then determines which of the FRUs in the FRU Replacement Order have already been replaced within a predetermined period of time from the current time. Those FRUs identified as having already been replaced are then flagged. The FRU Replacement Order is then output to the user with the flagged FRUs being output in a different manner than the other FRUs in the FRU Replacement Order.

- the present invention may be implemented solely on the data processing system shown in FIG. 2 or may be implemented in a distributed manner using the distributed data processing system of FIG. 1, as will be discussed hereafter.
- the present invention may be implemented as part of diagnostic tool embodied in software and/or hardware for diagnosing the source of a failure of a data processing system.
- the present invention provides a mechanism through which a customer engineer, for example, may be provided with an indication of which field replaceable units (FRUs) have been replaced within a predetermined period of time. In this way, the customer engineer may be provided with information to help the customer engineer determine the most probable cause of an error in a data processing system.
- the present invention may be implemented in a stand alone device, such as the data processing system 200 or distributed amongst a plurality of devices in a distributed data processing system, such as distributed data processing system 100 .
- a customer engineer in response to a service call, may initiate diagnostic procedures on a data processing system which is experiencing one or more error conditions.
- the particular diagnostic procedures may be any of those generally known in the art, or hereafter developed. These diagnostic procedures may be automatically performed, performed by the customer engineer, or may be a combination of procedures performed by the customer engineer and automatically by one or more diagnostic routines in a diagnostic tool according to the present invention.
- a FRU bucket is identified for the errors encountered.
- the FRU bucket identifies the FRUs that are most likely the cause of the associated error.
- a FRU Replacement Order may be identified. The functions of performing diagnostic procedures, identifying a FRU bucket, and identifying a FRU Replacement Order are performed in substantially the same manner as known in the art.
- the customer engineer may then take the FRU Replacement Order and begin replacing FRUs based on the FRU Replacement Order. With each replacement, the customer engineer may rerun the diagnostic procedures to determine if the error condition has been cured by replacement of the FRU. If not, the next FRU in the FRU Replacement Order may be replaced and the procedure repeated until the error condition is cured.
- the present invention avoids such scenarios by providing a mechanism through which a customer engineer is informed of which FRUs have been replaced within a predetermined period of time.
- an event log is also retrieved from storage.
- the event log may be stored in a local memory that is local to the data processing system 200 , for example.
- the event log may be uploaded to a remote data storage device, such as data storage unit 106 , that may be accessible to a number of different customer engineers from a central site on the distributed data processing system 100 , for example.
- the event log stores records indicating the FRUs that have been replaced in a particular data processing system, the dates and/or times that the FRUs were replaced, and optionally, the errors encountered that led to the FRUs being replaced.
- the FRUs may be identified based on, for example, their vital product data (VPD) that is normally associated with the hardware devices.
- VPD vital product data
- Such vital product data may include, for example, the serial number, part number, EC number, and the like, of the hardware device.
- the event log is then compared against the results of the PD procedures. If there is a FRU in the results of the PD procedures that is indicated in the event log to have been replaced within a predetermined period of time from the current time, that FRU is flagged as having already been replaced. For example, assume the PD procedures results in an error code that corresponds to a FRU bucket that includes FRU A, FRU B, and FRU C. Also assume that the event log indicates that FRU B was replaced within 30 days of the current date. As a result, FRU B may be flagged as having already been replaced within the predetermined period of time (30 days). The particular period of time may be selected based on the particular data processing system being serviced, empirical failure rate data, industry convention, the judgment of a system administrator, customer engineer, or the like.
- a display of the FRU Replacement Order is then provided to the customer engineer.
- the FRU Replacement Order display is different from the prior art displays in that those FRUs that have been flagged as having already been replaced, are displayed differently from the other FRUs in the FRU Replacement Order.
- the display may be provided using a display device associated with a device, such as the data processing system 200 , being used by the customer engineer, for example.
- the customer engineer is using a PDA version of data processing system 200 , for example, the customer engineer is provided with a display on the PDA display screen that indicates the FRU Replacement Order with the flagged FRUs being displayed in a different manner from the non-flagged FRUs.
- Displaying these flagged FRUs differently may include displaying them using a different text color, as highlighted text, as dimmed text, with a different graphical icon, with a graphical icon representing the FRU being already replaced (e.g., an exclamation point, a flag icon, the tag “Replaced,” etc.), and the like.
- the customer engineer is informed of which FRUs have already been replaced so that the customer engineer may replace other FRUs in the FRU Replacement Order prior to replacing the already replaced FRU.
- the likelihood of different customer engineers repeatedly replacing the same FRU within a predetermined period of time is minimized.
- temporary solutions to intermittent problems are avoided and thus, the intermittent problem is less likely to continue since the customer engineer must find the actual source of the intermittent problem.
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a data flow amongst components of a distributed data processing system according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- a customer engineer using a data processing device 310 according to the present invention, runs PD procedures on the system 320 that is experiencing an error condition ( 1 ).
- the data processing system 310 receives the results of the PD procedures ( 2 ) and sends a request ( 3 ) for a corresponding FRU Replacement Order to the system maintenance server 330 .
- the request sent to the system maintenance server 330 may include an indication of any error codes returned by the system 320 to the data processing system 310 as well as an identifier of the system 320 , for example.
- the system maintenance server 330 sends a request for the event log for the system 320 to the network 340 ( 4 ) which routes the request to the event log storage unit 350 ( 5 ).
- the event log storage unit 350 replies with the requested event log ( 6 ) which is again routed by the network 340 to the system maintenance server 330 ( 7 ).
- the system maintenance server 330 compares the event log to the standard FRU Replacement Order for the error conditions being experienced by the system 320 . Any FRUs appearing in the standard FRU Replacement Order and in the event log (within a predetermined period of time) are flagged as having been replaced.
- the FRU Replacement Order with the flagged FRUs is then provided to the data processing system 310 ( 8 ).
- a customer engineer views the FRU Replacement Order as it is displayed on the data processing system 310 and selects one or more FRUs to replace.
- the customer engineer replaces the selected one or more FRUs ( 9 ) in the system 320 and reruns the PD procedures ( 10 ).
- the results of the PD procedures are then output to the data processing system 310 . If the results indicate that the error has not been cured, the process may be repeated as necessary.
- the vital product data for the replaced FRUs is entered into the diagnostic tool. This may include, for example, obtaining the vital product data by querying the replacement FRUs, having the customer engineer enter the vital product data via an input device associated with the data processing system 310 , or the like. The vital product data may then be uploaded to the event log storage unit 350 . Thus, the event log is updated with the most current replacement event data.
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a display on a data processing system in accordance with the present invention. As shown in FIG. 4, the display includes an identifier of an error 410 and a listing of an FRU Replacement Order 420 . Within the FRU Replacement Order 420 , one or more FRUs may include flags 425 that identify the FRUs as having already been replaced within a predetermined period of time. In addition, information regarding when the FRUs were previously replaced may also be included.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart outlining an exemplary operation of one embodiment of the present invention.
- the operation starts with an error condition in a system being reported (step 510 ).
- the customer engineer performs problem determination diagnostic procedures on the system (step 520 ) and a FRU Replacement Order is identified based on the results of the problem determination diagnostic procedures (step 530 ).
- An event log for the system is retrieved (step 540 ) and compared to the FRU Replacement Order (step 550 ). FRUs appearing in both the event log (within a predetermined time of the current time) and the FRU Replacement Order are flagged (step 560 ).
- the FRU Replacement Order is then output for use by the customer engineer (step 570 ).
- the operation ends.
- the operation shown in FIG. 5 may be repeated until the error condition is cured by replacement of FRUs.
- the vital product data for FRUs already replaced may be entered and added to the event log for the system. In this way, the most current event log information is maintained in the event log storage unit.
- FIGS. 3-5 describe the present invention in terms of a distributed data processing system
- the functionality of the present invention may be provided in a stand alone device, such as in a PDA, notebook computer, dedicated diagnostic device, or the like.
- a maintenance server and event log storage unit may be incorporated into the hardware/software of the stand alone device.
- the present invention may make use of a combination of the stand alone device and distributed data processing system embodiments.
- the functionality described above may be provided by a stand alone device with periodic updates to a central event log storage device being made.
- the system maintenance server may periodically transmit update data to one or more stand alone devices to thereby update their locally stored event logs.
- Other embodiments as will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
- the FRU Replacement Order and Flagged FRUs may be identified to a customer engineer, or other user, using audio, visual, and/or tactile output. For example, an audio message may be output indicating the FRU Replacement Order and the status of a FRU as having already been replaced.
- the present invention may modify the FRU Replacement Order based on the determination that a FRU has been previously replaced. For example, if an FRU in a FRU Replacement Order is determined to have already been replaced within a predetermined period of time, the ranking of the FRU in the FRU Replacement Order may be reduced. Such reduction may be to place the FRU at the end of the FRU Replacement Order, reduce the FRU priority in the FRU Replacement Order by a designated amount, or the like. The FRU Replacement Order then output to the customer engineer will be the modified FRU Replacement Order which may also include the flags as previously described.
- the present invention provides a mechanism by which a customer engineer, or other user, may be informed of the FRUs that have been replaced within a predetermined period of time from the current time. In this way, the customer engineer may make an informed decision as to which FRU to replace in view of the fact that one or more of the FRUs may have already been replaced recently.
- the identification of the recently replaced FRUs is performed by a data processing system utilized by the customer engineer in performing the problem determination diagnostic procedures, the possibility of misplacing the event log of a system is greatly reduced.
- a centralized event log is utilized, multiple customer engineers may access the same event log information and may receive the most current event log information.
- the present invention eliminates the need to maintain separate physical log books at each system being maintained.
- Examples of computer readable media include recordable-type media, such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a RAM, CD-ROMS, DVD-ROMS, and transmission-type media, such as digital and analog communications links, wired or wireless communications links using transmission forms, such as, for example, radio frequency and light wave transmissions.
- the computer readable media may take the form of coded formats that are decoded for actual use in a particular data processing system.
