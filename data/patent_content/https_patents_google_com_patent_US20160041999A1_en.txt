Thememory device 167 includes ananalyzer software program 162 for analyzing the tracking data. - The
tracking data 168 b can be stored in one ormore tracking logs 169, which are used to record the collected information for multiple users. In various implementations, the recorded information includes log entries that indicate the IP (Internet Protocol) address or cookie of the client 104 that transmitted the information, the date and time the information was received, the type of data, and a value for the data. Examples of the types of data that are recorded in the tracking logs is presented in TABLE 1. Other types of tracking data are possible. -
TABLE 1 DATA TYPE DATA VALUE Query Query text as submitted by a user through an input device such as a keyboard or converted from the user's speech. Advertisement Identification of an advertisement and a query Impressions where the advertisement was presented with the query's search results. Advertisement Identification of an advertisement and a query Clicks where the advertisement was presented with the query's search results and clicked on by a user. A click-through rate (CTR) can be determined for a given advertisement based on this information. - A
user 102 a connects to thesearch engine 110 within aserver system 114 to submit a query 115. When theuser 102 a submits the query 115 through an input device attached to aclient device 104 a, a client-side query signal 110 a is sent into thenetwork 112 and is forwarded to theserver system 114 as a server-side query signal 110 b.Server system 114 can be one or more server devices in one or more locations. Aserver device 114 includes amemory device 116, which can include thesearch engine 110 loaded therein. Aprocessor 118 is structured to process instructions within thedevice 114. These instructions can implement one or more components of thesearch engine 110. Theprocessor 118 can be a single or multi-threaded processor and can include multiple processing cores. Theprocessor 118 can process instructions stored in thememory 116 related to thesearch engine 110 and can send information to respective client devices 104 a-c, through thenetwork 112, to create a graphical presentation in a user interface of the client device 104, e.g., a search results web page displayed in a web browser. - The server-
side query signal 110 b is received by thesearch engine 110. Thesearch engine 110 uses the information within the user query 115, e.g. query terms, to find relevant resources. As used herein, resource is any data that can be provided by a website over a network and that is associated with a resource address. Resources include, for example, HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, videos, electronic games, and feed sources, to name just a few. The resources can include content, for example, words, phrases, images and sounds and may include embedded information, e.g., meta information and hyperlinks, and/or embedded instructions, e.g., scripted content. - The
search engine 110 can include anindexing engine 120 that actively searches a corpus or collection of documents, e.g., web pages on the Internet, to index the resources found in that corpus, and the index information for the resources in the corpus can be stored in anindex database 122. Thisindex database 122 can be accessed to identify resources related to the user query 115. Note that, an electronic resource, which for brevity will simply be referred to as a resource, does not necessarily correspond to a file. A resource can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other resources, in a single file dedicated to the resource in question, or in multiple coordinated files. Moreover, a resource can be stored in a memory without having first been stored in file. - The
search engine 110 includes aranking engine 152 to rank the resources related to the user query 115 using a scoring or ranking function. The ranking of the resources can be performed using traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed resources in view of a given query, for example. The relevance of a particular resource with respect to a particular search term or to other provided information may be determined by any appropriate technique. - To further improve such traditional resource ranking techniques, the
ranking engine 152 determines an appropriate ranking for search results. Search results can be ranked according to traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed resources that contain videos in view of a given query. The relevance of a particular resource with respect to a particular search term or other provided information may be determined by any appropriate scoring technique. - The
search engine 110 forwards the final, ranked result list within a server-side search results signal 128 a through thenetwork 112. Exiting thenetwork 112, a client-side search results signal 128 b is received by theclient device 104 a where the results are stored within theRAM 106 and/or used by theprocessor 108 to display the results on an output device for theuser 102 a. Theserver system 114 may also maintain one or more user search histories based on the queries theserver system 114 receives from a user, and from results that a user selected after a search was performed. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an examplequery analysis system 200. Thesystem 200 includes ageolocator 202, alocation extractor 204, aquery categorizer 206, and aquery analyzer 208. Thegeolocator 202,location extractor 204, andcategorizer 206 each have access to the tracking logs 169 and generate additional information to be associated with queries in the tracking logs. In some implementations, thegeolocator 202,location extractor 204, andcategorizer 206 can create one or more database indexes 210 a-c that enable fast access to the additional information. - The geolocator associates a source geographic location, e.g., zip code, city, state, point of interest, and so on, with queries in the tracking logs 169 based on, for example, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the client devices from which the queries were entered or by using cookie values stored on the client devices. For example, an IP address can be mapped to a geographic location using the predetermined location information for IP address blocks provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Other ways of mapping an IP address are possible. Alternatively, a cookie value can be encoded with the identification of a user of the client device. The user identification can be used to look up a user's geographic location in user profile or account information. In some implementations, the source geographic location associated with a query by the
geolocator 202 is provided at a granularity that protects the privacy of users. That is, the source geographic location is a geographic area that is large enough to prevent the identification of individual users. In some implementations, the geographic location can be include a hierarchy of locations such as country, state, city, and subdivision within the city. Adatabase index 210 a of source geographic location information associated with queries in the tracking logs 169 can created for use by thequery analyzer 208, as described below. - The
location extractor 204 associates a destination geographic location with queries in the tracking logs 169 based on respective text of the queries. Thelocation extractor 204 first identifies any parts of the query, e.g., one or more letters, numbers, or combinations thereof, that may refer to a geographic location. For example, given the query “hotels paris” the portion of the query that refers to a geographic location is “paris”. The portion of the query that refers to a geographic location can come before or after another portion of the query. In some implementations, a table maps terms or keywords in a query to predetermined geographic locations. For example, the term “paris” could be mapped to Paris, France. - In further implementations, a probability is determined as to whether an IP address or cookie associated with the query should be mapped to a predetermined geographic location. For example, the term “paris” can be mapped to either “Paris, Texas” or “Paris, France”. Given that the source geographic location of the query is not in Paris, Tex., for example, the probability that the term “paris” refers to France would be higher. Other ways of determining a geographic location from query terms are possible. The determined geographic location is used as the destination geographic location. A
database index 210 b of destination geographic location information associated with queries in the tracking logs 169 can be created for use by thequery analyzer 208, as described below. - The
categorizer 206 associates a vertical market category with queries in the tracking logs 169 based on text of the query. A vertical market category describes a group of similar businesses and customers that engage in trade based on specific and specialized needs, such as restaurants and golf equipment manufacturers, for instance. A given category can be part of a hierarchy of categories such as travel→lodging and accommodations→restaurants. Thecategorizer 206 first identifies any parts of the query, e.g., one or more letters, numbers, or combinations thereof, that do not refer to a geographic location. For example, given the query “hotels paris” the portion of the query that does not refer to a geographic location is “hotels”. The portion of the query that does not refer to a geographic location can come before or after another portion of the query. In some implementations, a table that maps terms or keywords in a query to predetermined vertical market categories. For example, the term “hotel” could be mapped to “lodgings”. Other ways of determining a vertical market category from query terms are possible. Adatabase index 210 c of vertical market category information associated with queries in the tracking logs 169 can created for use by thequery analyzer 208, as described below. - The
query analyzer 208 analyzes query information according to the determined vertical market categories using one or more of the indexes 210 a-c and trackinglogs 169, and can provide the analysis for presentation in a graphical user interface of one or moreclient computing devices 214 that can communicate with thequery analyzer 208 through acomputer network 212. In some implementations, thequery analyzer 208 determines, for a given time period and vertical market category, the number of queries, the text of the queries, the aggregate click-through rate of advertisements presented with search results for the queries, and/or the number of advertisement impressions for advertisements presented with search results for the queries. The determination can be restricted according to queries matching a specified source geographic location, destination geographic location, or both. Other analysis is possible. - The information generated by the
query analyzer 208 can be used by advertisers to gain insight into how to target their advertising campaigns, for example, by associating advertisements with popular queries, or terms from the queries, that match the analysis criteria. In some implementations, theanalyzer 208 presents queries matching the analysis criteria that occur in the tracking logs a number of times beyond a threshold number, e.g., 1000. Theanalyzer 208 can also access information to determine revenue generated from conversions, e.g., making an online purchase or submitting a form to request additional information in response to an advertisement. In some implementations, theanalyzer 208 presents queries that have associated conversions beyond a threshold number of conversions. -
FIG. 3 is an example query analysisgraphical user interface 300 as provided byquery analyzer 208.User input area 302 allows specification of an optional source geographic location, e.g., United States.User input area 304 allows specification of a destination geographic location, e.g., Germany.User input area 308 allows the specification of one or more vertical market categories, e.g., >travel>hotels & accommodations.User input area 310 allows the specification of a time period for performing the analysis, e.g., Jul. 12, 2010 through Jul. 10, 2011. The user input areas are used by thequery analyzer 208 to establish the analysis criteria. In some implementations, the destination geographic location can be specified by user interaction with themap 306 such as, for example, the user drawing a rectangle or other shape over a region of interest. The results of the analysis are presented inarea 312 of the user interface and, optionally, indicated on themap 306 as colored regions. The results are presented in a table form. Each row of the table represents a unique query that matches the query criteria. By way of illustration, row 312 a is for query “munich hotels” that is associated with the specified source and destination geographic locations. The results can present a count of the number of times the query occurred for the given criteria as well as other information such as impressions and click-through rates of advertisements for the query. -
FIG. 4 is another example query analysisgraphical user interface 400 as provided byquery analyzer 208. Theuser interface 400 compares counts of queries over time ingraph 404 for one or more locations and verticals. In particular, thegraph 404 separately plots counts for queries having a source location of the United States, a destination location of Mexico, and a vertical “Hotels & Accommodations” and counts for queries having a source location of the United States, a destination location of Canada, and a vertical “Hotels & Accommodations.” - Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
