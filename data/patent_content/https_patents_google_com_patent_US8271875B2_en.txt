Definitions
- This document generally describes information presentation.
- Help information is a common source of frustration for users. Often, a user does not know the key terms that are required to solve their problem. As the computer world expands, more help information is generated for the user to read to try and determine what is needed to complete a desired task.
- help information can be provided on forums.
- the product can provide internally generated help information.
- Help information can be listed using topics or listing alphabetical entries.
- Similar products can have similar approaches to general functions, such as the open apple key used in conjunction with the “c” key on an Apple computer to copy a highlighted item on the user's screen.
- a function in a product can be product-specific, with no other products being able to produce the same function.
- This document describes techniques for providing content (e.g., help information).
- preconfigured content can be used to determine related portions of help information, and the system may then rank the help information to generate references to be displayed with the content in an application.
- a computer-implemented method for providing content includes extracting preconfigured content from an application; selecting, from second content (e.g., help information) associated with the application, a plurality of portions of the second content using the extracted preconfigured content; ranking the plurality of portions based at least in part on the preconfigured content; and associating a reference with the preconfigured content in the application such that the reference is displayed with the application, the reference providing user navigation to at least one of the plurality of portions selected based on the ranking.
- second content e.g., help information
- an electronic system for providing content e.g., help information
- the system includes a content extractor to extract preconfigured content from an application; a selector to select, from second content (e.g., help information) associated with the application, a plurality of portions of the second content using the extracted preconfigured content; a ranking module to rank the plurality of portions based at least in part on the preconfigured content; and a reference association module to associate a reference with the preconfigured content in the application such that the reference is displayed with the application, the reference providing user navigation to at least one of the plurality of portions selected based on the ranking.
- second content e.g., help information
- an electronic system for providing content e.g., help information
- the system includes a content extractor to extract preconfigured content from an application; a selector to select, from second content associated with the application, a plurality of portions of the second content using the extracted preconfigured content; a ranking module to rank the plurality of portions based at least in part on the preconfigured content; and means for associating a reference with the preconfigured content in the application such that the reference is displayed with the application, the reference providing user navigation to at least one of the plurality of portions selected based on the ranking.
- a computer program embodied on a computer-readable storage medium for providing content includes extracting preconfigured content from an application; selecting, from second content (e.g., help information) associated with the application, a plurality of portions of the second content using the extracted preconfigured content; ranking the plurality of portions based at least in part on the preconfigured content; and associating a reference with the preconfigured content in the application such that the reference is displayed with the application, the reference providing user navigation to at least one of the plurality of portions selected based on the ranking.
- second content e.g., help information
- FIG. 1 is a an example of a graphical user interface for providing content.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a system for providing content.
- FIG. 3 is an example of a method for providing content.
- FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of a computer system.
- FIG. 1 is an example of a graphical user interface (GUI) 100 for providing content (e.g., help information).
- the GUI 100 displays an application 102 on a user device.
- the GUI 100 shown here as an e-mail application, provides a user with references linked to content (e.g., help information) related to the current screen in the application 102 .
- content e.g., help information
- Help information is one example of related content that can be presented. Other forms of content are possible.
- content can be extracted from the application 102 to select portions of related help information. The selected help information can be ranked based on the extracted content.
- the help information can be linked to help references that are then displayed in the application 102 .
- the help references can be displayed inside the application 102 so that the user can view help references alongside the application 102 for ease of use.
- the help references can be displayed in a separate or otherwise designated area for easy of identification.
- the application 102 provides the user with an inbox 104 , a selection for actions, such as “Compose” 106 and “Folders” 108 .
- the GUI 100 also displays a Help Links 110 header for help information. Underneath the Help Links 110 header, individual references 112 - 116 are displayed.
- the displayed references 112 - 116 show content headers providing a brief description of the reference topic.
- the content headers can be similar or the same as a portion of help information associated with the reference.
- the first reference 112 is shown as having the header “Composing a Message.”
- the help information can be determined by a variety of methods.
- the extracted preconfigured content from the application 102 can include topics and keywords from the current display on the GUI 100 .
- the topics and keywords may be available to the user, but other topics and keywords may not be displayed to the user.
- “Compose” 106 relates to the first reference 112
- Folders 108 relates to the second reference 114 .
- the third reference 116 does not directly relate to a term displayed in the GUI 100 .
- the term “carbon copy” may be associated with “Compose” 106 so that if “Compose” 106 is onscreen, “carbon copy” is a term that can be extracted.
- the keywords and topics associated with a current display can be used to determine references 112 - 116 .
- the GUI 100 displays three references 112 - 116 in the application 102 .
- the number of references displayed in the application 102 can be predetermined (e.g. five references must be displayed under the Help Links 110 header).
- the number of ranked portions to be associated with the reference can be determined using a percentile cutoff. For example, if each portion of help information is ranked to be relevant based on keywords and topics, that relevancy can be determined as a percentage.
- the displayed references 112 - 116 may be required to have a ranking of 75% or higher to be displayed. Alternatively, the references 112 - 116 can have an option to display different help references.
- the GUI 100 can receive feedback from the user to rank the references 112 - 116 .
- This feedback can be passive or active.
- a passive means of retrieving feedback can use the user's selection of one of the references 112 - 116 to recalculate a reference's ranking. If more users select the first reference 112 , that reference can have a higher rank than it would from only keywords and topics.
- the references that are not chosen 114 - 116 may decrease in their ranking so that other references are shown with the application 102 with the same or similar content extracted.
- Active means of retrieving user feedback can also be implemented. For example, a window can appear to accept user feedback, asking the user to choose whether the reference 112 was helpful. Similarly, the GUI 100 can display a ranking system for feedback from the user, such as a star ranking system or a scale from 1 to 10 . Likewise, a user choosing a reference 112 from other references 114 - 116 displayed alongside the reference 112 can provide feedback. This user feedback can be used for later rankings. In some implementations, ranking feedback can be obtained from the related help information after the user has selected one of the references 112 - 116 .
- the GUI 100 can also display an ads header 118 with individual advertisements 120 - 124 related to the extracted content from the application 102 .
- the advertisement 120 “80's Music” is related to the “Debbie Gibson” text in the inbox 104 .
- the advertisement 122 “Football Jerseys” is related to the text “Superbowl Party” in the inbox 104 .
- the advertisement 124 “Personalized E-mail” is related to the name “Robin Scherbatsky” in the application 102 and the type of application being an e-mail application.
- the application 102 may display other content-related data, such as news information, weather information, maps, videos, etc.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a system 200 for providing content (e.g., help information).
- the system 200 shows an example of extracting content from an application, selecting portions of second content (e.g., help information) based on that extracted content, ranking the second content based on the extracted content, and associating references with the extracted content.
- the system 200 includes a server 202 , a user device 204 , and an application display 206 .
- the server 202 includes a help information system 208 .
- the help information system 208 has a database 210 including minimum ranks data stores 212 a - c .
- the help information system 208 also has a content extractor 214 , a selector 216 , a ranking module 218 , and a reference association module 220 .
- the database 210 can store help information along with minimum ranking information stored in the minimum ranks data stores 212 a - c for each of the portions of help information in the database 210 .
- the plurality of portions of the help information each have a predetermined rank that is modifiable. For example, a new portion of help information can have a default ranking so that terms within the help information trigger a 50% ranking. As discussed in FIG. 1 , this ranking system can be used to determine which portions of help information are most relevant to a particular application display 206 .
- the application display 206 can contain content that the system 200 can extract 222 to be processed by the help information system 208 .
- the content extractor 214 can extract preconfigured content from an application to determine keywords and terms from the content of the application display 206 .
- the content extractor can also use content not previously configured to be used as a keyword or term.
- the application display 206 can have a display similar to FIG. 1 , where the inbox 104 displays the term “video” several times in the subject line.
- the “video” term can display a reference 112 discussing the ability to display an attached video file in the application.
- the selector 216 can select portions of the help information from the database 210 using the extracted preconfigured content.
- the portions of help information can be associated with the application.
- the selector 216 can use, for example, keywords and terms extracted from the application display 206 by the content extractor 214 .
- the selector 216 only provides a predetermined number of portions of help information based on previously known rankings.
- the ranking module 218 can rank the plurality of portions based at least in part on the preconfigured content. For example, the ranking module 218 can evaluate the current ranking of each of the portions of help information identified by the selector and determine the likelihood that the help information matches the extracted preconfigured content.
- the content extractor 214 can take a term, like “Compose” and provide it to the selector 216 .
- the selector 216 can find portions of help information with the term “compose” (in some instances, including close matches such as “composing”). The ranking module 218 can then evaluate the relevancy of portions of help information associated with the “compose” term.
- the ranking module 218 can also use data provided by an administrator to rank the plurality of portions of help information. For example, if an administrator provides a score to the help information associated with the first reference 112 in FIG. 1 for the term “Compose,” the ranking module 218 can rank that portion of help information based on the high score and provide that portion when the term “compose” appears on the application display 206 .
- the ranking module 218 can determine the ranking of portions of help information based on multiple terms. In some implementations, each term may be determined to have its own weight from the application display 206 itself, from the content extractor 214 , or from other sources. Further, the ranking of portions may be adjusted individually based on passive or active user feedback, as described in FIG. 1 . If user chooses a particular reference by clicking on the reference, the ranking module 218 can increase the reference's ranking.
- the reference association module 220 can associate a reference with the preconfigured content in the application such that the reference is displayed with the application.
- the reference can provide user navigation to at least one of the plurality of portions selected based on the ranking.
- the reference association module 220 can generate the reference based on the extracted content and the portions of help information provided. For example, the reference association module 220 can generate a content header for the reference using the extracted preconfigured content, so that the term “compose” is the header of a reference providing user navigation to a portion of help information associated with “compose” actions.
- the reference association module 220 can retrieve previously generated references associated with portions of help information.
- the references can be displayed 224 on the user device 204 in the application display 206 .
- the references can be displayed 224 at the same time that a user navigates to the preconfigured content.
- the user can choose to activate the references in the application display 206 .
- the references can be displayed 224 after the application display 206 has loaded. For example, the references can be displayed 224 when the user selects a related portion of the application display 206 .
- the references displayed 224 can contain the entire portion of the help information. However, in some implementations, only a proper subset of the reference may be displayed 224 with the application display 206 , the reference being displayed 224 after a user selects the proper subset. For example, a content header of a reference may be displayed. If a user selects that content header by rolling over the content header with her mouse, the content header can expand in the application display 206 to show the full reference.
- the user's selection can be used to update 226 the ranking of portions of help information. This can be accomplished through passive or active means. For example, the user rolling over a content header to obtain more information can be used to increase the ranking of the associated help information. Alternatively, users from a particular geographic location who receive a reference more often than users from other locations may have that reference ranked higher for their location.
- the system 200 can periodically refresh the preconfigured content. For example, the preconfigured content can be updated so that new terms and keywords can be associated with the content, allowing for better help information to be available to the user.
- FIG. 3 is an example of a method 300 for presenting content (e.g., help information).
- the method 300 can be performed to provide help information similar, or corresponding, to the help information in the graphical user interface 100 .
- the method 300 can be performed by a processor executing instructions stored in a computer-readable storage medium.
- preconfigured content is extracted from an application.
- the preconfigured content can include a word that appears multiple times in the application, such as the word “video” in FIG. 1 .
- a word appearing multiple times in the current display can be extracted as preconfigured content, as can an image with related terms. For example, if an icon appears on a page, that icon can be used as a term.
- the method 300 includes, in step 304 , selecting a plurality of portions of second content (e.g., help information) using the extracted preconfigured content.
- the help information can be associated with the application.
- the preconfigured content can be an icon representing the copy function. Using the icon, the method 300 can find portions of help information relating to the application's copy function.
- the help information associated with the application can be generated by users of the application. For example, there may be help references created by users regarding use of the application available on the Internet.
- the method 300 can search help information in an online forum discussing the application and use its content as portions of help information.
- the plurality of portions of second content has been selected, it is ranked based at least in part on the preconfigured content in step 306 .
- “Compose” 106 can be related to a portion of help information associated with first reference 112 in FIG. 1 and a portion of help information associated with the third reference 116 .
- “Compose” can relate more with the portion of help information associated with first reference 112 than the portion of help information associated with the third reference 116 .
- the method 300 can rank the portions of help information based on their relatedness to the preconfigured content so that the most pertinent information is displayed to the user.
- Step 308 associates references with the preconfigured content in the application such that the reference is displayed with the application.
- the reference can provide user navigation to at least one of the plurality of portions of help information selected based on the ranking.
- the first reference 112 in FIG. 1 appears in the application 102 .
- the reference 112 can provide user navigation through a hyperlink to a portion of help information that discusses a step-by-step process for composing an e-mail.
- the reference is generated at least in part from the preconfigured content in the application.
- the content header of each of the references 112 - 116 in FIG. 1 can be composed of key words and terms, like “Compose,” “Folders,” and “Carbon Copy.”
- the method 300 can display the references to the user in step 310 .
- the references 112 - 116 can be displayed in the GUI 100 along the user's inbox 104 , but still in the application 102 .
- the references can be displayed such that the user can click on a tab, like the inbox or home tabs in FIG. 1 , to access the references for a given screen.
- the user can also elect to “pop-out” the references to a separate window, or “pop-in” the references into the current application.
- the method 300 can determine the relationship between help information and the predetermined content using a separate product that determines how long a user was on a particular display and her geographic position.
- the product can provide information to determine which references users find to be more helpful.
- One such product may be GOOGLE ANALYTICS.
