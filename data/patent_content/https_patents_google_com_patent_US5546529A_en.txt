Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to the field of information display, and in particular to providing a visual display relating to the results of a database search.
- information visualizations provide insights to the underlying data. For example, for any given set of information, new information regarding patterns or relationships can be obtained by looking at attributes of the information. It is often useful to view the attributes of the information in a hierarchical structure. However, a difficulty lies in displaying large hierarchical structures in a limited display area.
- EP 0 435 601 A2 entitled “Display of Hierarchical Three-Dimensional Structures", Robertson, et al., which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention discloses a technique for displaying and manipulating three-dimensional representations of a tree structure which have rotating substructures.
- EP 0 535 986 A2 entitled “Method of Operating A Processor”, Robertson, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention describes a method for centering a selected node of a node link structure along a centering line.
- the nodes are in rows, and each row extends across a centering line with links between nodes in adjacent rows.
- a sequence of images is presented, each including a row that appears to be a continuation of the row with the indicated node and that includes a continued indicated node that appears to be a continuation of the indicated node.
- the rows appear to be shifted, bringing the continued indicated nodes toward the centering line, until a final shift locks the continued indicated node into position at the centering line.
- the positions of the indicated node and a subset of the continued indicated nodes together can define an asymptotic path that begins at the position of the indicated node and approaches the center line asymptotically until the final shift occurs.
- the displacements between positions can follow a logarithmic function, with each displacement being a proportion of the distance from the preceding position to the centering line.
- Each node can be rectangular, and the nodes in each row can be separated by equal offsets to provide compact rows.
- Each node can be a selectable unit, so that the user can request a centering operation by selecting a node, such as with a mouse click.
- Section 1 discusses fisheye lenses that show places nearby in great detail while showing the whole world, showing remote regions in successively less detail; a caricature is the poster of the "New Yorker's View of the United States.”
- Section 3 describes a degree of interest (DOI) function that assigns to each point in a structure, a number telling how interested the user is in seeing that point, given the current task. A display can then be made by showing the most interesting points, as indicated by the DOI function.
- DOI degree of interest
- the fisheye view can achieve, for example, a logarithmically compressed display of a tree, as illustrated by FIG. 4 of Furnas for a tree structured text file.
- Section 4 also describes fisheye views for botanical taxonomies, legal codes, text outlines, a decisions tree, a telephone area code directory, a corporate directory, and UNIX file hierarchy listings.
- Section 5 indicates that a display-relevant notion of a priori importance can be defined for lists, trees, acylic directed graphs, general graphs, and Euclidean spaces, unlike the geographical example which inspired the metaphor of the "New Yorker's View," the underlying structures need not be spatial, nor need the output be graphic.
- FIG. 6 of Furnas shows a fisheye calendar.
- EP 0447 095A, Robertson, et al., entitled “Workspace Display”, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention discloses a processor which presents a sequence of images of a workspace that is stretched to enable the user to view a part of a workspace in greater detail.
- the workspace includes a middle section and two peripheral sections that meet the middle section on opposite edges.
- Each of the sections appears to be a rectangular two-dimensional surface and they are perceptible in three dimensions.
- each peripheral section appears to extend away from the user at an angle from the edge of the middle section so that the peripheral sections occupy relatively little of the screen.
- the middle section is stretched and the peripheral sections are compressed to accommodate the stretching.
- the middle section is destretched and the peripheral sections are decompressed accordingly.
- the present invention enables the organization and visualization of database search results independent of the search parameters. Often, it is desirable to obtain properties of the search results independent of the search parameters. For example, a search on a database may be performed by specifying the authors. It may be undesirable to limit the search by specifying a date. It may later be desirable to organize the search results by date in order to determine when particular documents were created.
- a tree structure is created based on the search results and user specified parameters.
- the user specified parameters represent attributes of documents stored in the database and may differ from the search parameters.
- the tree structure is then mapped to a static reference surface which is visually perceived as three-dimensional.
- the reference surface is comprised of a detail area where detail of the tree structure is displayed and a context area for displaying other portions of the tree in less detail but which conveys to the viewer a sense of context.
- the tree structure may be scrolled about the reference surface to bring portions of the structure into a direct detail view while retaining a context view of the overall tree.

- Hierarchically related information is often represented as a tree.
- node will refer to a point on the tree structure.
- Each node includes pointers to a parent node, a child node and a sibling node to create the tree structure.
- a root node is the highest level node.
- Leaf nodes are the bottom level nodes.
- the present invention addresses this by providing a three-dimensional context view of the tree which can be scrolled.
- a tree is in the general class of node-link structures. As will become apparent in the description below, the present invention could be implemented so as to support other node link structures.
- the currently preferred embodiment of the present invention is used to provide visualizations of the results of a database search (often, important information can be determined by examining relationships between the various search results.)
- important information can be determined by examining relationships between the various search results.
- the computer based system is comprised of a plurality of components coupled via a bus 101.
- the bus 101 may consist of a plurality of parallel buses (e.g. address, data and status buses) as well as a hierarchy of buses (e.g. a processor bus, a local bus and an I/O bus).
- the computer system is further comprised of a processor 102 for executing instructions provided via bus 101 from Internal memory 103 (note that the Internal memory 103 is typically a combination of Random Access and Read Only Memories).
- the processor 102 will be used to perform various operations in support of creating the tree visualizations. Such operations that would be performed by the processor 102 are described with reference to FIGS. 6-10.
- the processor 102 and Internal memory 103 may be discrete components or a single integrated device such as an Application Specification Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chip.
- ASIC Application Specification Integrated Circuit
- keyboard 104 for entering alphanumeric input
- external storage 105 for storing data
- cursor control device 106 for manipulating a cursor
- display 107 for displaying visual output.
- the keyboard 104 would typically be a standard QWERTY keyboard but may also be telephone like keypad.
- the external storage 105 may be fixed or removable magnetic or optical disk drive.
- the cursor control device 106 e.g. a mouse or trackball, will typically have a button or switch associated with it to which the performance of certain functions can be programmed.
- the currently preferred embodiment of the present invention is designed for use on a commercially available IBM compatible computer system available from various vendors, and which is running the Microsoft Windows 3.1 Operating System.
- the Windows operating system provides for the use of multiple workspaces concurrently.
- the operation of Windows-like operating systems is well known in the art.
- the cursor control device is used to position a cursor located on the display to a desired location (i.e. "point" to the desired location).
- a desired location i.e. "point” to the desired location.
- the button associated with the cursor control device may be depressed and released in order to invoke an action. This is referred to as a "click”.
- a different function may be invoked if the button is depressed and released twice in succession. This is referred to as a "double click.”
- a user points to an object on the display depresses the button and holds it down, the object will follow the cursor and be placed at the location on the display where the button is released. This is referred to as a “drag and drop” or “drag” operation.
- FIGS. 2a and 2b illustrate the visualization of a tree structure in the currently preferred embodiment.
- FIG. 2a illustrates a tree structure 201 which is projected onto a plane 202.
- FIG. 2b the same tree structure 201' has been mapped onto a reference surface 203.
- the reference surface 203 has a center panel 204 sharing an edge with a top panel 205 and a bottom panel 206.
- the center panel 204 has a rectangular shape while the top panel 205 and bottom panel 206 have trapezoidal shapes.
- the reference surface may be rotated by 180 degrees. This may be done if it is desirable to have a vertical representation of a tree structure.
- the various levels of the tree structure of FIGS. 2a and 2b are aligned in columns. As will become apparent in the description below, such an alignment reduces processing computations for scrolling of the tree structure across the reference surface and does not effect the underlying nature of the tree structure.
- FIG. 3b is a side view of the reference surface 300 with respect to user viewpoint 306. From FIG. 3b, it is readily observed that the user viewpoint 306 is orthogonal to center panel 301, whereas information on top panel 302 and bottom panel 303 are not. Accordingly, information in top panel 302 or bottom panel 303 are viewed in perspective.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart describing the general steps performed for the rendering of the present invention's visualization of a tree structure.
- perspective transformation look-up tables for the top and bottom panels are created, step 401. These look-up tables are for creating the display data for portions of the tree structure on the top and bottom panels.
- the look-up tables are static for the durations of the visualization.
- each look-up table stores 3000 sample points for transforming an orthogonal view to a perspective view. Values between the sample points are obtained through interpolation. Techniques for creating such a look-up table to create a perspective view are well known in the art. Thus, further description on the generation of sample points in the look-up table is not deemed necessary.
- the tree structure i.e.
- the node/link pointer data is created or otherwise obtained, step 402.
- Creation of the tree structure is dependent on what the structure represents. In the currently preferred embodiment, a hierarchical view of the results of a database search are embodied in the tree structure. A description of the creation of the tree structure in the currently preferred embodiment is provided below.
- the tree structure is created or obtained, it is mapped to the reference surface by the following steps. First, the tree structure is laid out on a two dimensional plane, step 403. Initial layout of the tree structure will center the tree on the reference surface. Subsequent layouts, e.g. as an effect of scrolling, will cause the layout positions to move. In the laying out step, each node will obtain a planar address. The tree is then rendered onto the reference surface, step 404. This is accomplished by transforming the plane coordinates for the nodes to screen coordinates using the look-up tables generated in step 401 for nodes in the top and bottom panels and direct scaling for nodes in the center panel.
- the present invention is now described in reference to its currently preferred embodiment of viewing the results of a database search.
- the visualization of the present invention could be used for viewing any information capable of representation in a tree structure.
- a database maintains a collection of documents. Each document has multiple indices by which it can be referenced.
- the present invention allows the results of a database search to be organized and viewed in a manner based on these indices.
- the indices used for organization and viewing may be different from the indices used for the database search.
- the indices which a user specifies by which they would like to view the search results are termed preferences.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example of a view of a search result.
- a first preference is Authors
- a second preference is Type
- a third preference is Date.
- a top level 500 identifies three authors, Alien (node 501), Bowers (node 502) and Card (node 503).
- Type a grouping 504 of document types is specified, namely Spreadsheet (node 504a), Report (node 504b) and Memo (node 504c).
- the spreadsheet is dated Jun. 15, 1993 (node 505a), the report dated Dec. 1, 1993 (node 505b) and the Memo on Jun. 30, 1994 (node 505c).
- each database that may be searched will have default preferences that may be used for viewing a tree structure.
- a display view may only show a portion of a tree structure because the window has been sized to be smaller than the actual size of the window display area.
- a user first selects a database and performs a database search, step 601. Once the search is completed, the user may then specify how they would like to view the search results. In the currently preferred embodiment the user may view the results as a list of documents or in a tree structure. The user selects the tree view, step 602. In the currently preferred embodiments, the various view options are represented as icons which the user selects by a point and click operation. Other means of view selection, e.g. via a pull-down menu could be used. Once the user selects the tree view, they must specify the preferences upon which to build the tree structure, step 603. In the currently preferred embodiment, a user may select up to 5 preferences. The primary limitation being the size of a typical display. It would be apparent to one skilled in the art to allow a fewer or greater number of preferences.
- each node is capable of being selected by a point operation using the cursor control device. For any operation, the user first points to a desired node, step 605. Highlighting the document path through the tree structure is invoked by a single click of the cursor control device. The highlighting is accomplished by displaying the path in reverse video (see FIG. 12).
- step 606 Before highlighting it must be determined if the document node corresponding to the pointed to node is in the center panel, step 606. If the document node is in the center panel, the document path is highlighted, step 608. If the document node is not in the center panel, the tree view is rotated (i.e. scrolled) to bring the document node into the center of the center panel, step 607. This scrolling is done automatically. When completed, the document node will be centered in the center panel and the path highlighted per step 608.
- the creation and rendering of a tree structure in the currently preferred embodiment is described with reference to the flowchart of FIG. 7.
- the underlying tree representation is created from the search results and the provided preferences, step 701.
- the tree consists of virtual nodes, the inner nodes which correspond to the preference values, and actual nodes, the leaf nodes (displayed in the right-most column) which correspond to the documents resulting from the search.
- the creation of the tree is accomplished through recursive calls to a software program called AddNode.
- AddNode takes as input, a parent node and a document.
- AddNode is called for each document, specifying a root node as the parent node.
- the value of the preference, say X for the current depth in the hierarchy is obtained, step 801. This would involve examining the database to determine the value of the index corresponding to the preference. A search is then made to determine if any child node has the value X, step 802. If no child node has the value X, then a new virtual child node having the value X is created, step 803. The depth of the hierarchy is then incremented, step 804. A check is then made to determine if the maximum depth in the hierarchy has been reached, step 805. If it has, then an actual node is created whose parent is the child with the value X (i.e. the current child), step 806. If a child having value X exists, then AddNode is recursively called with that child as the new parent, step 807.
- each level in the hierarchy is in a column (which is not visible) of the display window.
- the steps for laying out the tree structure on a plane are illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 9.
- the tree is traversed to count the number of nodes at each level in the hierarchy, step 901.
- Each level will form a column so a node count for each column is created.
- each nodes when displayed is 80 ⁇ 20 pixels in size. Thus, the size of a column can be readily determined. This will correspond to the number of nodes in a column.
- a bounding rectangle for each column is determined, step 902.
- the tree layout is then rendered on the reference surface, step 703.
- This is accomplished by transforming the plane coordinates to display screen coordinates.
- the transformation that takes place depends on the panel.
- the reference surface relates to the plane in that it merely folds at predetermined vertical fold locations (i.e. at a particular Y-coordinate in the plane). So determination of which transformation to use requires examination of the Y-coordinate of the node.
- plane coordinates are scaled to the those of the reference surface.
- look-up tables are used to apply perspective transformations on the plane coordinates.
- two look-up tables are used.
- One look-up table maps plane y-distance from a panel fold to screen y-distance.
- a second look-up table maps plane x-distance from the center to screen x-distance from the center.
- FIG. 10 is a flowchart describing the steps for scrolling.
- the scrolling of the currently preferred embodiment is intended to provide animation. It has been determined that animation aids the users perception of what is occurring. To accommodate animation, the scrolling occurs in animation steps with a total animation time of 0.6 seconds (which has been determined to be optimal).
- First the distance each column of the tree will need to travel is determined, step 1001. In the currently preferred embodiment the selected nodes, its ancestors and its children will be centered on the reference surface.
- FIG. 11 illustrates a data structure for a node in a tree structure in the currently preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the structure is comprised of a plurality of pointers 1101-1104 and a layout address for the node, 1105.
- the pointer 1101 points to a parent node
- the pointer 1102 points to a child node
- the pointer 1103 points to a sibling node
- the pointer 1104 points to document information.
- the pointers 1101-1103 are typical for a tree structure representation.
- the pointer 1104 is used to point to the document itself.
- the layout address 1105 contains the address for the node with respect to the plane as generated in the layout plane step described in FIG. 9.
- FIGS. 12-14 “Copyright 1994, Xerox Corporation” (17 U.S.C. 401) are screen displays illustrating the information visualization of database search.
- FIG. 12 a tree of a search result is illustrated.
- FIG. 13 illustrates the highlighting of a node along with its descendant nodes.
- the node 1301 is selected and highlighted. This results in the descendant nodes 1302-1305 to also be highlighted.
- FIG. 14 illustrates a selection which causes scrolling. Assuming the starting position as illustrated in FIG. 12, node 1401 is selected.
- the descendant nodes 1402-1411 are then scrolled to the center panel and highlighted. Note that nodes have scrolled off the center panel and onto the bottom panel.
