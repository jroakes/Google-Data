- Electronic discovery tools are used in the vast majority of modem litigations.
- a vendor will collect a set of electronic documents from a business facing a litigation or threat of litigation, and load the documents into a database for further analysis. Analysis may include sorting the documents, filtering them according to a query, or partitioning them to be reviewed by specific reviewers.
- One useful analysis method is to group documents according to a certain theme or other criteria. Grouped documents can then be reviewed together, such that documents related to a particular criteria are all reviewed at the same time. This eliminates the need for a reviewer to keep track of multiple concepts at once. Instead, the reviewer can focus on one concept for a grouped set of documents, and move on to another later.
- Grouping a set of data, particularly documents, often involves clustering algorithms.
- Document clustering algorithms require a calculation of the similarity or dissimilarity between two or more documents or document clusters.
- a document cluster may be made up of two or more documents that exhibit similarity to each other.
- Clustering text documents based on their full text may be a very time consuming operation. Although full text clustering may be used for small groups of documents, it is not scalable, as full text clustering quickly becomes impractical and prohibitively difficult for large numbers of documents.
- clustering on text may start by analyzing text documents to determine word counts. Documents may be then clustered together based on the word count statistics. For example, three documents that frequently mention the term “patent” may be clustered together, while four documents that frequently mention the word “copyright” may be clustered together, separate from the “patent” set.
- Clustering documents depends on the similarity between two documents. In many clustering algorithms, statistics regarding word frequency and presence in a document are used to compare documents. Documents may be represented as vectors of the words contained in each document.
- a term-document incidence matrix may be created to represent each document in a matrix. For example, a matrix may represent each document as a column, and each word contained in each document as a row. The matrix may omit common words such as “to” or “and”, since these words may be present in many documents.
- the intersection of each document column and each word row contains a value indicating whether the particular word is contained in the document. This value is entered for each document contained in the set to be clustered.
- a portion of a term-document index is shown in FIG. 1 for four exemplary electronic mail messages.
- the term-document index of FIG. 1 includes both content information of each electronic mail message, as well as non-content information, such as the recipient, sender, or other collaborators of each electronic mail message.
- each column is a vector representation of a particular document.
- a similarity calculation may be performed.
- Each document vector may be represented in a vector space model.
- a similarity measure such as the cosine similarity
- a cosine similarity function determines the cosine of the angle between two vectors, such as document vectors, and returns values between zero and 1. A value of zero indicates that the two documents are entirely dissimilar, while a value of 1 indicates that the two documents are identical.
- clustering operations may take many hours to complete. For example, creating a term-document incidence matrix for each document in a set of thousands of documents is a lengthy operation, since the matrix may contain a large number of rows and columns. Such a matrix also may take a large amount of space on a company's computing environment. Further calculating the similarity between the documents in the matrix, if the matrix contains many documents and/or words, is another lengthy operation. Thus, in a business computing environment, with many lengthy documents, clustering on full text may be an untenable solution, and is unscalable as a collection of documents grows.
- Non-content portions of documents generally contain less data.
- Non-content fields of a text document may include elements of metadata, such as the file name of the document, the owner or collaborator of the document, viewers of the document, or any other non-content field.
- Non-content fields of an electronic mail message may include collaborators, such as the sender or recipients of the e-mail, or other metadata fields of the message.
- Collaborators may include e-mail addresses found in the from, to, cc, bcc, reply-to, or other fields of an electronic mail message. In a given e-mail, there may only be a few collaborators, thus reducing the number of rows created in a term-document index for a given e-mail.
- clustering based on document contents may provide a very precise resulting set of clusters, as mentioned above, a clustering algorithm run on a large body of text may take a great amount of time to complete.
- FIG. 2 shows exemplary non-content and content portions of an electronic mail message 200 .
- clustering may be performed on data contained in the recipients field 201 , represented as one or more addresses in the “to:” line of an e-mail. If the recipients field 201 of a large set of e-mails includes the same recipient or recipients, the set of e-mails may form a cluster. Also, a large set of e-mails may be directed to one recipient, and may be clustered together. Identical recipients over a large set of e-mails may indicate that the e-mails in the set are related to each other, and the recipients and senders of the e-mails in the set may be working on a particular project or topic together.
- non-content elements of a document may be used for clustering as well. If a set of e-mails contains messages from different user accounts, the e-mails may be clustered first on information contained in the sender field 203 . Also, documents may be clustered based on labels or tags associated with the documents, or file names/file paths if the document was placed in a specific folder on the user's computer.
- agglomerative clustering or partitional clustering may be used.
- the clustering approach chosen may depend on the advantages and/or disadvantages of each approach, the embodiment chosen, or other criteria requested by a user.
- clustering approach, or additional clustering approaches known to those skilled in the art may be used to implement the embodiments described herein.
- FIG. 3A is an illustration of a method 300 for clustering a set of documents on collaborators or other non-content information.
- a set of electronic documents to be clustered is selected.
- the set of electronic documents may be previously determined as being relevant to a litigation.
- the documents may be e-mails, text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, or any other type of electronic document used.
- a non-content field may be the to: field of an e-mail.
- the non-content field may be the creator of a document or a list of the collaborators of a document.
- Other non-content fields may include, for example and without limitation, a recipient of a document, sender of a document, group recipient of a document, project identifier, the date a document was created, the date a document was modified, or an element of metadata. Additional non-content fields may vary depending on the type of documents to be clustered.
- the documents in the set established in block 302 are clustered in accordance with the data contained in the non-content field or fields selected in block 304 .
- the non-content field is the recipients field of an electronic mail message
- the resulting clusters may represent sets of documents with common recipients.
- the non-content field selected is the collaborators of a spreadsheet
- the resulting clusters may represent sets of documents with common collaborators.
- more than one non-content field is identified in block 304 , such as the recipients field of an electronic mail message and the date the message was sent, the resulting clusters may represent sets of documents with common recipients sent around the same date.
- each document in the set established at block 302 is represented as a set of words.
- the set of words model may ignore duplicates of e-mail addresses or other non-content data.
- the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weight may be calculated for each element of non-content data.
- TF-IDF frequency-inverse document frequency
- the TF-IDF weight is a statistical measure of how important a given term is to a document in a set of documents or corpus.
- the TF-IDF weight increases as the occurrence of the term increases in a document, but decreases as the term occurs more often in the set of documents.
- the TF-IDF weight may not be calculated for elements of non-content data that appear below a threshold number of times. For example, a set of documents may have 10,000 e-mail addresses appearing in the from: field. A member of a legal team may only wish to cluster on addresses appearing above 300 times, for example. Thus, the TF-IDF weight may only be calculated on e-mail addresses or other elements of non-content data that appear over a threshold number of times.
- a term-document matrix may be created, based on the TF-IDF weights, to create a representation of the documents to be clustered and the non-content fields and data in each document. Documents may be compared to determine their similarity using cosine similarity, or other known similarity measures.
- documents may be clustered at block 306 D using any well known clustering algorithm, such as partitional clustering, k-means clustering, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, or any other clustering algorithm suitable for clustering large sets of documents, to create clusters of documents.
- clustering algorithm such as partitional clustering, k-means clustering, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, or any other clustering algorithm suitable for clustering large sets of documents, to create clusters of documents.
- Normalizing data may include making data representing the same concept consistent from element to element.
- a system implementing method 300 explained above may treat an e-mail address formatted as JohnSmith@google.com as different from johnsmith@google.com.
- Normalizing data may take two e-mail addresses such as the above, and normalize them to a consistent value, such as johnsmith@google.com, so that they only represent one data point.
- clustering based on e-mail addresses only one cluster will be formed with the e-mails sent to the recipient.
- data contained in the non-content fields is not normalized.
- formatting or other differences may have a secondary meaning.
- data may not be normalized prior to clustering.
- clusters may be exported to a document review tool for further analysis. For example, a cluster that identifies a group of e-mail addresses as belonging to a cluster may be reviewed by a member of a legal department familiar with the issues and subjects contained in the cluster. Also, a cluster may be exported or sent to a repository of documents to be later reviewed.
- clusters created as a result of method 300 may be further filtered according to desired criteria.
- Filter criteria may specify other non-content fields not used by the clustering algorithm.
- a cluster may be filtered based on a particular e-mail address or other criteria to identify documents relevant to a particular matter.
- one or more clusters may be used in a document review tool by members of a legal department or outside counsel to review documents for a litigation.
- filter criteria may be one or more content fields, such as the body or subject of an e-mail, or text contained in a text document.
- elements of non-content information that only appear infrequently in the set may be filtered out.
- an e-mail address that only appears twice in a set of 1000 documents as the recipient may be filtered and excluded from clustering. In this way, only documents that contain e-mail addresses that would result in useful clusters are clustered together.
- weights may be assigned to one or more non-content fields to direct the results of a particular clustering algorithm.
- recipients of the message may be listed in each of the to: field and the cc: field of the message.
- recipients listed in the to: field may be more indicative of the message's similarity to other messages, whereas recipients listed in the cc: field may not be as important.
- the addresses contained in the to: field may be assigned a greater weight than addresses in the cc: field.
- group names or addresses listed in the to: field of an e-mail may be indicative of common themes or projects. Thus, group names or addresses may be assigned a greater weight than other addresses.
- one or more clusters of documents created as a result of clustering method 300 may be assigned to a particular reviewer, in accordance with an access control policy. For example, if a cluster of documents is formed with documents created by a high level executive in the organization, a paralegal may not be permitted to view those documents on the basis of confidentiality. Thus, an access control policy may block the paralegal from accessing the contents of the cluster. Similarly, if a cluster of documents involves a group of technical users, the documents may be assigned to a reviewer with similar technical knowledge.

Abstract
In an automatic electronic discovery search tool, emails subject to a litigation hold can be clustered using collaborative information rather than the contents to speed the review process. Collaborative information may include non-content fields such as the sender or recipient of a document or message. Documents may then be reviewed as a group based on the collaborative information, or further filtered in accordance with desired criteria.
Description
- This application claims priority to Indian Provisional Application No. 2116/CHE/2011, filed Jun. 22, 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- Electronic discovery tools are used in the majority of modern court proceedings to capture and review documents that may be relevant to a particular proceeding. Conventional electronic discovery tools are used to duplicate various devices used in a company, extract potentially relevant information, and load the information into a database or other repository for review.
- Managing and effectively analyzing the large number of documents typically reviewed in a litigation poses many problems to businesses and law firms. Grouping a set of relevant documents together may involve clustering algorithms, which typically compare documents together and group documents based on their similarity. Grouping documents on their contents may be a lengthy process in a large document set.
- Embodiments relate to clustering documents relevant to a litigation. In one embodiment, a method of clustering a set of documents relevant to a litigation is disclosed. One or more non-content fields associated with each document in the set are identified. The set of documents is then clustered based on the data in the one or more non-content fields.
- In an embodiment, the non-content field may include the a collaborator, such as the creator of the document, a recipient of the document, a sender of the document, a project identifier, a group recipient of the document, or an element of metadata.
- In an embodiment, before the clustering operation takes place, non-content fields are assigned weights to control the outcome of the clustering operation.
- In an embodiment, the set of documents to be clustered in distributed across a plurality of clients in a hosted user environment.
- Further embodiments, features, and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of the various embodiments of the invention are described in detail below with reference to accompanying drawings.
- Embodiments of the invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers may indicate identical or functionally similar elements. The drawing in which an element first appears is generally indicated by the left-most digit in the corresponding reference number.

Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments, whether or not explicitly described.
- Electronic discovery tools are used in the vast majority of modem litigations. Conventionally, a vendor will collect a set of electronic documents from a business facing a litigation or threat of litigation, and load the documents into a database for further analysis. Analysis may include sorting the documents, filtering them according to a query, or partitioning them to be reviewed by specific reviewers.
- One useful analysis method is to group documents according to a certain theme or other criteria. Grouped documents can then be reviewed together, such that documents related to a particular criteria are all reviewed at the same time. This eliminates the need for a reviewer to keep track of multiple concepts at once. Instead, the reviewer can focus on one concept for a grouped set of documents, and move on to another later.
- In a large business, the set of collected documents number from a thousand to millions of documents. These large sets of documents pose many issues. Database performance on large numbers of records degrades quickly. Analysis on even a relatively small set of documents may take hours or even days for a relatively simple analysis, such as a count of instances of a particular phrase.
- Grouping a set of data, particularly documents, often involves clustering algorithms. Document clustering algorithms require a calculation of the similarity or dissimilarity between two or more documents or document clusters. A document cluster may be made up of two or more documents that exhibit similarity to each other.
- Clustering text documents based on their full text may be a very time consuming operation. Although full text clustering may be used for small groups of documents, it is not scalable, as full text clustering quickly becomes impractical and prohibitively difficult for large numbers of documents.
- In an embodiment, clustering on text may start by analyzing text documents to determine word counts. Documents may be then clustered together based on the word count statistics. For example, three documents that frequently mention the term “patent” may be clustered together, while four documents that frequently mention the word “copyright” may be clustered together, separate from the “patent” set.
- Clustering documents depends on the similarity between two documents. In many clustering algorithms, statistics regarding word frequency and presence in a document are used to compare documents. Documents may be represented as vectors of the words contained in each document. A term-document incidence matrix may be created to represent each document in a matrix. For example, a matrix may represent each document as a column, and each word contained in each document as a row. The matrix may omit common words such as “to” or “and”, since these words may be present in many documents. The intersection of each document column and each word row contains a value indicating whether the particular word is contained in the document. This value is entered for each document contained in the set to be clustered. A portion of a term-document index is shown in
FIG. 1 for four exemplary electronic mail messages. The term-document index ofFIG. 1 includes both content information of each electronic mail message, as well as non-content information, such as the recipient, sender, or other collaborators of each electronic mail message. - Once the term-document incidence matrix is created, each column is a vector representation of a particular document. In order to compare two documents and determine similarity between documents, a similarity calculation may be performed. Each document vector may be represented in a vector space model. To determine the similarity between two documents, a similarity measure, such as the cosine similarity, may be calculated. A cosine similarity function determines the cosine of the angle between two vectors, such as document vectors, and returns values between zero and 1. A value of zero indicates that the two documents are entirely dissimilar, while a value of 1 indicates that the two documents are identical.
- In a large document set, such as in a set of documents determined to be relevant to a litigation, clustering operations may take many hours to complete. For example, creating a term-document incidence matrix for each document in a set of thousands of documents is a lengthy operation, since the matrix may contain a large number of rows and columns. Such a matrix also may take a large amount of space on a company's computing environment. Further calculating the similarity between the documents in the matrix, if the matrix contains many documents and/or words, is another lengthy operation. Thus, in a business computing environment, with many lengthy documents, clustering on full text may be an untenable solution, and is unscalable as a collection of documents grows.
- Non-content portions of documents, however, generally contain less data. Non-content fields of a text document, for example, may include elements of metadata, such as the file name of the document, the owner or collaborator of the document, viewers of the document, or any other non-content field. Non-content fields of an electronic mail message may include collaborators, such as the sender or recipients of the e-mail, or other metadata fields of the message. Collaborators may include e-mail addresses found in the from, to, cc, bcc, reply-to, or other fields of an electronic mail message. In a given e-mail, there may only be a few collaborators, thus reducing the number of rows created in a term-document index for a given e-mail.
- While clustering based on document contents may provide a very precise resulting set of clusters, as mentioned above, a clustering algorithm run on a large body of text may take a great amount of time to complete.
- Clustering on non-content parameters of a document, in contrast, takes less time and may still provide very useful end results.
FIG. 2 shows exemplary non-content and content portions of an electronic mail message 200. For example, clustering may be performed on data contained in therecipients field 201, represented as one or more addresses in the “to:” line of an e-mail. If therecipients field 201 of a large set of e-mails includes the same recipient or recipients, the set of e-mails may form a cluster. Also, a large set of e-mails may be directed to one recipient, and may be clustered together. Identical recipients over a large set of e-mails may indicate that the e-mails in the set are related to each other, and the recipients and senders of the e-mails in the set may be working on a particular project or topic together. - As mentioned above, other non-content elements of a document may be used for clustering as well. If a set of e-mails contains messages from different user accounts, the e-mails may be clustered first on information contained in the
sender field 203. Also, documents may be clustered based on labels or tags associated with the documents, or file names/file paths if the document was placed in a specific folder on the user's computer. - In order to cluster the documents, either agglomerative clustering or partitional clustering may be used. The clustering approach chosen may depend on the advantages and/or disadvantages of each approach, the embodiment chosen, or other criteria requested by a user. However, either clustering approach, or additional clustering approaches known to those skilled in the art, may be used to implement the embodiments described herein.
-
FIG. 3A is an illustration of amethod 300 for clustering a set of documents on collaborators or other non-content information. - At
block 302, a set of electronic documents to be clustered is selected. The set of electronic documents may be previously determined as being relevant to a litigation. The documents may be e-mails, text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, or any other type of electronic document used. - At
block 304, one or more non-content fields associated with each document in the set is identified. For a set of electronic mail messages, for example, a non-content field may be the to: field of an e-mail. For a text document or a spreadsheet, the non-content field may be the creator of a document or a list of the collaborators of a document. Other non-content fields may include, for example and without limitation, a recipient of a document, sender of a document, group recipient of a document, project identifier, the date a document was created, the date a document was modified, or an element of metadata. Additional non-content fields may vary depending on the type of documents to be clustered. - At
block 306, the documents in the set established inblock 302 are clustered in accordance with the data contained in the non-content field or fields selected inblock 304. For example, if the non-content field is the recipients field of an electronic mail message, the resulting clusters may represent sets of documents with common recipients. If the non-content field selected is the collaborators of a spreadsheet, the resulting clusters may represent sets of documents with common collaborators. Further, if more than one non-content field is identified inblock 304, such as the recipients field of an electronic mail message and the date the message was sent, the resulting clusters may represent sets of documents with common recipients sent around the same date. - The clustering operation of
block 306 may be further described with reference toFIG. 3B . Atblock 306A ofFIG. 3B , each document in the set established atblock 302 is represented as a set of words. The set of words model may ignore duplicates of e-mail addresses or other non-content data. Once each document is represented as a set of words, atblock 306B, the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weight may be calculated for each element of non-content data. Thus, for example, if the identified non-content field is the from: field of an e-mail, the TF-IDF weight may be calculated for each address appearing in the from: field of the e-mails in the set. - The TF-IDF weight is a statistical measure of how important a given term is to a document in a set of documents or corpus. The TF-IDF weight increases as the occurrence of the term increases in a document, but decreases as the term occurs more often in the set of documents.
- The TF-IDF weight may not be calculated for elements of non-content data that appear below a threshold number of times. For example, a set of documents may have 10,000 e-mail addresses appearing in the from: field. A member of a legal team may only wish to cluster on addresses appearing above 300 times, for example. Thus, the TF-IDF weight may only be calculated on e-mail addresses or other elements of non-content data that appear over a threshold number of times.
- Once the TF-IDF weight is calculated for the elements of data in the non-content field, at block 306C, a term-document matrix may be created, based on the TF-IDF weights, to create a representation of the documents to be clustered and the non-content fields and data in each document. Documents may be compared to determine their similarity using cosine similarity, or other known similarity measures.
- Based on this information, documents may be clustered at
block 306D using any well known clustering algorithm, such as partitional clustering, k-means clustering, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, or any other clustering algorithm suitable for clustering large sets of documents, to create clusters of documents. - In an embodiment, before documents are clustered, data contained in the one or more non-content fields is normalized. Normalizing data may include making data representing the same concept consistent from element to element. For example, a
system implementing method 300 explained above may treat an e-mail address formatted as JohnSmith@google.com as different from johnsmith@google.com. However, e-mails sent to either address are received by the intended recipient. Normalizing data may take two e-mail addresses such as the above, and normalize them to a consistent value, such as johnsmith@google.com, so that they only represent one data point. Thus, when clustering based on e-mail addresses, only one cluster will be formed with the e-mails sent to the recipient. In an embodiment, data contained in the non-content fields is not normalized. In some computing environments, formatting or other differences may have a secondary meaning. Thus, in order to preserve this secondary meaning and create clusters that may group these differences together, data may not be normalized prior to clustering. - Once the documents are clustered, the resulting clusters may be used for a number of operations. In an embodiment, clusters may be exported to a document review tool for further analysis. For example, a cluster that identifies a group of e-mail addresses as belonging to a cluster may be reviewed by a member of a legal department familiar with the issues and subjects contained in the cluster. Also, a cluster may be exported or sent to a repository of documents to be later reviewed.
- In an embodiment, clusters created as a result of
method 300 may be further filtered according to desired criteria. Filter criteria may specify other non-content fields not used by the clustering algorithm. In the above example, a cluster may be filtered based on a particular e-mail address or other criteria to identify documents relevant to a particular matter. For example, one or more clusters may be used in a document review tool by members of a legal department or outside counsel to review documents for a litigation. In an embodiment, filter criteria may be one or more content fields, such as the body or subject of an e-mail, or text contained in a text document. - In an embodiment, in order to simplify the clustering operation and decrease the time necessary to cluster the set of documents, once the non-content field or fields to cluster on are identified, elements of non-content information that only appear infrequently in the set may be filtered out. Thus, for example and without limitation, if the set of documents is to be clustered on recipients of e-mail messages, an e-mail address that only appears twice in a set of 1000 documents as the recipient may be filtered and excluded from clustering. In this way, only documents that contain e-mail addresses that would result in useful clusters are clustered together.
- In an embodiment, weights may be assigned to one or more non-content fields to direct the results of a particular clustering algorithm. In an electronic mail message, for example, recipients of the message may be listed in each of the to: field and the cc: field of the message. However, recipients listed in the to: field may be more indicative of the message's similarity to other messages, whereas recipients listed in the cc: field may not be as important. Thus, the addresses contained in the to: field may be assigned a greater weight than addresses in the cc: field. Additionally, group names or addresses listed in the to: field of an e-mail may be indicative of common themes or projects. Thus, group names or addresses may be assigned a greater weight than other addresses.
- In an embodiment, one or more clusters of documents created as a result of
clustering method 300 may be assigned to a particular reviewer, in accordance with an access control policy. For example, if a cluster of documents is formed with documents created by a high level executive in the organization, a paralegal may not be permitted to view those documents on the basis of confidentiality. Thus, an access control policy may block the paralegal from accessing the contents of the cluster. Similarly, if a cluster of documents involves a group of technical users, the documents may be assigned to a reviewer with similar technical knowledge. -
