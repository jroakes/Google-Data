Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in transporting passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- a manual mode where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle
- autonomous mode where the vehicle essentially drives itself

- FIG. 5 is a schematic illustrating a conceptual partial view of a computer program, in accordance with an example embodiment.
- An autonomous vehicle operating on a road may rely on identifying objects in a vicinity of the vehicle to determine a safe trajectory or path for the vehicle on the road.
- following a geometric center of a lane may not be sufficient for safety; instead, the vehicle may be configured to determine a lateral position in the lane based on a plurality of factors. For example, the vehicle may take into consideration curvature of the road, proximity of static and dynamic obstacles, relative positions and speeds of the obstacles, etc.
- a computing device configured to control a vehicle following a given trajectory on a road, may be configured to identify a set of objects that may have an effect on a lateral positioning of the vehicle within a lane.
- the set of objects may include, for example, cars in adjacent lanes both behind and ahead of the vehicle, static objects (e.g., guard rails, curbs, trees, etc.), motorcycles and cyclists ahead and behind the vehicle, etc.
- the computing device may be configured to estimate characteristics of each object such as size of each object, position of each object in a respective lane, longitudinal and lateral speeds of each object relative to the vehicle, etc.
- the computing device based on the characteristics of each object and characteristics of the vehicle (e.g., speed of the vehicle), may be configured to determine an interval of time during which the vehicle will be laterally adjacent to a respective object. Further, based on a current speed and an estimated acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle, the computing device may be configured to estimate one or more longitudinal positions (e.g., discretized positions) of the vehicle on the road during the interval of time that the vehicle will be laterally adjacent to the object.
- the characteristics of each object and characteristics of the vehicle e.g., speed of the vehicle
- the computing device may be configured to estimate an interval of time during which the vehicle will be laterally adjacent to a respective object. Further, based on a current speed and an estimated acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle, the computing device may be configured to estimate one or more longitudinal positions (e.g., discretized positions) of the vehicle on the road during the interval of time that the vehicle will be laterally adjacent to the object.
- the computing device further may be configured to estimate, based on the characteristics of the respective object, a respective lateral distance for the vehicle to maintain between the vehicle and the respective object during the interval of time at the one or more estimated longitudinal positions.
- the computing device may be configured to implement heuristics, for example, to mimic human-like behavior to determine the respective lateral distance. For instance, when a large truck or a car moving at a high speed is laterally adjacent to the vehicle, the computing device may be configured to determine a lateral distance that is larger than a given lateral distance determined when a slow-moving car is laterally adjacent to the vehicle. Similarly, a large lateral distance may be determined when passing motorcycles, cyclists, and pedestrians.
- the computing device may be configured to determine larger lateral distance for dynamic objects than for static objects.
- the computing device may be configured to take into consideration other factors such as a type of lane the vehicle is currently in (e.g., a high occupancy vehicle lane), road condition, etc., to determine the respective lateral distance.
- the computing device may be configured to determine a modified trajectory for the vehicle based on respective lateral distances determined for the objects. To determine the modified trajectory, the computing device may be configured to assign a respective weight to each respective lateral distance determined for a respective object. The respective weight may, for example, be determined based on the characteristics of the respective object. The computing device may be configured to take into account the respective weights to determine the modified trajectory. The computing device may be configured to provide instructions to control the vehicle (e.g., modify speed, steering angle, etc.) to cause the vehicle to follow the modified trajectory and maintain safe lateral distances with the objects in the vicinity of the vehicle.
- modify speed e.g., modify speed, steering angle, etc.
- An example vehicle control system may be implemented in or may take the form of an automobile.
- a vehicle control system may be implemented in or take the form of other vehicles, such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, boats, airplanes, helicopters, lawn mowers, recreational vehicles, amusement park vehicles, farm equipment, construction equipment, trams, golf carts, trains, and trolleys. Other vehicles are possible as well.
- an example system may take the form of a non-transitory computer-readable medium, which has program instructions stored thereon that are executable by at least one processor to provide the functionality described herein.
- An example system may also take the form of an automobile or a subsystem of an automobile that includes such a non-transitory computer-readable medium having such program instructions stored thereon.
