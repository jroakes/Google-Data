- This specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results.
- Content in these examples can be of various formats, while the devices that consume (e.g., present) the content can be equally varied in terms of their type and capabilities.
- Content slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction.
- content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or a likelihood that the user will interact with the content presented.
- the method includes receiving a request for a content item for publication in a slot on a publisher site.
- the method further includes identifying, using one or more processors, a content item responsive to the request.
- the method further includes identifying the publisher site based on the request.
- the method further includes determining based on identifying the publisher site when to augment the content item with a feedback item and when so augmenting the content item to include the feedback item for obtaining feedback from a viewer of the content item wherein the feedback item includes a query as to a desire of the viewer to share the content item with other members of a community associated with the publisher site.
- the method further includes providing the augmented content item responsive to the request.
- the method further includes receiving feedback from the viewer based on interaction with the feedback item once presented.
- the method further includes associating the feedback with the content item.
- Determining when to augment the content item can include determining when one or more of a sponsor associated with the content item or a publisher associated with the publisher site has approved augmentation.
- Augmenting can include associating the feedback item with the content item and delivering the content item and the feedback item responsive to the request.
- Augmenting can include appending to or overlaying the feedback item on the content item creating a single unit and providing the single unit responsive to the request.
- the method can further include accumulating feedback for the content item from plural different viewers that visit the publisher site, determining statistical relevance of the feedback, and when relevant, using the feedback when deciding content items for delivery to other viewers that visit the publisher site in the future.
- the method can further include providing a recommendation along with a content item that is delivered based on the accumulated feedback.
- the recommendation can include an indication of a number of prior viewers of the community that recommended the content item.
- Associating the feedback with the content item can include storing the feedback, and the method can further include receiving a second request for content for publication in a slot on the publisher page, identifying one or more candidate content items responsive to the request, identifying feedback for the candidate content items based on the storing and using the feedback to select a content item responsive to the second request.
- the method can further include determining, for a given candidate content item, a statistical relevance of the feedback, and when relevant, using the feedback as a signal in a selection algorithm for determining the content item from the candidate content items. Statistical relevance can be based on interaction rates with content items that are selected when feedback is used to select a given content item.

- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure.
- Systems, methods, and computer program products are described for collecting and surfacing community-based recommendations.
- collecting the recommendations can be by querying users for feedback when a content item is presented on a publisher site.
- Surfacing the recommendations for example, can occur when content items (e.g., the same content item) are presented to other users, such as on the same publisher site.
- recommendations that are provided by users can be stored and used for selecting content, e.g., in response to a request for content, by selecting content items having positive recommendations over content items having negative recommendations (or no recommendations at all).
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers 109 , and the content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 and publishers 109 .
- the environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by the content management system 110 , stored somewhere else and accessible using the network 102 , generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination of these. Further, some data stores described herein may include identifiers that can be used to match or access corresponding data records or other information that are stored elsewhere, e.g. locally and/or remotely.
- a data store of eligible content items 131 can include eligible content items (e.g., advertisements) that can be selected in response to a received request for content.
- eligible content items may be deemed to be eligible, at least in part, by matching keywords and/or other selection information.
- the data store of eligible content items 131 can include, for example, an inventory of content items (e.g., creatives) provided by content sponsors 108 for presentation to users.
- Content items in the data store of eligible content items 131 can have associated with them, for example, per-content item feedback that is stored in a data store of community feedback 132 .
- the data store of community feedback 132 can include feedback provided by users in communities, including user communities that are associated with particular publisher sites.
- One or more instances of user feedback, provided by one or more different users, can all be associated with a specific content item (e.g., advertisement).
- Other information can be stored, e.g., that identifies the particular publisher site and/or user community in which the feedback was provided.
- information stored in the data store of community feedback 132 can be used to annotate content that is provided to users, such as, when a content item is provided, describing or summarizing feedback or recommendations made by other users.
- the content management system 110 can include plural engines, some or all of which may be combined or separate, and may be co-located or distributed (e.g., connected over the network 102 ).
- a content identification engine 121 can identify candidate content items from the inventory of eligible content items 131 that are responsive to a received request for content. For example, the content identification engine 121 can identify candidate content items from the eligible content items 131 , the identification performed, at least in part, by matching keywords or other information in or associated with the request for content.
- content items selected by the content identification engine 121 can be based on information stored in the data store of community feedback 132 . For example, the content identification engine 121 can make selections of content based on statistical analysis of community feedback.
- a publisher identification engine 122 can identify a publisher 109 and/or a publisher site associated with a request for content. For example, the publisher site 104 a can be identified from among the other websites 104 , e.g., based on information included with the request.
- the publisher identification engine 122 can also look up information associated with a publisher 109 , e.g., to determine if a particular publisher 109 authorizes the use of user feedback/recommendations on specific publisher sites associated with the publisher.
- An augmentation engine 123 can annotate content items (e.g., advertisements) with feedback and recommendation information, when the information exists for a particular content item.
- content items e.g., advertisements
- the augmentation engine 123 can create a feedback item for insertion into, or inclusion with, a content item, to provide an augmented content item, for example.
- the feedback item can include a query or some other call-to-action that encourages the user to provide feedback.
- the feedback item can include information about past feedback provided by other users.
- An association engine 124 can associate feedback with a content item for which the feedback was provided, e.g., when the content item was displayed on a publisher site.
- the association engine 124 can store or update information in the data store of community feedback 132 using information received from users in a community, and the information can be associated with the corresponding content item in the eligible content items 131 .
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScriptTM scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 can, for example, access the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 can be data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is provided in response to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., advertisements) can be presented.
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- other information such as information obtained from one or more snapshots, can be used to respond to the received request.
- the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item.
- a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used
- FIG. 2 shows an example system 200 for receiving user community feedback from a user for association with a content item.
- the content management system 110 can receive a content item request 202 from a user device 106 a .
- the content item request 202 can be a request for a content item 208 (e.g., an advertisement) to fill a content item slot 204 for presentation to a user 210 on a publisher site 104 a .
- a determination can be made, based on information for a publisher 109 associated with the publisher site 104 a , when to create an augmented content item 208 a that includes a feedback item 212 for obtaining feedback from the user 210 .
- the content management system 110 can provide the augmented content item 208 a to the user device 106 a for presentation to the user 210 .
- the user 210 can interact with the feedback item 212 , e.g., by answering a query 214 , resulting in feedback 216 being provided to the content management system 110 .
- the feedback 216 can be stored as community feedback 132 and associated with the content item 208 , e.g., for use in subsequent presentation of the content item 208 , including feedback from one or more users.
- the following example stages can be used for associating feedback with a content item.
- the content management system 110 can receive the content item request 202 from the user device 106 a .
- the content item request 202 can be sent from the user device 106 a , such as to fill the content item slot 204 (e.g., an ad slot) on the publisher site 104 a being viewed by a user 210 .
- the publisher site 104 a can be one of the websites 104 that is associated with a particular publisher 109 .
- the content identification engine 121 can identify the content item 208 responsive to the request.
- the content item 208 identified by the content identification engine 121 can be identified from the eligible content items 131 as a content item that matches selection criteria to fill the content item slot 204 .
- An auction or other selection mechanism can be used to select content item 208 as being responsive to the request.
- the publisher identification engine 122 can identify the publisher site 104 a based on the request. For example, the publisher site 104 a can be identified from among the other websites 104 .
- the augmentation engine 123 can determine, based on identifying the publisher site 104 a , when to augment the content item 208 with a feedback item.
- the augmentation engine 123 can augment the content item 208 (e.g., creating augmented content item 208 a ) to include the feedback item 212 for obtaining feedback from a viewer (e.g., the user 210 ) of the content item.
- the feedback item 212 can include a query 214 (e.g., along the lines of “Share your comments with other users?”).
- the query 214 can query a desire of the user 210 to share the content item 208 with other members of a community (e.g., associated with the publisher site 104 a ).
- the query 214 can be part of or in the form of a widget included with the content item that includes a recommendation gatherer.
- the widget can serve as a recommendation gatherer, e.g., in which users, such as mothers seeing an ad at a new mothers website, are asked specific questions, e.g., “would you like other moms to see this ad?”).
- Recommendations from the same ad and website can serve, for example, as “signals” from the users, e.g., who are visitors to that web site, and the signals can be gathered and attributed to particular creatives.
- the query 214 can optionally include a notification, e.g., along the lines of “Other users will see this ad, would you like to comment on it?” or “Do you recommend this ad to other members of this community ⁇ name of the website>?”
- the notification for example, can be used to notify the user about where the user's comment will appear, how the comment may be used, or otherwise inform the user of the purpose for, or use of, the solicited information.
- the content management system 110 can provide the augmented content item 208 a responsive to the request.
- the augmented content item 208 a can be provided to the user device 106 a for presentation on the publisher site 104 a , e.g., in the content item slot 204 .
- the content management system 110 can receive feedback 216 from the viewer based on interaction with the feedback item once presented. For example, when the user 210 is presented with the query 214 embedded in the augmented content item 208 a , the user 210 can provide the feedback 216 .
- the feedback 216 can serve as one of plural signals from the users (e.g., visitors to the publisher site 104 a ) that can be gathered and attributed to particular creatives.
- the query 214 may be hidden, and the query 214 can show up after the user 210 selects or interacts with a feedback control (not shown in FIG. 2 ).
- the feedback control can be a small icon (e.g., labeled with an “F” for feedback).
- the feedback control can appear (e.g., by default) in a location that users learn and understand is for providing feedback.
- the association engine 124 can associate the feedback 216 with the content item 208 .
- the association engine 124 can update information in the data store of community feedback 132 to indicate that feedback 216 is to be included when presenting the content item 208 , e.g., to other users.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process 300 for receiving user community feedback from a user for association with a content item for subsequent presentation.
- the content management system 110 can perform steps of the process 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.
- FIGS. 1-2 are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of the process 300 .
- a request is received for a content item for publication in a slot on a publisher site ( 302 ).
- the content management system 110 can receive the content item request 202 that is sent from the user device 106 a , e.g., to fill the content item slot 204 on the publisher site 104 a.
- a content item responsive to the request is identified ( 304 ).
- the content identification engine 121 can identify the content item 208 as being responsive to the content item request 202 .
- the content item 208 identified by the content identification engine 121 can be identified from the eligible content items 131 as a content item that matches selection criteria to fill the content item slot 204 .
- the publisher site is identified based on the request ( 306 ).
- the publisher identification engine 122 can identify the publisher site 104 a based on the request.
- the publisher site 104 a can be identified from among the other websites 104 . Identification of the publisher site 104 a is made in order to obtain information (e.g., as specified by an associated publisher 109 ) that identifies conditions, if any, under which augmented content items are to be provided.
- the content item is augmented to include the feedback item for obtaining feedback from a viewer of the content item ( 308 ).
- the feedback item includes a query.
- the query solicits the viewer to approve sharing the content item with other members of a community associated with the publisher site.
- the augmentation engine 123 can augment the content item 208 in order to create the augmented content item 208 a that includes the feedback item 212 .
- the feedback item 212 can include the query 214 (e.g., along the lines of “Is this a good item for sharing with others that visit this site” or “Can we share your comments with other users?”) or some other format and/or control for obtaining input from the user 210 regarding user feedback.
- the query 214 can query a desire of the user 210 to share the content item 208 with other members of a community associated with the publisher site 104 a , such as other users who frequent the publisher site 104 a.
- determining when to augment the content item can include determining when one or more of a sponsor associated with the content item or a publisher associated with the publisher site has approved augmentation. For example, some portion of the eligible content items 131 can be defined by an associated content sponsor 108 as being content items for which augmentation is to occur, as described in this document.
- content sponsors 108 can provide content selection parameters that indicate, for example, that creatives (e.g., advertisement creatives) in a campaign are to include or can be modified to include augmentation in certain conditions, e.g., depending on a type of content item request 202 . Conditions can include or relate to, for example, mobile versus non-mobile requests, time of day, user demographics, or other conditions.
- content sponsors 108 may have campaigns for which content items are not to be augmented.
- Publishers 109 can also control augmentation, for example, based on specific publisher sites 104 a that either are approved or not approved for augmentation.
- Approved publisher sites 104 a can have the same or different conditions as described above for content sponsors 108 (e.g., including request types such as mobile versus non-mobile requests, time of day, user demographics, or other conditions) as to when or how augmentation occurs.
- the augmented content item is provided responsive to the request ( 310 ).
- the content management system 110 can provide the augmented content item 208 a responsive to the content item request 202 .
- the content management system 110 can provide the augmented content item 208 a to the user device 106 a for presentation on the publisher site 104 a , e.g., in the content item slot 204 .
- augmenting the content item can include associating the feedback item with the content item and delivering the content item and the feedback item responsive to the request.
- the augmentation engine 123 can associate the feedback item 212 with the content item 208 , and the content management system 110 can provide the feedback item 212 and the content item 208 in response to the content item request 202 .
- augmenting the content item can include appending to or overlaying the feedback item on the content item, creating a single unit, and providing the single unit responsive to the request.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, including a method for providing content. A request is received for a content item for publication in a slot on a publisher site. A content item responsive to the request is identified. The publisher site is identified based on the request. A determination is made when to augment the content item with a feedback item. The content item is augmented to include the feedback item for obtaining feedback from a viewer of the content item. The feedback item includes a query as to a desire of the viewer to share the content item with other members of a community associated with the publisher site. The augmented content item is provided responsive to the request. Feedback is received from the viewer based on interaction with the feedback item once presented. The feedback is associated with the content item.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results. Content in these examples can be of various formats, while the devices that consume (e.g., present) the content can be equally varied in terms of their type and capabilities.
- Content slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or a likelihood that the user will interact with the content presented.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content. The method includes receiving a request for a content item for publication in a slot on a publisher site. The method further includes identifying, using one or more processors, a content item responsive to the request. The method further includes identifying the publisher site based on the request. The method further includes determining based on identifying the publisher site when to augment the content item with a feedback item and when so augmenting the content item to include the feedback item for obtaining feedback from a viewer of the content item wherein the feedback item includes a query as to a desire of the viewer to share the content item with other members of a community associated with the publisher site. The method further includes providing the augmented content item responsive to the request. The method further includes receiving feedback from the viewer based on interaction with the feedback item once presented. The method further includes associating the feedback with the content item.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining when to augment the content item can include determining when one or more of a sponsor associated with the content item or a publisher associated with the publisher site has approved augmentation. Augmenting can include associating the feedback item with the content item and delivering the content item and the feedback item responsive to the request. Augmenting can include appending to or overlaying the feedback item on the content item creating a single unit and providing the single unit responsive to the request. The method can further include accumulating feedback for the content item from plural different viewers that visit the publisher site, determining statistical relevance of the feedback, and when relevant, using the feedback when deciding content items for delivery to other viewers that visit the publisher site in the future. The method can further include providing a recommendation along with a content item that is delivered based on the accumulated feedback. The recommendation can include an indication of a number of prior viewers of the community that recommended the content item. Associating the feedback with the content item can include storing the feedback, and the method can further include receiving a second request for content for publication in a slot on the publisher page, identifying one or more candidate content items responsive to the request, identifying feedback for the candidate content items based on the storing and using the feedback to select a content item responsive to the second request. The method can further include determining, for a given candidate content item, a statistical relevance of the feedback, and when relevant, using the feedback as a signal in a selection algorithm for determining the content item from the candidate content items. Statistical relevance can be based on interaction rates with content items that are selected when feedback is used to select a given content item.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by one or more processors, cause the processor to: receive a request for a content item for publication in a slot on a publisher site; identify a content item responsive to the request; identify the publisher site based on the request; determine based on identifying the publisher site when to augment the content item with a feedback item, and when so, augment the content item to include the feedback item for obtaining feedback from a viewer of the content item, wherein the feedback item includes a query as to a desire of the viewer to share the content item with other members of a community associated with the publisher site; provide the augmented content item responsive to the request; receive feedback from the viewer based on interaction with the feedback item once presented; and associate the feedback with the content item.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining when to augment the content item can include determining when one or more of a sponsor associated with the content item or a publisher associated with the publisher site has approved augmentation. Augmenting can include associating the feedback item with the content item and delivering the content item and the feedback item responsive to the request. Augmenting can include appending to or overlaying the feedback item on the content item creating a single unit and providing the single unit responsive to the request. The instructions can further include instructions to accumulate feedback for the content item from plural different viewers that visit the publisher site, determining statistical relevance of the feedback, and when relevant, using the feedback when deciding content items for delivery to other viewers that visit the publisher site in the future.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems, including a system comprising one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: receive a request for a content item for publication in a slot on a publisher site; identify a content item responsive to the request; identify the publisher site based on the request; determine based on identifying the publisher site when to augment the content item with a feedback item, and when so, augment the content item to include the feedback item for obtaining feedback from a viewer of the content item, wherein the feedback item includes a query as to a desire of the viewer to share the content item with other members of a community associated with the publisher site; provide the augmented content item responsive to the request; receive feedback from the viewer based on interaction with the feedback item once presented; and associate the feedback with the content item.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining when to augment the content item can include determining when one or more of a sponsor associated with the content item or a publisher associated with the publisher site has approved augmentation. Augmenting can include associating the feedback item with the content item and delivering the content item and the feedback item responsive to the request. Augmenting can include appending to or overlaying the feedback item on the content item creating a single unit and providing the single unit responsive to the request. The instructions can further include instructions to accumulate feedback for the content item from plural different viewers that visit the publisher site, determining statistical relevance of the feedback, and when relevant, using the feedback when deciding content items for delivery to other viewers that visit the publisher site in the future.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Users who receive and view content items (e.g., advertisements) displayed on publisher sites, for example, can see content items that are accompanied by a notification describing how many other users/visitors of that particular publisher, website or community have recommended, approved or engaged with the content item. User feedback and recommendations can be used to optimize algorithms for selecting content and providing more meaningful content to users.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 2 shows an example system for receiving user community feedback from a user for association with a content item for subsequent presentation. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process for receiving user community feedback from a user for association with a content item for subsequent presentation. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Systems, methods, and computer program products are described for collecting and surfacing community-based recommendations. For example, collecting the recommendations can be by querying users for feedback when a content item is presented on a publisher site. Surfacing the recommendations, for example, can occur when content items (e.g., the same content item) are presented to other users, such as on the same publisher site. In some implementations, recommendations that are provided by users can be stored and used for selecting content, e.g., in response to a request for content, by selecting content items having positive recommendations over content items having negative recommendations (or no recommendations at all).
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect and/or use personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for providing content. Theexample environment 100 includes acontent management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers),publishers 109, and thecontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 andpublishers 109. - The
environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by thecontent management system 110, stored somewhere else and accessible using thenetwork 102, generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination of these. Further, some data stores described herein may include identifiers that can be used to match or access corresponding data records or other information that are stored elsewhere, e.g. locally and/or remotely. - A data store of
eligible content items 131, for example, can include eligible content items (e.g., advertisements) that can be selected in response to a received request for content. For example, eligible content items may be deemed to be eligible, at least in part, by matching keywords and/or other selection information. The data store ofeligible content items 131 can include, for example, an inventory of content items (e.g., creatives) provided bycontent sponsors 108 for presentation to users. Content items in the data store ofeligible content items 131 can have associated with them, for example, per-content item feedback that is stored in a data store ofcommunity feedback 132. For example, the data store ofcommunity feedback 132 can include feedback provided by users in communities, including user communities that are associated with particular publisher sites. One or more instances of user feedback, provided by one or more different users, can all be associated with a specific content item (e.g., advertisement). Other information can be stored, e.g., that identifies the particular publisher site and/or user community in which the feedback was provided. Further, information stored in the data store ofcommunity feedback 132 can be used to annotate content that is provided to users, such as, when a content item is provided, describing or summarizing feedback or recommendations made by other users. - The
content management system 110 can include plural engines, some or all of which may be combined or separate, and may be co-located or distributed (e.g., connected over the network 102). Acontent identification engine 121, for example, can identify candidate content items from the inventory ofeligible content items 131 that are responsive to a received request for content. For example, thecontent identification engine 121 can identify candidate content items from theeligible content items 131, the identification performed, at least in part, by matching keywords or other information in or associated with the request for content. In some implementations, content items selected by thecontent identification engine 121 can be based on information stored in the data store ofcommunity feedback 132. For example, thecontent identification engine 121 can make selections of content based on statistical analysis of community feedback. - A
publisher identification engine 122, for example, can identify apublisher 109 and/or a publisher site associated with a request for content. For example, thepublisher site 104 a can be identified from among theother websites 104, e.g., based on information included with the request. Thepublisher identification engine 122 can also look up information associated with apublisher 109, e.g., to determine if aparticular publisher 109 authorizes the use of user feedback/recommendations on specific publisher sites associated with the publisher. - An
augmentation engine 123, for example, can annotate content items (e.g., advertisements) with feedback and recommendation information, when the information exists for a particular content item. For example, in response to a request received by thecontent management system 110, theaugmentation engine 123 can create a feedback item for insertion into, or inclusion with, a content item, to provide an augmented content item, for example. In some implementations, the feedback item can include a query or some other call-to-action that encourages the user to provide feedback. In some implementations, the feedback item can include information about past feedback provided by other users. - An
association engine 124, for example, can associate feedback with a content item for which the feedback was provided, e.g., when the content item was displayed on a publisher site. For example, theassociation engine 124 can store or update information in the data store ofcommunity feedback 132 using information received from users in a community, and the information can be associated with the corresponding content item in theeligible content items 131. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript™ scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in anindexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 can, for example, access the indexedcache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 can be data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is provided in response to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. - When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content (e.g., a video) are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110 in association with a given request. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In addition, when no search is performed or no keywords are available (e.g., because the user is not browsing a webpage), other information, such as information obtained from one or more snapshots, can be used to respond to the received request. In some implementations, the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive offers fromcontent sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors. - A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.

FIG. 2 shows anexample system 200 for receiving user community feedback from a user for association with a content item. For example, thecontent management system 110 can receive acontent item request 202 from auser device 106 a. Thecontent item request 202, for example, can be a request for a content item 208 (e.g., an advertisement) to fill acontent item slot 204 for presentation to auser 210 on apublisher site 104 a. A determination can be made, based on information for apublisher 109 associated with thepublisher site 104 a, when to create anaugmented content item 208 a that includes afeedback item 212 for obtaining feedback from theuser 210. Thecontent management system 110, for example, can provide the augmentedcontent item 208 a to theuser device 106 a for presentation to theuser 210. Theuser 210 can interact with thefeedback item 212, e.g., by answering aquery 214, resulting infeedback 216 being provided to thecontent management system 110. At thecontent management system 110, for example, thefeedback 216 can be stored ascommunity feedback 132 and associated with thecontent item 208, e.g., for use in subsequent presentation of thecontent item 208, including feedback from one or more users. In some implementations, the following example stages can be used for associating feedback with a content item. - At stage 1, for example, the
content management system 110 can receive thecontent item request 202 from theuser device 106 a. For example, thecontent item request 202 can be sent from theuser device 106 a, such as to fill the content item slot 204 (e.g., an ad slot) on thepublisher site 104 a being viewed by auser 210. Thepublisher site 104 a, for example, can be one of thewebsites 104 that is associated with aparticular publisher 109. - At
stage 2, for example, thecontent identification engine 121 can identify thecontent item 208 responsive to the request. For example, thecontent item 208 identified by thecontent identification engine 121 can be identified from theeligible content items 131 as a content item that matches selection criteria to fill thecontent item slot 204. An auction or other selection mechanism can be used to selectcontent item 208 as being responsive to the request. - At stage 3, for example, the
publisher identification engine 122 can identify thepublisher site 104 a based on the request. For example, thepublisher site 104 a can be identified from among theother websites 104. - At
stage 4, for example, theaugmentation engine 123 can determine, based on identifying thepublisher site 104 a, when to augment thecontent item 208 with a feedback item. When augmentation is indicated, for example, theaugmentation engine 123 can augment the content item 208 (e.g., creatingaugmented content item 208 a) to include thefeedback item 212 for obtaining feedback from a viewer (e.g., the user 210) of the content item. For example, thefeedback item 212 can include a query 214 (e.g., along the lines of “Share your comments with other users?”). Thequery 214, for example, can query a desire of theuser 210 to share thecontent item 208 with other members of a community (e.g., associated with thepublisher site 104 a). In some implementations, thequery 214 can be part of or in the form of a widget included with the content item that includes a recommendation gatherer. For example, the widget can serve as a recommendation gatherer, e.g., in which users, such as mothers seeing an ad at a new mothers website, are asked specific questions, e.g., “would you like other moms to see this ad?”). Recommendations from the same ad and website can serve, for example, as “signals” from the users, e.g., who are visitors to that web site, and the signals can be gathered and attributed to particular creatives. For example, thequery 214 can optionally include a notification, e.g., along the lines of “Other users will see this ad, would you like to comment on it?” or “Do you recommend this ad to other members of this community <name of the website>?” The notification, for example, can be used to notify the user about where the user's comment will appear, how the comment may be used, or otherwise inform the user of the purpose for, or use of, the solicited information. - At
stage 5, for example, thecontent management system 110 can provide the augmentedcontent item 208 a responsive to the request. As an example, theaugmented content item 208 a can be provided to theuser device 106 a for presentation on thepublisher site 104 a, e.g., in thecontent item slot 204. - At
stage 6, for example, thecontent management system 110 can receivefeedback 216 from the viewer based on interaction with the feedback item once presented. For example, when theuser 210 is presented with thequery 214 embedded in the augmentedcontent item 208 a, theuser 210 can provide thefeedback 216. In some implementations, thefeedback 216 can serve as one of plural signals from the users (e.g., visitors to thepublisher site 104 a) that can be gathered and attributed to particular creatives. In some implementations, thequery 214 may be hidden, and thequery 214 can show up after theuser 210 selects or interacts with a feedback control (not shown inFIG. 2 ). For example, the feedback control can be a small icon (e.g., labeled with an “F” for feedback). In some implementations, the feedback control can appear (e.g., by default) in a location that users learn and understand is for providing feedback. - At
stage 7, for example, theassociation engine 124 can associate thefeedback 216 with thecontent item 208. For example, theassociation engine 124 can update information in the data store ofcommunity feedback 132 to indicate thatfeedback 216 is to be included when presenting thecontent item 208, e.g., to other users. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for receiving user community feedback from a user for association with a content item for subsequent presentation. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can perform steps of theprocess 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-2 are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 300. - A request is received for a content item for publication in a slot on a publisher site (302). As an example, the
content management system 110 can receive thecontent item request 202 that is sent from theuser device 106 a, e.g., to fill thecontent item slot 204 on thepublisher site 104 a. - A content item responsive to the request is identified (304). As an example, the
content identification engine 121 can identify thecontent item 208 as being responsive to thecontent item request 202. For example, thecontent item 208 identified by thecontent identification engine 121 can be identified from theeligible content items 131 as a content item that matches selection criteria to fill thecontent item slot 204. - The publisher site is identified based on the request (306). For example, the
publisher identification engine 122 can identify thepublisher site 104 a based on the request. For example, thepublisher site 104 a can be identified from among theother websites 104. Identification of thepublisher site 104 a is made in order to obtain information (e.g., as specified by an associated publisher 109) that identifies conditions, if any, under which augmented content items are to be provided. - Based on identifying the publisher site, a determination is made when to augment the content item with a feedback item, and when so, the content item is augmented to include the feedback item for obtaining feedback from a viewer of the content item (308). In some implementations, the feedback item includes a query. In some implementations, the query solicits the viewer to approve sharing the content item with other members of a community associated with the publisher site. For example, the
augmentation engine 123 can augment thecontent item 208 in order to create theaugmented content item 208 a that includes thefeedback item 212. Thefeedback item 212, for example, can include the query 214 (e.g., along the lines of “Is this a good item for sharing with others that visit this site” or “Can we share your comments with other users?”) or some other format and/or control for obtaining input from theuser 210 regarding user feedback. Thequery 214, for example, can query a desire of theuser 210 to share thecontent item 208 with other members of a community associated with thepublisher site 104 a, such as other users who frequent thepublisher site 104 a. - In some implementations, determining when to augment the content item can include determining when one or more of a sponsor associated with the content item or a publisher associated with the publisher site has approved augmentation. For example, some portion of the
eligible content items 131 can be defined by an associatedcontent sponsor 108 as being content items for which augmentation is to occur, as described in this document. In some implementations, content sponsors 108 can provide content selection parameters that indicate, for example, that creatives (e.g., advertisement creatives) in a campaign are to include or can be modified to include augmentation in certain conditions, e.g., depending on a type ofcontent item request 202. Conditions can include or relate to, for example, mobile versus non-mobile requests, time of day, user demographics, or other conditions. Similarly, content sponsors 108 may have campaigns for which content items are not to be augmented.Publishers 109 can also control augmentation, for example, based onspecific publisher sites 104 a that either are approved or not approved for augmentation. Approvedpublisher sites 104 a can have the same or different conditions as described above for content sponsors 108 (e.g., including request types such as mobile versus non-mobile requests, time of day, user demographics, or other conditions) as to when or how augmentation occurs. - The augmented content item is provided responsive to the request (310). The
content management system 110, for example, can provide the augmentedcontent item 208 a responsive to thecontent item request 202. As an example, thecontent management system 110 can provide the augmentedcontent item 208 a to theuser device 106 a for presentation on thepublisher site 104 a, e.g., in thecontent item slot 204. - In some implementations, augmenting the content item can include associating the feedback item with the content item and delivering the content item and the feedback item responsive to the request. For example, the
augmentation engine 123 can associate thefeedback item 212 with thecontent item 208, and thecontent management system 110 can provide thefeedback item 212 and thecontent item 208 in response to thecontent item request 202. - In some implementations, augmenting the content item can include appending to or overlaying the feedback item on the content item, creating a single unit, and providing the single unit responsive to the request. For example, the
augmentation engine 123 can embed or otherwise overlay thefeedback items 212 in the augmentedcontent item 208 a, as described above. When thecontent item 208 is an advertisement, for example, the embedding or overlaying can occur in a portion of thecontent item 208 that is free space, free of text, or that does not obscure important parts (e.g., image features) in the content item. - Feedback is received from the viewer based on interaction with the feedback item once presented (312). The
content management system 110, for example, can receivefeedback 216 from the viewer based on interaction with the feedback item once presented. For example, when theuser 210 is presented with thequery 214 embedded in the augmentedcontent item 208 a, theuser 210 can provide the feedback 216 (e.g., an answer to the query). - The feedback is associated with the content item (314). For example, the
association engine 124 can associate thefeedback 216 with thecontent item 208. For example, theassociation engine 124 can update information in the data store ofcommunity feedback 132 to indicate thatfeedback 216 is to be included when presenting thecontent item 208, e.g., to other users. - In some implementations, associating the feedback with the content item can include storing the feedback, and the
process 300 can further include receiving a second request for content for publication in a slot on the publisher page, identifying one or more candidate content items responsive to the request, identifying feedback for the candidate content items based on the storing, and using the feedback to select a content item responsive to the second request. For example, sometime after thecontent management system 110 receives and processes thecontent item request 202, as described above, an additionalcontent item request 202 can be received. The request, for example, can be a request for a content item to fill the samecontent item slot 204, or the request can be to fill a different slot on thepublisher site 104 a. In response to the received secondcontent item request 202, for example, thecontent identification engine 121 can identify one or more of theeligible content items 131 that are responsive to the request. Thecontent identification engine 121 can select a particular one of theeligible content items 131 to provide in response to the request based on stored feedback that is associated with the content item. - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include accumulating feedback for the content item from plural different viewers that visit the publisher site, determining statistical relevance of the feedback, and when relevant, using the feedback when deciding content items for delivery to other viewers that visit the publisher site in the future. For example, thecontent management system 110 can process multiple instances offeedback 216 that have been provided byplural users 210. Thecontent identification engine 121, for example, can evaluate plural instances of storedfeedback 216. The evaluation can include, for example, identifying instances of each of positive, neutral and negative feedback. Thecontent management system 110, for example, can perform statistical analysis on the feedback and determine, for example, when to provide thecontent item 208 to other users who visit thepublisher site 104 a. For example, if a website, such as thepublisher site 104 a, caters to a geographically and demographically large audience, sufficient statistics may exist to match “recommended ads” to ad requests, e.g., to use user signals in the form offeedback 216 to determine which ad(s) to show. Content items (e.g., advertisements) can be selected, for example, based on relevance (e.g., based on matching one or more criteria) and/or significance (e.g., determined based on performance metrics such as click-through rates or other user interactions). - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include providing a recommendation along with a content item that is delivered based on the accumulated feedback. For example, thecontent management system 110 can include, such as using an overlay, a feedback-derived recommendation, e.g., along the lines of “Several people have recommended this product!” - In some implementations, the recommendation can include an indication of a number of prior viewers of the community that recommended the content item. For example, the
content management system 110 can include, with the recommendation, information along the lines of “14 people visiting the Example Site liked the ad and recommended the shoes.” Other formats and information can be provided, e.g., including using a rating (e.g., determined for each content item). For example, notification can include information along the lines of “X % of Example Site moms watched and approved/recommended this ad” or “Some number N of Example Site moms . . . Click here to expand.” Other formats and information are possible. - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include determining, for a given candidate content item, a statistical relevance of the feedback, and when relevant, using the feedback as a signal in a selection algorithm for determining the content item from the candidate content items. For example, thecontent management system 110 can analyze the receivedfeedback 216 and determine, using statistical techniques, when to include, such as using an overlay, a feedback-derived recommendation, such as along the lines of “14 people visiting the Example Site liked the ad about shoes.” - In some implementations, the statistical relevance can be based on interaction rates with content items that are selected when feedback is used to select a given content item. For example, the
content management system 110 can track user interactions (e.g., click-throughs, conversions, etc.) that occur when users are presented content items that are selected based on existing storedfeedback 216.Eligible content items 131 that have a higher click-through rate (or that have a higher conversion rate) can be selected by thecontent identification engine 121 over eligible content items having lower interaction rates. -

speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for thecomputing device 400, while the low-speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is an example only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled tomemory 404, display 416 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 410, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 412 is coupled tostorage device 406 and low-speed bus 414.

In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as alaptop computer 422. Alternatively, components fromcomputing device 400 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such ascomputing device 450. Each of such devices may contain one or more ofcomputing devices multiple computing devices -
Computing device 450 includes aprocessor 452,memory 464, an input/output device such as adisplay 454, acommunication interface 466, and atransceiver 468, among other components. Thecomputing device 450 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a micro-drive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of thecomponents - The
processor 452 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 450, including instructions stored in thememory 464. The processor may also include separate analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of thecomputing device 450, such as control of user interfaces, applications run by computingdevice 450, and wireless communication bycomputing device 450. -
Processor 452 may communicate with a user throughcontrol interface 458 anddisplay interface 456 coupled to adisplay 454. Thedisplay 454 may be, for example, a TFT LCD display or an OLED display, or other appropriate display technology. Thedisplay interface 456 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving thedisplay 454 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 458 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 452. In addition, anexternal interface 462 may be provided in communication withprocessor 452, so as to enable near area communication ofcomputing device 450 with other devices.External interface 462 may provide, for example, for wired communication (e.g., via a docking procedure) or for wireless communication (e.g., via Bluetooth® or other such technologies). - The
memory 464 stores information within thecomputing device 450. In one implementation, thememory 464 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, thememory 464 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 464 is a non-volatile memory unit or units.Expansion memory 474 may also be provided and connected tocomputing device 450 through expansion interface 472, which may include, for example, a subscriber identification module (SIM) card interface.Such expansion memory 474 may provide extra storage space forcomputing device 450, or may also store applications or other information forcomputing device 450. Specifically,expansion memory 474 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example,expansion memory 474 may be provide as a security module forcomputing device 450, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use ofcomputing device 450. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory may include for example, flash memory and/or MRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the
memory 464,expansion memory 474, or memory onprocessor 452. -
Computing device 450 may communicate wirelessly throughcommunication interface 466, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary.Communication interface 466 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through transceiver 468 (e.g., a radio-frequency transceiver). In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth®, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition,GPS receiver module 470 may provide additional wireless data tocomputing device 450, which may be used as appropriate by applications running oncomputing device 450. -
Computing device 450 may also communicate audibly usingaudio codec 460, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information.Audio codec 460 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset ofcomputing device 450. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating oncomputing device 450. - The
computing device 450 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as acellular telephone 480. It may also be implemented as part of asmartphone 482, personal digital assistant, or other mobile device. - Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. Other programming paradigms can be used, e.g., functional programming, logical programming, or other programming. As used herein, the terms “machine-readable medium” “computer-readable medium” refers to any computer program product, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term “machine-readable signal” refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
- To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
- Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- Thus, particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
