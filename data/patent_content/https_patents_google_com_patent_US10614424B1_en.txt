Abstract
Provided are methods and systems for creating events in a calendar application by providing a user with a suggestion service (e.g., tool, function, etc.) for entering various details about the events. The event creation suggestion service is designed to provide the user with a single-box suggestion-like experience that allows the user to quickly and easily enter information about an event (e.g., event title, event location, event date and/or start/end time, contacts to be associated with the event, etc.). With each keystroke a user may be given a set of suggestions (e.g., auto-completions) to choose from. In this manner, the user may create detailed events by typing in one box as if the user is only entering the title for the event, and selecting from relevant suggestions that are provided.
Description
Conventional calendar client applications typically implement an event creation flow by presenting a user with a form containing many different fields representing different event details (e.g., event title, event start/end times, event location, guests, etc.). While such a form may allow users to enter many of the necessary details for the event, most users only specify partial information (e.g., event title and start time) for the event, and presenting users with such a comprehensive form often makes them feel overwhelmed.
This Summary introduces a selection of concepts in a simplified form in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the present disclosure. This Summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure, and is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the disclosure or to delineate the scope of the disclosure.

Various examples and embodiments will now be described. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and enabling description of these examples. One skilled in the relevant art will understand, however, that one or more embodiments described herein may be practiced without many of these details. Likewise, one skilled in the relevant art will also understand that one or more embodiments of the present disclosure can include many other obvious features not described in detail herein. Additionally, some well-known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail below, so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description.
Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to methods and systems for providing users with assistance for creating time-based events. As will be described in greater detail below, a user may be provided with a suggestion service (e.g., tool, function, etc.) for entering various details about any of a variety of time-based events (e.g., calendar events, tasks, etc.). The event creation suggestion service of the present disclosure is designed to provide the user with a single-box suggestion-like experience that allows the user to quickly and easily enter information about an event (e.g., event title, event location, event start/end time, contacts to be associated with the event, etc.). In accordance with at least one embodiment described herein, with each keystroke (e.g., on a digital keyboard provided for display on a user device such as, for example, a cellular telephone, smartphone, etc.) a user may be given a set of suggestions (e.g., auto-completions) to choose from. In this manner, a user may create detailed events by typing in one box (e.g., as if the user is only entering the title for the event) and selecting from relevant suggestions that are provided.
It should be noted that in accordance with one or more embodiments, the suggestions provided to a user may be of different types or categories from one another, and may relate to entities other than data components typically associated with an event including, for example, documents, attachments, recurrence settings, notification timers, as well as any other types of suggestions deemed relevant to what the user is inputting (e.g., typing).
The methods and systems of the present disclosure are designed to make the process of creating events faster and more efficient for the user while also encouraging the user to enter more structured data (e.g., contacts, locations, etc.). As will be further described herein, the event creation suggestion service of the present disclosure makes creating or editing an event (e.g., a calendar event) into an incremental process whereby a user types in some details about the event, accepts a relevant suggestion (e.g., a location for the event, a contact to associate with the event, etc.), and continues typing to specify additional details (and also possibly triggering one or more other suggestions). Among numerous other advantages, the methods and systems described herein make the title field (e.g., the data entry field for entering a title for an event) in an event creation/edit mode more powerful by providing suggestions for titles, locations, contacts, dates, times, as well as numerous other data and/or content entities determined to be relevant to input from the user.
The methods and systems of the present disclosure may be implemented as a suggestion service that takes user-entered text as an input and provides a set of suggestions representing various event details. In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, the suggestion functionality used by an event creation server (e.g., Event Creation Server 140 in the example system 100 shown in FIG. 1 , the details of which are further described herein) may include one or more components configured for particular suggestion of event details.
In accordance with one or more embodiments described herein, Event Creation Server 140 may include a Front-End Server 145, CPU 160, Memory 165, and Suggestion Engine 150, and may be configured to generate suggestions for a user to quickly and easily enter information about a time-based event (e.g., event title, event location, event start/end time, contacts to be associated with the event, etc.).
Event Creation Server 140 (which may sometimes be referred to herein as the “Quick Create Server”) may be configured to act as mixer of suggestions generated from different sources. For example, in accordance with at least one embodiment, the Suggestion Engine 150 of the Event Creation Server 140 may include Ranking & Mixing Module 155, which may be configured to determine relevant candidate suggestions and order (e.g., prioritize, rank, or otherwise organize) such suggestions based on one or more parameters, rules, etc. For example, Ranking & Mixing Module 155 may use data obtained (e.g., retrieved, received, etc.) from Location Suggestion Server 170, Event Title Suggestion Server 175 (which may be configured to store template event titles in one or more databases such as Event Titles Database 180), User Event History Database 190 a, User Contacts Database 190 b, or some combination thereof, to sort candidate suggestions according to, for example, type of suggestion (e.g., title, date/time, location, contact, etc.), strength of relevancy of the suggestion (e.g., which may be determined based on frequency of use by the particular user and/or other users), and/or any user preferences or settings configured by the user (e.g., only provide suggestions for event locations, do not provide contact suggestions, etc.).
In accordance with at least one embodiment, Event Creation Server 140 may support the following non-exhaustive list of types of suggestions: (i) templates, which may be based on frequent titles of events; (ii) connector terms; (iii) people, which may be based on a user's contacts; (iv) locations, which may be based on a maps database and may also be based on stored location data for the user (provided that user has consented to such stored data); (v) dates and/or times; and (vi) personal history suggestions.
Event Title Suggestions (182). This type of suggestion is intended to assist the user in creating events with commonly or frequently used titles (e.g., “Dinner”, “Tennis game”, “Yoga”, etc.). In accordance with one or more embodiments, the Event Title Suggestions (182) may be based on event titles commonly or frequently used by some or all users of the calendar application 110. For example, the pool of candidate (e.g., supported, available, etc.) event titles that may be utilized to generate Event Title Suggestions (182) may be mined from existing events stored in a calendar backend or database (not shown). In accordance with at least one embodiment, the user's input (e.g., user input data (174)) may be matched against this pool in order to find the most relevant frequent titles (if any). In accordance with one or more other embodiments, Event Title Suggestions (182) may be based on various other data associated with existing events, including, for example, contacts associated with events, locations for events, dates and/or times of events, and the like.
Event Date/Time Suggestions (183). In accordance with one or more embodiments described herein, date and/or time suggestions may be provided for an event being created by a user, where the date and/or time suggestions may be generated by parsing out relevant data from the user's input (e.g., in the event creation field), may be based on date/time data associated with existing and/or past events of the user, or some combination thereof. For example, while a user is entering data about an event, the entered data may be parsed to determine relevant date (e.g., June 16, next Tuesday) and/or time (e.g., 3:00 PM) suggestions to provide to the user.
Event History Suggestions (184). In accordance with at least one embodiment, Event History Suggestions (184) may include suggestions based on a user's personal event history (e.g., based on the events that are already present in the user's personal calendar). For example, event titles that occurred previously in a user's calendar may be used as suggestions. Some non-limiting examples of Event History Suggestions (184) may include “Babysit Julia”, “piano practice for the contest”, “change to winter tires”, etc.
In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, user input data (172), suggestions selections (174), user location data (176), and/or various other data associated with a user may be utilized to provide the user with suggestions corresponding to an event being created by the user (e.g., in the user's calendar application). Such user input data and/or location data associated with the user may be received (e.g., at an Event Creation Server 150, as will be described in greater detail below) from any one or more of a variety of user devices 105 of the user (e.g., belonging to, authorized for use by, or otherwise associated with the user), and the various suggestions (e.g., Event Title Suggestions (182), Event Date/Time Suggestions (183), Event History Suggestions (184), Event Contact Suggestions (186), and/or Event Location Suggestions (188)) may be provided to any one or more of the same or different such user devices 105 for presentation to the user.
In accordance with at least one embodiment, User Device 105 may include Events Application 110, GPS Unit 115, Memory 120, and CPU 125. Examples of such user devices include laptop computers, tablet computing devices, mobile telephones, smartphones, wearable user computing devices (e.g., wristwatch or glasses configured as computing devices), as well as numerous other types or variations of such devices similar in nature and/or functionality.
In accordance with at least one embodiment, the Events Application 110 (e.g., a client application, such as a calendaring application) may be configured to aggregate all of the event details accepted by the user and send the aggregated data back to the Event Creation Server 140 as part of Suggestions Selections (174). The Event Creation Server 140 may use the aggregated event data for suggestions ranking and filtering processes (e.g., by Ranking & Mixing Module 155 of Suggestion Engine 150).
It should be understood that, in accordance with one or more other embodiments of the present disclosure, one or more of Event Creation Server 140, Authentication Server 135, Location Suggestion Server 170, Event Title Suggestion Server, Event Titles Database 180, User Event History Database 190 a, and User Contacts Database 190 b, may be a component in a larger system or service for providing users with assistance in the creation of time-based events. For example, Event Creation Server 140 may be an independent component in such a larger system or may be a subcomponent within an independent component (not shown) of the system. Similarly, one or more of Front-End Server 145, Suggestion Engine 150, and Ranking & Mixing Module 155 may be separate and/or independent components of Event Creation Server 140. In addition, in accordance with one or more other embodiments of the present disclosure, one or more other components, modules, units, etc., may be included as part of the example system 100, in addition to or instead of those illustrated in FIG. 1 . The names used to identify the various servers, databases, and other components in the example system 100 shown in FIG. 1 (e.g., “Suggestion Engine”, “Event Title Suggestion Server”, “Ranking & Mixing Module”, etc.), as well as the data exchanged between such components (e.g., “Selection Suggestions”, “Event History Suggestions”, etc.) are exemplary in nature, and are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.
As described above, one or more embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a suggestion service that takes input from a user during the creation of a time-based event and provides a set of suggestions representing various data components of the event based on the input. For example, input (e.g., text input) from a user (206) may be detected in an event creation field of an Events Application 210 (e.g., a calendar application, task-manager application, etc.), which may be installed on or accessed from, for example, a user device (e.g., user device 105 in the example system 100 shown in FIG. 1 ).
The detected input from the user may be sent with a request for event data suggestions (208) to an Event Creation Server 240. The Event Creation Server 240 may, based on the received user input and request for suggestions (208), send a request for frequent event titles data (212) to Title Suggestion Server 275, send a request for location suggestions (214) to Location Suggestion Server 270, and send one or more requests for user contact data and/or event history data (216) to one or more User Data Sources 290.
In response to sending the requests (212), (214), and (216), the Event Creation Server 240 may receive frequent titles data (218) from Title Suggestion Server 275, one or more location suggestions (222) from Location Suggestion Server 270, and user contact and/or event history data (224) from one or more of the User Data Sources 290.
In accordance with at least one embodiment described herein, the Event Creation Server 240 may use the received frequent titles data (218), location suggestions (222), user contact and/or event history data (224), as well as various other data (e.g., date/time data, not shown in FIG. 2 ) to generate one or more suggestions (226) for data about the event being created by the user. The Event Creation Server 240 may order (e.g., rank, prioritize, organize, etc.) the suggestions based on one or more criteria, preferences, settings, or the like, and send the ordered suggestions for event data (228) to the Events Application 210 for presentation to the user.
In accordance with at least one embodiment, the methods and systems of the present disclosure for providing event creation data suggestions to a user may include matching a query (e.g., text input such as, for example, one or more characters, numbers, punctuation, etc.) entered in an event creation field (e.g., data entry field) with one or more templates, as further described below.
Suggestions for one or more components (e.g., title, date and/or time, guests, etc.) of a time-based event (e.g., a calendar event, task, etc.) may be generated using a collection of templates. For example, when a user begins to type (e.g., enter characters such as letters, numbers, punctuation, etc.) in a data entry field for creating or editing an event, a list (e.g., index, database, etc.) of stored templates may be referenced (e.g., accessed) to determine whether the input from the user can be used to generate one or more suggestions for auto-completion of the data entry. In describing various embodiments, examples, and features of the present disclosure, data input (e.g., from a user) in the data entry field for creating/editing an event (e.g., the “event creation field” or the like) may be referred to as a “query”. In accordance with at least one embodiment, in addition to or instead of the data input (e.g., text) by the user into the event creation field, a query may also include the user's location, language settings (e.g., the suggestion service of the present disclosure may be configured for multiple other languages besides English), current date/time, as well as numerous other types of input. The suggestion service described herein may detect a query in the data entry field for creating/editing an event and determine whether the query matches any of the stored templates. If any matches are determined, then one or more of the matched templates may be used to provide the user with one or more suggestions for completing the query.
In accordance with at least one embodiment described herein, template suggestions may be triggered while a user is typing in a data entry field for creating a new event or for editing an existing event. Furthermore, in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein, a template may be truncated before a contact, location, or date/time placeholder if the template is used as a suggestion to the user.
Suggestions of different types (e.g., contacts, locations, etc.) may be ranked and combined into a single list of results. In accordance with at least one embodiment described herein, the ranking and combining of relevant suggestions may be based on a set of logic rules (e.g., ranking and mixing logic), which may vary depending on the particular implementation, and/or may be based on one or more preferences of the user, settings configured for the user, and the like.
In describing various embodiments and features of the present disclosure, reference is sometimes made to event data “received from a user” and event data suggestions “provided to a user.” It should be understood that in the implementation context, data and/or suggestions “received from a user” or “provided to a user” means data and/or suggestions received from/provided to a device of a user (e.g., User Device 105 in the example system 100 shown in FIG. 1 ), the device being configured for operation or use by the user. As such, data received from a user and data received from a user device, as well as suggestions provided to a user and suggestions provided to a user device, may be used interchangeably at times for purposes of simplicity.
Additionally, one or more examples provided herein describe providing suggestions for event data (e.g., details about an event) by displaying the suggestions in a “staging area” of an “event creation field”. It should be noted that the terms “staging area” and “event creation field” are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. Rather, these terms are used herein as example descriptions of various areas of a user interface screen in which a user can create a new time-based event (e.g., a calendar event, a task, etc.). It should also be understood that, in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein, a calendar event associated with the user may be any time-based event associated with the user, and is not limited to an event scheduled only in a user's calendar application. For example, event data suggestions may be provided to a user for a task assigned to the user and stored in a task list associated with the user.
As will be described in greater detail herein, in generating and providing event component suggestions to a user, the location of the user may be determined (or approximated) using any of a variety of techniques and/or devices known in the art. For example, in accordance with at least one embodiment, a user's location may be determined using a global position system (GPS) associated with a device of the user, such as the user's mobile telephone, tablet computer, various wearable technologies or devices (e.g., articles of clothing or accessories incorporating or embedded with a computer and/or other electronic technologies, such as, for example, a wrist watch, glasses, etc.), and the like.
At block 305, user input may be detected in an event creation field for entering data about an event. For example, the user interface screen 500 a shown in FIG. 5a includes an example event creation field 505 in which a user may enter or input data about a new event that the user intends to create (or about an existing event that the user intends to edit). For example, the user may input into the event creation field 505 data about one or more of a variety of components of an event including, for example, a title for the event, an activity associated with the event, a person or people associated with (e.g., invited to) the event, start and/or end dates or times for the event, and the like.
In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the event creation field 505 may be displayed to the user in conjunction with a prompt 510. The prompt 510 may include, for example, an indication (e.g., a query, a request, etc.) that the user should begin to enter data about the event. The prompt 510 that may be displayed with the event creation field 505 may be displayed in a variety of other ways in addition to or instead of the manner in which the prompt 510 is illustrated in user interface screen 500 a. Referring back to the example process 300 of FIG. 3 , any input from the user in the event creation field that may be detected at block 305 may be in response to a prompt (e.g., prompt 510) displayed or presented to the user upon initiating the creation of a new time-based event.
In the example user interface 500 b shown in FIG. 5b , the event creation field 505 includes user input 520 (e.g., the letter “d” has been entered into the event creation field 505) together with a prompt 510 for the user to enter additional data about the event (where the user input 520 in event creation field 505 may be detected at block 305 of the example process 300 described above and illustrated in FIG. 3 ).
At block 310, one or more suggestions for data about the event may be determined based on the user input detected at block 305. For example, if user input in the event creation field is detected at block 305 to be a combination of letters and/or characters (e.g., a string of text data), then at block 310 one or more suggestions may be determined based on this combination of letters and/or characters. For example, with reference to the example user interface 500 c shown in FIG. 5c , if user input 520 in the event creation field 505 is detected (e.g., at block 305) as “di”, then the one or more suggestions that may be determined (e.g., at block 310) may be event data components (e.g., event title, contact, event location, etc.) that each include “di” in their contents. In accordance with at least one embodiment, the one or more suggestions determined at block 310 may each begin with the user input detected at block 305 (e.g., if the detected user input is “di” then each of the determined suggestions may begin with “di” such as “Diane Doe”, “Dinner”, “Dixon, California”, and the like). In accordance with one or more other embodiments, the one or more suggestions determined at block 310 may each incorporate or be based on the detected user input in some other manner besides that described above.
At block 315, the one or more suggestions determined at block 310 may be displayed for selection (e.g., by the user). For example, referring again to the example user interface screen 500 c shown in FIG. 5c , in accordance with at least one embodiment described herein the event creation field 505 may be displayed with a staging area 515, which may be located in some directional relation (e.g., below, to the side of, etc.) to the event creation field 505. The staging area 515 may include one or more suggestions 550 a-550 d for data about the event being created in the event creation field 505, where the suggestions 550 a-550 d may be displayed in the staging area 515 for selection by the user. It should be noted that the suggestions 550 a-550 d for data about the event may sometimes be referred to as “event component suggestions”, “event data suggestions”, or by some other similar term or phrase descriptive of the same.
In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the one or more suggestions that may be displayed (at block 315) may be displayed in the staging area 515 according to a type of data associated with each of the suggestions. For example, with reference to the example user interface 600 b illustrated in FIG. 6b , the staging area 615 may include suggestions 650, which relate to suggested contacts (e.g., “Diane Doe”, “Joan Johnson”, etc.) to add to the event creation field 605. The suggestions 650 may be displayed in the staging area 615 based on a determination that the type of data to be added to the event creation field 605 may be a contact of the user.
At block 320, a selection of the one of the suggestions for data about the event displayed at block 315 may be received. For example, in accordance with at least one embodiment, the selection of one of the displayed suggestions at block 320 may be received at an event creation server (e.g., Suggestion Selections (174) received at Event Creation Server 140 via Authentication Server 135 in the example system 100 shown in FIG. 1 ).
At block 325, the suggestion selected at block 320 may be added to the event creation field as data about the event. For example, with reference to the example user interface 500 d shown in FIG. 5d , the selected suggestion “Dinner” 525 has been added to the event creation field 505 in place of the user input (e.g., user input “di” 520 in event creation field 505 in the example user interface 500 c shown in FIG. 5c ).
In accordance with at least one embodiment, the process 400 may be performed by an event creation server (e.g., Event Creation Server 140 in the example system 100 shown in FIG. 1 ) configured to provide such a suggestion service to a user when the user is creation and/or editing an event. It should also be noted that, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, the example process 400 may form a part of, or be performed in addition to, the example process 300 described above and illustrated in FIG. 3 .
At block 405, a prompt may be presented to a user to enter data about a first component of an event.
At block 410, one or more suggestions for the first component of the event may be generated (and provided or displayed to the user for selection) based on data entered by the user in response to the prompt presented at block 405.
At block 415, a selection of one of the suggestions (generated at block 410) for the first component of the event may be received.
At block 420, the selected suggestion for the first component of the event may be added to an event creation field (e.g., any of event creation fields 505, 605, or 705 in the example user interfaces shown in FIGS. 5-7 , respectively) as data for the first component of the event.
At block 425, one or more suggestions for a second component of the event may be generated (and provided or displayed to the user for selection) based on the selected suggestion (from block 415) for the first component of the event.
As mentioned above, FIGS. 5a-5d, 6a-6f, 7a-7g , and 8 illustrate example user interface screens including components that may be used in implementing one or more of the various embodiments of the methods and systems described herein. The features and components of the illustrative user interface screens presented in FIGS. 5a-5d, 6a-6f, 7a-7g , and 8 are described in the context of example calendar events being created by a hypothetical user, where the user is provided with suggestions for various data components of the events being created. It should be understood that the particular subject-matter of the content contained in any of the example user interface screens shown in FIGS. 5a-5d, 6a-6f, 7a-7g , and 8, as well as the arrangement of any of the various components comprising these example user interfaces are for illustrative purposes only, and are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. It should also be understood that numerous other variations, types, combinations, and arrangements of user interface screens may also be used to implement certain features of the methods and systems described herein, in addition to or instead of the example user interfaces shown in FIGS. 5a-5d, 6a-6f, 7a-7g , and 8.
The illustrative user interface screens shown in FIGS. 5a-5d, 6a-6f, 7a-7g , and 8 are examples of what may constitute an event data suggestion service in accordance with one or more of the embodiments described herein.
In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the suggestions for the additional data about the event, displayed in the staging area 615, may be based on the already selected suggestion 625. For example, suggestions 630 may be based on one or more other events associated with the user (e.g., past events, already scheduled future events, etc.), where the suggestions 630 include multiple event data components (e.g., a complete event title including an activity (“Dinner”), a contact (“Diane Doe” or “Robert Smith”), and a location (“New Age Bistro, San Francisco” or “Trattoria Coast, San Diego”)). As another example, suggestions 635 and 640, which are similar to additional prompts or queries in that the suggestions 635 and 640 ask the user to consider identifying a contact and a location for the event being created, may be based on a determination that the already selected suggestion (“Dinner”) is typically associated with the additional event data components of a contact and a location.
In the example user interface screen 600 b shown in FIG. 6b , the event creation field 605 (shown in user interface 600 a in FIG. 6a ) includes the selected suggestion 625 for data about the event (e.g., “Dinner”) together with a connector term 660 (e.g., “with”) and the prompt 610 to enter additional data about the event. In accordance with at least one embodiment described herein, a connector term (e.g., connector term 660) may be added to the event creation field in response to receiving a selection (e.g., from the user) of a suggested type of data to add to the event creation field. For example, with reference to the example user interface 600 a shown in FIG. 6a , in response to suggestion 635 (“With whom?”) being selected, the connector term “with” may be added to the event creation field 605, as shown in the example user interface 600 b in FIG. 6 b.
It should be understood that numerous other connector terms may be added to the event creation field in response to receiving a selection of one or more other suggested types of data to add to the event creation field, in addition to or instead of the example connector term and suggested type of data described above. For example, referring again to the example user interface 600 a shown in FIG. 6a , in response to suggestion 640 (“Where?”) being selected, a connector term such as “at” may be added to the event creation field 605. A non-exhaustive and non-limiting list of other example connector terms include “to”, “for”, “on”, “and”, “from”, etc.
Referring back to the example user interface screen 600 b illustrated in FIG. 6b , the staging area 615 may include suggestions 650, which may be based on the particular connector term 660 added to the event creation field 605. For example, suggestions 650 all relate to suggested contacts (e.g., “Diane Doe”, “Joan Johnson”, etc.) to add to the event creation field 605. The suggestions 650 may be displayed in the staging area 615 based on a determination that the type of data to be added to the event creation field 605 is a contact of the user (e.g., in response to receiving a selection of suggestion 635 (“With whom?”) in the example user interface 600 a shown in FIG. 6a ).
The staging area 615 of the example user interface 600 b includes a selection indicator 665 (e.g., cursor, pointer, mark, etc.). Similar selection indicators may also be included in one or more of the other example user interface screens illustrated in FIGS. 5a-5d, 6a-6f, 7a-7g , and 8. It should be understood that such selection indicators are merely included in the example user interface screens to aid in the description of various features and/or functionalities associated with the example user interface screens. Depending on the particular implementation, such selection indicators (or variations thereof) may or may not be included in any user interface screens utilized in connection with the suggestions service described herein.
In the example user interface 700 b shown in FIG. 7b , the event creation field 705 includes user input 720 (e.g., the phrase “Di” has been entered into the event creation field 705) together with a prompt 710 for the user to enter additional data about the event. In accordance with at least one embodiment described herein, the user interface screen 700 b may also include a staging area 715, which may be located in some directional relation (e.g., below, to the side of, etc.) to the event creation field 705. The staging area 715 may include one or more suggestions 750 for data about the event being created in the event creation field 705, where the suggestions 750 may be displayed in the staging area 715 for selection by the user. It should be noted that the suggestions 750 for data about the event may sometimes be referred to as “event component suggestions”, “event data suggestions”, or by some other similar term or phrase descriptive of the same.
In accordance with at least one embodiment, the suggestions 750 for data about the event may be generated based on the user input 720, and the generated suggestions 750 displayed in the staging area 715 for selection by the user.
