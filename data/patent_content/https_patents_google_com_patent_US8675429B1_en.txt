- impedances are specific examples, and should not be construed as limiting in any manner. Such impedances may vary depending on the particular implementation and components used.
- a PCB manufacturing technique known as High Density Interconnect (HDI), and Build-Up technology may be employed.
- HDI technology is a technique to condense integrated circuit packaging for increased microsystem density and high performance.
- HDI technology is sometimes used as a generic term to denote a range of technologies that may be added to normal PCB technology to increase the density of interconnect.
- HDI packaging minimizes the size and weight of the electronics while maximizing performance.
- HDI allows three-dimensional wafer-scale packaging of integrated circuits.
- the particular features of HDI technology that are used are the thin layers used as insulating material between conducting layers and micro-via holes that connect conducting layers and are drilled through the thin insulating layers.
- One way of constructing the thin insulating layers is using build-up technology, although other methods may equally be employed.
- One way of creating micro-vias is to use a laser to drill a precision hole through thin build-up layers, although other methods may equally be employed.
- the thin insulating layers and micro-vias provided by HDI technology allow precise control over the transmission line impedance of the PCB interconnect as well as the unwanted parasitic impedances of the PCB interconnect.
- a micro-via manufacturing technique may be utilized to achieve the desired impedance at a point of the traces 112 ( a )- 112 ( c ).
- Micro-via technology implements a via between layers of a PCB wherein the via traverses only between the specific two layers of the PCB, resulting in elimination of redundant open via stubs with conventional through-hole vias, a much lower parasitic capacitance, a much smaller impedance discontinuity and accordingly a much lower amplitude of reflections.
- a via refers to any pad or strip with a plated hole that connects tracks from one layer of a substrate (e.g. a PCB) to another layer or layers.
- flip-chip a PCB manufacturing technique known as flip-chip may be employed.
- Flip chip package technology implements signal connectivity between the package and a die that uses much less (and often a shortened run-length of) conductive material than other similarly purposed technologies employed for the stated connectivity such as wire bond, and therefore presents a much lower serial inductance, and accordingly a much lower impedance discontinuity and lower inductive crosstalk.
- a programmable I/O driver may be employed.
- the driver may be capable of presenting a range of drive strengths (e.g. drive strengths 1-N, where N is an integer).
- Each of the drive strength settings normally corresponds to a different value of effective or average driver resistance or impedance, though other factors such as shape, effective resistance, etc. of the drive curve at different voltage levels may also be varied.
- Such a strength value may be programmed using a variety of well known techniques, including setting the strength of the programmable buffer as a response to a command originating or sent through the memory controller 152 . Due to the nature of the multi-drop topology, the read path desires stronger driver strength than what memory devices on regular Register-DIMM can provide.
- Table 1 shows specific memory cycles (namely, READ, WRITE, and CMD) illustrating the performance characteristics of a generic solution of the prior art, representative of commercial standards, versus an implementation of one embodiment discussed in the context of the present description. It should be noted that long valid data times (e.g. valid windows) supporting high frequency memory reads and writes are both highly valued, and elusive.

As can be seen by inspection, the valid window of FIG. 3A is only about 350 picoseconds, while the valid window 306 of an implementation of the presently discussed embodiments is about 610 picoseconds, as shown in FIG. 3B .
- FIGS. 4A and 4B depict eye diagrams 400 and 450 for a CMD cycle. Inspection of FIG. 4A illustrates data for the CMD cycle associated with the prior art.

For ease of illustration only, four such memory circuits 604 A- 604 N are shown, but actual embodiments may use any number of memory circuits. As will be discussed below, the memory chips may optionally be coupled to a memory module (not shown), such as a DIMM.
- the system device 606 may be any type of system capable of requesting and/or initiating a process that results in an access of the memory circuits.

- some other signals 610 are communicated directly between the system device 606 (or some component thereof, such as a memory controller, or a register, etc.) and the memory circuits 604 A- 604 N, without passing through the interface circuit 602 .
- the presence of a buffer chip between the memory controller and the plurality of memory circuits 604 A- 604 N may present a single smaller capacitive load on a channel as compared with multiple loads that would be presented by the plurality of memory devices in multiple rank DIMM systems, in absence of any buffer chip.
- an interface circuit 602 may facilitate use of an input buffer design that has a lower input threshold requirement than normal memory chips. In other words, the interface circuit 602 is capable of receiving more noisy signals, or higher speed signals from the memory controller side than regular memory chips. Similarly, the presence of the interface circuit 602 may facilitate use of an output buffer design that is capable of not only driving with wider strength range, but also driving with wider range of edge rates, i.e., rise time. Faster edge rate may also facilitate the signal integrity of the data read path, given voltage margin is the main limiting factor. In addition, such an output buffer can be designed to operate more linearly than regular memory device output drivers.
