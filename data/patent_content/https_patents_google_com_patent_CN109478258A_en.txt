It can implement theme described in this specification, in a specific way to realize one or more in following advantages
It is a.
Control equipment in systems is included by directly adjustment using the systematic training quantum evolution of sub- logic control
Control parameter (for example, by adjusting voltage on digital analog converter) executes variation and minimizes program to parameterize usage amount subsystem
The quantum evolution of the natural contral parameter of system.By proposing using rudimentary control to parameterize, the system of sub- logic control is used
Training quantum evolution, with use controlled variable cervical orifice of uterus training quantum evolution system on the contrary, with for systematic error it is unknowable simultaneously
And the global mapping of robust is used as exchange for many controls and calibration problem, can be avoided accurately knowing to efficient circuit
Know.In addition, may be implemented fundamentally more accurately to indicate expectation state using rudimentary control, state is drilled because realizing
Into control increase.The maximum control to evolution and the state to be prepared is provided using hardware level control, therefore,
Even if also the model creation to simulate more accurately proposes there are error.
Using the systematic training quantum evolution of sub- logic control without using the digital quantum circuit of parametrization
Adaptively train quantum evolution to realize the objective quantum state with target property, so that the experimental complexities of system are reduced,
It may be extremely complex because this quantum circuit implements.On the contrary, it is different from other quantum evolution training systems, it is patrolled using son
The systematic training quantum evolution of volume control can abandon the concept of digital quantity cervical orifice of uterus, support by using being usually to calibrate single door
The control parameter of reservation and the adjustable simulation evolution defined.By operating in the rank of basic hardware element, sub- logic is used
The systematic training quantum evolution of control does not need the fine knowledge to efficient circuit, but executes unknowable for systematic error
And the global mapping of robust for many controls and calibration problem.
Digital quantum circuit may include multidimensional quantum bit to quantum bit (qubits) or in some instances
(qudits) Quantum logic gates of precise manipulation are executed.In many settings, Quantum logic gates model algorithm specifies quantum circuit
And it is required that experimenter executes specified quantum circuit with minimal error.This may be challenging task, because implementing
Quantum logic gates model algorithm may need many Quantum logic gates.Therefore, based on the expansible calculating of Quantum logic gates model
It may need expensive process, such as, Quantum error correction.Further, it is necessary to calibrate each door in circuit before execution.No
It can be by carefully adjusting hardware controls parameter and executing warp by using the system of sub- logic control training quantum evolution
Allusion quotation minimizes circuit to improve each individually door and carry out calibrator quantity cervical orifice of uterus.Therefore, in order to which application quantum circuit may need largely
Effort, this can be not no error in no instance.In fact, Errors Catastrophic may occur for system, and such as, control
Error (caused by the error is the pulse as incompletely formed door, this is common occurrence) or the noise by coupling with system draw
The error risen.
It can be adapted for various settings using the systematic training quantum evolution of sub- logic control and be used to manipulate various types of
The controllable state of type such as those of is present in the resonator for being attached to superconductive quantum bit state.This resonator state
It is controllable and defines variation appropriate and propose.
The systematic training quantum evolution using sub- logic control can be used replace for door calibrate standard method or
Person is in connection, to improve the system expandability and performance.Quantum door can pass through the quantized system under specific Hamiltonian
Accurate evolution generate.For example, system can be by being given by following equation (1) in the case where superconduction Gmon quantum bit
Hamiltonian description out.
In equation (1), Xi、Yi、ZiIt is Pauli operator (Pauli operator), and ai(t)、bi(t)、ci(t) and
gijIt (t) is the time correlation curve generated by the microwave pulse sent by the conducting wire in hardware.It, can in order to execute quantum circuit
Experimenter can be required to send specific pulse by the conducting wire in hardware to calibrate including all quantum in quantum circuit first
Door.In the case where superconducting electronics, pulse is considered by Fourier space formation, for example, in quantum bit q
The pulse of upper induction part Y can be byIt provides, wherein ω0It is fundamental frequency, and
AK、BKDetermine pulse shape.In hardware level, pulse Y can be designed by using digital analog converter (DAC)1And Y2, the digital-to-analogue
Converter is for every line setting voltage and time.
It can be accurate or determine approximately and needs which pulse to execute desired quantum door, then to identified arteries and veins
Rush in row Fourier transformation and by pulse program into DAC appropriate.However, DAC's is arranged and passes through what pulse was acted on
Accurate mapping between the actual pulse that system is seen is inaccurate for the actual experiment system in laboratory.For example, can
To be in a specific way programmed DAC to execute particular task, however, in fact, the physical action of DAC may deviate it is pre-
Phase movement, for example, due to unknown continuous systems error.For example, the DAC in laboratory is likely to be at room temperature, and quantum chip
It is likely to be at milli Kelvin (milikelven) temperature, leads to unpredictable or undesirable conversion, because signal is due to wave
The temperature change led and travel down to chip.
It is different from other systems, it may not be needed using the systematic training quantum evolution of sub- logic control from Quantum control
Theoretical agreement, such as, copped wave random basis scheme (chopped random basis scheme) is clean to be formed
Quantum door.Similarly, different to tune other systems of single door from implementation Quantum control program, as described above, being patrolled using son
The systematic training quantum evolution for collecting control can be used for calibrating or the entire circuit of training.In some embodiments, for example, being directed to

Method combination may be further advantageous.
In addition, being instructed compared with without using the system of sub- logic control training quantum evolution using the system of sub- logic control
It may be more robust for practicing quantum evolution, and avoid for certain controls or systematic error being introduced into quantized system.For example, real
The person of testing usually can be used control theory feedback and form door from sub- logic control, because control parameter may to the movement of system
It is not completely known or predictable.However, this control or systematic error instruct the system for using sub- logic control
Practice quantum evolution for be not a problem because for determine control parameter update classical minimum process in hardware
It is unknowable for the thing of generation, if it is assumed that parametrization proposes in some way, then it is unchallenged, but such as
Fruit parametrization does not change, then actually parametrization degree is slightly different.
In addition, the systematic training quantum evolution using sub- logic control can tolerate the leakage other than quantum bit status,
This is the place that most of quantum calculation settings all have great problems.Variation is defined in quantum bit manifold to propose but permit
Perhaps state or partial status leave manifold and are allowed, and are equivalent to and execute non-single operation and reform state.
It is different from other quantum evolution training systems, it can be applied to using the systematic training quantum evolution of sub- logic control
Multiple quantum system, for example, the multilevel system other than quantum bit, because of the amount of any parametrization of any quantized system
Sub- evolution may be used to definition and propose.Therefore, using the practicability of the systematic training quantum evolution of sub- logic control and be applicable in
Property greatly improve because quantum hardware be generally subjected to quantum bit leakage, that is, quantum bit may be only approximate quantum bit,
And it there may come a time when to occupy higher energy level.In addition, the systematic training quantum evolution using sub- logic control can be applied to
Training quantum evolution, and the quantum state with target property is able to achieve there are noise, that is, use son
The systematic training quantum evolution of logic control does not require closure evolution.
It can be applied to various settings using the training quantum evolution of sub- logic control, specifically, the setting of industrial value.
Any physical system for being difficult to study generally, due to quantum mechanics can benefit from implementing for by using sub- logic control
The system for making training quantum evolution.For example, the training quantum evolution using sub- logic control can be used for preparing molecular electronic knot
The ground state of structure Hamiltonian, this describes the energetics of molecule --- the industrial application of noticeable small quantum computer.?
