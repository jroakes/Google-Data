- the client device 620 may scale the rendered output for presentation via the graphical display unit of the client device 620 .
- the host device 610 may receive an indication of the display resolution of the client device 620 and may render the representation of the operating environment using the display resolution of the client device 620 .
- the host device 610 may adjust the display resolution of the host device 610 to match the display resolution of the client device 620 , and may render the representation of the display area at the adjusted display resolution. Adjusting the display resolution may cause unwanted interference with the operating environment of the host device 610 .

- FIG. 7 is a block diagram of remote access encoding in accordance with implementations of this disclosure.
- Remote access encoding may include a host device performing remote access, such as the remote access shown in FIG. 6 , with a client device via a network.
- the host device may execute an operating environment.
- a representation of the operating environment may include a display area, which may include elements of the operating environment, such as windows, and window content.
- the host device may render the display area, encode the rendered content, and output the encoded content to the client device.
- remote access encoding may be performed by an encoder, such as the encoder 400 shown in FIG. 4 , of the host device.
- Rendered video such as remote access video
- Static content may be compressed using high quality encoding.
- Quality and contextual metrics may be used to simplify and improve encoding performance.
- Implementations of remote access encoding may include initiating remote access at 700 , rendering content at 710 , encoding rendered content at 720 , and transmitting the encoded content at 730 .
- the client device may receive the encoded content, may decode the content, and may output the content to a local graphical display unit for presentation.
- Remote access may be initiated at 700 .
- Initiating remote access may include establishing a connection between the client device and the host device.
- the client device and the host device may exchange information for performing remote access.
- the host device may receive a remote access request from the client device.
- the host device may render a representation (rendered content) of the display area, or a portion of the display area, of the operating environment of the host device at 710 .
- the host device may generate the rendered content as a sequence of frames.
- Each frame may include implicit or explicit information, such as the request identifier, offset information, buffer information, a timestamp, or any other information relevant to the rendered sequence of frames.
- the host device may encode the rendered content at 720 .
- Encoding the rendered content may include identifying a current block at 722 , determining whether a block is a static block at 724 , determining a coding quality for encoding a current block at 726 , determining whether to encode the current block as a skipped block at 728 , or a combination thereof.
- a current block of a current frame may be identified for encoding at 722 .
- the representation of the display area of the operating environment may be rendered as video stream, such as the vides stream 300 shown in FIG. 3
- the encoding may include block based encoding, wherein a block of a frame of the video stream may be encoded based on, for example, a reference block in a previously encoded reference frame.
- Remote access encoding may include determining whether a block is a static block at 724 .
- a portion or portions of a rendered display area may be static (static content) from frame to frame.
- a block in a frame that includes content that is the same as the content of a corresponding reference block may be referred to as a static block.
- static blocks may be identified based on differences between blocks of a current frame and corresponding blocks of an unencoded (raw) frame corresponding to the reference frame identified for encoding the current frame. Blocks for which the difference between the current block and the corresponding block is within a threshold, which may be zero, may be identified as static blocks and may be assigned a zero motion vector.
- static blocks may be identified prior to, instead of, or as part of, performing motion estimation.
- identifying static blocks may include using information indicating movement of an element of the operating environment.
- the movement information may indicate motion of a window in the operating environment or motion, such as scrolling, of content within a window of the operating environment, such that the content changes location within the frame, but otherwise remains static.
- the motion information may be used identify a non-zero motion vector indicating the difference in location of the element between the current frame and the reference frame. Blocks including the static content may be identified as static blocks and may be assigned the non-zero motion vector.
- Remote access encoding may include determining a coding quality for encoding a current block at 726 .
- the coding quality of an encoded block may indicate differences between a current frame (raw frame) and a corresponding reconstructed frame.
- the coding quality may be measured based on a sum of absolute differences (SAD) in the transform domain or spatial domain.
- SAD sum of absolute differences
- the SAD for an encoded block may be smaller than a threshold and the block may be a high quality block. Pixels in a high quality block may be referred to as high quality pixels.
- determining a coding quality for encoding a current block may be based on a relative priority (importance) of the content included in the block.
- video encoding may be subjected to resource utilization limitations, such as bit rate constraint, and content may be prioritized so that blocks including important content (important blocks) may be encoded using high quality encoding using a relatively large amount of resources (i.e., higher priority in bit allocation).
- Bits allocated for encoding important blocks may not be used for encoding the important blocks and may be used for encoding other blocks.
- important blocks may be encoded before other blocks. For example, a frame may be divided into slices and the important blocks may be included in a slice that may be encoded before other slices.
- the priority for encoding a block may be based on the context of the content included in the block relative to the operating environment. For example, a topmost window in the operating environment may be relatively important to a user (in focus), and blocks of the rendered content including the topmost window may have a higher priority than other blocks. Blocks encoded using high quality encoding may suffer less quantization distortion than other blocks, convergence between a current frame and subsequent frames may be faster than for blocks that are not encoded using high quality encoding. Corresponding blocks in subsequent frames may be encoded as skipped blocks. Some subsequent frames may be encoded without encoding residual data. For example, encoding a first subsequent block may include encoding residual data and encoding other subsequent blocks may not include encoding residual data.
- priority may be based on the frequently and recency with which a window has been in focus, or interacted with by a user. The higher the focus frequency and recency, the higher the priority.
- windows may be indexed in order of focus frequency, focus recency, or based on a combination of focus frequency and focus recency.
- a static block may be encoded using high quality encoding. For example, encoding a static block as a high quality block may allow subsequent corresponding blocks to be encoded using fewer resources, which may reduce overall resource utilization (bit count). Bits utilized for encoding a static block as a high quality block can be used to improve the efficiency of encoding blocks which use the static block as a reference block.
- a current block may be identified as a static block in a current frame, and the likelihood that a corresponding block in a subsequent frame is a static block may be high.
- the likelihood that the corresponding block in the subsequent frame is a static block may be particularly high when the current block does not include a portion of a topmost window.
- Remote access encoding may include determining whether to encode the current block as a skipped block at 728 . In some implementations, determining whether to encode the current block as a skipped block may be based on whether the current block is a static block, whether a reference block identified for encoding the current block is a high quality reference block, or a combination thereof.
- determining whether to encode the current block as a skipped block may include determining whether a reference block for encoding the current block is a high quality reference block or a low quality reference block.
- a reference block aligned with a block boundary and encoded using high quality encoding may be a high quality reference block;
- a reference block that overlaps multiple blocks that were encoded using high quality encoding may be a high quality reference block; and
- a reference block that overlaps with a block was not encoded using high quality encoding may be a low quality reference block.
- encoding a static block using a high quality reference block may include identifying the current block as a skipped block, identifying a motion vector, indicating the reference block, and identifying the current block as a high quality block.
- encoding a static block using a low quality reference block may include identifying the current block as a skipped block, identifying a motion vector indicating the reference block, and identifying the current block as a low quality block.
- encoding a static block using a low quality reference block may include encoding the block without identifying the block as a skipped block, which may include using very good motion vector estimation.
- the encoder may utilize the motion vector directly in the coding process.
- the encoder may utilize the motion vector as a good starting point to find the best motion vector for coding the block.
- Non-static blocks in the current frame may be encoded using a non-static block encoding technique, such as the encoding shown in FIG. 3 .
- remote access encoding can be implemented in a device, such as the computing device 100 shown in FIG. 1 or the computing and communication devices 100 A/ 100 B/ 100 C shown in FIG. 2 .
- an encoder such as the encoder 400 shown in FIG. 4
