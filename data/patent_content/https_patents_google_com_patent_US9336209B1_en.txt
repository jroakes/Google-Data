- Application store 214 stores modular applications that are designed for use within the documents stored in data store 212 .
- application store 214 may store modular applications that are used in conjunction with document editing applications provided by cloud computing service 202 that allows users to edit documents on client computer 218 .
- the modular applications are executed on cloud computing service 202 rather than installed and executed on client computer 218 .
- Client computer 218 includes a CPU 226 , ROM 222 , RAM 224 , input/output interface 220 , and bus 228 .
- Client computer 218 may have additional components that are not illustrated in FIG. 2 .

- Web browsers are used, among other things, to display content and services provided by cloud computing service 202 . Web browsers receive web page documents encoded in HTML, CSS, Javascript, or other web-compatible languages and interpret the language to properly display the web page.
- Data store 212 for storing content on cloud computing service 202 , application store 214 , a web browser executing on client computer 218 , and other data structures and software programs in system 200 may be implemented using non-transitory computer-readable media.
- suitable non-transitory computer-readable media include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and read-only, once-writable, or rewriteable optical disks (such as, e.g., CDROM, CDR, CD+R, CDRW, CD+RW, DVDROM, DVDR, DVD+R, DVDRW, and DVD+RW).
- semiconductor memory devices e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices
- magnetic disks e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks
- a cloud computing service stores documents accessible to a number of users. Each user can view, edit, and share the document with other users.
- a collaborative document is a document stored on a cloud computing service that is accessible to multiple users and may be edited by one or more users at the same time.
- a cloud computing service provides a platform for collaborators to work on collaborative documents.
- the cloud computing service provides document editing applications for viewing and editing documents stored on the cloud computing service.
- the document editing applications are sent from the cloud computing service to a client computer and run on a web browser or as a stand-alone application.
- the document editing applications include a user interface for displaying and editing the document. For example, if a user opens a word processing document stored on the cloud computing service, the cloud computing service sends a word processing document application to the web browser of the client computer.
- the word processing document application displays a user interface on the web browser for the user to view and edit the word processing document.
- the word processing document application may be implemented in HTML, Javascript, or any other browser-compatible language.
- the document editing application may be a stand-alone application that executes on the client computer, for example an “app” for a mobile device.
- the cloud computing service may also store modular applications that work in conjunction with document editing applications and increase their functionality. These modular applications are provided by the cloud computing service and any user may install the modular applications and use them with and in documents stored on the cloud computing service. Examples of modular applications for use in conjunction with cloud-based document editing applications include mail merging applications, bibliography applications, chart and graph applications, plagiarism detection applications, document signature applications, facsimile applications, and applications that retrieve information from the Internet to display within the document. When activated within a document editing application, some modular applications may alter the user interface of the document editing application to provide added functionality, while other modular applications may execute certain computations or routines to display a result, while yet others may operate in the background and do not produce a visual change in the display of the document or document editing application.
- the modular applications may be developed by the cloud computing service or by third-party developers.
- the cloud computing service may provide an online web page or in-product gallery where users can browse, search, and install the modular applications.
- the user interface of the document editing applications also provides menu options to browse, search, and install modular applications.
- the modular applications may be provided for free, or some of them may be available for a fee.
- Modular applications are normally installed on a client computer and may only be used on that particular device. If a user accesses the cloud computing service from another device, the user cannot use the modular application unless the user installs the modular application on the new device as well. In addition, when a collaborator of a collaborative document uses a modular application within a collaborative document, the other collaborators have to first install the modular application themselves before they can also take advantage of the added functionality. This makes the use and sharing of modular applications in a cloud computing service cumbersome and inconvenient.
- the present systems and methods provide a more convenient way for users to use and share modular applications in a cloud computing environment. Instead of having the modular applications installed on the client computers, the execution of the modular applications is retained on the cloud computing service and the results are displayed to the user on the client computer. Thus a user may use the modular application from any client computer connected to the cloud computing service without first having to install the modular application on that client computer. Also, because the modular applications run on the cloud computing service, other collaborators may also use the modular applications without first having to install the modular applications. In addition, a user may choose to activate the modular application for use in certain documents but not in other documents.
- the modular applications may be developed by the cloud computing service or by third-party developers and may be written in Javascript or another browser compatible language.
- a modular application may be written as a script in Javascript that communicates with the application programming interface (API) of the document editing application and provides additional functionality to the application.
- the modular application may add additional user interface elements to the display, such as menu options, tabs, or sidebars.
- the cloud computing service initiates and executes a modular application when it receives a request from a user to activate the modular application within a collaborative document.
- the modular application communicates with the document editing application executing on the client computer to display the results of the modular application.
- the user interface displaying a collaborative document on the client computer provides ways for users to activate or deactivate modular applications within collaborative documents, as well as to search for additional modular applications to use within the collaborative document.
- a user activates a modular application for use within the collaborative document
- information identifying the user and the modular application is sent from the client computer to the cloud computing service and stored in the document metadata of the collaborative document.
- each modular application has an application ID and each user has a user ID that is stored by the cloud computing service.
- the document metadata stores information about all the modular applications that have been activated in a collaborative document, the collaborator who initially activated it, and whether each modular application is currently active or inactive within the document.
- the document metadata may also store licensing information associated with any modular applications that have been activated within the document.
- modular applications that can only be used with a fee may have licensing restrictions associated with them.
- Information about activated modular applications may also be stored in the user metadata.
- the cloud computing service maintains the document and user metadata to track the activation status of modular applications for all documents and all users.
- the cloud computing service checks the document metadata of the collaborative document to determine which modular applications have been activated for the collaborative document.
- the cloud computing service executes the activated modular applications and incorporates the results into the display of the document editing application and collaborative document on the collaborator's client computer. For example, if a modular application adds a new menu option to the user interface of the document editing application, the new menu option appears in the user interface displayed to the collaborator. In another example, if a modular application inserts the current weather forecast within a collaborative document, the current weather forecast is inserted into the collaborative document displayed to the collaborator.
- FIG. 3 shows a user interface 300 for a document editing application provided by a cloud computing service.
- the document editing application and user interface 300 may be implemented in Javascript, Java, HTML, CSS, or any other browser-compatible language.
- the design and layout of user interface 300 is not limited to what is illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- the cloud computing service sends the document editing application to the client computer, where it may be executed as a stand-alone application or executed within a web browser on the client computer, where it displays user interface 300 so that a user may view and edit collaborative document 304 .
- User interface 300 also includes a menu bar 302 for providing various functions to the user, sorted into categories such as “File” and “Edit”.
- menu bar 302 may allow the user to save or share the file, copy and paste items on collaborative document 304 , change the view of collaborative document 304 , format the text or other graphics in collaborative document 304 , and access help resources.
- Menu bar 302 may also include an “Apps” application menu 306 for a user to activate, deactivate, or search for modular applications to use within collaborative document 304 .
- Application menu 306 may be labeled differently than as shown in FIG. 3 , for example as “Tools”, and may include additional options not shown in FIG. 3 .
- Application menu 306 includes three modular applications available for use within collaborative document 304 : Label Maker application 308 , Mail Merge application 310 , and bibliography application 312 .
- the check marks for Label Maker application 308 and bibliography application 312 indicate that these applications are currently activated for use within collaborative document 304 .
- Mail Merge application 310 is currently deactivated and not available for use within collaborative document 304 .
- any collaborator may reactivate the use of the modular application.
- the modular applications displayed in menu 306 includes modular applications that the user has installed and active applications used by other collaborators of collaborative document 304 .
- Menu 306 may also display all modular applications owned by collaborators, whether active or not. Alternatively, menu 306 may display modular applications owned by collaborators that are currently or had been active within collaborative document 304 , but not modular applications owned by collaborators that have never been activated within collaborative document 304 .
- the selection acts as a toggle for the activation or deactivation of the modular application within collaborative document 304 .
- the application would be deactivated within collaborative document 304 and the check mark beside the name of the application would disappear. Any user interface elements or content that Label Maker application 308 added to collaborative document 304 would disappear from view.
- a user selected Mail Merger application 310 the application would be activated for use within collaborative document 304 and a check mark would appear beside the name of the application. Any user interface elements or content that Mail Merge application 310 adds to collaborative document 304 would appear on the display screen.
- Any collaborator that has access to collaborative document 304 may view, activate, or deactivate the modular applications listed in application menu 306 , regardless of whether that collaborator was the one that initially activated the modular application within the document. For example, one collaborator may have activated Label Maker application 308 for use in collaborative document 304 and another collaborator may choose to deactivate it. This allows each collaborator to control all modular applications that other collaborators have activated within the document.
- user interface 300 may display a screen requesting consent from the user to allow the modular application permission to certain user data.
- the document metadata stores an access control list which determines the access permissions of each collaborator, such as “view”, “comment, “edit”, and “owner”. In some instances, the activation or deactivation of modular applications may be restricted to collaborators with certain access permissions, such as owner or editor.
- Application menu 306 also includes a “More Apps” option 314 for searching or browsing for modular applications to use within collaborative document 304 .
- user interface 300 presents another interface for a user to browse and search for modular applications.
- FIG. 4 shows user interface 400 that is displayed by the document editing application when a user selects the “More Apps” option 314 in FIG. 3 .
- An application browsing window 402 appears on top of the display of the collaborative document. Application browsing window 402 may overlay the display of the collaborative document or may be displayed in a separate window. Application browsing window 402 may be implemented in Javascript or any other browser compatible language. The design and layout of application browsing window 402 is not limited to what is shown in FIG. 4 .
- Application browsing window 402 includes one or more drop-down menus such as drop-down menu 404 for sorting and filtering available modular applications provided by the cloud computing service. For example, modular applications may be filtered based on category, identity of developer, rating, the date of release, or which document editing applications the modular applications may work with.
- Application browsing window 402 also includes one or more search fields 406 for users to search for particular modular applications.
- Application browsing window 402 may also include a link 408 to manage modular applications that the user has activated.
- Application browsing window 402 also displays icons for one or more modular applications stored on the cloud computing service and available for use within the collaborative document.
- the displayed modular applications may be based on selections made by the user in drop-down menu 404 or searches the user has entered in search field 406 .
- FIG. 4 shows icons for four modular applications: Label Maker application 410 , Mail Merge application 412 , bibliography application 414 , and Screenshots application 416 .
- Check marks are shown on icons for Label Maker application 410 and Bibliography application 414 to indicate that the user has already activated that application in one or more collaborative documents stored by the cloud computing service.
- the icons for modular applications that the user already has activated within one or more documents may include a “Manage” button for managing the use of the modular applications.
- the “Manage” button is discussed in further detail in relation to FIG. 5 .
- a “Use” button may appear on the icon of the application.
- sub-menu 418 may appear.
- Sub-menu 418 gives the user the option to either use the modular application only in the current collaborative document that the user is viewing (represented by the option “This document”), or to use the modular application in all documents owned by the user (represented by the option “All your documents”).
- the second option activates the modular application in documents owned by the user, as opposed to documents accessible to the user that are owned by a collaborator and shared with the user. This allows users to selectively choose which documents the modular application may run on.
- application browsing window 402 may display a confirmation screen confirming that the modular application is activated, and may also present a warning screen to inform the users of possible access permissions that the modular application has over the user's cloud computing account.
- FIG. 4 shows a user interface 500 that is displayed by the document editing application when a user selects the “Manage your applications” link 408 in FIG. 4 .
- An application manager window 502 appears on top of the display of the collaborative document.
- Application manager window 502 may overlay the display of the collaborative document or may be displayed in a separate window.
- Application manager window 502 may be implemented in Javascript or any other browser compatible language. The design and layout of application manager window 502 is not limited to what is shown in FIG. 5 .
- Application manager window 502 includes icons representing modular applications that the user has activated in one or more documents stored on the cloud computing service that are accessible to the user. For example, Label Maker application 504 and Cito application 506 are displayed in application manager window 502 , but Mail Merge application 412 and Screenshots application 416 shown in FIG. 4 do not appear in application manager window 502 because the user has never activated the modular applications before.
- Each modular application icon in application manager window 502 includes a “Manage” button that, when highlighted or selected by a user, shows a menu 508 for managing the modular application.
- Menu 508 may include, among other things, options to use a modular application in a particular document or to use the modular application in all documents owned by the user. The current option selected may be indicated with a check mark.
- Menu 508 may include options to rate the modular application, options to adjust settings on the modular application, options to obtain help resources for the modular application, and other options not illustrated in FIG. 5 .
- FIGS. 3-5 show that a user viewing a collaborative document on a client computer may access and manage modular applications through the user interface provided by the cloud computing service.
- the cloud computing service may also provide an independent web page that allows users to browse and search for modular applications provided by the cloud computing service.
- This web page may be an online “store” or other type of software retail web page that users navigate.
- the web page may request that the user present their log-in credentials for the cloud computing service. This allows the cloud computing service to associate the modular application with the user and update the relevant metadata.
- a user may also choose to “uninstall” a modular application that the user has previously activated in one or more documents stored on the cloud computing service. This is not a true uninstall because the modular application was never installed on any of the user's client computers. If the user never activated the modular application in any documents that collaborators could access, then the modular application is removed from the display of application menu 306 shown in FIG. 3 . That is, the user will no longer have the option to activate or deactivate the modular application in any of the user's documents. If the user has activated the modular application in a collaborative document, the modular application may also be removed from the display of application menu 306 shown in FIG. 3 , or may remain in display so that collaborators can opt to reactivate it. Any other collaborator that has independently activated the modular application may reactivate the modular application within the collaborative document.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a method 600 for providing applications for use within collaborative documents.
- Method 600 includes storing, on a cloud computing service, a collaborative document accessible by a plurality of collaborators and storing on the cloud computing service a plurality of modular applications for a document editing application used by the plurality of collaborators to view the collaborative document, where the plurality of modular applications are usable within the collaborative document.
- the method further includes receiving a request from a first collaborator in the plurality of collaborators to activate the use of a first modular application in the plurality of modular applications within the collaborative document, and activating the use of the first modular application within the collaborative document, where the first modular application executes on the cloud computing service and each of the plurality of collaborators may use the first modular application within the collaborative document.
- Method 600 may be performed on one or more servers that collectively provide a cloud computing service, such as cloud computing service 102 in FIG. 1 or cloud computing service 202 in FIG. 2 .
- Method 600 begins when a cloud computing service stores a collaborative document accessible by a plurality of collaborators, shown at 602 .
- the collaborative document may be a word processing document, spreadsheet, presentation, or any other document that may be edited by multiple users at the same time.
- the cloud computing service authenticates the collaborator and sends a copy of the collaborative document and a document editing application to run on the client computer, either as a stand-alone application or within a web browser of the client computer.
- the document editing application includes a user interface for the collaborator to view and edit the collaborative document.
- the cloud computing service manages any changes made to the collaborative document by the collaborator and propagates those changes to any other collaborators who are concurrently viewing the document.
- the collaborative document may have an access control list stored in its metadata that stores which collaborators have access to the document and their level of access (view, comment, write, edit, owner, etc.).
- the cloud computing service also stores a plurality of modular applications for a document editing application used by the plurality of collaborators to view the collaborative document, where the plurality of modular applications are usable within the collaborative document, shown at 604 .
- These modular applications are designed to work in conjunction with the document editing application to add more functionality to the document editing application. Examples of modular applications for use within the collaborative document include mail merging applications, bibliography applications, chart and graph applications, plagiarism detection applications, document signature applications, facsimile applications, and applications that retrieve information from the Internet to display within the document.
- the modular applications may be written in Javascript and use the API of the document editing application to add functionality and additional user interface elements.
- the modular applications may be developed by the cloud computing service or by third-party developers.
- the modular applications are available for any user to use within a document stored on the cloud computing service, and may be free or available for a fee.
- the user interface of the document editing application has menu options for collaborators to activate, deactivate, search, and browse for the modular applications, such as user interface 300 in FIG. 3 .
- the cloud computing service may also provide an independent web page for users to browse and search for the modular applications.
- the cloud computing service receives a request from a collaborator of the collaborative document to activate the use of a modular application within the collaborative document, shown at 606 .
- the request may be generated from a user action on the user interface of the document editing application.
- the user interface may have an application menu that displays one or more modular applications that may be activated within the collaborative document, or a menu option to browse for modular applications and activate modular applications within the collaborative document.
- FIGS. 3 and 4 show user interfaces capable of allowing collaborators to request activation of a modular application.
- the document editing application receives the user input and sends a request to the cloud computing service to activate the modular application in the collaborative document.
- the request may include the application ID, the ID of the collaborator making the request, and the document ID.
- the cloud computing service After the cloud computing service receives the request to activate the modular application, the cloud computing service activates the use of the modular application within the collaborative document, shown at 608 .
- the cloud computing service updates the document metadata with the application ID of the modular application being activated and the ID of the collaborator that made the request.
- the cloud computing service updates the document editing application to display the modular application in the application menu of the user interface as an activated modular application.
- the cloud computing service then initiates the execution of the modular application on the cloud computing service.
- the user interface on each collaborator's client computers is updated with the results of the execution of the modular application, such as updates to user interface elements and content.
- An example flow chart for the process of activating a modular application is shown below:
Abstract
Description
-
- 1. Receive request to activate modular application within collaborative document from user on client computer.
- 2. Retrieve application ID and user ID from the request.
- 3. Add the application ID and user ID to the document metadata of the collaborative document.
- 4. Add the activated modular application to the application menu displayed on the client computer.
- 5. Execute the modular application on the cloud computing service.
- 6. Send the results of the execution to the client computer and any other collaborators that are concurrently editing the collaborative document.
Thus the modular application is not installed and executed on each client computer but rather is executed on the cloud computing service and the results delivered to each client computer for display. The user interface of the document editing application executing on each client computer allows any collaborator to activate or deactivate any modular application that any other collaborator has added to the collaborative document. Any collaborator may also add additional modular applications to the collaborative documents. Also, a collaborator may choose to activate the modular application in a particular collaborative document or may activate the modular application in all the documents owned by the collaborator on the cloud computing service. Thus,method 600 provides a way for collaborators of a collaborative document to use and share modular applications within the collaborative document.
