Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of map 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d of Exemplary temporal relevant routes 103a, 103b, 103c.Such as, each in route 103a, 103b, 103c can represent at special time or over a time period (such as, Monday 8 a.m., Wednesday afternoon 5 point, Thursday from the morning 8:00 to 8:15 in the morning period etc.) geography information relevant with user, and can the path passed through in this time period of indicating user.Similarly, path 103 can provide the instruction to the action that user may regularly or partly regularly implement, and comprises the information providing the action may implemented in future about user.Each in map 102a-d show user family (by ground Figure 102 each in " H " indicate) near region.For the sake of simplicity, the exemplarily Figure 102 in Fig. 1 depicts relatively narrow and small region, but can use the map of any proper range and/or granularity in various embodiments.
First route 103a is the example path that user may pass through when going to work (being indicated by " W " in map 102a).Second path 103b shows user can in order to advance to the example path that ball park (being indicated by " S " in map 102b) is followed.Three-route 102c shows user can arrive cinema and the example path followed.4th map 102d identifies grocery store near the family of user and refuelling station, and path is not shown.Owing to not illustrating the route be associated in the 4th map 102d, so map 102d can represent that user is still in.In described example, map 102a-d and/or route 103a-c can be associated with timeline (timeline) 104.
Timeline 104 is the figure representing the time on the horizontal axis, wherein figure 1 illustrates one week.Route 103 can be interrelated with timeline 104, and route 103 can be represented by event 106a-e, the 108a-c, 110 that are depicted as to being illustrated property circle in FIG in timeline.Show the representative line segment of the event in the one or more timeline periods (such as, Zhou Tian) connecting specifically Figure 102 and the route 103 be associated and timeline 104.Such as, event 106a-e represents the every workday of user during one week (Monday 106a; Tu. 106b; Wednesday 106c; Thursday 106d; Friday 106e), represented by the route 103a in map 102a, be in and go to work between place and travel frequently.In a similar fashion, event 108a, 108b and 108c represent that user attends baseball game on Monday, Tu. and Wednesday in stadium respectively, and event 110 represents that user saw a film at the cinema on Friday.Event location in particular day in timeline 104 can also represent time related information.Such as, can see, on Monday, event 106a occurred before event 108a, because event 106a illustrates on the left side of event 108a in timeline 104.Although not shown in FIG, each event can with identify that the timestamp of the time of corresponding action or time period occur to be indicated and be associated.The sample of the user profile that each in event 106a-e, 108a-c and 110 obtains during can representing a week represented by timeline 104.In various embodiments, the timeline of the time of any suitable length can be used, and for given user, system can safeguard one or more timeline.
Time and route information vague generalization can be made with the number of matches between increase event.Such as, some periods can be divided into by one day, such as morning, noon, afternoon and evening, make event during any such period will be considered to common event, even if it is slightly different in time.In the same way, can classify primarily of its end points in the position of event, event can not be stoped to be sorted in together to make limited the departing between end points on path.Such as, if the part that user one day adopts alternative route to travel frequently as it, then the event that this is travelled frequently can be treated as with employ slightly different route other to travel frequently be common.
In some embodiments, information providing system can obtain the information relevant with ground Figure 102 or route 103, and can use this information to determine or predict following User Activity.In one example, information providing system can obtain about user and the information relevant with route 103 by being carried out associating with user by route.Such as, information providing system can receive data from the GPS device in the path detected route 103a-c.In another example, outside computing system, the server of the various application of such as trustship (comprise and such as provide traffic route to guide or the application of Map Ability), can determine route 103a-c by observing with drive a vehicle relevant inquiry and result.In another example, information providing system can receive data from payment processes ISP, and it may be used for determining where and when user stops purchase product.Such as, system can be determined that user stops and buy the position of cafe of coffee, or user have purchased the position of the refuelling station of gasoline.This information may be used for determining route or prediction User Activity.In other example, such as the calendar information of appointment, meeting, schedule etc. may be used for determining route 103a-c.In some embodiments, route can be determined based on the one or more information request about the mechanism along route.Above combination is also possible.
User can also be allowed to select to participate in or select to exit some information aggregate.Such as, user can be allowed to determine when collection information, and its computing equipment can be warned them and when collect information.Further, can the type of permitted user configuration information, such as make to be collected about the search activities of user or the information of position, and be not collected about the information of purchase activity.And, in order to help the privacy of maintenance customer, suitable mechanism can be used to guarantee that some information is only processed on the equipment of user, and can't help independent server process, or information by fully anonymous or shielding (such as, by Hash information, wherein the actual value of information is not crucial).
Use the information obtained, system can generate event 106a-e, 108a-c and 110 by being carried out associating with timeline 104 by route 103.In this example, route 103a is associated with event 106a-e in morning on working day.Route 103b is associated with Monday, Tu. and Wednesday evening event 108a-c, and route 103c is associated with Friday night event 110.In some embodiments, system can receive the information relevant with the time.Such as, the payment processes ISP position that user can be provided to buy product and user buy the time of this product.By being associated with the time by purchase events, system can generate event in timeline 104.In some embodiments, received data can associate with time of reception by system.Such as, GPS device can send user's run-length data to system such as almost in real time.Information providing system can generate the stroke event corresponding with the time receiving run-length data in timeline 104.
Based on time related information (such as, event in timeline 104), information providing system can observe the pattern of the behavior of the user joined with time correlation, and can use viewed information to make the prediction to future customer behavior, and correspondingly provides content.In one example, event 106a-d can with to buy coffee at the first cafe (being marked as in map 102a " cafe 1 ") relevant, so seems user to have formed to stop at cafe 1 before arriving working place each morning and buy the custom of espresso.In some embodiments, system can by interrelated to observe user behavior pattern for the time of event and event.Such as, as mentioned above, a user behavior pattern can be included in and buy coffee morning on working day.In various embodiments, can by event segmentation to comprise extraneous information.Such as, user can be on duty on the way and follow the route 103a described in map 102a the every workday, but can such as only stop at cafe 1 place on Monday, Tu. and Friday.In this case, can comprise with user corresponding event 106a, 106b and 106e of the those days of buying coffee that stop the subevent indicating coffee to stop, and event 106c and 106d can not comprise.
Use observed arriving or determined pattern, system can determine that suitable information is to represent to user in correlation time.Such as, system can use viewed user to like drinking before operation the information of coffee in morning, and can represent from cafe 1 or from the reward voucher of another cafe (such as " cafe 2 ") in place being positioned at the route 103a usually advanced that to go to work morning on weekdays along user.In one example, system such as typically can be away from home user and go to work not long ago to user's presenting information.User may pay attention to this information, because it can according to the preference of user (such as, user to liking of drinking coffee morning on weekdays) adjustment, and because its can with time m-opportunism mode (that is, closing on the time that user buys coffee usually) send or represent.So, user can save money or time by the extra effort that seldom or at all do not have that acquisition sales promotion information spends.
In some embodiments, system can use the information that indicates first user pattern the time outside the time be associated with pattern and come to user's presenting information from the information of external signal.Such as, suppose user in the above example the morning saturday morning 9:00 drive around cities and towns.System can use the viewed coffee on working day about user to buy (namely, be associated with the pattern of the activity occurring in morning on working day) information, and the external signal that user's current (although on Saturday) in the morning can be used to drive represents the content be associated with cafe, such as buy the reward vouchers that medium-sized or large-scale mocha receives hundred lucky volumes.One or more extra external signal, the current location of such as user, calendar information, mobile device communication or request etc., can be further used for Suitable content to represent to user, comprise the reward voucher such as representing neighbouring cafe.
In some embodiments, information providing system can also represent the user profile of time correlation based on the combination of global information and viewed pattern.As an illustrated examples, system can be observed user based on event 108a-c and advance to stadium in Monday, Tu. and midweek evening.In one example, system can by access such as can store in the server and on webpage obtainable global information, the schedule of such as baseball team, determined to hold baseball game in stadium in the time of the generation closing on event 108a-c.Such as, system can determine that team carries out home match in stadium, and can from the schedule of team or website visiting team of alliance.In various embodiments, system can ask user to upload the fixture calendar of baseball team, or sends inquiry with the website searched for the result relevant with its schedule with team or access baseball team with acquisition time calendar to search engine.System can use user related information (advancing to stadium on Monday, Tu. and Wednesday), with global information or external signal (each in those nights has carried out baseball game in stadium) combined, determine user may Monday, Tu. and night on Wednesday each attended baseball game in stadium.
Such determination can indicate any implication in some implications.Such as, it can indicating user be all or part of season ticket holder of this baseball team, and user may attend the match in many futures in stadium.If user regularly or in half regular basis is continuing to attend baseball game in stadium, if or observe instruction to the external signal of the interest of local baseball team (such as, use the article that the mobile device of user checks alliance's ranking list or reads about team), then can support such instruction.As an alternative, if each in the match that user attended is all for same opponent, then alternatively, it can indicating user be the football fan of this opponent instead of locals, and can indicate that user may attend following match in stadium when this opponent visits, but can attend match when other opponents come cities and towns by less indicating user.If user never or seldom attend to relate to other opponents baseball game, attend to relate to same opponent match in future or show the observable behavior of instruction to the interest of opponent baseball team, then can support such instruction.
By global information (such as, baseball team's schedule) and event 108a-c is combined, system can observe that indicating user may present at that stadium is ranked many or be all about to the pattern of the baseball game held.In some instances, system can use this pattern to predict the baseball game that user will attend next and is ranked, and it can be determined from the schedule of team.Based on prediction, the user profile that system can represent relevant time correlation at reasonable time is consulted for user.Such as, system can retrieve the date and time of baseball game next time by access global information.Then, system such as can represent the catering information being positioned near stadium or may advancing to the restaurant in the route in stadium or the place near described route along user from family.Within such as two hours before baseball game, such information can be represented, make user can have an opportunity to receive this information, and therefore use this information.Such as, Reference Map 102b, system can represent the reward voucher in restaurant 112 or selected menu item information, and described restaurant 112 had previously used the route 103b in stadium along viewed user.As another example, it near stadium is the bar of assembly place or the sales promotion information of public house (not shown in Figure 1) after welcome match that system can be presented between match period.
