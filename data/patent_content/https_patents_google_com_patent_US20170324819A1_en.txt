- the user interface for an application may include an icon or soft key on a touchscreen of the user device, a physical key or button, a stylus, or a voice input, for example.
- An application may be developed by one or more software developers. Audio or video content may be played from an Internet website by using an Internet browser, or by using one or more applications installed on a user device, such as a music or video play store, for example.
- users may be able to download or to play music or video content repeatedly from music or video play stores, Internet radio stations, music or video websites, or other online music or video sources, without actually listening to or watching the music or video content.
- Some users may set their user devices to play the music or video content repeatedly for various reasons, including, for example, in response to encouragement by the artists, labels, publishers, or copyright owners or licensors.
- owners or licensors of copyrighted music or video content may encourage their fans to download or to play the music or video content repeatedly to increase their popularity ratings or revenues from copyright royalties.
- repeated, automated or robotic plays of online music or video content may consume valuable network resources, reduce bandwidths to other users of the network, and slow down or create latency in the downloading of music or video content by other users who actually listen to or watch the music or video content.
- FIG. 1 shows an example of providing modified online audio or video content to a user and monitoring for a reaction from the user in response to the modified audio or video content.
- the owner or licensor of original audio or video content in block 102 transmits the original audio or video content 104 to an online content provider 106 , which may be an online play store, an Internet radio or television station, an audio or video streaming service provider, or another type of audio or video content provider.
- the online content provider 106 may apply one or more modifications to one or more portions of the audio or video content, and transmit the modified audio or video content 108 to the end user 110 .
- Modifications applied to the audio or video content may include one or more audible distortions to the audio content or to the audio portion of the video content.
- audible distortions to the audio content or to the audio portion of the video content that may be expected to trigger a reaction by an actual listener or viewer may include muting a portion of the audio content, a pause at some point in the playback of the audio content, a modification to the bit rate in at least a portion of the audio content that results in an audible change in the playback, a modification to the spectral content of at least a portion of the audio content, an abrupt increase or decrease in the playback volume of at least a portion of the audio content, or injection of an acoustic signal that is not normally expected to be part of the audio content, for example, the injection of a beep, a buzz, a ringtone or a noise in a music soundtrack.
- the user may react to the modified content in various manners, for example, by moving or shaking the user device, adjusting the volume on the user device, stopping, reversing or fast-forwarding the playback on the user device, re-downloading or replaying the content, or another type of user reaction detectable on the user device, as indicated in block 112 . If the user is merely robotically playing the audio or video content without actually listening to or watching it, then no reaction may be detected on the user device. Response data 114 indicative of one or more user reactions by the user, or the lack thereof, may be transmitted back to the online content provider 106 in FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 2 shows an example of a process of monitoring for inflated plays by users of online audio or video content according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- a modification may be applied to a portion of the audio stream in block 202 .
- the modification may be introduced to the audio stream or to the audio portion of the video stream by the owner of a play store, a website, or a server that provides audio or video streaming, for example.
- the user may download the audio or video content from an audio or video play store, an Internet radio or television station, or an Internet browser, for example. Downloading of audio or video content from the content provider or server may be achieved through one or more wired or wireless connections.
- Modifications to one or more portions of an audio stream may be made in various manners that are expected to trigger one or more reactions by a user who is actually listening to the audio stream. For example, a modification may be applied to a portion of an audio stream, such as a music soundtrack, by distorting the portion of the audio stream such that the music would sound abnormal to a user who is actually listening to the music. As another example, a modification may be applied to a portion of an audio stream by muting the portion of the audio stream. As another example, a modification may be applied to a portion of the audio stream by pausing the playback at some point in the audio stream.
- pausing of the playback of the audio stream may last for a limited time duration that is perceptible to a normal human listener, for example, a second or a few seconds, such that a user who is actually listening to the audio may be expected to react.
- the pausing of the playback of the audio stream on a user device may continue until the user has reacted to the pause.
- a modification may be applied to a portion of the audio stream by changing the bit rate of playback of that portion of the audio stream, such that a distortion due to the change in the bit rate is perceptible to a normal human listener.
- a modification may be applied to a portion of the audio stream by changing the spectral content of the portion of the audio stream.
- a modification may be applied to a portion of the audio stream by decreasing or increasing the sound volume of that portion of the audio stream. For example, if the volume of music is suddenly decreased or increased substantially during the play of a music soundtrack, then a user who is actually listening to the music may be expected to react to the sudden decrease or increase in the volume on the user device.
- a modification to a portion of the audio stream may be made by inserting one or more acoustic signals into that portion of the audio stream.
- acoustic signals may include the types of sounds not normally expected to be present in the audio stream.
- an acoustic signal such as a beep, a buzz, a ringtone, or a noise that is not normally expected to be part of the music, may be introduced into the soundtrack.
- a user who is actually listening to the music may be expected to react to the sudden introduction of such acoustic signals.
- various types of modifications may be introduced to one or more portions of an audio stream such as a music soundtrack, or to one or more portions of the audio portion of a video stream. For example, a user who is actually watching a music video may be expected to react to such modifications to the audio portion of the music video.
- the audio content with the applied modification may be transmitted to one or more user devices in block 204 , by the provider of the audio content from one or more servers, for example.
- a user may play back the modified audio stream from a play store or an Internet browser on a user device, for example.
- the provider of the audio content may monitor the user device for reactions, if any, by the user, in response to the playback of the modified audio stream in block 206 . If a reaction is not detected from the user device in block 208 , then the playback of audio or video content on that user device may be flagged as an inflated playback in block 210 . On the other hand, if a reaction is detected from the user device in block 208 , then the playback of the audio or video content on that user device may be flagged as a legitimate play in block 212 .
- a user who is actually listening to the audio content may normally react to a sudden or unexpected audible modification to the audio content in various manners.
- the user may react to the sudden or unexpected modification to the audio content be moving or shaking the user device on which the audio content is being played.
- a user device may be a mobile device, for example, a smartphone, a smartwatch, a pad, or the like.
- Some mobile devices for example, mobile devices that are capable of position location, may be equipped with one or more movement sensors such as a magnetometer, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a piezoelectric device, or the like, that may detect a movement such as shaking of the device by the user.
- a movement such as a shaking of the user device may be an indication that the user is actually listening to the audio content and is reacting to the sudden or unexpected modification to the audio content.
- the playback of the audio content on that user device may be flagged as a legitimate play.
- the user may react to a modification to a portion of an audio stream by manually adjusting the sound volume on the user device. For example, if the modification to the audio stream includes muting a portion the audio stream, pausing the playback at a certain point of the audio stream, or suddenly decreasing or increasing the volume of the audio stream, then the user who is actually listening to the audio stream may manually adjust the volume on the user device in an attempt to compensate for the modification introduced to the audio stream. Such a manual adjustment to the volume may be detected by the user device, and the playback may be flagged as a legitimate playback.
- the user who is actually listening to the audio content may react to a sudden or unexpected modification by manually stopping the playback, or reversing or fast-forwarding the playback on the user device. For example, if a distortion or change in the spectral content is applied to a portion of a music soundtrack, a user who is actually listening to the music may stop the playback to avoid listening to the music that has been distorted. In some instances, the user may reverse the playback in an attempt to listen to the music again. In some instances, the user may fast-forward the playback in an attempt to skip over the modified portion of the audio content.
- the user who is actually listening to the audio content may react to a sudden or unexpected modification of the audio content by initiating re-downloading or replaying of the audio content on the user device, for example.
- the user may also react to audible modifications or distortions of the audio content in various other manners by performing one or more acts on the user device. Any of such user reactions may be regarded as an indication that the user is actually listening to the audio content or watching the video content which includes the audio content that has been modified.
- a user may react to a sudden or unexpected modification to an audio stream or an audio portion of a video stream by one or more interactions with one or more user interfaces, such as a graphic user interface (GUI).
- GUI graphic user interface
- a user may react to the unexpected modification by making a key input, a button input, a stylus input, a touchscreen input, a voice command input, or the like.
- a user input to adjust the volume of the audio playback, to stop, reverse or fast-forward the playback of the audio content, or to re-download or replay the audio content in response to the modification may be regarded as an indication that the user is actually listening to the audio content.
- Such an indication may be transmitted to the network which allows the owner of the play store or website that provides audio or video streaming service to determine that the user is an actual listener or viewer who is not merely repetitively downloading or playing the music or video.
- other types of reactions such as sudden movements of the user device in response to unexpected modifications of the audio content detected by one or more movement sensors on the user device may also serve as an indication that the user is an actual listener or viewer, and such an indication may be transmitted to the owner of the play store or website through the network.
- the system may only need to monitor the usage patterns of a large number of users, for example, a large number of listeners in the fan base of an artist or label.
- a large group of users instead of each individual user may be monitored to detect inflated playbacks.
- the owner or licensor of the copyright of the music or video content may encourage its fan base to play the music or video content repeatedly to increase its popularity ratings or copyright revenue, without regard to the waste of network resources and slowing down of network access caused by the repeated playbacks of music or video.
- statistics of abuse by repeated playbacks of music or video content may be compiled against the copyright owner or licensor instead of against the individual user.
- warnings may be sent out to users who abuse network resources and available bandwidths.
- the system may prevent a user from replaying the same music or video after one or more warnings in order to conserve network resources and to make bandwidths available to other legitimate users.
- the system may take some action regarding the user in addition to flagging inflated playbacks.
- the system may cull the connection between the user and the website or play store that provides the content. In some situations, a single instance or a few occasional instances of the absence of reactions to modifications of the audio content may be excusable. However, actions may be taken against users who have repeatedly ignored modifications to the audio content. In some implementations, the system may keep a record of users, devices or accounts which have shown a repeated lack of responses to modifications applied to the audio content. For example, actions such as transmitting warnings to the user, terminating the repeated downloading of the same audio or video content, or suspending or terminating the user account, may be taken against a user if the number of non-responses exceeds a threshold within a given period of time.
- a play store or website connection may be terminated if no reaction is detected from the user device in response to modifications to the audio or video content more than three times per day.
- individual users may be provided an opportunity to control whether such information is collected by the system.
- the playback information disclosed herein may be maintained separately from other user information, so that for example, it does not include any personally-identifiable information about individual users.
- a user account may be automatically marked as exhibiting patterns of repeatedly playing content as disclosed herein, such indication may be stored, manipulated, and otherwise treated separately from some or all other information about the user's account, such as the user's name or other personally-identifiable information.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the identity of the device may be monitored for multiple repeated playbacks of online audio or video content, personal information associated with the user of that device may not be necessary for a system to compile histories or statistics of legitimate or inflated playbacks of online audio or video content on that particular device.
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a system as disclosed herein.

Abstract
Description
- With high levels of automation in modern user devices, such as computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones or smartwatches, users may be able to play music or video content automatically or nearly automatically at all times, day after day, even if the user does not actually listen to the music or watch the video during those times. Such repeated plays may consume valuable network resources, reduce bandwidths that otherwise would be available to other users of the network, and affect the quality of transmission of audio or video content to other users who actually listen to or watch the audio or video content. In some situations, the copyright owners or licensors may encourage their fans to play their music or video content repeatedly to increase their popularity ratings, to improve their positions on music charts, or to increase their copyright royalties collected from audio or video content stores, Internet radio or television stations, or audio or video streaming service providers if the copyright royalties are based on a fixed royalty rate per playback.
- According to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter, a method of detecting inflated playbacks of audio content downloaded to a device includes applying a modification to a portion of the audio content; transmitting the audio content with the modification to the device; monitoring the device for a reaction by a user of the device to an audible playback of the modification of the portion of the audio content by the device; and determining that the audible playback is an inflated playback if no reaction by the user of the device is detected based on monitoring of the device.
- According to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter, an apparatus for detecting inflated playbacks of audio content includes a memory and a processor communicably coupled to the memory. In an embodiment, the processor is configured to execute instructions to apply a modification to a portion of an audio content; transmit the audio content with the modification to a device; monitor the device for a reaction by a user of the device to an audible playbacks of the modification of the portion of the audio content by the device; and determine that the audible playback is an inflated playback if no reaction by the user of the device is detected based on monitoring of the device.
- According to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter, means for detecting inflated playbacks of audio content downloaded to a device are provided, which include means for applying a modification to a portion of the audio content; means for transmitting the audio content with the modification to the device; means for monitoring the device for a reaction by a user of the device to an audible playback of the modification of the portion of the audio content by the device; and means for determining that the audible playback is an inflated playback if no reaction by the user of the device is detected based on monitoring of the device.
- According to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter, a method of detecting inflated plays of audio content downloaded to a device comprises applying a modification to a portion of the audio content; transmitting the audio content with the modification to said device; monitoring said device for one or more reactions by a user of the device in response to audible playback of the modification during one or more playbacks of at least a part of the audio content by the device; and flagging one or more of said playbacks as one or more inflated plays in response to said monitoring. In some implementations, one or more of said playbacks are flagged as inflated playbacks if no said reaction by the user is detected. In some implementations, the audio content comprises an audio portion of a video stream. In some implementations, the audio content is downloaded from an online content service. In some implementations, the audio content is downloaded by an Internet browser executing on the device. In some implementations, applying the modification to the portion of the audio comprises applying an audible distortion to the portion of the audio, muting the portion of the audio content, inserting a pause into the audio content, changing a bit rate of playback of the portion of the audio content, changing a spectral content of the portion of the audio content, reducing or increasing a volume of the portion of the audio content, or adding one or more acoustic signals to the portion of the audio content. In some implementations, monitoring said device for one or more reactions by a user of the device in response to audible playback of the modification comprises detecting one or more movements of the user device. In some implementations, monitoring said device for one or more reactions by a user of the device in response to audible playback of the modification comprises detecting one or more user adjustments of audio playback volume on said user device, detecting a user stopping a said playback on said devices, detecting a user fast-forwarding a said playback on said device, detecting inputs by a user of the device to initiate re-downloading or replaying of the audio content on said device, or detecting one or more user interface inputs on said one or more user devices.

FIG. 4 shows an example of a network configuration according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. -
FIG. 5 shows another example of a network configuration according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. - Some listeners or viewers of online music or video content may play the music or video content repeatedly without actually listening to or watching the music or video, thereby wasting network resources, reducing bandwidths to other users, and slowing down or creating latency for the downloading of music or video content by other users who actually listen to or watch the music or video content. In some instances, owners or licensors of music or video content may encourage their users to play the music or video repeatedly to increase their popularity ratings or their copyright revenues. According to embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, inflated playbacks of an audio content or the audio portion of a video content may be detected by applying an audible modification to the audio content and monitoring for reactions, if any, by the user to the audible modification. The lack of a reaction by the user may indicate an inflated playback, whereas the presence of a reaction may indicate that the playback is legitimate.
- The presently-disclosed subject matter relates to methods and apparatus for detecting abuse or preventing attempted abuse by users who play audio or video content from a website or play store repeatedly, without actually listening to or watching the audio or video content. A “user device” may be any device on which audio, video or other types of contents may be played by a user, including but not limited to a desktop or laptop computer, or a mobile device such as a smartphone, a smartwatch, a tablet, or the like. An “application” may include a computer program or software with an interface, such as a user interface, which may enable a user to accomplish a task on a user device. The user interface for an application may include an icon or soft key on a touchscreen of the user device, a physical key or button, a stylus, or a voice input, for example. An application may be developed by one or more software developers. Audio or video content may be played from an Internet website by using an Internet browser, or by using one or more applications installed on a user device, such as a music or video play store, for example.
- With high levels of automation in modern user devices, users may be able to download or to play music or video content repeatedly from music or video play stores, Internet radio stations, music or video websites, or other online music or video sources, without actually listening to or watching the music or video content. Some users may set their user devices to play the music or video content repeatedly for various reasons, including, for example, in response to encouragement by the artists, labels, publishers, or copyright owners or licensors. In some instances, owners or licensors of copyrighted music or video content may encourage their fans to download or to play the music or video content repeatedly to increase their popularity ratings or revenues from copyright royalties. Regardless of the motivations, repeated, automated or robotic plays of online music or video content may consume valuable network resources, reduce bandwidths to other users of the network, and slow down or create latency in the downloading of music or video content by other users who actually listen to or watch the music or video content.
-
FIG. 1 shows an example of providing modified online audio or video content to a user and monitoring for a reaction from the user in response to the modified audio or video content. InFIG. 1 , the owner or licensor of original audio or video content inblock 102 transmits the original audio orvideo content 104 to anonline content provider 106, which may be an online play store, an Internet radio or television station, an audio or video streaming service provider, or another type of audio or video content provider. In order to detect whether an end user is actually listening to or watching the audio or video content or merely playing back the audio or video content repeatedly or automatically without actually listening to or watching the content, theonline content provider 106 may apply one or more modifications to one or more portions of the audio or video content, and transmit the modified audio orvideo content 108 to theend user 110. - Modifications applied to the audio or video content may include one or more audible distortions to the audio content or to the audio portion of the video content. For example, audible distortions to the audio content or to the audio portion of the video content that may be expected to trigger a reaction by an actual listener or viewer may include muting a portion of the audio content, a pause at some point in the playback of the audio content, a modification to the bit rate in at least a portion of the audio content that results in an audible change in the playback, a modification to the spectral content of at least a portion of the audio content, an abrupt increase or decrease in the playback volume of at least a portion of the audio content, or injection of an acoustic signal that is not normally expected to be part of the audio content, for example, the injection of a beep, a buzz, a ringtone or a noise in a music soundtrack. If the user is actually listening to or watching the modified audio or video content, the user may react to the modified content in various manners, for example, by moving or shaking the user device, adjusting the volume on the user device, stopping, reversing or fast-forwarding the playback on the user device, re-downloading or replaying the content, or another type of user reaction detectable on the user device, as indicated in
block 112. If the user is merely robotically playing the audio or video content without actually listening to or watching it, then no reaction may be detected on the user device.Response data 114 indicative of one or more user reactions by the user, or the lack thereof, may be transmitted back to theonline content provider 106 inFIG. 1 . -
FIG. 2 shows an example of a process of monitoring for inflated plays by users of online audio or video content according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. In order to test whether a user is actually listening to an audio stream or to the audio portion of a video stream, a modification may be applied to a portion of the audio stream inblock 202. The modification may be introduced to the audio stream or to the audio portion of the video stream by the owner of a play store, a website, or a server that provides audio or video streaming, for example. The user may download the audio or video content from an audio or video play store, an Internet radio or television station, or an Internet browser, for example. Downloading of audio or video content from the content provider or server may be achieved through one or more wired or wireless connections. - Modifications to one or more portions of an audio stream may be made in various manners that are expected to trigger one or more reactions by a user who is actually listening to the audio stream. For example, a modification may be applied to a portion of an audio stream, such as a music soundtrack, by distorting the portion of the audio stream such that the music would sound abnormal to a user who is actually listening to the music. As another example, a modification may be applied to a portion of an audio stream by muting the portion of the audio stream. As another example, a modification may be applied to a portion of the audio stream by pausing the playback at some point in the audio stream. In some implementations, pausing of the playback of the audio stream may last for a limited time duration that is perceptible to a normal human listener, for example, a second or a few seconds, such that a user who is actually listening to the audio may be expected to react. In some implementations, the pausing of the playback of the audio stream on a user device may continue until the user has reacted to the pause.
- As another example, a modification may be applied to a portion of the audio stream by changing the bit rate of playback of that portion of the audio stream, such that a distortion due to the change in the bit rate is perceptible to a normal human listener. As another example, a modification may be applied to a portion of the audio stream by changing the spectral content of the portion of the audio stream. As another example, a modification may be applied to a portion of the audio stream by decreasing or increasing the sound volume of that portion of the audio stream. For example, if the volume of music is suddenly decreased or increased substantially during the play of a music soundtrack, then a user who is actually listening to the music may be expected to react to the sudden decrease or increase in the volume on the user device.
- As yet another example, a modification to a portion of the audio stream may be made by inserting one or more acoustic signals into that portion of the audio stream. Such acoustic signals may include the types of sounds not normally expected to be present in the audio stream. For example, in a music soundtrack, an acoustic signal such as a beep, a buzz, a ringtone, or a noise that is not normally expected to be part of the music, may be introduced into the soundtrack. A user who is actually listening to the music may be expected to react to the sudden introduction of such acoustic signals. In the examples described above, various types of modifications may be introduced to one or more portions of an audio stream such as a music soundtrack, or to one or more portions of the audio portion of a video stream. For example, a user who is actually watching a music video may be expected to react to such modifications to the audio portion of the music video.
- Referring to
FIG. 2 , after the modification is applied to a portion of the audio content inblock 202, the audio content with the applied modification may be transmitted to one or more user devices inblock 204, by the provider of the audio content from one or more servers, for example. A user may play back the modified audio stream from a play store or an Internet browser on a user device, for example. After the modified audio content is transmitted, the provider of the audio content may monitor the user device for reactions, if any, by the user, in response to the playback of the modified audio stream inblock 206. If a reaction is not detected from the user device inblock 208, then the playback of audio or video content on that user device may be flagged as an inflated playback inblock 210. On the other hand, if a reaction is detected from the user device inblock 208, then the playback of the audio or video content on that user device may be flagged as a legitimate play inblock 212. - A user who is actually listening to the audio content may normally react to a sudden or unexpected audible modification to the audio content in various manners. For example, the user may react to the sudden or unexpected modification to the audio content be moving or shaking the user device on which the audio content is being played. Such a user device may be a mobile device, for example, a smartphone, a smartwatch, a pad, or the like. Some mobile devices, for example, mobile devices that are capable of position location, may be equipped with one or more movement sensors such as a magnetometer, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a piezoelectric device, or the like, that may detect a movement such as shaking of the device by the user. A movement such as a shaking of the user device may be an indication that the user is actually listening to the audio content and is reacting to the sudden or unexpected modification to the audio content. In response to detecting such a movement or shaking, the playback of the audio content on that user device may be flagged as a legitimate play.
- Instead of or in addition to moving or shaking the user device, the user may react to a modification to a portion of an audio stream by manually adjusting the sound volume on the user device. For example, if the modification to the audio stream includes muting a portion the audio stream, pausing the playback at a certain point of the audio stream, or suddenly decreasing or increasing the volume of the audio stream, then the user who is actually listening to the audio stream may manually adjust the volume on the user device in an attempt to compensate for the modification introduced to the audio stream. Such a manual adjustment to the volume may be detected by the user device, and the playback may be flagged as a legitimate playback.
- In some instances, the user who is actually listening to the audio content may react to a sudden or unexpected modification by manually stopping the playback, or reversing or fast-forwarding the playback on the user device. For example, if a distortion or change in the spectral content is applied to a portion of a music soundtrack, a user who is actually listening to the music may stop the playback to avoid listening to the music that has been distorted. In some instances, the user may reverse the playback in an attempt to listen to the music again. In some instances, the user may fast-forward the playback in an attempt to skip over the modified portion of the audio content. In some instances, the user who is actually listening to the audio content may react to a sudden or unexpected modification of the audio content by initiating re-downloading or replaying of the audio content on the user device, for example. The user may also react to audible modifications or distortions of the audio content in various other manners by performing one or more acts on the user device. Any of such user reactions may be regarded as an indication that the user is actually listening to the audio content or watching the video content which includes the audio content that has been modified.
- On some user devices such as smartphones, smartwatches or pads, a user may react to a sudden or unexpected modification to an audio stream or an audio portion of a video stream by one or more interactions with one or more user interfaces, such as a graphic user interface (GUI). In some instances, a user may react to the unexpected modification by making a key input, a button input, a stylus input, a touchscreen input, a voice command input, or the like. A user input to adjust the volume of the audio playback, to stop, reverse or fast-forward the playback of the audio content, or to re-download or replay the audio content in response to the modification may be regarded as an indication that the user is actually listening to the audio content. Such an indication may be transmitted to the network which allows the owner of the play store or website that provides audio or video streaming service to determine that the user is an actual listener or viewer who is not merely repetitively downloading or playing the music or video. Moreover, other types of reactions such as sudden movements of the user device in response to unexpected modifications of the audio content detected by one or more movement sensors on the user device may also serve as an indication that the user is an actual listener or viewer, and such an indication may be transmitted to the owner of the play store or website through the network.
- In some instances, it may be unnecessary to monitor the usage pattern of each individual user. For example, in order to detect potential abuse by a copyright owner or licensor, the system may only need to monitor the usage patterns of a large number of users, for example, a large number of listeners in the fan base of an artist or label. In some implementations, a large group of users instead of each individual user may be monitored to detect inflated playbacks. The owner or licensor of the copyright of the music or video content may encourage its fan base to play the music or video content repeatedly to increase its popularity ratings or copyright revenue, without regard to the waste of network resources and slowing down of network access caused by the repeated playbacks of music or video. In such instances, statistics of abuse by repeated playbacks of music or video content may be compiled against the copyright owner or licensor instead of against the individual user.
- In some situations, however, monitoring of individual users or types of users may be desirable to identify users or types of users that have exhibited patterns of repeatedly playing the music or video content without actually listening to or watching it. In some implementations, warnings may be sent out to users who abuse network resources and available bandwidths. In some implementations, the system may prevent a user from replaying the same music or video after one or more warnings in order to conserve network resources and to make bandwidths available to other legitimate users. Upon determining that there are one or more instances in which no reaction is detected from the user device after a modification is introduced into an audio stream such as a music soundtrack, or into the audio portion of a video stream, the system may take some action regarding the user in addition to flagging inflated playbacks. For example, the system may cull the connection between the user and the website or play store that provides the content. In some situations, a single instance or a few occasional instances of the absence of reactions to modifications of the audio content may be excusable. However, actions may be taken against users who have repeatedly ignored modifications to the audio content. In some implementations, the system may keep a record of users, devices or accounts which have shown a repeated lack of responses to modifications applied to the audio content. For example, actions such as transmitting warnings to the user, terminating the repeated downloading of the same audio or video content, or suspending or terminating the user account, may be taken against a user if the number of non-responses exceeds a threshold within a given period of time. As a specific example, a play store or website connection may be terminated if no reaction is detected from the user device in response to modifications to the audio or video content more than three times per day. However, even in implementations in which user activity is used as disclosed herein, individual users may be provided an opportunity to control whether such information is collected by the system. Alternatively or in addition, the playback information disclosed herein may be maintained separately from other user information, so that for example, it does not include any personally-identifiable information about individual users. As a specific example, although a user account may be automatically marked as exhibiting patterns of repeatedly playing content as disclosed herein, such indication may be stored, manipulated, and otherwise treated separately from some or all other information about the user's account, such as the user's name or other personally-identifiable information.
- More generally, in situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. As another example, although the identity of the device may be monitored for multiple repeated playbacks of online audio or video content, personal information associated with the user of that device may not be necessary for a system to compile histories or statistics of legitimate or inflated playbacks of online audio or video content on that particular device. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a system as disclosed herein.
