The numeral that front-end server system 108 receives inquiry 104 and for example uses speech recognition system will give an oral account phrase converts the text representation of oral account phrase to.The front-end server system determines then whether inquiry 104 (now with textual forms) comprise carrier phrases (for example, one or more words), and this carrier phrases sign inquiry is as being assigned for unique processing.In this illustration, inquiry comprises that carrier phrases " calling " or " wikipedia " are as the first words of inquiring about 104.Therefore, mark inquires about to be used for unique processing, and this can cause the telephone number that inquiry 104 is used for Search Results to different search engine routes and mobile computing device 102 automatic calls, and this Search Results is in response to inquiry 104.
Can carry out determining of carrier phrases existence by the first words of the relatively inquiry of conversion and the white list of candidate's carrier phrases, system is intended to allow these candidate's carrier phrases utilize customer-furnished follow-up input to trigger specific action.Can make specific available support phrase can be used for the user, thereby so that how they can know best and system interaction, although thereby to such an extent as to can select some carrier phrases so that their users so directly perceived can understand how to use them without any explicit commands the time naturally.In some instances, carrier phrases relates to specific general order based on verb, such as " calling ".In other example, carrier phrases can be the tabulation of noun, such as the title of company of Fortune 500, the title of front 100 websites etc.
When assigning inquiry 104 to be used for the unique processing consistent with location-based search, to inquire about 104 and position 106 to local search engine 110 rather than general search engine 112 routes (for example, can not provide inquiry to two search engines, but in other example, can provide it to the two).In some instances, before providing inquiry to local search engine 110, remove the inquiry carrier phrases from inquiry.Local search engine 110 can be determined in response to the two Search Results of inquiry 104 and position 106, and it can be tied by position-based 106 geographically.Can forward end server system 108 providing echoes answers one or more response Search Results in the Search Results 114, and this front-end server system can transmit one or more Search Results 114 to mobile computing device 102.One or more Search Results 114 can come by rank according to them and the degree of correlation of inquiry 104 and position 106.
The Search Results that mobile computing device 102 receives one or more Search Results 114 and the most remarkable rank from Search Results 114 selects to be used for the telephone number of Search Results of the most remarkable rank of Search Results.Mobile phone is for example by initiating to come the selected telephone number of automatic call for the process that dials selected telephone number.As illustration, mobile computing device can show telephone number to be called out and warning user: if not cancellation calling within the time of determining amount of user, then with dialing telephone number.This demonstration also can comprise title for corresponding Search Results, the physical address relevant with corresponding Search Results or the station address relevant with corresponding Search Results.
When automatic movable relates to when guiding the user into webpage rather than dialing telephone number, can provide similar feedback to the user, and the user can have for the treatment of the similar manner that feeds back (for example, wait for redirected and allow and be redirected automatic appearance, cancellation is redirected and carries out other operation, redirected such as the tabulation of checking all Search Results or immediately triggering).For exemplary purpose, in question a large amount of discussion here being exemplified as the center, although provide additional discussion about automatically being redirected example in suitable part, comprise following Fig. 3 H and Fig. 3 I with automatic poking.
In another example of automatic call, mobile phone 102 presents prompting, and this prompting is called user's the ability of mobile computing device with dialing telephone number.As illustration, can present dialog box, this dialog box comprises the demonstration of telephone number, " calling " button and " cancellation " button.Yet, can not add telephone number, thereby make mobile output device be connected to another computing equipment by PSTN, there is not no user to input explicit selection " calling " button.
In some instances, if the inquiry that forward end server system 108 provides does not comprise " calling " carrier phrases, then send inquiry to general search engine 112 rather than local search engine 110.General search engine 112 can return Search Results to mobile phone 102, but returning of Search Results can not make mobile phone 102 automatic call telephone numbers.For example, can in tabulation, present for the demonstration of each Search Results that returns or with synthetic speech and can export the Search Results that each returns to the user with listening.Therefore, the user of mobile phone 102 can use single inquiry input mechanism (for example, single optional interface element) with: (i) submit general inquiry to, these general inquiries produce the visual display of the tabulation of Search Results; And (ii) submit Query, these query calls mobile computing devices are used for the telephone number of the Search Results of remarkable rank with automatic call.
In more other implementations, can check the inquiry that does not comprise " calling " carrier phrases in order to determine it and whether should be regarded as location-based inquiry.Various technology can be used for carrying out such determining, such as by location-basedly formerly inquiring about training system so that sign relates to term and the phrase of position with being known as, and the then inquiry of follow-up reception and the model that produces from such training is in order to produce the designator whether inquiry of follow-up reception probably relates to the position.For example, can determine that term (such as " food " and " dining room ") indicates location-based inquiry, because they are often used by following user, these users attempt to find the place of having dinner in the near future near them.When carrying out so really timing, such inquiry can be treated as the inquiry by the guiding of " calling " carrier phrases discussed above.
Except being the calling telephone number by process result shown in the arrow 6 among the figure, the result can be alternatively with the application on equipment 102 to the webpage redirect or be redirected, this webpage for example is the login page corresponding with Search Results (webpage that namely provides when the user clicks Search Results in the tabulation of Search Results).For example, if general search server system 112 determine ad hoc inquiries and particular search result to heavens relevant and/or for " mark " of the first Search Results or other quality indicator apparently higher than " mark " or other quality indicator for the second best result, then general search server system 112 can make the front-end server system provide marker code to equipment 102, this marker code is used in that the highest result's login page is shown (that is equipment 102 is redirected not at display of search results on the equipment 102 to login page) immediately if or make the shown and user of Search Results not provide input so automatically be redirected then make equipment 102 redirected from the login page that trend is used for the highest result stopping after the predetermined time period that counts down.By this mode, can illustrate and take the user to the highest Search Results and the user need not to provide any further input after submit Query to the user.In various examples, select more continually particular search result if check the user of tabulation in response to the Search Results of inquiry than other Search Results in the Search Results, then particular search result can have balloon score.
Although show automatic poking here automatically guiding the specific example of login page in response to inquiry in response to the telephone number of inquiry with equipment, can also identify and can automatically process other classification according to similar manner with technology described herein.When receiving the oral account inquiry, can be progressively or analyze the text that is used for inquiry in the classification process, this process with rule application in text to determine that whether inquiry is corresponding to particular category, such as login page or enterprise telephone number.For example, the specific support phrase can be relevant with the particular result classification, perhaps can identify appropriate classification by the coupling of a certain text in inspection in a series of tabulations and the inquiry, wherein each is tabulated corresponding to classification, and checks that the order of tabulation can be the frequency of successively decreasing of the theme of oral account inquiry according to each classification.
Therefore, for example, can receive the text representation of oral account input, and can (for example compare first specific instructions, " calling ") tabulation check one or more the first words, if and in this classification, found coupling, then system could be such as the order of carrying out sign by the sign telephone number corresponding with the remainder of inquiry.If there is no coupling order, then system can check then whether particular search result has very balloon score, and formulates equipment automatically being redirected to the login page that is used for this result.Can other classification of subsequent examination, and can select the action that limits for particular category.Other such action can be fill order on the application-specific on the equipment, such as using media renderer plays audio frequency or video file, using counter carry out mathematical functions etc.
Fig. 2 is for the swimming lane figure of automatic call for the instantiation procedure of the telephone number of Search Results.Generally speaking, this process relates to the Search Results that sign is used for inquiry, this Query Result has the telephone number related with it (for example, the homepage by analyze being used for the result and to wherein telephone number location or the structure list (such as by allowing enterprise to the service commitment profile information) by the maintenance telephone number relevant with the specific enterprise position).In other example, replace enterprise telephone number or in addition, can identify enterprise web site, and can use and be used for automatic poking and automatically guide equipment into website the similar user interface mechanisms of the user interface mechanisms of enterprise.Equipment also can dial enterprise and web login page for enterprise is shown basically simultaneously.
The process of Fig. 2 can be by at the System Implementation shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 6, Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 and the screenshot capture of Fig. 3 A to Fig. 5 is generated for showing at computing equipment.
In frame 202, computing equipment is determined device location alternatively.For example, station location marker mechanism can be used the geographic position that identifies the estimation of computing equipment from the wireless signal of electric transmission device (for example, gps satellite or cell tower).Can use triangulation method with the geographic position of the estimation of definite mobile device and the accuracy of location positioning.The geographic position of estimating can be represented by latitude and longitude coordinate.In some instances, " register " definite geographic position of estimating to the position based on Wi-Fi signal or user.In various examples, determine the geographic position of a series of estimations, and the forward end server system provides each position as regularly position renewal.
In frame 204, computing equipment receives user's input of inquiry.For example, the user of computing equipment can select search box and uses virtual or physical keyboard is keyed in text query in search box in response to providing to search box to focus on.Behind the typing text query, the user can select inquire button with to the server system submit Query.Alternatively, the user can select speech polling button (for example, virtual or physical button), and this speech polling button calls computing equipment to use the microphone record audio.Search box or speech polling button can be separately according to query contents (for example, whether inquiry comprises carrier phrases) allow user (i) to receive and show in response to the tabulation of the Search Results of inquiry or (ii) Automatically invoked be used for the telephone number of Search Results.In various examples, inquire button is not to call the button of calling (button and " conversation " button of for example, marking with character 0-9).In some instances, as hereinafter more specifically discussing, inquiry comprises user's input position.
In frame 206, the forward end server system sends inquiry.For example, in typing of user after the text query, the user can select and contiguous show and the interface element that describe words " continuation " or " search " of query frame.The option interface element can call computing equipment with forward end server system transmission text query.The user has recorded in the example of speech polling therein, when pressing button with the termination record or when computing equipment is ended to record automatically, can the inquiry of forward end server system transmission counterpart predicate sound carry out coded data after the user has finished oral account.Can be independent of call and carry out two transmission of inquiry, wherein connect two phones to be used for duplex voice communication.
In some instances, computing equipment can send the geographic position of the estimation of computing equipment with inquiry.For example, latitude and longitude coordinate can be followed the query requests of forward end server system, perhaps computing equipment can be before the forward end server system coordinate (the half regular stream that for example, upgrades as the position) is provided.In some instances, the inquiry by user's input comprises geographical location information.The inquiry of for example, " calling out near Pizza shop, Times Square " for phrase comprises positional information " Times Square ".
In frame 208, the front-end server system has received inquiry and has determined whether inquiry is used for the telephone number of automatic call Search Results.In some instances, if inquiry comprises the reserved word word, determine that then inquiry is for being used for automatic call.For example, predetermined words can be as the carrier phrases of user input and with inquiry in words in other words inline.Carrier phrases can be at beginning or the end of inquiry.As illustration, inquiry "
Call outThe refuelling station ", "
Send a telegraphPharmacy ", "
Mobile phone ... call out... nearest bookstore " and " large-scale taxi company
Automatic call" all comprise carrier phrases (in these examples, illustrating with underscore).
In various examples, inquiry is designated the telephone number that is used for Search Results for automatic call based on the indication that receives from computing equipment.For example, computing equipment may determine that inquiry comprises carrier phrases, removes carrier phrases and provide inquiry to be used for the such indication of telephone number of automatic call Search Results with inquiry and forward end server system from inquiry.In various examples, send inquiry in response to user selection graphical interfaces element to server system, this graphical interfaces element specifically is used for submitting to the inquiry that is used for the automatic call telephone number.In such example, can be used for the such indication forward end server system of automatic call telephone number with inquiry and send inquiry, perhaps inquiry can be guided into the unified resource location address, the inquiry that is used for receiving the telephone number that is used for the automatic call Search Results is assigned separately in this address.Therefore, server system can implicit expression know that the inquiry of reception is used for the automatic call telephone number.
If inquiry is not for the automatic call telephone number, then can provide inquiry (frame 210 of hereinafter more specifically discussing) to general search system.If determine that inquiry for being used for the automatic call telephone number, then can provide inquiry to local search system (being also referred to as the geographic search system).
In frame 212, local search system is determined the Search Results in response to inquiry.Local search system can be search engine, and this search engine is configured to the Search Results that provides relevant with the inquiry that is attended by positional information.In some instances, send the position as the coordinate in the geographic position of the estimation of computing equipment with inquiry.In other example, determine the position according to the content of inquiry.As illustration, near inquiry " call out to my family drycleaner's ", can home position " family " as positional information, and the geographic position that arranges to be identified for " family " that can store according to the user for submit Query.
In some instances, local search system is searched in the corpus of record, and these records are associated with the place with geographic position (for example, business entity or place) separately.For example, each record can be the structured field collection and comprise following field, and this field is used for the position that storage is used for the place of being quoted by this record.In various examples, each record that is used for the corpus of local search system can comprise the geographic position.In some instances, each record is associated with the webpage of being stored by single Information Provider and present.In other words, record can be not separately corresponding to provided by various Information Providers and cross over addressable website, the Internet.Can be based on the information structuring Search Results in the record.
Local search system can use the geographic position with to the Search Results assign weights.For example, search system can access response in many Search Results of inquiry " Pizza ", but can distribute larger weighted value to following Search Results, these Search Results are quoted with nearer position, the position that provides in inquiry or with inquiry.In some instances, based on Search Results with in inquiry or with the search result set that distance is selected weighting of quoting in the geographic position that provides of inquiry.As illustration, can get rid of the Search Results of quoting the position same city not or leave Search Results more than 50 miles from the geographic position from the tabulation of weighting Search Results.
A plurality of other factors (popularity of the query term in the content of for example, storing for Search Results and as by the popularity of the Search Results of the user selection of query search engine) can be revised the weighted value for Search Results.Local search system can be selected one group of response Search Results based on the weighted value of distributing to Search Results.In some instances, local search system only selects to have the Search Results of corresponding telephone number to be used for being contained in group.
Each Search Results can comprise following information, and this message identification is used for the telephone number in corresponding real place and (i) is used for the title in place, (ii) for the physical address in place, the description that (iii) is used for the place, the e-mail address that (iv) is used for the place, website and (iv) any combination of the picture in place that (v) is used for the place.
In frame 214, send one or more Search Results in the Search Results to computing equipment.Can or can send by front-end server (seeing frame 216) Search Results to the direct transmission of computing equipment.In some instances, provide to computing equipment and be confirmed as and inquire about maximally related single Search Results (for example, providing the highest weighting Search Results).In other example, can provide a plurality of Search Results to computing equipment.A plurality of Search Results can be by any combination rank of local search system, front-end server or computing equipment.Rank can comprise the information of sequentially numbering of sign Search Results or identify the information of the score of each Search Results.
In frame 218, computing equipment receives telephone number corresponding to one or more Search Results and one of sign and Search Results Search Results of high rank (for example).For example, when returning single Search Results, sign is used for the telephone number of single Search Results.Return therein in the example of a plurality of Search Results, can identify the telephone number for the Search Results of the highest rank or score.In some instances, all Search Results that send to computing equipment comprise telephone number.In some instances, one or more Search Results in the Search Results does not comprise telephone number, and the telephone number of sign can be used for having the highest rank of corresponding telephone number or the Search Results of score.
In frame 220, the telephone number of computing equipment automatic call sign.For example, can present timer to be used for showing (frame 222) at computing equipment.Computing equipment does not receive user's input of the process interruption (for example, by selecting " cancellation " interface element or physical button) of the telephone number that makes the automatic call sign, the then telephone number of computing equipment call identification if timer expires.In various examples, timer or along counting up to timer expires.In various examples, the time quantum before timer expires is based on the score of the Search Results of remarkable rank (for example, absolute value or with next mark poor of remarkable rank) and change.For example, Displaying timer device and can cry calling for relevant especially Search Results automatic poking not.
In frame 224, the automatic call telephone number comprises that generation shows the prompting that is used for calling telephone number.Prompting can be included in " dialing " button that makes the computing equipment calling telephone number when being selected.For example, in response to sending inquiry, computing equipment can present pop-up box, and this pop-up box has for dialing telephone number or is used for the optional button of user that (for example, removing pop-up box) called out in cancellation.In this example, phone not dialing telephone number does not receive user's input to set up voice communication, but can replace the user display input that need to select dialing button.
In various examples, the automatic call telephone number is included in and shows telephone number, the title that is used for corresponding place and any combination of address on the computing equipment.In some instances, the screen at computing equipment shows single telephone number and the information corresponding with single telephone number.Computing equipment can not show telephone number or the title in other place in such example.
In frame 226, dialing telephone number.If user selection dials button (frame 224) or timer expires and receive user's input (frame 222) of cancelling calling, then can carry out the operation of frame 226.Dialing telephone number can comprise provides a series of numerals (for example, recommending the E.164 telephone number of Plays by telecommunication standardization sector (ITU-T)) in order to set up duplex voice communication with another computerized equipment.In some instances, dialing telephone number comprises by voice-over ip (VoIP) network computing equipment is connected to another computing equipment.
In frame 228, if select cancel button, then show alternatively the telephone number (seeing frame 224) that is used for additional search results.Therefore, if the user determines that he does not want to call out the telephone number by automatic call, then he can select cancel button and check the tabulation of other relevant search result.The user can select any Search Results in the Search Results to call out corresponding telephone number or to check additional information.
In some instances, after selecting cancel button, do not show other Search Results, and from show, remove pop-up box.In various examples, to after date, show other Search Results (frame 228), and the user must select " calling " button with the telephone number of call identification at timer during counting down.Therefore, counting down can be to participate in the period for the selection of calling telephone number.In such example, the user can select " calling " button to prevent from showing other Search Results before timer expires.
In various examples, between the time during in the time when computing equipment provides Search Results to server system and when the computing equipment dialing telephone number, do not receive the further user input at computing equipment.In various examples, between the time during in the time when computing equipment receives one or more Search Results from server system and when dialing telephone number, do not receive the further user input.
Getting back to now the discussion of frame 210, is not the telephone number for the automatic call Search Results if determine inquiry, then can provide inquiry to general search system (being different from local search system), and general search system can determine to respond Search Results.The inquiry in the corpus of record of general search engine system can not all have the document in the geographic position that is associated.In various examples, general search engine system provides a plurality of medium types (for example, video, picture and product) distinctive Search Results.
Although not shown in the swimming lane figure of Fig. 2, can provide the Search Results of being determined by general search system to be used for demonstration to computing equipment.In response to receiving a plurality of Search Results from general search system, computing equipment can show the content that is used for a plurality of Search Results and can not initiate for the process of calling for the telephone number of any Search Results of a plurality of Search Results in the visual depiction of a plurality of Search Results.In fact, telephone number (with the Search Results contrast that can all comprise telephone number that is provided by local search system) can be provided one or more Search Results in a plurality of Search Results.In other words, be confirmed as to make computing equipment to single telephone number telephone calling for the inquiry of automatic call telephone number, and be confirmed as not being that the inquiry for the automatic call telephone number can make computing equipment show the visual tabulation of a plurality of Search Results.
The operation of being carried out by the method for Fig. 2 is quoted from computing equipment forward end server and the inquiry of transmitting to local search system.In some instances, inquiry can change when it is transmitted between these computing equipments.For example, the inquiry of forward end server system transmission can be the numeral that comprises the audio frequency of carrier phrases and query term, front-end server can be transformed into the numeral of audio frequency the text letters numeral words that comprises carrier phrases and query term, and local search system can receive text query, and text inquiry comprises query term and carrier phrases is removed.The literature can be with these a plurality of expressions referred to as " inquiry ".In addition, and in order to be described clearly, the transmission of literature discussion " Search Results " and show the two is even the Search Results of transmission comprises that the demonstration of Search Results comprises the visual depiction of data on screen according to the mechanized data of numerical coding form.
In various examples, frame 218 to frame 226 is carried out by server system call service (for example, GOOGLE VOICE).In other words, computing equipment can send inquires about to be used for by the server system processing, and server system can send to call service the telephone number of sign.Call service can be initiated at computing equipment and corresponding to the call between the equipment of the telephone number that identifies.
In various examples, the concept of describing about the automatic call telephone number in the literature can be applied to other communication form.These other communication form comprise Email, text message sending and receiving, voice mail message, instant messaging and voip call.For example, inquiry "
EmailSenior middle school " the user can see the email application that calls at computing equipment, wherein generating messages and to as the pre-addressing of e-mail address that is used for specific school that will be determined by search system.Therefore, can be from computing equipment to remote server system transmission inquery and position, this remote server system returns e-mail address for one or more Search Results to computing equipment.Computing equipment can generate the Email composer window, wherein with Email to the pre-addressing of Search Results of high rank.
In various examples, Email can comprise the content from inquiry.For example, inquiry "
EmailSenior middle school
MessageSomeone will be late today on class " can cause computing equipment to write to the email message of the e-mail address addressing that is used for specific senior middle school, and comprise that content " someone will be late today on class " is as theme or the text of Email.
In various examples, can be immediately or when the timer of visual depiction expires the automatic transmission Email.In various examples, can show the prompting similar to the prompting among Fig. 3 D, this prompting request is in user's input of writing before the message of specific senior middle school addressing.For example in response to user statement "
TextThe Pizza shop
MessageSpeed is to shop, baloney Pizza Como park " come to carry out similar operations for text message sending and receiving communication form.
In various embodiments, the inquiry that relates to any communication form in the various communication form can comprise computing equipment search local search results.For example, for "
Send a telegraphJohn's cyclery " inquiry can comprise and searching for first for the user of computing equipment and the contact person's who stores tabulation sees if there is any contact name as " John's cyclery " to look into.In some instances, if relevant (for example with the contact person who stores for the user of computing equipment by the Search Results of remote server system sign, if Search Results and the contact person who stores for the user can share telephone number or physical address), then Search Results is can rank higher.
Fig. 3 A to Fig. 3 F is the sample screen shot that shows in the process that is used for the automatic call Search Results.Can present together dialog box 302 with the user interface content that in background, shows (for example, surrounding the zone of the dialog box 302 shown in Fig. 3 A).Can show dialog box 302 for the icon of initiating speech polling in response to user selection.The screenshot capture that shows among Fig. 3 B illustrates the user and has stated " call out Palo Alto I loved Pizza " (yet, can not show this text at the computing equipment screen when the user gives an oral account).
Fig. 3 C illustrates and can present " work " dialog box 306 in response to the oral account inquiry that receives the user.In various examples, computing equipment has sent inquiry to server system after and wait at computing equipment that one or more responds and present " work " dialog box 306 in search inquiry.
In case Fig. 3 D illustrates and has received the dialog box 308 that just presents at computing equipment such as the Search Results in response to speech polling at computing equipment.Dialog box 308 can present the information for single Search Results (for example, with the maximally related Search Results of inquiry).As shown in Fig. 3 D, the user can select " dialing " interface element 310 to dial the telephone number be used to " Pizza that I the am loved " dining room that is positioned at Palo Alto.The user also can select " cancellation " interface element 312 to remove dialog box 308 from show.Dialog box 308 comprises search result content, for example, and Search Results title 314, Search Results address 316 and Search Results telephone number 318.In various examples, dialog box 308 is static, and the user must press and dials button 310 so that calling telephone number 318.
Fig. 3 E and Fig. 3 F illustrate dialog box 320 and dialog box 322, and in these dialog boxes, if user's non-selected cancellation interface element 312 within the time of determining amount, then computing equipment is with dialing telephone number " 650-327-9400 ".In this example, animation counts down timer by being shown in until the time quantum that stayed before with dialing telephone number with the inswept dialog box of new color in the motion clockwise.When timer stops (for example, when screen is stopped by color filling and animation or user when knowing that timer has been finished fully), the computing equipment dialing telephone number.
Fig. 3 G to Fig. 3 H is for the screenshot capture of submitting automatically the process that the user of computing equipment is redirected in response to the oral account of inquiry to.In Fig. 3 G, the demonstration of the tabulation of Search Results is shown at equipment.In this example, the user has given an oral account term " General Motors " in the equipment as inquiry, and the result who enumerates is the result who is determined in response to inquiry.The first result 330 points to the link of General Motor corporation (GM) website.It is correctly to mate with the quite complete of inquiring about, and provides result's system to have determined that via various mechanism it is high quality results.For example, system's inquiry of can having observed first submit or other users of similar inquiry frequent (percentage of time with respect to other result is high) click this result.System can have realized that also the inquiry according to expectation is navigation, and therefore to find particular station as target, this is different from the general answer of finding problem.In addition, system can notice for the URL of website closely related with inquiry, and therefore to make website more may be expectation destination for the user.Determine that by system other result (such as result 336) is still less relevant.
Can be that therefore the search system that is positioned at the server system of apparatus remote can be returned the result with code, this code be used for permission equipment automatically being redirected to the General Motors login page.This code is in the drawings by two user interface elements 332 and 334 reflections.At first, showing counts down reminds frame 332, and this frame reminding user equipment will be redirected (wherein digital per second changed until redirected the appearance) downwards to login page in second at X.Prompting frame 332 cannot be by user selection.Secondly, the form with the optional button of user provides cancellation control 334.If the user selected control 334 before the end that counts down, then can from show, remove two UI elements 332 and 334, and Search Results will shrink in the regional folded around that was occupied in the past by element, thereby so that the user can see the more Search Results in the Search Results.In addition, if think action indication that hypothesis user's cancellation is redirected indifferent to the first result be reasonably, then can from show, remove alternatively the first result.The user can realize analog result by saying words " cancellation " simply, thereby so that can make options here hands-free, only available in the voice environment.
The user also can select to fetch by the chain that click to be used for the first result with typical way and be brought to the first result, and therefore need not to wait for and count down.Yet, directly take the user to login page and need not still to allow user selection to withdraw from the advantage that automatically is redirected from user's artificial input but count down to provide.In various examples, mobile phone may be invisible to the user.Therefore, can for example count down with next can the output of synthetic speech statement " you are redirected to " General Motor corporation (GM) website ", say " cancellation " to replace the tabulation of hearing Search Results " by mobile device with listening.
Fig. 3 H shows in succession and shows, these demonstrations relate to carrier phrases automatically being redirected to the website of at least part of use sign website.Show that 340 show screen display and inquiry by user's oral account of mobile computing device the time.Inquiry comprises signal of carrier symbol and parameter, and this signal of carrier symbol sign is the website that is directed to, and this parameter is with in the searched content of this website.The user can be here by the search button on the presses, and then presses the microphone button and formulate action with indication by oral account rather than by the intention of keying in logging data.
Demonstration 342 shows the direct result that is returned in the oral account input by system responses and does not first return search result list to the user.Particularly, the first words of understanding systematicly (for example, comparing by the white list with term) oral account inquiry is the carrier phrases for the reservation of following classification, and this classification relates to automatically being redirected to the website.The wikipedia website will be in this tabulation, because it is special in inquire about the website that is popular on the net for the user of acquired information.Here, content is the summary content from login page, and shows optional button, thereby so that if the user comes back for moce information then they can be taken to actual login page.Can generate the summary content by template being applied to specific webpage in some instances.In this example, many wikipedia pages are followed common format, thereby so that can be to extract certain content in order to produce summary information from the wikipedia page with System Programming.In other example, system can be (for example, come by the value of checking the DOM Document Object Model tissue and/or being used for the specific html tag of the page) analyze the layout of the page, and can be by various rule application are generated the information of format in such information rather than applying template.
Fig. 4 is the screenshot capture that shows in the process that is used for the automatic call Search Results.Particularly, can show dialog box 402 in response to the Search Results that computing equipment receives in response to inquiry.Dialog box 402 shows about three Search Results 404,406 and 408 information.In this illustration, the Search Results 404 that computing equipment is identified for " Pizza that I am loved " dining room of Palo Alto is the Search Results of the most remarkable rank in the Search Results 404,406 and 408.Therefore, initiated the process in my loved Pizza dining room of automatic call Palo Alto.Particularly, animation timer 410 is filled in direction from left to right.Basically large about the time that timer 410 is filled fully, with dialing telephone number 410.

More specifically, the first computing equipment 602 comprises inquiry manager 612.Inquiry manager 612 is carried out the operation that is used for receiving inquiry and transmits the inquiry that receives to server system 606.For example, inquiry manager 612 can make search query box 502 and speech polling button 508 be shown on the mobile device.Inquiry manager 612 can receive the input of text or spoken user and to the inquiry of server system 606 transmission based on the input that receives.
Server system 606 comprises location identifier 614.Location identifier 614 signs are used for the interested position of the inquiry 604 of reception.Location identifier 614 can be carried out this sign by determining the words corresponding with the position in the inquiry 604.Location identifier 614 additionally or alternatively can by identify the first computing equipment 602 as being determined by the first computing equipment 602 and identifying interested position for the inquiry 604 that receives to the geographic position of the estimation of server system 606 transmission.
Speech recognition device 624 receives the numerical information of the audio frequency of representative record, and converts numerical information to text query.For example, inquiry 604 can represent the user's of the first computing equipment 602 the audio recording of voice.Speech recognition device 624 can be translated into audio recording the text representation of determining at probability of user's voice.
Server system 606 comprises query type identifier 616.Query type identifier 616 determines that whether inquiries are to make not automatic call telephone number and replace the type of display of search results of computing equipment be used to the type or be used for that makes the computing equipment automatic call be used for the telephone number of Search Results.In some instances, be provided for making the inquiry of the automatic dialing telephone number of computing equipment to the first search engine 620, and send other inquiry to the second search engine 622.
The exemplary components that is used for the type of definite inquiry is carrier phrases identifier 618.Carrier phrases identifier 618 determines whether the inquiry 604 that receives comprises carrier phrases.For example, and as mentioned more specifically as described in, the carrier phrases identifier can determine whether the first words of inquiring about comprises words " calling ".In some instances, if inquiry is corresponding to the place title, even then inquiry comprises that words " calling ", carrier phrases identifier 618 still are not designated inquiry and comprises carrier phrases.For example, query type identifier 616 can identify inquiry and " calls out that bit machine personage " as the inquiry of the computer repairment enterprise that is used for " calling out that bit machine personage " by name rather than make the inquiry of mobile computing device automatic call telephone number.
Based on as the type of the inquiry determined by query type identifier 616 send inquiry to the first search engine 620 or the second search engine 622.The first search engine 620 can be local search engine 620, and this local search engine 620 receives inquiry and position, and returns the Search Results in response to inquiry.As hereinafter more specifically as described in, can by a plurality of signal weightings are determined the response Search Results.Generally speaking, local search engine 620 can retrain the result, thereby so that the Search Results that shows to the user in the geographic distance of determining by the position of location identifier 614 signs.In other words, the Search Results for Minnesotan Pizza shop can not be returned in the inquiry that is used for " calling out Palo Alto Pizza shop ", and this is because the Minnesota State is more farther than 50 miles example distance.
The second search engine 622 can be the general content search engine.The general content search engine can return the result relevant with the position that is identified by location identifier 614, but the result can be not limited to geography.For example, the inquiry that is used for " Pizza shop " can be returned the Search Results corresponding with the webpage that is used for the following at the first computing equipment 602 during at Palo Alto: the Human Resource Department, (ii) that (i) is used for national Pizza shop be in Pizza shop, the Minnesota State of news and (iii) the Pizza shop approaching with the geographic position of the estimation of the first computing equipment 602 recently.Therefore, Search Results can be not limited to the position.In addition, the second search engine 622 can return with by Search Results corresponding to the webpage of various Information Providers master control, and the first search engine can return the Search Results corresponding with the webpage (for example, the webpage in the catalogue in " place " that have separately corresponding geographic position) of being stored by single Information Provider.
Search result rank device 626 can be based on various signal 628-636 to search result rank.The operation of search result rank device 626 can by: (i) the first search engine 620 (for example, local search engine) is carried out, 606 couples of results that returned by the first search engine of (ii) server system carry out or (iii) carried out by the first computing equipment 602.For example, server system 606 can receive the tabulation that joins separately the Search Results of (for example, distance-based and content) with various Fractional correlations from the first search engine 620.Search result rank device 626 can be revised these marks based on signal 628-636.
Business hours signal 628 can be used for to comprising the larger weighting of those Search Results of following information by search result rank device 626, and this information is indicated the office of doing business at present of corresponding place.For example, be at 1:30 in morning if indivedual inquiry " is called out the Pizza shop ", then the search result rank device can be to the larger weighting of Search Results of those enterprises of being used for current business.Therefore, more the possibility automatic call is for the telephone number of following enterprise for mobile computing device 602, and the individual is with answerphone in this enterprise.
The mark for Search Results is revised in the correction to the automatic call process of supplying based on the user in some instances.For example, the user can inquire about " calling out the Pizza shop " when the user is positioned at Palo Alto.User's mobile phone can automatic call my loved Pizza, but the user can stop automatic call (for example, by selecting " cancellation " button).As response, the user can: (i) typing is newly inquired about (for example, " call out to Frank Pizza ") or (ii) is selected to be used in response to selecting " cancellation " button to show the telephone number of " Frank's Pizza " Search Results.The Search Results corresponding with next telephone number that dials can be higher than original " calling out the Pizza shop " inquiry weighting.
In various examples, in response to the inquiry that is independent of the automatic call process, the mark for Search Results is revised in call based on Client-initiated.For example, the user can inquire about " Pizza shop " and present tabulation for the Search Results of the webpage of various contents relevant with the Pizza shop to the user.It can be the link for dialing telephone number by one of Search Results.Even this link of user selection can make Search Results be supported more in the subsequent query that the automatic call process is occurred---may not yet come display of search results in response to the inquiry that causes the automatic call process.
The Search Results marking that user search signal 636 can make 626 pairs of search result rank devices select in response to user search is higher.Continue to use the upper example of the inquiry of user wherein " Pizza shop ", the user can select a plurality of Search Results in the Search Results to check the corresponding webpage (the in some instances any telephone number of non-selected calling) for Search Results.These Search Results or the content that identifies in Search Results can be than higher in response to other Search Results weighting of the inquiry that is used for the automatic call telephone number.For example, if the tabulation of the Search Results that shows comprises two Search Results for different Palo Alto Pizzas shop, and user selection is used for the Search Results in one of local Pizza shop, then is used for the telephone number of selected Search Results (the Search Results mark equates) when the user who inquires about " calling Pizza " in Palo Alto can see his telephone automatic calling aspect other later on.
Social networks signal 638 can make search result rank device 626 based on social network data to user feedback 632 weightings.Social network data can comprise the social networks figure that identifies the following: (i) have the individual of acquaintance relation and the intensity that (ii) concerns.For example, if the user is another user on the social networks " good friend " or " colleague ", then can form the acquaintance relation.If the user in another user's electronic address book, if perhaps a user calls out or send Email to another user, then also can form the acquaintance relation.Intensity in the relation between the user can be based on the communication type between the user and the frequency of communicating by letter.The intensity of (for example, the user is " good friend " or " good friend's good friend ") and the annexation of can in the social networks figure, how far being separated by based on the user at the social networks between two users " distance ".
Social network data 638 can be used for to user feedback 632 weightings by carrying out with the more approaching user of inquiring user in the social networks higher.For example, the data of " good friend " of inquiring user can be weighted the highest, and the data of " good friend's good friend's the good friend " of inquiring user can be weighted still less.Therefore, if the many good friends among the good friend of inquiring user have inquired about " Pizza of calling out Frank ", then inquiring user can more may see him call response in " calling Pizza " inquiry and automatic call Frank's Pizza rather than the Pizza (mark that is used for each corresponding Search Results is equating aspect other) that I am loved.
Dial the computing equipment that device identifier 640 signs are used for the automatic call telephone number.Dialing device identifier 614 can check for the first computing equipment 602 and the setting of storing or the content that can check inquiry 604.As illustration, suppose that the individual uses laptop computer signing in to search engine with user account, and be used for search engine indicating is set user account be associated with telephone number for mobile phone.The user can key in inquiry to the search box that is used for search engine and " call out the Pizza shop " and press the typing button.Can send inquiry to server system, and the server system relevant search result that can be identified for inquiring about.Laptop computer may not calling telephone number, and perhaps the user can prefer to the call on his mobile phone, and therefore can use mobile device (for example, the second computing equipment 610) to finish calling.
For example, server system can be to mobile phone 610 transmission information, and this information makes mobile device 610 automatic calls be used for the telephone number of relevant search result.For example, mobile phone can show one of various combinations of the screenshot capture among Fig. 3 D to Fig. 4.This demonstration can be attended by prompting (for example, phone ringing).In various examples, server system is initiated at mobile phone 610 and for the calling between the telephone number of Search Results.In such example, do not show the screenshot capture among Fig. 3 D-Fig. 4, and phone ring as usual.When answerphone, the user can hear the opposite side ring or can hear voice suggestion (for example, saying " the Pizza shop that you is connected to Frank ").
In various examples, server system or the first computing equipment 602 comprise significance determiner 642.The significance determiner can be identified for the mark of remarkable Search Results and compare how by force with next the most remarkable Search Results.If the most remarkable Search Results is more than threshold value or differ definite number percent or mark, then can automatic call be used for the telephone number of remarkable Search Results.If the most remarkable Search Results has the mark that approaches with the mark that is used for other Search Results, then can in tabulation, provide Search Results to be used for by the user selection of mobile phone 602 (and not the most remarkable Search Results of automatic call).For example, the inquiry that is used for " call out me loved Pizza " can more may cause automatic call than the inquiry that is used for " calling Pizza ".Therefore, the user can be at corresponding Search Results by score more impossible computing equipment automatic call telephone number that allows them during apparently higher than alternative Search Results.
The first computing equipment 602 can comprise automatic calling unit 644.Automatic calling unit 644 can receive single Search Results and formulate to be used for automatic call be used for single Search Results telephone number process or alternatively receive a plurality of Search Results and formulate and be used for the process of telephone number of Search Results that automatic call is used for the most remarkable rank of a plurality of Search Results.Automatic calling unit 644 can comprise timer 646, and this timer is formulated the delay before the first computing equipment 602 dialing telephone numbers.Timer 646 can provide visual depiction, for example, animation sequence, this animation sequence be shown in that timer expires and dialing telephone number before the remaining time.Automatic calling unit also can comprise and dials prompting device 648.Dialing prompting device 648 can display reminding, and the prompting that wherein shows is associated with following function, and these functions allow the user of the first computing equipment 602 to input dialing telephone number with the one action user.
