Specific embodiment
I. it summarizes
This disclosure relates to provide the method and system of noise reduction and high dynamic range in three-dimensional and multiple views camera system.
Digital photography quality (especially for user equipment, such as, cell phone camera) may be subjected to small-sized sensing
The limitation of device and aperture size.This characteristic can limit can be with captured photon numbers, this may be scaled up by passing
" shot noise (shot noise) " or the random variation in photon numbers that sensor pixel absorbs.Increase shutter length to reduce
This noise, but to be carried out with the possibility of increased motion blur at original.
Another limitation is the low-dynamic range of cell phone camera image.When in same scene there are it is non-be always on it is non-
Often when dark object, the dynamic range of sensor pixel may capture in bright image-region and dark image-region with being unable to fully
Details, so as to cause pixel supersaturation or undersaturation.The camera use of better quality can read bigger bit-depth figure
The sensor of picture, but they are still limited.
Possible solution for both of these problems is continuous shooting (burst photography), wherein camera is quick
Ground shooting N opens photos to replace shooting single photo.Then it is N number of these to be merged by using one of various algorithms algorithm

Such as, Block- matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) or non local device.It is appreciated that various other noise-removed technologies and algorithm be it is possible,
And various other noise-removed technologies and algorithm is contemplated herein.
Some pixel coders indicated using 8 the brightness of each pixel do so referred to as low-dynamic range (LDR) at
Picture.Therefore, 256 grades of brightness can only be supported.However, real-world scene is usually shown than appropriate table can be imaged with LDR
Show the brightness of more wide dynamic range.For example, the scene before window of the individual station in dark room may include the non-region being always on
Very dark region.However, capturing the image of this scene using LDR imaging can cause based on the exposure for capturing image
Light length and be lost in the details in bright area and/or dark areas.
Short exposure length can lead to the reasonable accurate expression of the bright area of scene, but dark areas can be made under-exposed.
On the contrary, long exposure length can lead to the reasonable accurate expression of dark areas, but bright area overexposure can be made.In example field
Jing Zhong, if exposure length is too long, the feature in room may moderately expose, but feature outside window may whitewash.
But if exposure length is too short, feature outside window may seem normally, but the feature in room may be dimmed.This
Any one of a little results are all undesirable.For some scenes, single exposure length may be not present, the single exposure length
Degree can generate the image of the details indicated in bright area and dark areas with acceptable details captured.
In the scene before window of the individual station in dark room, the first image can be captured with the first exposure length
Frame, this can suitably expose the sky of scene and cloud part, but may result in the inappropriate exposure of people and ambient room
(for example, under-exposed).The second picture frame can be captured with the second exposure length, this can suitably expose people and surrounding room
Between, but may result in the sky of scene and the inappropriate exposure (for example, overexposure) of cloud part.
Optionally, as illustrated in frame 314, controller 150 can be operated so that high dynamic range (HDR) processing to be applied to become
The image stack of shape and/or one or more output image.It, can be by the first figure of image stack by using aforementioned exemplary
As the pixel in the pixel of the correct exposure of frame and the second picture frame of image stack with the inappropriate exposure in the first picture frame
Corresponding combination of pixels.For example, by the sky of the correct exposure from the first picture frame and cloud part and the second figure can be come from
As the people of the correct exposure of frame and room part combine.Composograph generated can reasonably well replicate the bright area of scene
With the details of dark areas.
Pixel of the combination from the image captured can be implemented in various ways to form composograph.For example,
The combination pixel-by-pixel of image can be formed by distributing weight to the pixel of each image according to the brightness of such as pixel.So
It afterwards, can include that specific pixel is excluded in final image or from final image by specific pixel according to its weight.Alternative
Two or more LDR image can be combined into HDR image by ground, then can be carried out tone mapping to HDR image, be made
Its brightness is obtained to fall into the range corresponding to the display capabilities of convention video output device.However, instead of the embodiments herein, also
Other methods of pixel of the combination from the image captured can be used.
In some embodiments, it can be executed based on the picture frame captured by using Auto exposure bracketing (AEB)
HDR processing.That is, the image stack of deformation may include the picture frame with the range of length of exposure.In this way, can be based on
The region of the correct exposure of the multiple images frame come in the image stack of self-deformation exports image to provide HDR.In some implementations
In example, continuous shooting image data may include the picture frame captured in 18 exposure values (EV).Range is surrounded in other exposures
It is possible.
The processing of HDR or " similar HDR " are applied to the image stack of deformation and/or export the other way energy of image
HDR is enough provided and exports image.For example, exposure, brightness, gamma, color or the other sides of adjustable output image
Face, to reduce overexposure and under-exposed region.In this scene, the shadow of output image can be enhanced, and
It can reduce the high brightness of output image.
In addition or as an alternative, tone mapping can be carried out to one or more output image to reduce output image
Dynamic range or contrast, while keeping local contrast.The overexposure and exposure for reducing image is contemplated herein
Insufficient region, while keeping the other way of image detail.
In the exemplary embodiment, controller 150 can be operated to analyze image data so that basis has similar characteristic
" segment " of image pixel is grouped the pixel in each picture frame, specifies, and/or separates.As an example, can analyze
Picture frame is to determine phase according to one or more picture characteristics (such as, pixel intensity, color, tone, shape, edge etc.)
Like segment or region.For example, the pixel region (for example, sky) with high brightness can be associated with the first segment, and
It can be associated with the second segment with the pixel region (for example, ground) compared with low-light level.In some embodiments, single image
Frame may include dozens of, up to a hundred, thousands of or more segments.
It can be according to mode segment continuous shooting image data similar with aforesaid way.In this way, continuous shooting image data can be with
Including the picture frame with the segment with similar shape and position in respective image frame.By pair between respective image frame
Answer segment to match generally can be than searching for faster in the pixel of entire quantity.
Therefore, any image processing operations described herein can be implemented based on the basis of every segment.I.e., it is possible to be based on
The correspondence segment alignment of at least one image pair being determined to, at least one corrects homography function.Furthermore, it is possible to pass through by
The relative position of similar segment in the picture frame of stereo pairs is compared to determine stereoscopic parallax.Furthermore it is possible to pass through
The correspondence segment of each picture frame of the image stack of deformation is compared to implement continuous shooting Denoising Algorithm.Further,
HDR processing may include: the segment of the correct exposure of the various picture frames for the image stack that combination carrys out self-deformation.
In some embodiments, the image procossing based on processing segment can be on the basis of every pixel in image processing method
Face provides the improvement to speed and picture quality.For example, segment image procossing can reduce or eliminate " afterimage ", fuzzy graph
As artifact, and/or the artifact of the edge on segment boundary.
