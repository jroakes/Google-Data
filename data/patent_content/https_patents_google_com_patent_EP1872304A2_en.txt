Definitions
- the present invention concerns helping advertisers to create ads and manage ad campaigns.
- the present invention concerns helping advertisers by creating a business network where advertisers and third parties specializing in ad creatives and/or ad campaign management can form business relationships and/or collaborate.
- Interactive advertising provides opportunities for advertisers to target their ads to a receptive audience. That is, targeted ads are more likely to be useful to end users since the ads may be relevant to a need inferred from some user activity (e.g., relevant to a user's search query to a search engine, relevant to content in a document requested by the user, etc.)
- Query keyword relevant advertising such as the AdWords advertising system by Google of Mountain View, CA.
- content-relevant advertising systems have been proposed. Such systems serve ads relevant to the content of a document, such as a Web page for example.
- AdSense from Google of Mountain View, CA is an example of an ad serving system that uses content targeted ads.
- Simple text ads have been common in targeted ad serving systems. Such simple text ads have been popular with many smaller advertisers since they are easy to author. Indeed, it is believed by some that a key driver of the success of keyword-based text-advertising was the ease with which short text ads can be created.
- ad delivery systems offer richer ad formats than traditional short text ads, advertisers will likely need a way to efficiently request assistance with ad creation. This poses a problem when ad formats become richer and heavier.
- Authoring compelling ad creatives becomes something that may require specialized talents. It would therefore be useful to help advertisers make full and effective use of ad delivery systems that serve ads having more sophisticated formatting and content.
- An online ad business environment helps connect advertisers with ad service providers (also called agents or advisors) who can meet their needs for more complex and sophisticated ad creatives.
- the online ad business network may use a job listing board where advertisers can enter request for assistance and agent can view them.
- the business network may also include an agent directory where agents can post their profiles and services and advertisers can view them.
- agents and agent can contact each other through contact operations available in the business network, and enter into business relationships.
- a payment from an advertiser to an agent may be made via the business network. The amount of compensation paid to the agent by the business network need not be equal to the amount of payment received by the advertiser.
- One embodiment consistent with the present invention provides a method (or means) that (a) provides a first interface for allowing agents to create and edit a listing, (b) stores a plurality of listings created via the first interface, and (c) provides a second interface for allowing advertisers to view the listings.
- One embodiment consistent with the present invention provides a method (or means) that (a) provides a first interface for allowing advertisers to create and edit an advertising job listing, (b) stores a plurality of job listings created via the first interface, and (c) provides a second interface for allowing agents to view the job listings.
- One embodiment consistent with the present invention provides a method (or means) that (a) provides a first interface for allowing agents to store preliminary adverting campaign information, (b) stores a plurality of sets of preliminary advertising campaign information stored via the first interface, and (c) provides a second interface for allowing advertisers to view at least one of the sets of preliminary advertising campaign information.
- One embodiment consistent with the present invention provides a method (or means) for use in an environment in which a business network facilitates business relationships or transactions between advertisers and agents for authoring advertisements and/or managing ad campaigns, in which the business network provides at least one of (A) compensation to the agent for the work done and (B) a subsidy to the advertiser.

- the present invention may involve novel methods, apparatus, message formats, and/or data structures for providing an online ad business network where advertisers and third party service providers can enter into business relationships and/or collaborate.
- the following description is presented to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular applications and their requirements.
- the following description of embodiments consistent with the present invention provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present invention to the precise form disclosed.
- Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles set forth below may be applied to other embodiments and applications.
- Online ads may have various intrinsic features. Such features may be specified by an application and/or an advertiser. These features are referred to as "ad features" below.
- ad features may include a title line, ad text, and an embedded link.
- ad features may include images, executable code, and an embedded link.
- ad features may include one or more of the following: text, a link, an audio file, a video file, an image file, executable code, embedded information, etc.
- Serving parameters may include, for example, one or more of the following: features of (including information on) a document on which, or with which, the ad was served, a search query or search results associated with the serving of the ad, a user characteristic (e.g., their geographic location, the language used by the user, the type of browser used, previous page views, previous behavior, user account, any Web cookies used by the system, etc.), a host or affiliate site (e.g., America Online, Google, Yahoo) that initiated the request, an absolute position of the ad on the page on which it was served, a position (spatial or temporal) of the ad relative to other ads served, an absolute size of the ad, a size of the ad relative to other ads, a color of the ad, a number of other ads
- serving parameters may be extrinsic to ad features, they may be associated with an ad as serving conditions or constraints. When used as serving conditions or constraints, such serving parameters are referred to simply as “serving constraints" (or “targeting criteria"). For example, in some systems, an advertiser may be able to target the serving of its ad by specifying that it is only to be served on weekdays, no lower than a certain position, only to users in a certain location, etc. As another example, in some systems, an advertiser may specify that its ad is to be served only if a page or search query includes certain keywords or phrases. As yet another example, in some systems, an advertiser may specify that its ad is to be served only if a document being served includes certain topics or concepts, or falls under a particular cluster or clusters, or some other classification or classifications.
- Ad information may include any combination of ad features, ad serving constraints, information derivable from ad features or ad serving constraints (referred to as “ad derived information”), and/or information related to the ad (referred to as “ad related information”), as well as an extension of such information (e.g., information derived from ad related information).
- the ratio of the number of selections (e.g., clickthroughs) of an ad to the number of impressions of the ad (i.e., the number of times an ad is rendered) is defined as the "selection rate" (or "clickthrough rate") of the ad.
- selection rate or "clickthrough rate”
- a "conversion" is said to occur when a user consummates a transaction related to a previously served ad. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, it may be the case that a conversion occurs when a user clicks on an ad, is referred to the advertiser's Web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that Web page.
- a conversion may be defined as a user being shown an ad, and making a purchase on the advertiser's Web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days).
- a conversion may be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Website, viewing at least a certain number of Web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Website or Web page, registering on a Website, etc.
- user actions don't indicate a consummated purchase they may indicate a sales lead, although user actions constituting a conversion are not limited to this. Indeed, many other definitions of what constitutes a conversion are possible.
- conversion rate The ratio of the number of conversions to the number of impressions of the ad (i.e., the number of times an ad is rendered) is referred to as the "conversion rate.” If a conversion is defined to be able to occur within a predetermined time since the serving of an ad, one possible definition of the conversion rate might only consider ads that have been served more than the predetermined time in the past.
- a "document” is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product.
- a document may be a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, etc.
- the files may be of any type, such as text, audio, image, video, etc.
- Parts of a document to be rendered to an end user can be thought of as "content" of the document.
- a document may include "structured data” containing both content (words, pictures, etc.) and some indication of the meaning of that content (for example, e-mail fields and associated data, HTML tags and associated data, etc.)
- Ad spots in the document may be defined by embedded information or instructions.
- a common document is a Web page.
- Web pages often include content and may include embedded information (such as meta information, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript, etc.).
- a document has a unique, addressable, storage location and can therefore be uniquely identified by this addressable location.
- a universal resource locator is a unique address used to access information on the Internet.
- Document information may include any information included in the document, information derivable from information included in the document (referred to as “document derived information”), and/or information related to the document (referred to as “document related information”), as well as an extensions of such information (e.g., information derived from related information).
- document derived information is a classification based on textual content of a document.
- document related information include document information from other documents with links to the instant document, as well as document information from other documents to which the instant document links.
- Content from a document may be rendered on a "content rendering application or device".
- content rendering applications include an Internet browser (e.g., Explorer or Netscape), a media player (e.g., an MP3 player, a Realnetworks streaming audio file player, etc.), a viewer (e.g., an Abobe Acrobat pdf reader), etc.
- a "content owner” is a person or entity that has some property right in the content of a document.
- a content owner may be an author of the content.
- a content owner may have rights to reproduce the content, rights to prepare derivative works of the content, rights to display or perform the content publicly, and/or other proscribed rights in the content.
- a content server might be a content owner in the content of the documents it serves, this is not necessary.
- User information may include user behavior information and/or user profile information.
- E-mail information may include any information included in an e-mail (also referred to as "internal e-mail information”), information derivable from information included in the e-mail and/or information related to the e-mail, as well as extensions of such information (e.g., information derived from related information).
- An example of information derived from e-mail information is information extracted or otherwise derived from search results returned in response to a search query composed of terms extracted from an e-mail subject line.
- Examples of information related to e-mail information include e-mail information about one or more other e-mails sent by the same sender of a given e-mail, or user information about an e-mail recipient.
- Information derived from or related to e-mail information may be referred to as "external e-mail information.”
- Embodiments consistent with the present invention may be used in the context of an online advertising delivery system, such as AdWord or AdSense from Google for example. ⁇ 4.3 EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS

It 120 may also include other pertinent information and functions to help all parties to reach agreements and conduct business. Properties and functions that may be part of an exemplary online ad business network 120 will be introduced below.
- FIG. 2 is a bubble diagram of exemplary operations, which may form a part of the online ad business network, and which may be performed in a manner consistent with the present invention, as well as information that may be used and/or generated by such operations.
- an exemplary ad business network may store job listings 220 and/or agent information 245.
- the exemplary system may support contact operations 205, advertiser user interface operations 210, job listing interface operations 215, job listing view operations 225, agent user interface operations 230, job routing operations 235, agent directory viewing operations 240, and agent information interface operations 250.
- Advertisers 110 may interface with the system via the advertiser user interface operations 210 as indicated by access point 211.
- Agents 130 may interface with the system via the agent user interface operations 230 as indicated by access point 231.
- advertiser 110 and agent 130 inputs to the system, and system outputs to the advertisers 110 and agents 130, may be accomplished through the advertiser user interface 210 and agent user interface 230, respectively.
- the job listing interface operations 215 may be used to allow advertisers 110 to create, edit, and/or view a job listing (e.g., a request for assistance in creating an ad, or manage an ad campaign according to their needs).
- the job listing information 220 can be entered and managed via the job listing interface operations 215.
- the job listing information 220 may contain various requests made by advertisers such as, request for quotes, request for proposals, open offers, etc.
- the job listing view operations 225 may be used to allow agents 130 to view (and perhaps respond to) the job listing information 220. Therefore, the agents 130 may inspect the job opportunities posted by the advertisers 110 and take steps to enter into a business relationship with advertisers.
- the agent information interface operations 250 may be used to allow agents 130 to create, view, and/or edit information about themselves or their agency.
- the agent information 245 can be entered and managed via the agent information interface 250.
- the agent information 245 may contain a directory of agents with pertinent information regarding their services.
- the agent information 245 may contain data about the agents 130 such as, for example, services offered, number of clients served, length of time providing services, customer feedback, ranking, amount of money managed (e.g., per ad or ad campaign), number of employees, one or more performance metrics, etc.
- the agent information may also include, for example, location of agent or agency, contact information, portfolio information, etc.
- the agent directory viewing operations 240 may be used by advertisers 110 to view the agent information 245. Therefore, the advertisers 110 may inspect information about available agents 130, such as services offered, qualifications, experience, etc.
- Contact operations 205 may be used to facilitate communications between the agents 130 and advertisers 110.
- FIG. 3 is a bubble diagram of exemplary operations, which may form a part of an online ad business network, and which may be performed in a manner consistent with the present invention, as well as information that may be used and/or generated by such operations.
- an exemplary online ad business network may further store offer information 305, acceptance information 310, preliminary ad information 330, final ad information 350, and/or contract information 355.
- the exemplary system may further include contract formation determination operations 315, ad review operations 325, preliminary ad information entry and editing operations 335, and accounting/billing operations 345.
- advertisers 110 may interface with the system via the advertiser user interface 210 as indicated by access point 211 and agents 130 may interface with the system via the agent user interface 230 as indicated by access point 231.
- advertiser 110 and agent 130 inputs to the system, and system outputs to the advertisers 110 and agents 130, may be accomplished through the advertiser user interface 210 and agent user interface 230, respectively.
- the offer information 305 may contain information about offers from either an agent 130 or an advertiser 110.
- Offer information 305 may include, for example, compensation the advertiser is willing to pay, compensation required by the agent, specifics of the requested ad or ad campaign, specifics of when various work is to be done, etc.
- the acceptance information 310 may include information indicating that an advertiser 110 or agent 130 intends or wants to accept an offer. For instance, an advertiser 110 might accept or decline an agent's offer, or provide a counter-offer. Similarly, the agent 130 might accept or decline an advertiser's offer, or may provide a counter-offer.
- the contract formation determination operations 315 may use the offer information 305 and the acceptance information 310 to determine whether or not a contract between an advertiser and agent has been formed. If contract formation determination operations 315 have determined that a contract has been formed, they 315 may update the contract information 355.
- the contract information 355 may contain information about a contract. Contract information 355 may include, for example, the parties to the contract, when the contract was formed, compensation, time for performance, conditions to performance, other terms of a contract, etc.
- the ad review operations 325 may be used by advertisers 110 to view (and possibly approve, annotate, edit, etc.) preliminary ad information submitted by agents 130. Also the ad review operations 325 may be used by the advertisers 110 to examine final ad information.
- the preliminary ad information 330 may contain preliminary ad information (also referred to as "proto ad accounts") submitted by the agents 130 for the advertisers to review. In at least some embodiments consistent with the present invention, these proto ad accounts are not live — that is, they are not available to be served to end users.
- the preliminary ad information entry and editing operations 335 may be used by the agents to enter their work in the preliminary ad information 330, view their work, view advertiser 110 edits or annotations of their work, and/or edit proto account information if necessary.
- the preliminary ad information 330 may be saved as final ad information 350 (e.g., using ad review operations 325).
- the final ad information 350 may contain the final ad campaign approved and agreed upon by the advertisers and agents and may contain such information as account information, campaign information, ad creatives, targeting information, offers for action (e.g., impression, selection, conversion), budgets, etc.
- advertiser payment for agent services and/or agent compensation for such services may take place via the online ad authoring and campaign management business network 120 (referred to simply as "the business network 120" below).
- the business network 120 may provide compensation to the appropriate agent.
- the compensation provided to the agent may be determined using the payment by the advertiser, and/or may be determined using one or more other factors, such as ad campaign performance or performance improvement for example.
- the compensation paid to the agent may be equal to, or substantially equal to, the payment received from the advertiser.
- the business network 120 would act like a "conduit" through which payment passes from the advertiser to the agent.
- the compensation paid to the agent may be less than or more than the payment received from the advertiser.
- the business network 120 subsidizes the payment, likely with the belief that it will recoup the subsidy (e.g., from an increase in ad serving revenues, from a payment from a separate ad serving entity, etc.).
- the business network 120 might totally subsidize the cost, in which case the advertiser would pay nothing. Indeed, in at least one embodiment consistent with the present invention, the business network 120 might in fact pay the advertiser (e.g., in addition to the agent). This allows the business network 120 to grow its network in the belief that it will recoup this payment to the advertiser.
- the payment of such a subsidy may be limited to certain situations (e.g., for an advertiser with a large, preferable committed advertising budget). If the compensation paid to the agent is less than the payment received from the advertiser, this could be thought of providing compensation to the business network 120 for matching the advertiser and agent.
- the compensation to the agent paid by the business network 120 may include multiple components.
- one component of the compensation may be a fixed percentage of the amount charged to (paid by) the advertiser.
- Another component, or an alternative component, of the compensation could be a fixed or flat fee.
- Another component, or an alternative component, of the compensation may be a variable component, such as a bonus determined using a performance or a performance improvement of the advertising campaign.
- performance of an ad campaign may be in expressed in terms of one or more of impressions, selections, conversions, revenue, expected revenue, etc.
- Performance improvement may be determined with respect to a previous ad campaign of the advertiser, or some other baseline (e.g., an aggregate of (e.g., all) other ad campaigns). In this way, such a variable component of the compensation to the agent may reflect the value that the agent has given to the advertiser (and/or to the ad serving system).
- the time at which the business network 120 compensates the agent may be substantially concurrent with, or just after, the advertiser makes its payment.
- the business network 120 may provide some or all components of compensation to the agent before the advertiser makes its payment.
- the business network 120 may provide some or all components of compensation to the agent substantially after the advertiser makes its payment.
- the business network 120 could provide a stream of payments to the agent (e.g., based on performance or performance increase of the ad campaign). Indeed, it is possible for the agent to pay the business network 120 in exchange for the right to such (e.g., potential) future payments.
- the business network 120 may determine compensation and time compensation payments to agents uniformly across all advertisers and agents. Alternatively, the business network 120 may determine compensation differently, and/or time compensation payments differently, for different advertisers, different agents, and/or different advertiser-agent pairs.
- the business network 120 may subsidize, to some extent, the Advertiser's payment to the Agent (e.g., compensation to agent > payment received from advertiser).
- the business network 120 may provide such subsidies with the expectation that it (or an affiliated ad serving network) will more than make up the difference in increased revenues due to increased impressions, selections, and/or conversions.
- Such a subsidy may be in the form of a bonus at the time of initial compensation of the agent, and/or at some later time when ad campaign performance and/or performance increases can be determined.
- the business network 120 may simply charge the Advertiser a predetermined or percentage amount more (or less) than it pays to the Agent.
- the business network may simply act as a "conduit for payment", in which case the compensation paid to the agent is equal (or substantially equal) to the payment received from the advertiser.
- Figure 4 illustrates an exemplary Webpage 400 including an exemplary agent directory (also referred to as "advisor directory”) which may be viewed by an advertiser.
- agent directory also referred to as "advisor directory”
- the business network may use such a directory to enable advertisers to search for suitable agents easily. Doing so further assists the agents in advertising their services and capabilities, and in general helps all parties to enter into business relations.
- the Webpage 400 includes two sections. Section 410 and section 440.
- Section 410 includes interactive means for filtering and/or sorting agents.
- Section 440 illustrates exemplary filtering/sorting results that advertisers may view after conducting a search using the filtering/sorting parameters provided in section 410.
- the section 410 may be used by advertisers to enter characteristics desired in an agent (so as to be capable of delivering the advertiser's demands) and search for those agents. For instance, an advertiser may request a record of performance (not shown) and/or highly experienced agents deemed to be "Pro's" by selecting the checkbox 420.
- the record of performance may include such statistics as number of clients, customer feedback, ranking, ratings, etc. These same statistics may also be used by the system to define highly experienced professional agents ("Pro's"). Also an advertiser can select a desired size range of campaigns that agents have experience working with from drop-down menus 430.
- Directory section 440 may include a number of entries, each of which may include advisor (also called agent) information 450, location 460, number of clients 470, and average campaign size of agent 480.
- agent listing 450 may include the name of the agent and/or agency name, as well as descriptive text and links to landing pages (typically the Website of the agent). Hence, advertisers can get further information about the agent's capabilities and service qualities.
- the location listing 460 contains location information of agents such as country, state, and city.
- the last column 480 contains information about the size of campaigns that the agents have worked on (e.g., measured as amount of dollars per month).
- Various embodiments consistent with the present invention may include different agent information, and may present such in different ways.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 500 that may be used to perform the advertiser user interface operations 210 in a manner consistent with the present invention. Different branches of the method 500 may be performed in response to different events that can occur.
- One event can be the selection of the job listing directory.
- the method 500 may invoke job listing interface operations (Recall, e.g., 215 of Figure 2.) to allow the advertiser to view (and perhaps respond to) the job listings (Recall, e.g., 220 of Figure 2.).
- job listing interface operations Return, e.g., 215 of Figure 2.
- the method 500 then branches back to event block 510.
- Another event may be the selection of the agent directory.
- the method 500 may invoke the agent directory viewing operations (Recall, e.g., 240 of Figure 2.) to allow the advertiser to view (and perhaps respond to) agent information (Recall, e.g., 245 of Figure 2.).
- agent directory viewing operations Recall, e.g., 240 of Figure 2.
- agent information Recall, e.g., 245 of Figure 2.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 600 that may be used to perform the agent user interface operations 230 in a manner consistent with the present invention. Different branches of the method 600 may be performed in response to different events that can occur.
- One event may be the selection of the agent directory (Recall, e.g., 245 of Figure 2.). Upon the occurrence of this event, the method 600 may invoke agent information create/edit/view operations (Recall, e.g., 250 of Figure 2.) to allow the agent to create, edit, and/or view the agent information. (Block 620) The method 600 then branches back to event block 610.
- Another event may be the selection of the job listings (Recall, e.g., 220 of Figure 2.). Upon the occurrence of this event, the method 600 may invoke job listing viewing operations (Recall, e.g., 225 of Figure 2.) to allow the agent to view (and perhaps respond to) the job listings. (Block 630) The method 600 then branches back to event block 610.

- the method 600 then branches back to event block 610.
- Figure 7 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 700 that may be used to perform agent directory management (Recall, e.g., 250 of Figure 2.) in a manner consistent with the present invention. Different branches of the method 700 may be performed in response to different events that may occur. (Block 710) One event that may occur is the receipt of the new agent information. If new agent information is received, the method 700 may authenticate the new agent information and add the agent listing to the agent directory before branching back to block 710. (Blocks 720 and 722)
- Another event that may occur is the receipt of modifications (or a request to make modifications) made to the agent listings and offers.
- the method 700 may authenticate the user (agent) and check the user's authorization. (Blocks 730 and 732) If the agent does not pass the inspection, an error handling procedure may be performed (e.g., an error message may be generated and provided to the agent). (Block 740) If, on the other hand, the agent passes the inspection, the method 700 may update the agent listing using the received modifications. (Block 734) Furthermore, if the modification includes an open offer, the method 700 may update offer information (Recall, e.g., 305 of Figure 3.) before branching back to Block 710.
- Block 736 and 7308 If the modification does not include an open offer, the method will simply branch back to Block 710.
- Block 736 Another event that may occur is the receipt of a directory request. Upon the occurrence of this event, the method 700 may provide the directory information to the requesting user (advertiser or agent). (Block 750) The method 700 then branches back to event block 710. A similar event is the receipt of a request for listing information. Upon the occurrence of such an event, the method 700 may provide the listing information to the requesting user (advertiser or agent). (Block 760) The method 700 then branches back to event block 710. A request for contact information may be another event that may occur.

- event Block 710 Yet another event that may occur at event Block 710 is the receipt of an acceptance of an open offer by an agent. Upon the occurrence of such an event, the method 700 may notify contract formation operations (Recall, e.g., 315 of Figure 3.) and/or update acceptance information (Recall, e.g., 310 of Figure 3.). (Block 780) The agent listing may also be updated (e.g., to reflect the acceptance of an open offer) (Block 782), before the method 700 branches back to event block 710.
- FIG 8 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 800 that may be used to perform job listing management (Recall, e.g., 215 of Figure 2.) in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- Different branches of the method 800 may be performed in response to different events that may occur.
- One event that may occur is the receipt of new job listing information. If job listing information is received, the method 800 may check the job listing and add it to the directory. (Blocks 820 and 822) Furthermore, the method 800 may check if any offers are included in the listing. (Block 824) If not, the method 800 may simply branch back to event block 810. If , on the other hand, the job listing includes an offer, then the method 800 may update offer information (Recall, e.g., 305 of Figure 3.) and branch back to event block 810. (Block 826)
- Another event that may occur is the receipt of modifications made to the listing by an advertiser. If the modifications are received, the method 800 may check to authenticate the advertiser and examine their authorization. (Blocks 830 and 832) If the advertiser passes the check, the method 800 may simply update the job listing before branching back to event block 810. (Block 834) If, on the other hand, the advertiser does not pass the check, the method 800 may perform error handling procedures (e.g., provide an error message to the advertiser) before branching back to event block 810. (Block 836)
- error handling procedures e.g., provide an error message to the advertiser
- Receiving a request for the job directory may be another event that may occur at event block 810. If such a request is received, the method 800 may provide the job directory information to the requesting user (advertiser or agent) before branching back to event block 810. (Block 840) A similar event that may occur is the receipt of a request for a particular job listing. If such a request is received, the method 800 may provide the requested job listing information to the requesting user (advertiser or agent). (Block 850) The method 800 then branches back to event block 810.
- the method 800 may enable communication between an agent and an advertiser before the method 800 branches back to event block 810. (Block 860)
- a further event that may occur at event block 810 is the receipt of an acceptance of an open offer.
- the method 800 may inform contract formation operations (Recall, e.g., 315 of Figure 3.) of the acceptance (e.g., update acceptance information), and may update the job listing status to reflect the acceptance of an open offer. (Blocks 870 and 872) The method 800 then branches back to event block 810.
- Agents can send quotes to the advertisers. This represents another event that may occur at event block 810. If a quote is received, the method 800 may simply forward the quote to the appropriate advertiser before branching back to event block 810. (Block 880) Referring back to event block 810, a proposal submitted by an agent may be received. If a proposal is received from an agent, the method 800 may forward it to the corresponding advertiser before branching back to event block 820. (Block 890)
- Figure 9 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 900 that may be used to perform contract management operations (Recall, e.g., 315 of Figure 3.) in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- Different branches of the method 900 may be performed in response to different events that may occur.
- One of the events that may occur is the receipt of a response to a request for quotes.
- the method 900 may save the response and facilitate viewing by advertiser, and may update offer information (Recall, e.g., 305 of Figure 3.).
- Blocks 920 and 922 The method 900 then branches back to event block 910.
- another event that may occur is the receipt of a response to an offer.
- the method 900 may examine if all terms of the offer are accepted. (Block 930) If all the terms are not accepted, the method 900 may simply communicate a counter-offer to the party that made the offer, before branching back to event block 910. (Block 940) On the other hand, if all the terms are accepted, the method 900 may determine if the offer has been withdrawn or already accepted by another party. (Block 930) If all the terms are not accepted, the method 900 may simply communicate a counter-offer to the party that made the offer, before branching back to event block 910. (Block 940) On the other hand, if all the terms are accepted, the method 900 may determine if the offer has been withdrawn or already accepted by another party. (Block 930) If all the terms are not accepted, the method 900 may simply communicate a counter-offer to the party that made the offer, before branching back to event block 910. (Block 940) On the
- the method 900 may notify the respondent that its acceptance failed, before branching back to event block 910. (Block 942) If, on the other hand, the offer has not been withdrawn, nor already accepted, then the method 900 may record the contract information (Recall, e.g., 310, 315, and 355 of Figure 3.), notify the parties, and update the associated job listing, before branching back to event block 910. (Blocks 934, 936, and 938)
- Yet another event that may occur at the event block 910 is the receipt of a response to a request for proposals. If a response to a request for proposals is received, the method 900 may save the response and facilitate viewing by advertiser that issued the request for proposal before branching back to event block 910. (Block 950)
- Figure 10 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 1000 that may be used to perform proto ad management (Recall, e.g., 325 and 335 of Figure 3.) in a manner consistent with the present invention. Different branches of the method 1000 may be performed in response to different events that may occur. (Block 1010) One of the events that may occur is the receipt of ad information from an agent 130. If such ad information is received, the proto ad management method 1000 may post the ad(s) or forward them to the advertiser 110 for review before branching back to event block 1010. (Block 1020)
- Another event that may occur is the receipt of an advertiser request for ad information. If such a request for ad information is received, the method 1000 may authenticate the advertiser and check their authorization. (Block 1030) If an advertiser is authorized to access and view the ad information, (Block 1032) then the method 1000 may provide proto ad information to the advertiser for review, before branching back to event block 1010.
