- wearable computing devices described herein such as wearable computing device 110 of FIG. 1 , wearable computing device 210 of FIG. 2 and/or wearable computing device 710 of FIG. 7 may, in some embodiments, be head-mounted eyeglasses devices, also referred to as wearable heads-up displays or head-mounted displays.
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment. Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Microsoft Hololens® just to name a few.
- a wearable heads-up display is an important factor in its design. When it comes to face-worn devices, however, users also care a lot about aesthetics. This is clearly highlighted by the immensity of the eyeglass (including sunglass) frame industry. Independent of their performance limitations, many of the aforementioned examples of wearable heads-up displays have struggled to find traction in consumer markets because, at least in part, they lack fashion appeal. Most wearable heads-up displays presented to date are bulky to enable adequate display performance and, as a result, appear very unnatural on a user's face compared to the sleeker and streamlined look of typical eyeglass and sunglass lenses.
- a traditional eyeglasses frame is problematic when correct alignment of optical components carried by the eyeglasses frame is a necessity for a high quality display. Because traditional eyeglasses have hinges where the arms meet the rest of the frame, any optical components carried on the arms may move relative to the rest of the frame or to the eye of the user while being worn, resulting in loss of or distortion of the display. There is a need in the art for means to successfully integrate electronic components into smaller frames in order to achieve the inconspicuous form factor and fashion appeal expected of the eyeglass frame industry while still maintaining a high display quality.
- the design form factor and location of an antenna within an electronic device is important because the location of the antenna relative to other components, both electronic and non-electronic, within the device impacts the functionality of the antenna. In some cases, interference from other components within the device significantly reduces the range, signal strength, and overall connectivity capabilities of the antenna, thus preventing the antenna from effectively connecting or communicating with other electronic devices. In many cases, a similar result occurs depending on the distance and orientation of the antenna relative to an external device with which the antenna is communicating.
- a wearable heads-up display may be provided in the form of eyeglasses frames and eyeglasses frames assemblies carrying an antenna for inter-device connectivity.
- Such glasses may include a minimal form factor that is aesthetically pleasing and an antenna design that enables superior range, signal strength, and overall connectivity capabilities of the antenna.

- the processor executing the user interface rendering loop can thereupon use the object position data and other object characteristics to adjust the user interface accordingly when composing the frame (e.g., to move user interface elements in the display so as not to occlude the object or objects).

- the elements of FIG. 19 generally correspond to their respective like-numbered equivalents of FIG. 17 , unless otherwise indicated.
- Method 2200 may begin at 2210 with a processor of the wearable computing device determining that one or more user interface elements is to be displayed at 2210 .
- the processor may also determine whether the entire user interface is to be displayed and, if so, what the properties of the display should be. For example, in some cases, the display may be dimmed or de-emphasized.
- the processor may compose the user interface elements for the display.
- Composition may include determining one or more properties, such as position in the available display area, size of the user interface element, color, opacity, animation, etc.
- Frame composition data may be provided to the environmental detection loop 2255 , which may use it as further described herein.
- the processor may render the frame data into a frame buffer, based on the composition, or may offload rendering to a suitable graphics processor in some cases, and return to 2210 .
- Acts 2210 , 2215 and 2220 may be referred to as a user interface rendering loop 2205 .
- Rendered frame data may be displayed from the frame buffer once it is available. Display of the frame data generally can occur asynchronously to the rendering, based on a display-specific refresh rate, and depending on the specific display device that is used.
- an environmental detection loop 2255 may be carried out by the processor.
- Environmental detection loop 2255 may begin at 2260 with at least one sensor of the wearable computing device detecting at least one sensor input.
- the at least one sensor may be an audio sensor (e.g., to detect speech, or verbal commands), an inertial motion sensor (e.g., to detect head movement), an altimeter (e.g., to detect ascending or descending a staircase by the user), a radio signal sensor (e.g., to detect proximity or movement of a controller device, such as controller device 120 ), a data signal sensor, an image detection device (as described with reference to FIG. 17 ), or any combination thereof.
- an audio sensor e.g., to detect speech, or verbal commands
- an inertial motion sensor e.g., to detect head movement
- an altimeter e.g., to detect ascending or descending a staircase by the user
- a radio signal sensor e.g., to detect proximity or movement of a controller device, such as controller device 120
- a data signal sensor e.
- the processor may process the at least one sensor input to detect a stimulus or stimuli.
- the stimulus detection may be offloaded to a host computing device or a remote computing device as described herein.
- the act of detecting stimuli may be replaced with an act of transmitting the at least one sensor input—which may be temporarily stored at the wearable computing device—to the host computing device and/or remote computing device (possibly via the host computing device), and receiving stimulus detection data from the respective device. Transmission and reception can occur via wireless data connection (e.g., BluetoothTM, Wi-FiTM, cellular or other data connection, as described herein).
- wireless data connection e.g., BluetoothTM, Wi-FiTM, cellular or other data connection, as described herein.
- the processor may determine whether an environmental interaction mode is to be activated at 2070 .
- the processor may determine whether it is to be deactivated. Deactivation may be appropriate, for example, when the conditions that triggered the activation of the environmental interaction mode are no longer present.
- the environmental interaction mode is activated by the processor (or deactivated, if it was active) and a notification of the environmental interaction mode status is transmitted to the user interface rendering loop, along with auxiliary data relating to the stimuli.
- the processor executing the user interface rendering loop can thereupon use the auxiliary data to adjust the user interface accordingly when composing the frame.
- activating the environmental interaction mode may involve: reducing a brightness of a user interface element, reducing the brightness of the entire display, decreasing an opacity of a user interface element or of the entire display, temporarily removing a user interface element, repositioning the user interface element in the display, temporarily deactivating the entire display, or any combination of the above.
- deactivating the environmental interaction mode may involve increasing a brightness of a user interface element, increasing the brightness of the entire display, increasing an opacity of a user interface element or of the entire display, temporarily removing a user interface element, repositioning the user interface element in the display (e.g., to a periphery of the display area), reactivating the entire display, or any combination of the above.
