Definitions
- This invention relates to detection and correction of errors and erasures in binary data strings comprising codewords in a linear cyclic code and, more particularly, to the efficient utilization of computational resources used in the detection and correction such as found in communications and storage subsystems and the like.
- a sequence of symbols may be formatted as a string of a fixed number of characters or symbols called "words".
- error connotes an unknown value change of one or more symbols at an unknown location or position within the word.
- erasure means that while the value of the change is unknown, the location or position within a word is known.
- a code C is said to be a linear cyclic code if the cyclic shift of each codeword is also a codeword. If each codeword u in C is of length n, then the cyclic shift ⁇ (u) of u is the word of length n obtained from u by shifting the last digit of u and moving it to the beginning, all other digits moving one position to the right. ##EQU1##
- codewords are conventionally represented by a collection of coefficients of a rational polynomial of an arbitrary place variable z in low-to-high order.
- a received codeword r(z) c(z)+e(z), where c(z) is the word that was originally recorded or transmitted and e(z) is the error.
- Reed-Solomon (RS) codes exemplify linear cyclic codes. RS codes are extensively used because they maintain the maximum distance among codewords for a given length n.
- An RS code may be said to comprise a set of vectors over a finite field F having p m elements, where p is a prime number.
- the positions within a codeword may be indexed by the nonzero elements of the field a 0 , a 1 , . . . , a 254 .
- the first step is that of syndrome determination decoding, while the remaining steps ascertain various factors in the key equation.
- the syndrome set ⁇ S j ⁇ is derived and the syndrome polynomial S summed over the individual S j 's is determined.
- the error locator polynomial ⁇ (z) and the error evaluator polynomial w(z) are computed. This is followed by ascertaining the error locations ⁇ l k ⁇ using the method of Chien and the computation of the error values ⁇ e k ⁇ using the method of Forney.
- Error decoding of linear cyclic codes generally comprises the steps of:
- the general machine computational problem is to find a rational approximation to the ratio of two polynomials. This is generally done by a partial fraction expansion as applied to Galois field arithmetic as it ordinarily would be applied to functions in a complex plane. Relatedly, the poles of the ratio are the location of the errors, and the residues at these poles are the error values.
- error correction of linear cyclic codes such as an RS code, required the syndrome polynomial S(z) and determining four polynomials ⁇ (z), ⁇ (z), ⁇ (z), and v(z).
- a machine-implementable method and means for correcting errors and erasures in binary data strings comprising codewords in a linear cyclic code.
- the code has a maximum number of consecutive zeroes occurring in the code definition, and each received word is subject to separate processing for location and value of errors.
- the method and means include (a) deriving one or more syndromes from each received word and computing an error location polynomial from the derived syndromes, and (b) determining error values from the syndromes and the error location polynomial using only coefficients from the syndromes and the location polynomial without computing an intermediate error evaluator polynomial.
- the method and means of this invention extends the single recursion key equation solver from error decoding to erasure decoding. This facilitates two modes of operation: an error-only mode and an erasure-only mode.
- the method and means are operable independent of the number of syndromes or the number of erasure pointers.
- FIG. 1 depicts a functional block diagram including that of an erasure-correcting, register-limited, linear cyclic decoder according to the invention.
- FIG. 2 shows logical details of the erasure values unit 19 as set out in FIG. 1 also according to the invention.
- FIG. 3 illustrates the logic of an erasure pointer generator 27 used in the embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 2.
- FIG. 4 sets out an erasure locator polynomial generator 6 used in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1.
- FIG. 5 depicts the computational flow of control used by the erasure decoder algorithm according to the invention.
- This invention is used in a data recovery procedure where binary data strings are mapped into counterpart codewords of a linear cyclic code prior to transmission on a communications subsystem or prior to recording them on disk, tape, or optical devices of a storage subsystem.
- codewords are received or read back from such a communications or storage subsystem
- syndromes are derived by dividing the codewords by an appropriate code-generating polynomial and detecting for nonzero syndromes. Correction of any detected errors or erasures is attempted in an on-the-fly mode. Since this process is usually executed at the device attachment level, it is transparent to higher levels, such as at an IBM host S/390 CPU or IBM 3990 storage control unit. It is only where correction cannot be performed that the next higher level of a subsystem becomes involved.
- each received code word r(x) on an input path 2 is applied to a syndrome generator 1.
- the syndromes are in turn applied to a key equation solver 3 (KES 3) of the Berlekamp-Massey type.
- ⁇ (a j ) is applied to root solver logic 17 through failure detector 13 over path 35. If the solver logic 17 converges on a root, then the detection unit 13 passes the information to error value computation unit 15 for further processing. However, if the solver logic 17 cannot converge, then the error detection unit 13 applies the quantity ⁇ (z) and a normalized value ⁇ j (z) to an erasure decoder 5 for further processing over paths 31 and 33.
- generator 6 repeats Berlekamp's algorithm using the values ⁇ (z) and ⁇ j (z) and the erasure pointer derived from a source 27 is supplied to the generator 6 over a path 28 through shift register 7.
- the modified locator ⁇ '(z) is in turn applied to root solver logic 17 over path 24 and also presented at erasure values unit 19.
- the ⁇ (z), ⁇ j (z) outputs of decoder 5 are loaded in parallel to shift register 401.
- the formation of the error location polynomial ⁇ '(z) involves a reentrant loop in which values from register 401 are time shifted through delay 403 and additively combined at gate 405 with a product formed from EP path 28 and the current shifted value from register 401.
- the modified value is then shifted into the next position at the top of the register. This processing repeats for each value in the output parallel loaded from decoder 5.
- the modified contents of register 401 are shifted out in parallel and applied to paths 24 and 18. This now constitutes ⁇ '(z). Concurrently, the new parallel output from decoder 5 is loaded into register 401 on path 8.
- the erasure values unit 19 is responsive to (a) syndromes S(0), S(1), . . . , S(t-1) from syndrome generator 1 as applied over path 25 to shift register 201, (b) to the error location values ⁇ l j ⁇ from solver logic 17 on path 22, (c) to the modified error locator polynomial ⁇ '(a j ) from generator 6 as applied over path 18 to shift register 203, and (d) to the EP from shift register 7 as applied on path 28.
- EPs and error location ⁇ l j ⁇ values are applied to the ⁇ (z j ) evaluation logic 207 through XOR 219 and multiplier 221.
- the output e j from erasure values unit 19 appears on path 20 from divider 217 as the approximated ratio of two polynomials evaluated at specific locations l j .
- logic unit 209 forms the derivative of the error location polynomial ⁇ (z) over z.
- the error e I is calculated as the ratio output from logic arrangement 205 on path 208, and the output from unit 209 over path 210.
- FIG. 3 there is shown the logic of an erasure pointer generator 27 used in the embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 2 of this invention.
- a cyclic, multitracked, recording disk storage medium 301 is accessed by an arm 302.
- This arm is preferably tipped with a magnetoresistive read/write head 304.
- Data and events are sensed by unit 303 and passed over separate paths to a disk drive controller 311.
- time-varying signals are resolved as binary bit signals and passed from unit 303 over a read channel 307 to the controller 311.
- Detected anomalous events such as track/head misalignments, read/write head state changes, thermal asperities, etc. are reported to an address generator 305 separately over path 315.
- generator 305 provides an address or pointer 321 associated with the location 323 of the event on the disk to the controller over path 317.
- Such anomalous events are statistically associated with erasures. Consequently, their pointers are used to modify the values involved in locating the roots of the modified error locator polynomial ⁇ '(z) when it is subjected to an extended Berlekamp-Massey process as discussed in connection with FIGS. 1 and 2.
- the method controls the number of iterations and tests whether sufficient roots have been found or the process has failed.
- the method in FIG. 5 is initialized at step 501 with predetermined values for ⁇ (z 0 ), ⁇ (z 0 ), register length L, RS code distance d, an incrementable/decrementable control parameter "ctlr", erasure pointer location, and an index j. It should be noted that ctlr is set equal to d-2L. Also, for notational convenience, the variables ⁇ (z j ), ⁇ (z j ) are respectively assigned to two arbitrary variables designed "a" and "b" in step 507.
- ⁇ (z), ⁇ (z), and car are tested for nullity at steps 507, 509, and 511. If the values for the variables a, b, and ctlr are null, then ctlr is decremented and ⁇ (z j ) is recursively changed in step 515. Otherwise, ctlr is incremented and ⁇ (z j ) is recursively changed in step 513. At this point, the index j is incremented in step 517 and tested in step 519. The test of the index value j as to whether it satisfies 1 mod 2 operates to assure that every other index j increment will result in an iteration back to step 503, while the intervening increment results in the activation of the root solver 17 in step 521.
- the focus is on whether another iteration starting at step 503 can be made. One reason that another iteration cannot be made is where the number of iterations has already exceeded a predetermined number.
