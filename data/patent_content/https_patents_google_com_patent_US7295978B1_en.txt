Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to speech recognition and, more particularly, to systems and methods that model speech using a small number of one-dimensional Gaussian distributions.
- Conventional speech recognizers identify unknown spoken utterances. Through a process known as training, the recognizer examines known words and samples and records features of the words as recognition models. The recognition models represent typical acoustic renditions of known words. In the training process, the recognizer applies a training algorithm to the recognition models to form the stored representations that it uses to identify future unknown words.
- the recognizer receives unknown speech signals from a source, such as a microphone or network.
- the recognizer determines features that are based on a short-term spectral analysis of the unknown speech signal at predetermined intervals, such as 10 ms.
- These features commonly referred to as “feature vectors,” are usually the output of some type of spectral analysis technique, such as a filter bank analysis, a linear predictive coding analysis, or a Fourier transform analysis.
- the recognizer compares the feature vectors with one or more of the recognition models that have been stored during the training process. During this comparison, the recognizer determines the degree of similarity between the feature vectors and the recognition models. In the final stage, the recognizer determines, based on the recognition model similarity scores, which recognition model best matches the unknown speech signal. The recognizer may then output the word(s) corresponding to the recognition model with the highest similarity score.
- HMM hidden Markov model
- a conventional speech recognition system divides the feature space into a predetermined number of disjoint regions. Typically, the system computes one feature vector for every 10 ms of speech. The system determines, for each feature vector in the input speech, in which regions the feature vector lies. This usually does not require very much computation because the system performs this operation only once in each frame. Each probability distribution in the HMM then models the probability mass within each region. Thus, to obtain the probability of the input feature vector for a particular distribution, the speech recognition system need only look up the probability for the index of the region for the feature vector.
- Continuous density HMMs model each distribution using a parametric function, such as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. That is, each distribution has its own set of multinomial Gaussian distributions that together form a probability density function.
- a conventional speech recognition system compares an input feature vector with a probability distribution for a state, the system computes the weighted Euclidean distance from the input feature vector to each Gaussian distribution in the mixture distribution to determine the probability of the Gaussian distribution. This calculation may be represented by the following equation:
- x represents the input vector
- u represents the mean of the Gaussian distribution
- ⁇ represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution (i.e., ⁇ 2 represents variance).
- the system computes the distance for each dimension of the input vector.
- a typical input vector may have 45 dimensions. As a result, the distance computation often dominates the computation needed for speech recognition.
- Continuous density HMMs generally provide more accurate recognition than discrete density HMMs, making them more desirable.
- Many conventional speech recognition systems share distributions among multiple states to decrease the amount of training data needed and to decrease the amount of computation needed during recognition.
- Many other conventional systems share sets of Gaussian distributions among several distributions, but permit the distributions to have different mixture weights. The distance computation, however, still dominates the computation time in both of these systems.
- the more Gaussian distributions an HMM has the more accurate the speech recognition is, as long as there is enough training data available. In practice, training data is always limited.
- Systems and methods consistent with the present invention address this need by providing a small number of one-dimensional Gaussian distributions from which all multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions may be constructed. This permits the Gaussian distribution likelihood computation to be performed by a table lookup operation, thereby reducing the computation time and the amount of training data needed.

- the system 100 may use hidden Markov model (HMM) techniques to perform speech recognition.
- the system 100 includes an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter 110 , a feature extractor 120 , an end-point detector 130 , a speech recognizer 140 , and a storage device 150 .

- the feature extractor 120 may include conventional mechanisms for organizing the received speech into frames of, for example, 10 ms and derives an input speech vector for each frame.

- the storage device 150 may contain a distance table 156 (described below) of precomputed distances associated with each one-dimensional Gaussian distribution.
- FIG. 2 is an exemplary flowchart of processing for creating a distance table 156 in an implementation consistent with the present invention.
- the processing will be described as a series of steps performed by a computer device, such as a personal computer. One or more of these steps, however, may be performed by one or more human operators.
- Processing may begin with the computer device determining the set of means and variances to be used [step 210 ].
- the computer device estimates the set of means and variances using standard estimation techniques for HMMs.
- the computer device determines a small set of representative means and variances, using, for example, a quantizer.
- a quantizer There are several known techniques for designing a quantizer for continuous values. The simplest is to divide the range of values into several equal sub-ranges. To reduce the quantization error, a conventional technique, such as the k-means clustering technique, can be used on a set of training data. In other implementations consistent with the present invention, other techniques are used to assign a set of representative values.
- the computer device may choose, for each estimated mean, a value that is closest to the estimated mean.
- the computer device may compute the logarithm of the variances. Then, the computer device may use the same procedure that was used for the means (e.g., k-means clustering) to determine a representative set of log variances. For each variance in the HMM, the computer device may choose the log variance that is closest to the log of the estimated variance.
- the means e.g., k-means clustering
- the computer device may replace the value of each of the means and variances with a code, such as a three-bit code [step 220 ].
- the computer may: (1) reestimate the means and variances to maximize the likelihood of the data; (2) permit the data to be realigned to different states and different Gaussian distributions while keeping the assignment of mean codes and variance codes fixed; (3) reestimate the means and variances and then determine the Gaussian distributions that maximize the likelihood in each dimension; or (4) iterate the reestimation of the means and variances by assigning codes for the means and variances to the Gaussian distributions and reestimate the maximum likelihood of the means and variances given the code assignments.
- the computer device may then identify the one-dimensional Gaussian distributions to be used for recognition using the determined set of means and variances [step 230 ]. Assume, for example, that the computer device determines that the set of means and variances includes eight different means and eight different variances. In this case, the computer device would identify sixty-four one-dimensional Gaussian distributions from the sixty-four different combinations of the means and variances.
- the computer device may assign a code to each of the Gaussian distributions based on the codes assigned to the means and variances. For example, the computer device may simply concatenate the three-bit means code and the three-bit variance code to create a six-bit code for each Gaussian distribution.
- the computer device may determine the subset of possible quantized input values [step 240 ]. This subset of values may be selected through experimentation or may be randomly chosen. During runtime, the computer device may replace each value of the input vector with the nearest value in the subset of values. Assume, for example, that the subset includes thirty-two possible values.
- the computer device may then compute the possible distances [step 250 ].
- the number of possible distances for a dimension may be determined from the number of Gaussian distributions and the number of possible quantized input values (i.e., in the subset of possible input values). If there are sixty-four possible Gaussian distributions and thirty-two possible input values, the computer device may calculate 2,048 possible distances.
- the computer device may create the distance table 156 to store the possible distances [step 260 ].
- the computer device may use a combination of the code for the Gaussian distribution and a code for the quantized input value as an address into the distance table 156 . In an implementation consistent with the present invention, the computer device concatenates the Gaussian distribution code and the quantized input value code to determine the address for a particular distance in the distance table 156 .
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of the distance table 156 in an implementation consistent with the present invention.
- the distance table 156 may include multiple entries 310 .
- Each of the entries 310 may store one of the possible distances 320 referenced by an address 330 .
- the distance 320 and address 330 may be determined as described above.
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary flowchart of processing for recognizing input speech in an implementation consistent with the present invention. Processing begins with the system 100 ( FIG. 1 ) receiving input speech and creating an input vector for each portion of speech, such as each 10 ms frame of speech.
- the speech recognizer 140 may quantize each dimension of the input vector [step 410 ]. In other words, the speech recognizer 140 may select one of the input values in the subset of possible quantized input values for the input vector. For example, the speech recognizer 140 may select one of the quantized input values that is closest in value to the input vector. Other selection techniques may alternatively be used.
- the speech recognizer 140 may then determine an address for accessing the distance table 156 [step 420 ]. To determine the address, the speech recognizer 140 may shift the code for the quantized input value by a number of bits equal to the number of bits for the code for a Gaussian distribution of interest and concatenate the two codes. The speech recognizer 140 may use the concatenated codes as the address into the distance table 156 . Using the address, the speech recognizer 140 may access the distance table 156 to determine a distance value for the Gaussian distribution [step 430 ]. The distance value indicates to the speech recognizer 140 the probability of the Gaussian distribution [step 440 ].
- the speech recognizer 140 may perform these steps many times for the different Gaussian distributions to identify one or more of the Gaussian distributions with the highest probabilities.
- the speech recognizer 140 may then recognize the inputted speech based on a sequence of the probabilities [step 450 ].
- the speech recognizer 140 uses conventional techniques for determining what word or words were spoken based on the Gaussian distributions identified with the highest probabilities for each of the received frames of speech.
- FIG. 5 is an exemplary flowchart of processing for creating a distance table 156 according to an alternate implementation consistent with the present invention.
- the processing will be described as a series of steps performed by a computer device, such as a personal computer. One or more of these steps, however, may be performed by one or more human operators.
- This alternate implementation differs from the above-described implementation by not requiring the quantization of the input vector and in the way it uses the input feature vector to compute the distance. This alternate implementation is especially beneficial in large vocabulary applications in which the speech recognizer 140 ( FIG. 1 ) computes a large number of Gaussian distributions for each input vector.
- Processing may begin with the computer device determining the set of means and variances to be used.
- the computer device estimates the set of means and variances from training data.
- the procedures and methods used to determine the set of quantized means and variances is the same as described above with regard to FIG. 2 . Therefore, steps 510 - 530 are identical to steps 210 - 230 described above with regard to FIG. 2 .
- the computer device may then precompute the weighted distance for each of the identified Gaussian distributions for each dimension of each input vector (e.g., every 10 ms frame) [step 540 ].
- the computer device may use the actual floating point values for the means and variances for computing the distances.
- the number of distances computed may be determined from the number of Gaussian distributions and the number of dimensions of the input vector. If there are sixty-four possible Gaussian distributions and forty-five dimensions, the computer device may calculate 2,880 distances.
- the computer device may create the distance table 156 to store the distances [step 550 ].
- the distance table 156 may be configured as shown in FIG. 3 .
- the computer device may use a combination of the code for the Gaussian distribution and the dimension number as an address into the distance table 156 .
- the computer device may concatenate the Gaussian distribution code and the dimension number to determine the address for a particular distance in the distance table 156 .
- FIG. 6 is an exemplary flowchart of processing for recognizing input speech according to an alternate implementation consistent with the present invention. Processing begins with the system 100 ( FIG. 1 ) receiving input speech and creating an input vector for each portion of speech, such as each 10 ms frame of speech. For each dimension of the input vector, the speech recognizer 140 determines an address for accessing the distance table 156 [step 610 ]. To determine the address, the speech recognizer 140 may concatenate the code for a Gaussian distribution of interest and the dimension number. Using the address, the speech recognizer 140 may access the distance table 156 to determine a distance value for the Gaussian distribution [step 620 ]. The distance value indicates to the speech recognizer 140 the probability of the Gaussian distribution [step 630 ].
- the speech recognizer 140 may perform these steps many times for the different Gaussian distributions and the different dimensions to identify one or more of the Gaussian distributions with the highest probabilities.
- the speech recognizer 140 then recognizes the inputted speech based on a sequence of the probabilities [step 640 ].
- the speech recognizer 140 may use conventional techniques to determine what word or words were spoken based on the identification of the Gaussian distributions for each of the received frames of speech.
- Systems and methods consistent with the present invention perform speech recognition with less computation and, therefore, in an expedited manner over conventional systems.
- the systems and methods permit a very large number of Gaussian distributions to be used in an HMM system, resulting in robust estimates of the parameters.
- each dimension of each Gaussian distribution now requires only a few bits of storage (e.g., six bits) rather than a full floating point value for the mean and inverse variance (typically eight bytes). This greatly reduces the storage requirements (by a factor of ten in the given example), which is important when a very large number of Gaussian distributions are needed to achieve high accuracy.
Abstract
Description
where x represents the input vector, u represents the mean of the Gaussian distribution, and σ represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution (i.e., σ2 represents variance). The system computes the distance for each dimension of the input vector. A typical input vector may have 45 dimensions. As a result, the distance computation often dominates the computation needed for speech recognition.
