Definitions
- a video hosting website includes a user database.
- the user database includes all registered users of the video hosting website along with an indication that a user is a revenue sharing partner.
- the video hosting website is adapted to receive user generated digital content that has been uploaded to an ingest module from users indicated in the user database.
- a video database stores all uploaded user generated digital content.
- FIG. 15 illustrates an example of a user interface illustrating a monetized video and an associated web advertisement that generates revenue in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- a suitable website for implementation of the system is the YOUTUBETM website, found at www.youtube.com; other video hosting sites are known as well, and can be adapted to operate according to the teaching disclosed herein.
- website represents any computer system adapted to serve content using any internetworking protocols, and is not intended to be limited to content uploaded or downloaded via the Internet or the HTTP protocol.
- functions described in one embodiment as being performed on the server side can also be performed on the client side in other embodiments if appropriate.
- the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together.
- Revenue sharing partners receive a share of the revenue generated from ad impressions occurring when videos that have been enabled for monetization are viewed by users of the video hosting website 100 .
- a content provider 185 submits an application to the video hosting website 100 to become a revenue sharing partner.
- the front end server 140 forwards the application to the application analysis module 120 which analyzes the application to determine whether the content provider 185 is eligible to become a revenue sharing partner.
- a partner signup list user interface 901 that allows a system administrator of the video hosting website 100 to view information regarding various content providers 185 indicated in the Username column 903 .
- the content providers 185 in the Username column 903 represent content providers 185 who have applied to the revenue sharing partner program.
- the application analysis module 120 analyzes infractions accumulated by a content provider 185 applying to the revenue sharing partner program. Infractions are violations of the rules of conduct specified by the system administrator of the video hosting website 100 .
- videos may be flagged as inappropriate because the content provider 185 is not authorized to use the content in the video. For example, television shows, music videos, music concerts or commercials should not be uploaded without permission from the owners of the content. Uploaded videos containing material not belonging to the uploading content provider may receive a takedown request because of a copyright violation.
- the Strikes Ok column also includes a textual symbol indicating a strike status 909 of the content provider 185 .
- the strike status 909 indicates whether the content provider 185 has an amount of strikes against his/her account that is either tolerable or intolerable.
- a tolerable number of strikes indicate that the amount of strikes against a content provider 185 is not enough to justify the content provider 185 from being denied entry into the revenue sharing partner program.
- An intolerable number of strikes indicate that the amount of strikes against a content provider 185 is an indication that the content provider 185 may not be eligible for the revenue sharing partner program.
- the textual symbol that indicates the strike status 909 will either be shown as a “Y” implying that the number of strikes against the content provider 185 is tolerable or a “N” implying that the number of strikes against the content provider 185 is not tolerable, for example. Any symbol can be used to represent the strike status 909 .
- the miscellaneous strikes 911 information is configured in a similar manner as the description relating to the copyright strikes 913 .
- the application analysis module 120 analyzes the number of copyright strikes 913 and miscellaneous strikes 911 to determine the strike status 909 against the content provider.
- the system administrator may analyze the copyright strikes 913 and miscellaneous strikes 911 and determine the strike status 909 .

- a content provider 185 with 30 uploaded videos would receive a higher amount of videos sub-score compared to a content provider 185 with only 5 uploaded videos.
- a content provider 185 with 30 uploaded videos will be used in the determination of the raw amount of videos sub-score.
- the raw amount of videos sub-score is equal to a value of 2.45 using the equation shown above.
- the raw amount of videos sub-score will later be used in the calculation of amount of videos sub-score.
- the raw channel views sub-score calculated using the above equation is equal to a value of 1.11.
- the raw channel views sub-score will later be used in the calculation of the channel views sub-score.
- the feedback sub-score reflects the feedback that a content provider's videos have received from users of the video hosting website 100 .
- Feedback can include a user providing a video rating such as rating one of the content provider's videos with a star rating of 5 out of 5 stars or users providing comments on a content provider's videos indicating that the user enjoyed the video.
- feedback can include the number of instances users of the video hosting website 100 have bookmarked web pages containing the content provider's videos to a favorites category.
- the act of a user bookmarking a video indicates that the user may have enjoyed the video or found the video interesting enough to keep a record of the web page containing the video for future viewing. Videos that have been bookmarked in the user's favorites category are said to be favoritized.
- Each instance of a user bookmarking a video and the rating information provided by users is stored in the account record of the content provider 185 in the user database 150 that is associated with the bookmarked video.

- ⁇ is equal to any of the raw sub-scores that were previously described above.
- Each raw sub-score is used to calculate its respective sub-score, represented by the variable sub-score, using the equation above.
- the previously calculated raw sub-scores are used to calculate example sub-scores for a content provider 185 .
- the calculated sub-scores are shown as follows:
- the content provider 185 who requested to join the revenue sharing partner program is notified of the decision whether he or she has been invited to become a revenue sharing partner.
- the notification may be in the form of an e-mail or a message in the content provider's account in the video hosting website 100 .
- content providers 185 that did not request to become revenue sharing partners also receive an invitation.
- the application analysis module 120 searches the user database 150 for all content providers 185 in the video hosting website 100 .
- the application analysis module 120 performs the steps described above to determine content providers 185 that are eligible to become a revenue sharing partner.
- the eligible content providers 185 that are determined eligible to become a revenue sharing partner are also sent an invitation to become a revenue sharing partner.
- FIG. 10 is one embodiment of an invitation user interface 1000 that indicates to the content provider 185 that they have been admitted in the revenue sharing partner program.
- the invitation user interface 1000 also includes important reference material for the new revenue sharing partner to review.
- the video monetization process has the following functional stages:
- Revenue sharing partners are not required to submit each video they upload to be enabled for revenue sharing. Revenue sharing partners that do not wish to enable a video for monetization simply specifies the file path of the video using the browse button 1101 and uploads the video to the video hosting website 100 using the upload video button 1109 .
- the submitted video is compared against reference sources.
- the video analysis module 130 compares videos that have been submitted for monetization against reference sources to ensure that the videos are original.
- Original videos are considered videos which the content provider 185 owns the copyrights and distribution rights for all audio and video content that is uploaded.
- a video illustrating a person drawing a picture of a Ferrari on an Etch-A-Sketch toy may be considered an original video.
- a video uploaded by a content provider 185 illustrating the content provider 185 performing a cover song may not be considered original because the content provider 185 may not own the rights to the song.
- all videos uploaded by the revenue sharing partner are automatically monetized.
- the revenue sharing partner has gained enough credibility that his or her videos no longer need to be analyzed for monetization. For example, every video submitted after the third month since the revenue sharing partner joined the revenue sharing partner program is automatically approved.
- the analysis discussed above may be performed on a yearly basis, for example, to ensure that the revenue sharing partner is not abusing his or her credibility.
- the time intervals mentioned above are merely exemplary of time intervals that can be used in the determination to monetize a video. Any suitable time interval can be used as determined by the system administrator of the video hosting website 100 .
- a web advertisement would be displayed prior to the monetized video being displayed.
- a web advertisement also may be played in the display region 1501 after the duration of the monetized video has elapsed.
- the rate per view is the same for every revenue sharing partner.
- a set rate per view value may be determined by the system administrator depending on the length of partnership of a revenue sharing partner. In an alternative embodiment, the rate per view is based on the length of partnership. Revenue sharing partners who have been part of the revenue sharing partner program for a determined length of time will have a higher rate per view compared to newly joined revenue sharing partners. Thus, the rate per view value of each revenue sharing partner will increase as their length of partnership increases.
- revenue sharing partners may receive a share percentage of revenue generated by web advertisements placed in conjunction with their monetized videos. Companies may negotiate a flat payment to the owners of the video hosting website 100 for displaying their web advertisements. Revenue sharing partners that display web advertisements of that company would receive a percentage of the revenue that the owners of the video hosting website 100 received. For example, assume that a company paid the owners of the video hosting website $10,000 to host their advertisements and 1,000 revenue sharing partners display those web advertisements. Thus, each revenue sharing partner generated $10 of revenue for displaying the company's web advertisements. The revenue sharing partners would only receive a set percentage of the generated revenue. For example, the set percentage may be 50% of the revenue generated, thus each revenue sharing partner would receive $5.00.
- the features described herein beneficially provide a system and method to admit content providers of a video hosting website into a revenue sharing partner program where the content providers may submit videos for monetization in order to generate shared revenue. Revenue sharing allows content providers to receive compensation for their original videos.
- the terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes,” “including,” “has,” “having” or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion.
- a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus.
- “or” refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).
