According to the implementation of present disclosure, receive inquiry from subscriber equipment.Such as, use
Family equipment 202 can provide inquiry to search system (such as, the search system 120 of Fig. 1).
In some instances, it may be determined that inquiry is impliedly about entity.In some instances, if
There is not clear and definite the quoting to entity in inquiry, then may determine that inquiry is impliedly about entity.
In some instances, if inquiry includes pronoun, then may determine that inquiry is impliedly about entity.
In some implementations, can process the inquiry received, and can compare and receive
Inquiry and one or more query pattern, to determine inquiry the most impliedly reference entity.?
In some examples, process and inquire about to remove one or more stop words and/or dialogue word, with
(cleaned) that there is provided clean inquires about.Such as, sample query [you can ask and show me grading]
Can be treated to provide [grading].In some instances, relatively cleaner inquiry with one or
Person's multiple queries pattern, the implicit of some entities is quoted by the instruction of each query pattern.At some
In example, if clean inquiry is mated with query pattern, it is determined that inquiry is impliedly about one
A little entities.In some instances, if clean inquiry is not mated with query pattern, it is determined that
Inquiry is not impliedly about some entities.Such as, from clean the looking in above example
Ask [grading] to mate with query pattern [grading].Hence, it can be determined that inquiry [you can ask to
I sees grading] impliedly about some entities.
As another example, [you can ask the grading shown me for fabulous Pizza in sample query
] can be treated to provide clean inquiry [fabulous Pizza of grading].Can compare clean
Inquiry [fabulous Pizza of grading] and one or more query pattern, and may determine that clean
Inquiry do not mate with any query pattern in one or more query pattern.Such as,
Word " fabulous Pizza " is specific to entity, and is therefore not included in query pattern
In any query pattern.Accordingly, it is determined that inquire about, [you can ask and show me for fabulous Pizza
Grading] not impliedly about some entities.On the contrary, and in this example, inquiry [you
Can please show me the grading for fabulous Pizza] clearly about entity, i.e. fabulous
Pizza.
In some instances, in response to determining that inquiry is impliedly about entity, it may be determined that submit to
The apparent position of the subscriber equipment of inquiry.In some instances, can be based on one or more
The signal that position is relevant determines apparent position.The signal that example location is relevant can include honeycomb
Signal, global positioning system (GPS) signal, wireless signal (WiFi) etc..Show at some
In example, the position data representing the relevant signal in one or more position is carried together with inquiry

Put data and the apparent position of subscriber equipment is provided.In some instances, apparent position is permissible
It is provided as geographical coordinate, such as, longitude, latitude.
In some instances, confidence score can be associated with apparent position.Such as, location
Service can provide apparent position and confidence score.In some instances, confidence score table
Show the degree of certainty of the degree of accuracy about apparent position.In some implementations, if confidence level
Score is less than threshold confidence score, does not the most explain inquiry.
In some instances, the time can be associated with apparent position.Such as, positioning service can
To provide apparent position and time associated there.In some instances, persond eixis user
It is determined to be in or at the time proximity of approximate position.In some implementations,
If apparent position is not determined as being the newest, the most do not explain inquiry.In some examples
In, it may be determined that the time difference between the time that current time is associated with apparent position,
And time difference and threshold difference can be compared.In some instances, if time difference exceedes threshold value
Difference, then apparent position is determined not to be the newest.In some instances, current time is carried
For the time being sent from subscriber equipment for inquiry or being received by search system.
In some implementations, entity set is provided based on apparent position.Such as, such as following institute
Describe, if confidence score exceedes threshold confidence score and/or apparent position is the newest
, then entity set is provided.In some instances, entity set includes one or more entity.
In some implementations, entity set include being confirmed as sufficiently close together apparent position one or
The multiple entity of person so that inquiry can be potentially about one or more entity.
In some implementations, position based on the corresponding entity relevant to apparent position is selected
Select one or more entity being included in entity set.In some instances, at the threshold of position
Entity in value distance (such as, threshold radius) can be identified, and is included in entity
Concentrate.Such as, geographical position can be divided into and include multiple unit (such as, square list
Unit or rectangular element) grid, the region in geographical position is responsible for by each unit.At some
In example, each unit is associated with the entity set being positioned at respective regions.In some instances,
Apparent position position unit in the inner can be identified, and may be provided in center cell.
In some instances, the multiple surrounding cells around center cell can be identified.Such as, extremely
Partially the unit in threshold distance may be provided in surrounding cells, and can be wrapped
Include in multiple surrounding cells.In some instances, entity set includes and center cell and multiple
All entities that each surrounding cells in surrounding cells in surrounding cells is associated.
In the example of Fig. 2 A and Fig. 2 B, it is provided that the threshold radius of definition border circular areas 222
220.Although example area is circular, but it is contemplated that region can include any
Suitable geometry.In some instances, the entity being positioned at region 222 is included in reality
Body is concentrated.Therefore, in the example of Fig. 2 A, entity " good hotel " 204 and entity
" fabulous Pizza " 212 is included in entity set, and in the example of Fig. 2 B, real
Body " good hotel " 204, entity " of sort hotel " 206 and entity are " fabulous
Pizza " 212 be included in entity set.In some instances, can be to processing approximation position
Put and provide the entity services of entity set to provide apparent position.
In some instances, each entity is associated with respective type.In some instances, class
Type is corresponding to the classification being associated with entity.Such as, entity " good hotel " 204 is permissible
It is provided as type [hotel].As another example, entity " fabulous Pizza " can be by
It is provided as type [dining room].In some instances, each entity during entity services is entity set
Respective type is provided.In some instances, as described above, from storage about corresponding real
The knowledge mapping of the information of body or data base determine the type of entity.
According to the implementation of present disclosure, for each entity in entity set, it is determined that
Whether inquiry can impliedly reference entity.In some instances, index is handed over by the type of entity
Fork is quoted.In some instances, index is by the corresponding n-gram of type association to inquiry.
In some instances, n-gram includes one or more word of inquiry.If based on rope
Draw and determine one or more n-gram of inquiry and be associated with type, then inquiry is considered
Potentially about corresponding entity, and entity is added to entity subset.
In some implementations, analysis based on one or more search daily record provides rope
Draw.In some instances, search daily record provides the daily record of the inquiry received.In some examples
In, search daily record can be processed to provide index.For example, it is possible to process search daily record to determine
Inquiry includes the word [menu] being associated with type [dining room].Such as another example, can locate
Reason search daily record is to determine that inquiry includes and type [dining room], [hotel], [film], [game], [business
Shop] and [service provider] word [comment] of being associated.In some instances, it is provided that
Index to be associated with type [dining room] by word [menu], and word [comment] is associated with type
[dining room], [hotel], [film], [game], [shop] and [service provider].
In some implementations, carry based at least one entity in inquiry and entity subset
For the inquiry improved.In some instances, by rewritten query to explicitly refer at least one
Entity provides the inquiry of improvement.In some instances, as sporocarp subset includes an entity,
The inquiry of improvement is then provided based on entity.
In some implementations, as sporocarp subset includes multiple entity, select from entity set
Select entity.In some instances, respective attributes based on entity selects entity.Instance attribute
Comment grading and popularity can be included.For example, it may be determined that all entities in entity subset
Whether including at least one common attribute, such as, each entity has associated there commenting
Opinion grading.In some instances, can be that each entity in entity subset provides for common
The property value of attribute, and select the entity with the highest property value.Such as, selection has
The entity of higher assessment opinion grading.As another example, select that there is the highest epidemic entity.
In some instances, entity is selected based on the entity selected before one or more.Such as,
When providing polytype entity in entity subset, the type of the entity before selected can
To be used to select entity.Such as, inquiry [showing me comment] can be relevant to type [dining room]
[hotel] and other, and entity subset can include type [dining room] and the reality in [hotel]
Body.May determine that the entity by selecting before user has type [hotel].Therefore, from entity
The entity of Selective type [hotel] in subset.
In some implementations, the inquiry of improvement is provided to search service.Such as, improve
Inquiry can by Fig. 1 search service 120 process.In some instances, search service carries
For the Search Results in response to the inquiry improved, wherein display to the user that Search Results.Such as,
The Search Results 112 of Fig. 1 can be provided based on the inquiry improved.
With reference to the example of example use case based on Fig. 2 A and Fig. 2 B, describe in further detail
The implementation of present disclosure.
With reference to Fig. 2 A, and in one example, receive search from subscriber equipment 202 and look into
Ask [showing me room grading].Determine the entity " good hotel " 204 with type [hotel]
With the entity " fabulous Pizza " 212 approximation at subscriber equipment 202 with type [dining room]
In the threshold distance of position.Therefore, entity " good hotel " 204 and entity are " fabulous
Pizza " 212 it is included in entity set.In this example, determine n-gram [room],
One or more in [grading] and [room grading] is associated with type [hotel].Therefore,
Entity " good hotel " 204 is included in entity subset.The most in this example, the most really
Neither one and type [dining room] in n-gram [room], [grading] and [room grading] are determined
It is associated.Therefore, entity " fabulous Pizza " 212 is not included in entity subset.
May determine that entity " good hotel " 204 is the sole entity in entity subset.As sound
Should, can be with rewritten query to explicitly refer to " good hotel ".Look into for example, it is possible to rewrite
Ask [showing me room grading] to provide the inquiry [the good hotel of grading, room] improved.Permissible
There is provided, to search service, the inquiry improved, and the search in response to the inquiry improved can be received
Result.
With reference to Fig. 2 B, and in another example, receive search inquiry and [show me room
Grading], and determine there is the entity " good hotel " 204 in type [hotel], there is class
The entity " of sort hotel " 206 of type [hotel] and there is the entity in type [dining room]
" fabulous Pizza " 212 is in the threshold distance of the apparent position of subscriber equipment 202.Therefore,
Entity " good hotel " 204, entity " of sort hotel " 206 and entity " pole
Good Pizza " 212 it is included in entity set.In this example, it is determined that n-gram [room
Between], one or more in [grading] and [room grading] be associated with type [hotel].
