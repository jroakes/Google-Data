- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a transmitter 10, for use in a mobile station such as mobile station 216, for generating second signal 215.
- a data bit stream 17 enters a variable-rate coder 19, which produces a signal 21 comprised of a series of transmit channel frames (discussed further below) having varying transmit data rates.
- the transmit data rate of each frame depends on the characteristics of data bit stream 17.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram of a transmit channel frame 20, produced by coder 19, for transmission at a rate of 9600 bits per second (bps) (unless otherwise specified, all IS-95 reverse-link channel examples herein correspond to a 9600 bps transmission rate).
- Frame 20 includes: an information portion 22 having 172 information bits; a frame quality indicator portion 24, calculated from information portion 22 according to a polynomial set forth in IS-95, at sec. 6.1.3.3.2.1 of IS-95; and eight encoder tail bits 26.
- encoder block 28 includes a convolutional encoder 30 and an interleaver 32.
- each frame 20 may be encoded by a rate 1/3encoder using well-known algorithms such as convolutional encoding algorithms which facilitate subsequent decoding of frames 20.
- Interleaver 32 operates to shuffle the contents of frames 20 using commonly-known techniques such as block interleaving techniques.
- each frame 34 of digitally coded and interleaved bits includes ninety-six groups of six coded bits, for a total of 576 bits.
- Each group of six coded bits represents an index 35 to one of sixty-four symbols such as Walsh codes.
- a Walsh code corresponds to a single row or column of a sixty-four-by-sixty-four Hadamard matrix, a square matrix of bits with a dimension that is a power of two.
- the bits comprising a Walsh code are referred to as Walsh chips.
- each of the ninety-six Walsh code indices 35 in frame 34 are input to an M-ary orthogonal modulator 36, which is preferably a sixty-four-ary orthogonal modulator.
- M-ary orthogonal modulator 36 For each input Walsh code index 35, M-ary orthogonal modulator 36 generates at output 38 a corresponding sixty-four-bit Walsh code W 39.
- W 39 a series of ninety-six Walsh codes W 39 is generated for each frame 34 input to M-ary orthogonal modulator 36.
- Scrambler/spreader block 40 applies a pseudorandom noise (PN) sequence to the series of Walsh codes W 39 using well-known scrambling techniques.
- PN pseudorandom noise
- the scrambled series of Walsh codes W 39 is phase modulated using an offset binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation process or another modulation process, up-converted and transmitted as communication signal S(T) 12 from antenna 46.
- BPSK offset binary phase-shift keying
- FIG. 6 is a partial block diagram of base station 212 (shown in FIG. 2), including a receiver 60, constructed according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- Base stations 210 and 214 are similarly constructed.
- Receiver 60 may detect a communication signal R(T) 14, such as second signal 215, traveling from mobile station 216 to base station 212.
- Receiver 60 is preferably a RAKE receiver having a number of fingers, although only a single finger is shown.
- Receiver 60 may be coherent, non-coherent or quasi-coherent.
- Antenna 62 receives communication signal R(T) 18, which comprises a number of received frames (discussed further below). Front-end processing such as filtering, frequency down-converting and phase demodulation of communication signal R(T) 18 is performed by well-known methods and circuits at block 64.
- receiver 60 When search input 300 is selected, receiver 60 operates as a searcher, the operation and construction of searchers being generally well-known, in an effort to lock onto received signal R(T) 18 at approximately the time of reception of R(T) 18. Receiver 60 looks for R(T) 18 at a plurality of time offsets. Once receiver 60 has locked onto signal R(T) 18 at the time offset which approximates the actual time of reception of R(T) 18, receiver 60 may activate demodulate input 301, and reassign the RAKE finger based on the best estimate of the time of reception of signal R(T) 18.
- De-scrambler/de-spreader block 66 removes the PN code applied by scrambler block 44 (shown in FIG. 3) to the series of Walsh codes W 39 (also shown in FIG. 3).
- a received frame (discussed further below) of received signal 18 includes ninety-six received symbols, or Walsh codes, which are each sixty-four bits long.
- FIG. 7 is a diagram representing a received frame 45 that has emerged from de-scrambler/de-spreader block 66.
- Received frame 45 includes ninety-six groups of sixty-four received signal samples, each group of received signal samples RS 68 corresponding to a transmitted Walsh code.
- Each group of signal samples has been corrupted by, for example, a slowly-changing channel parameter such as time delay D 14 (shown in FIG. 1) and a channel variable such as N 16 (also shown in FIG. 1).
- each received group of received signal samples RS 68 is input to an orthogonal demodulator 70, such as a Fast Hadamard Transform (FHT).
- FHT 70 may be implemented using commercially available hardware as an array of adders or as a multiplexed adder, depending on its size.
- FHT 70 may be implemented utilizing a conventional digital signal processor (DSP) such as a Motorola DSP, part no. 56166 or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC).
- DSP digital signal processor
- ASIC application specific integrated circuit
- FHT 70 Upon receiving a group of received signal samples RS 68, FHT 70 generates a number of output signals 72. Sixty-four output signals 72 are generated per signal sample group RS 68 in the IS-95 reverse-link channel. Each output signal 72 has an index which references one of the sixty-four possible Walsh codes W 39 generated by M-ary orthogonal modulator 36 (shown in FIG. 3). Thus, in the IS-95 reverse link channel, when a received signal sample group RS 68 is input to FHT 70, sixty-four output signals 72 which correlate to sixty-four possible transmitted Walsh codes 39 are produced. It should be understood that in addition to having an index, each output signal 72 also has an associated complex number, C. For simplicity, the index and the complex number will be referred to collectively as output signal 72.
- Each output signal 72 further has an associated energy value C 2 (not shown), commonly calculated by magnitude-squaring the complex number C associated with output signal 72.
- the energy value C 2 generally corresponds to a measure of confidence, or a likelihood, that output signal 72 indexes a Walsh code W 39 which corresponds to a group of received signal samples RS input to FHT 70. In about twenty percent of the cases, however, the energy value C 2 representing the highest measure of confidence is wrong--that is, output signal 72 associated with the greatest energy value C 2 does not actually index a Walsh code W 39 which was transmitted.
- Decoder block 76 which may include a de-interleaver 78 and a convolutional decoder 80, further demodulates received signal R(T) 18, that is, second signal 215, estimating transmitted signal S(T) (shown in FIG. 3), which is comprised of a series of channel frames, to form a series of demodulated frames (discussed further below).
- Decoder block 76 may be implemented in a variety of ways. For example, a Maximum Likelihood decoder, implemented in hardware or software according to well-known methods, may be used within decoder block 76.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a demodulated frame 85 which appears at output 81 of decoder block 76.
- Demodulated frame 85 includes a demodulated information portion 86, a demodulated frame quality indicator 88, and may also include a demodulated tail bit portion 89.
- a demultiplexer 90 separates demodulated information portion 86 of frame 85 from demodulated frame quality indicator 88.
- Frame quality indicator circuit 92 uses demodulated portion 86 to calculate a re-computed frame quality indicator 93.
- Re-computed frame quality indicator 93 is then compared to demodulated frame quality indicator 88 at comparator 94, to determine whether a particular demodulated frame 85 matches a particular channel frame 20 produced by coder 19.
- demodulated frame 85 does not match channel frame 20, it fails, and is discarded by switch 96 at point 97.
- demodulated frame 85 matches transmit channel frame 20, demodulated frame 85 passes. As shown in FIG. 6, demodulated frame 85 has passed. Demodulated information portion 86 is passed by switch 96 at point 91 to re-encoder block 98, which is preferably substantially similar to encoder block 28, depicted in FIG. 3. Thus, an encoded frame 34 exiting re-encoder block 98 is essentially a reproduction of frame 34 (shown in FIG. 5), which may be referred to as a reference frame or a reference signal. As illustrated in FIG. 5, encoded frame 34 includes up to ninety-six groups of six coded bits, each group of six coded bits representing an index 35 to one of sixty-four Walsh codes.
- base station 212 would have obtained a good estimate of channel parameter information such as time delay D 14 from which the distance between mobile station 216 and base station 212 could be determined.
- time delay D 14 To accurately determine the location of mobile 216 using the trilateration method, however, it is desirable to know the distances between mobile station 216 and at least two other base stations, such as base stations 210 and 214. These distances may be determined from time delays of a communication signal such as signals 215 or 217 transmitted from mobile station 216 to base stations 210 and 214.
- base station 212 may, according to one embodiment of the present invention, re-transmit first signal 213 to mobile station 216, receiving in response a retransmitted second signal 217, substantially identical to originally transmitted second signal 215.
- Base station 212 may communicate originally transmitted second signal 215, present at output 81 of decoder block 76, or may alternatively communicate the reference signal which has been output as re-encoded frame 34 from block 98, to base stations 210 and 214.
- Base stations 210 and 214 also receive retransmitted signal 217. Then, receiver 60 in all three base stations may operate as a special searcher to accurately determine the time delays of communication signal 217 between mobile station 216 and base stations 210, 212 and 214.
- receiver 60 may re-M-ary orthogonally modulate each of the ninety-six Walsh code indices 35 in re-encoded frame 34. For each input Walsh code index 35, a sixty-four-bit signal sample group, or Walsh code, is generated. Thus, a series of ninety-six Walsh codes is generated for each frame 34.
- the M-ary orthogonally modulated signal may be re-scrambled and re-spread by applying a PN sequence to the series of Walsh codes using well-known scrambling techniques.
- the re-modulation and re-scrambling/spreading processes are preferably substantially similar to the corresponding processes in transmitter 10 of mobile station 216, described in connection with FIG. 3.
- the re-modulated indices 35 are then correlated with the received signal samples RS 68 associated with communication signal 217 at a plurality of time offsets.
- the time offset at which re-transmitted second signal 217 and re-encoded originally-transmitted second signal 215 have a high degree of correlation may be output from correlator 100 at line 131.
- correlator 100 may compare, at a plurality of time offsets, a particular encoded index 35 (shown in FIG. 5) of a particular frame 34 received from re-encoder block 98 to re-transmitted second signal 217 at the point where an output signal 72 corresponding to the particular index corresponding to encoded index 35 exits FHT 70.
- the time offset at which a frame of re-transmitted second signal 217 and a frame of re-encoded originally-transmitted second signal 215 has a high degree of correlation may be output from correlator 100 at line 131.
- the time delays D 14, and hence the distances, between mobile station 216 and each base station 210, 212 and 214 may be determined by comparing, at block 130, the time offsets at which the high degree of correlation occurred with a central time source 140.
- the signals to be correlated may span a time duration much longer than the channel coherent time, and the special search process may be realized in two steps.
- received signal samples 68 and re-modulated indices 35 are first each divided into a plurality of segments, preferably of equal length, each segment spanning a time duration less than the channel coherent time, and correlations are performed over each pair of segments.
- the correlation results which are complex numbers, are magnitude-squared and summed together to form the final search results.
- the second step may be referred to as non-coherent combining.
- the special search process may be performed using FHT 70.
- the received signal sample groups exiting de-scrambler/de-spreader block 66 are divided into a plurality of segments, each of which spans a time duration less than the channel coherent time.
- Each group of received signal samples is processed by FHT 70 and the complex number output C with the index equal to the corresponding re-encoded 6-bit group is selected.
- these selected FHT outputs are summed to form a combined complex FHT output.
- the combined complex FHT output is magnitude-squared and summed with the magnitude-squared combined complex FHT outputs from other segments to form the final search results.
- mobile station 216 does not transmit signal 217.
- a memory 110 which may be a commercially available computer-readable random-access memory, for example, may be positioned at a point within receiver 60 in base stations 210, 212 and 214 to capture second signal 215 as it is received. As shown in FIG. 6, memory 110 is responsive to front end processing block 64, to descrambler/despreader block 66 and to demodulator 70, although it may also be responsive to other receiver elements. Then, search processes as described herein may be performed for the captured second signal in base stations 210, 212 and 214 to determine the time delays, or the distances, between mobile station 216 and the base stations.
- the estimated memory size is 0.5 Mbytes per 0.1 second of samples, when the number of samples stored is two times the Walsh chip rate.
- second signal 215 may be any normal traffic signal transmitted by mobile station 216, without the preceding transmission of first signal 213 from base station 212.
- base stations 210, 212 and 214 would preferably store signal 215 at a common predetermined time. It may be desirable, however, to direct mobile station 216 to transmit at a full-rate, for example, by sending first signal 213 to request that mobile station 216 transmit a blank-and-burst or dim-and-burst signal, to ensure that signal 215 includes full-rate frames.
- a method for determining time delay D 14 resulting from second signal 215 or 217 traveling between mobile station 216 and base station 212 may be summarized as follows: a delayed signal R(T) 18 represented at the output of FHT 70 as a number of stored output signals 72 is known, either having been (1) retransmitted as second signal 217 by mobile station 216, or (2) transmitted by mobile station 216 as signal 215 and captured in memory 110. Values of S(T) 12 corresponding to R(T) 18 are given by indices 35 of encoded frames 34 exiting re-encoder block 98.
- Correlator 100 correlates the received signals and the re-modulated and/or re-spread and re-scrambled signals, or, as the case may be, determines differences between output signals 72 and matching corresponding indices 35, and forwards to delay estimator 130 at line 131 the time offset at which correlation between a frame of R(T) 18 and a frame of S(T) 12 is high.
- Calculation of the correct time offset for a particular frame is generally corrupted only by an amount of noise N 16.
- the time offset calculations may be performed over a period of time, for example, for several frames.
- the selected time offset at line 131 is compared with a central time source 140, such as a 20 millisecond integral multiple of the IS-95 System Time available at base station 212, to estimate time delay D 14 of second signal 215 or 217 from mobile station 216 to base stations 210, 212 and 214.
- a central time source 140 such as a 20 millisecond integral multiple of the IS-95 System Time available at base station 212
- a controller such as base station controller 250 or mobile station controller 260, may initiate a command to one or more base stations such as base stations 210, 212 and 214 to determine time delay D 14 of a signal 215 or 217 traveling from mobile station 216 to base stations 210, 212 and 214, as described above. Then, time delays D 14 calculated by each base station may be forwarded, along with base station identification information, to a central location such as base station controller 250 or mobile switching center 260.
- Location of mobile station 216 may be determined by considering time delays D 14 for each base station, along with the two- or three-dimensional geographic coordinates of the receiving base stations, and calculating the unique point (or small region of highest probability) where the signal propagation paths between the base stations and the mobile station intersect. For example, a suitable calculation for determining the geographic coordinates of mobile station 216 is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,708 to Ghosh et al., incorporated herein by reference.
- One preferred method for determining a location of a mobile station in a spread spectrum communication system is outlined in the flowchart of FIG. 9.
- the method starts at block 400, and continues to block 402, where a first base station transmits a first signal to a mobile station.
- the first base station receives a second signal from the mobile station, in response to the first signal.
- the first base station demodulates the second signal to form a demodulated signal, and at block 408 the first base station re-encodes the demodulated signal to form a reference signal.
- the second base station receives the reference signal at block 410.
- the first and second base stations receive a retransmitted second signal at block 412, the retransmitted second signal sent from the mobile station in response to a retransmitted first signal directed to the mobile station.
- the first and second base stations compare the retransmitted second signal with the reference signal at a first time and at a second time. Based on the comparisons at the first base station, at block 416, a first delay of the retransmitted second signal is determined, the first delay representing a travel time of the retransmitted second signal from the mobile station to the first base station.
- a second delay of the retransmitted second signal is determined, the second delay representing a travel time of the retransmitted second signal from the mobile station to the second base station.
- the location of the mobile station is determined based on the first and second delays.
- the second base station may receive the demodulated signal and both the first base station and the second base station may re-modulate the demodulated signal to form the reference signal.
- both the first and second base stations may store the first signal in a memory such as memory 110, demodulate the first signal to form a demodulated signal, re-modulate the demodulated signal, and compare the re-modulated signal with the contents of the memory.
- base station receivers 60 have prior knowledge of the exact signal S(T) 12, for example, signal 215 or 217 transmitted by mobile station 216.
- a receiver 60 operating as a searcher may determine time delay D 14 associated with received signal R(T) by correlating signal R(T) 18 with transmitted signal S(T) 12 at a number of offset times over a long integration period, for example, over two or more frames. This method may result in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of up to 12 dB, and should significantly shrink coverage holes.
