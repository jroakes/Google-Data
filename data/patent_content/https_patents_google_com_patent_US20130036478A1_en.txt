- Output module 308 may prepare the emails in responsive emails repository 208 for further review by a user, for segregation from the responsive documents due to privilege, or for production as non-privileged, responsive documents.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations that may be performed in an embodiment.
- a responsive document e.g. an email
- a responsive set of documents 400 is searched for, for example, attorney names maintained in repository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery and privileged terms maintained in repository 214 containing an identification of privilege terms.
- Inputs received for conducting searches such as attorney names or privilege terms, may be automatically or manually generated.
- an attorney names list 404 or a privilege terms list 406 may be received for searching a responsive document.
- stage 408 if no attorney name and no privilege terms are found, then in stage 410 the responsive document is identified or marked for production.
- documents may be identified or marked for production by setting a flag in the document record.
- documents may be identified or marked for production by segregating the document from non-produced documents. Downstream determination of privilege will ignore those documents already identified as not privileged, i.e., to be produced.
- stage 408 If, in stage 408 , an attorney name or privilege term is found, then the document is identified as potentially privileged and, in stage 412 , the responsive document is searched for an adverse party in the last-in-time (“LIT”) to:, from:, cc:, or bcc: fields, and the email address are extracted.
- LIT last-in-time
- a communication is the LIT communication when it is at the top of, or is the most recent communication in, a string of communications such as an email thread.
- LIT communication 106 appears at the top of email thread 102 and has the most recent timestamp of all messages in email thread 102 .
- stage 414 if the email contains an adverse party in a LIT field, then in 416 the email is identified as not privileged.
- Emails are not privileged because the entire document has been shared with an adverse party by virtue of the LIT communication, so privilege is broken and the document should be produced.
- Documents may be identified as not privileged by, for example, setting a flag in the document record or segregating the document from the potentially privileged documents.
- the responsive document does not contain an adverse party in a LIT field
- the responsive document is searched for an adverse party in the body of the document, i.e., not involved in the LIT communication.
- stage 420 if communication involving an adverse party is found in the body of the document, then in stage 422 the portion of the document later in time or more recent than the communication involving an adverse party should be redacted.
- the communication involving the adverse party and any communication earlier in time have already been disclosed to an adverse party, and privilege is broken for that portion of the document. The remainder of the document should be redacted before production.
- stage 424 the responsive document is searched for an attorney name in the LIT communication.
- stage 426 if an attorney name is found in the LIT communication, then in stage 428 the document is identified as privileged or most likely privileged. These emails likely are privileged based on attorney advice content by virtue of the LIT communication, so further privilege review may be necessary. If, in stage 426 , an attorney name is not found in the LIT communication, then in stage 430 the responsive document is searched again for an attorney name appearing in a position in the document other than in the LIT communication.
- stage 432 if an attorney name is found in the body of the document, i.e., in a position other than the LIT communication, then in stage 434 , the attorney communication and any later in time communication should be redacted and the document identified for production.
- the attorney communication and later in time communication are candidates for redaction because the portion of the document relating to attorney advice should be redacted, while portions of the email preceding and following the communication with the attorney that are not attorney-client privileged should be produced.
- stage 436 the responsive document is identified as not attorney-client privileged and is output for further analysis regarding work product privilege and/or indirect attorney advice based on privilege terms found in stage 402 that lead to the document being identified as potentially privileged. In this manner, a lesser number of documents are output for manual review compared to previous methods, thus saving review time and resources.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations for automatically generating an attorney names list and an adverse parties list that may be performed in an embodiment.
- These lists can be maintained in repositories such as repository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery and repository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery.
- repositories such as repository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery and repository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery.
- These lists can optionally be used in an embodiment such as that illustrated in FIG. 4 to identify and redact privileged information.
- LIT email addresses are extracted from a responsive document, e.g. an email, from the responsive set of documents 500 .
- these email addresses are searched for addresses from the domain of the party conducting e-discovery, indicating the email address potentially belongs to a company employee.
- the identified email addresses are searched to determine whether in-house counsel email addresses are present.
- a list of in-house counsel 510 may be provided as an input.
- the email addresses searched are removed from the list generation analysis. If, in stage 512 , email addresses of in-house counsel are found, then in stage 516 the identified email addresses are added to the list of attorney names generated.
- stage 506 email addresses from the domain of the party conducting e-discovery are not found, then in stage 518 the email addresses are searched to determine whether outside counsel email addresses or email addresses belonging to vendors or consultants related to the litigation are present. In stage 520 , if email addresses of outside counsel, litigation vendor personnel, or litigation consultants are found, then the identified email addresses are added to the list of attorney names generated 516 .
- stage 520 email addresses of outside counsel, litigation vendor personnel, or litigation consultants are not found, then in stage 522 the email addresses are searched to determine whether email addresses of adverse parties are present. In stage 524 , if email addresses of adverse parties are found, then in stage 526 the identified email addresses are added to the list of adverse parties generated. If in stage 524 email addresses of adverse parties are not found, then in stage 528 the email addresses searched are removed from the list generation analysis.
- FIG. 6 illustrated therein is an exemplary responsive email before redaction 602 and after redaction 604 according to one embodiment.
- first email message in thread 606 occurs between two employees of the company and is not privileged.
- the next communications 608 seek out and result in advice from an attorney.
- These communications are identified by e-discovery server 204 as privileged and can be automatically redacted 610 by output module 308 .
- the identification of outside counsel in the LIT communication based on domain name can be used to automatically generate a list of attorney names for use in subsequent responsive email processing.

Abstract
Description
- This application claims priority to Indian Provisional Application No. 2698/CHE/2011, filed Aug. 5, 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- Embodiments generally relate to electronic discovery systems and methods in the context of litigation and applications thereof.
- In litigation, significant cost is expended through the process of discovery. As organizations increasingly maintain documents and emails in electronic form, the universe of documents potentially relevant to a given litigation matter is also increasing. Currently, parties to litigation incur time and expense in collecting, reviewing, and producing this electronic discovery or e-discovery. A manual review of documents identified as responsive in a litigation contributes significantly to this cost. Parties to litigation require a cost effective way to balance the goal of identifying and producing all material relevant to a litigation without damaging their case through inadvertent disclosure of privileged information.
- Disclosed herein are systems and methods relating to identifying and redacting privileged information automatically in electronic discovery documents such as emails.
- In an embodiment, a method for redacting privileged information from an email thread includes: identifying a set of email threads containing one or more potentially privileged emails; locating a particular email thread in the set of email threads containing correspondence with a non-privileged party; when the correspondence with the non-privileged party is a last-in-time email, marking the email thread as non-privileged; and when the correspondence with the non-privileged party is not the last-in-time email, automatically redacting emails from the email thread that are later in time than the correspondence with the non-privileged party.
- In another embodiment, a method for redacting privileged information from an email thread includes: identifying a set of email threads containing one or more potentially privileged emails; locating a particular email thread in the set of email threads containing correspondence with a privileged party; and when the correspondence with the privileged party is not the last-in-time email, automatically redacting emails from the email thread that are later in time than the correspondence with the privileged party, including the correspondence with the privileged party.
- In another embodiment, a computer implemented method for redacting, at a server, privileged information from an email thread includes: receiving, at the server, an email thread containing potentially privileged information; searching the email thread for an adverse party in a last-in-time communication; searching the email thread for an adverse party not in the last-in-time communication; searching the email thread for an attorney in the last-in-time communication; searching the email thread for an attorney not in the last-in-time communication; determining a portion of the email thread that is privileged; and automatically redacting the portion of the email thread that is privileged.
- In another embodiment, a computer-based system for redacting privileged information from an email thread includes: one or more processors; one or more repositories configured to store at least one of responsive documents, privileged parties, adverse parties, or privilege terms; a privilege determination module configured to receive a selected one of the responsive documents and to determine whether the selected responsive one of the responsive documents is privileged based on the presence of at least one of the privileged parties, adverse parties, or privileged terms; and an output module configured to redact portions of the selected responsive document based on the privilege determination of the privilege determination module.
- In another embodiment, a tangible computer program product includes a computer readable storage medium having computer program logic recorded thereon that, when executed by a processor, causes the processor to: identify a set of email threads containing, one or more potentially privileged emails; locate a particular email thread in the set of email threads containing correspondence with a non-privileged party; when the correspondence with the non-privileged party is a last-in-time email, mark the email thread as non-privileged; and when the correspondence with the non-privileged party is not the last-in-time email, automatically redact emails from the email thread that are later in time than the correspondence with the non-privileged party.
- Further embodiments, features, and advantages, as well as the structure and operation of the various embodiments, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.
- Embodiments are described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers may indicate identical or functionally similar elements. These figures are intended to be illustrative, not limiting.

- Overview
- Embodiments relate to systems and methods for identifying responsive and potentially privileged documents in an email collection and marking the emails for review and production. Email, as used herein, refers to any digital medium for exchanging messages from an author to one or more recipients. In one embodiment, the system identifies documents for redaction based on a ranking of the likelihood of privilege, whether a redaction is necessary, and/or the presence of adverse third parties in emails. In an embodiment, the system uses a list of email recipients to identify documents likely to require redaction, documents most likely to be privileged, documents least likely to be privileged, and documents for which no viable privilege claim can be made.
- Electronic discovery is a costly component of litigation. In particular, the proliferation of email communication in the modern business entity has resulted in an exponential increase in the amount of electronic files generated by these entities. A party to a litigation must strike a careful balance between fulfilling its duty to respond fully and completely to discovery requests from the opposing party and ensuring that only responsive documents are produced. Conducting a manual review of electronic documents including email is quickly becoming virtually impossible within any reasonable time frame and budget. Reviewing emails for privileged information provides an added level of complexity because of the additional level of scrutiny required. In the case of attorney-client privilege, for example, not all communications within a particular email thread may be privileged, and thus, it may not be proper to withhold as privileged that portion of the email thread that does not constitute an attorney-client communication.
-
FIG. 1 is an illustration of an example thread ofemail communications 102 containing both privileged and non-privileged information. An email thread may be a first email and the sequence of successive email messages following and related to the first email. Afirst email 104 in thread ofemails 102 is an attorney-client privileged email from a company employee to another employee and a company lawyer. Privileged communication is not to be disclosed during discovery; however, in thisparticular email thread 102, alater email 106 from a company employee to an adverse, outside party disclosed the contents of the entire thread, thus breaking privilege. Embodiments of the systems and methods disclosed herein are related to automated review of electronic documents identified in litigation as being potentially responsive to a matter at issue in a litigation, and identifying and redacting privileged information in emails automatically where appropriate. -
FIG. 2 illustrates a client-server architecture according to an embodiment. One ormore e-discovery clients 202 may be connected to ane-discovery server 204 over anetwork 206. Network 206 can be any network or combination of networks that can carry data communications, and may be referred to herein as a computer network.Such network 206 can include, but is not limited to, a local area network, medium area network, and/or wide area network such as the Internet. Network 206 can support protocols and technology including, but not limited to, World Wide Web protocols and/or services. Intermediate web servers, gateways, or other servers may be provided between components ofFIG. 2 , depending upon a particular application or environment. -
Server 204 is connected to one or more data repositories such as databases. A data repository may be located on a storage location, or may be distributed across multiple storage locations. In the embodiment ofFIG. 2 ,server 204 is connected to arepository 208 of e-discovery documents, for example, email documents that have been identified as responsive to a litigation issue. Emails maintained inrepository 208 of e-discovery documents may be in native format or in searchable image format. In some embodiments,server 204 may also be connected to arepository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery. Attorney identifiers maintained inrepository 210 may include, for example and without limitation, attorney names, initials, nicknames and/or email addresses. In some embodiments,server 204 may also be connected to arepository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery. These adverse parties can be opposing litigants, attorneys and agents of opposing litigants, or other parties adverse to the litigant. Adverse parties may be identified by, for example, names of individuals, law firm names, company names, email addresses, domain names, initials, or other adverse party identifiers maintained inrepository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery. In some embodiments,server 204 may also be connected to arepository 214 containing an identification of privilege terms. Privilege terms may be terms identified by, for example, the litigant or the litigant's counsel as terms likely to indicate that the subject of the email is privileged. -
E-discovery server 204 may receive as input documents fromrepository 208 of e-discovery documents. In an embodiment,e-discovery server 204 can identify whether a document potentially contains privileged information by comparing the information in the email with information maintained in, for example,repository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery,repository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery, and/orrepository 214 containing an identification of privilege terms. - In some embodiments,
server 204 may be connected to ane-discovery client 202 that allows a user to review e-discovery documents. In other embodiments,e-discovery client 202 may allow the user to prepare relevant e-discovery for production in the litigation. - In some embodiments,
e-discovery server 204 may implement modules for performing automated redaction of privileged information. As illustrated inFIG. 3 ,e-discovery server 204 may contain anemail extraction module 302.Email extraction module 302 may receive as input one or more emails maintained inrepository 208 of e-discovery documents.Email extraction module 302 identifies the message headers contained in a particular email message thread.Email extraction module 302 may extract email addresses for comparison against email addresses maintained inrepository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery orrepository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery.Email extraction module 304 may identify the email received as input as potentially privileged or not privileged depending on whether an email address maintained in therepository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery or an email address maintained inrepository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery is found in the email thread. -
E-discovery server 204 may contain adomain extraction module 304.Domain extraction module 304 may receive as input one or more emails maintained inrepository 208 of e-discovery documents.Domain extraction module 304 identifies the message headers contained in a particular email message thread.Domain extraction module 304 may extract domain names from the message headers for comparison against domain names maintained in therepository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery orrepository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery. For example, if an email message contains an email address having the domain name mylawyer.com,domain extraction module 304 can compare this domain to those maintained in therepository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery orrepository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery to determine whether the domain name belongs to attorneys of the litigant or to an adverse party.Domain extraction module 304 may identify the email received as input as potentially privileged or not privileged depending on whether a domain name maintained in therepository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing, the litigant conducting e-discovery or a domain name maintained inrepository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery is found in the email thread. -
E-discovery server 204 may contain aprivilege determination module 306.Privilege determination module 306 may receive as input one or more emails maintained inrepository 208 of e-discovery documents.Privilege determination module 306 identifies whether privilege terms maintained inrepository 214 containing an identification of privilege terms are contained in a particular email message thread.Privilege determination module 306 may identify the email received as input as potentially privileged or not privileged depending on whether the privilege term is found in the email thread. -
E-discovery server 204 may contain anoutput module 308.Output module 308 may receive as input one or more emails maintained inrepository 208 of e-discovery documents.Output module 306 may redact a portion of the email depending on the determinations made byemail extraction module 302,domain extraction module 304, orprivilege determination module 306.Output module 308 may prepare the emails inresponsive emails repository 208 for further review by a user, for segregation from the responsive documents due to privilege, or for production as non-privileged, responsive documents. -
FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations that may be performed in an embodiment. Instage 402, a responsive document, e.g. an email, from the responsive set ofdocuments 400 is searched for, for example, attorney names maintained inrepository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery and privileged terms maintained inrepository 214 containing an identification of privilege terms. Inputs received for conducting searches, such as attorney names or privilege terms, may be automatically or manually generated. For example, instage 402, an attorney names list 404 or a privilege terms list 406 may be received for searching a responsive document. Instage 408, if no attorney name and no privilege terms are found, then instage 410 the responsive document is identified or marked for production. In some embodiments, documents may be identified or marked for production by setting a flag in the document record. Alternatively or in addition, in some embodiments documents may be identified or marked for production by segregating the document from non-produced documents. Downstream determination of privilege will ignore those documents already identified as not privileged, i.e., to be produced. - If, in
stage 408, an attorney name or privilege term is found, then the document is identified as potentially privileged and, instage 412, the responsive document is searched for an adverse party in the last-in-time (“LIT”) to:, from:, cc:, or bcc: fields, and the email address are extracted. A communication is the LIT communication when it is at the top of, or is the most recent communication in, a string of communications such as an email thread. InFIG. 1 ,LIT communication 106 appears at the top ofemail thread 102 and has the most recent timestamp of all messages inemail thread 102. Instage 414, if the email contains an adverse party in a LIT field, then in 416 the email is identified as not privileged. These emails are not privileged because the entire document has been shared with an adverse party by virtue of the LIT communication, so privilege is broken and the document should be produced. Documents may be identified as not privileged by, for example, setting a flag in the document record or segregating the document from the potentially privileged documents. - If, in
stage 414, the responsive document does not contain an adverse party in a LIT field, then instage 418 the responsive document is searched for an adverse party in the body of the document, i.e., not involved in the LIT communication. Instage 420, if communication involving an adverse party is found in the body of the document, then instage 422 the portion of the document later in time or more recent than the communication involving an adverse party should be redacted. The communication involving the adverse party and any communication earlier in time have already been disclosed to an adverse party, and privilege is broken for that portion of the document. The remainder of the document should be redacted before production. - If, in
stage 420, no adverse party communication is found in the body of the responsive document, then instage 424 the responsive document is searched for an attorney name in the LIT communication. Instage 426, if an attorney name is found in the LIT communication, then instage 428 the document is identified as privileged or most likely privileged. These emails likely are privileged based on attorney advice content by virtue of the LIT communication, so further privilege review may be necessary. If, instage 426, an attorney name is not found in the LIT communication, then instage 430 the responsive document is searched again for an attorney name appearing in a position in the document other than in the LIT communication. Instage 432, if an attorney name is found in the body of the document, i.e., in a position other than the LIT communication, then instage 434, the attorney communication and any later in time communication should be redacted and the document identified for production. The attorney communication and later in time communication are candidates for redaction because the portion of the document relating to attorney advice should be redacted, while portions of the email preceding and following the communication with the attorney that are not attorney-client privileged should be produced. If, instage 432, no attorney name is found in the responsive communication, then in stage 436, the responsive document is identified as not attorney-client privileged and is output for further analysis regarding work product privilege and/or indirect attorney advice based on privilege terms found instage 402 that lead to the document being identified as potentially privileged. In this manner, a lesser number of documents are output for manual review compared to previous methods, thus saving review time and resources. -
FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations for automatically generating an attorney names list and an adverse parties list that may be performed in an embodiment. These lists can be maintained in repositories such asrepository 210 containing an identification of attorneys representing the litigant conducting e-discovery andrepository 212 containing an identification of parties adverse to the litigant conducting e-discovery. These lists can optionally be used in an embodiment such as that illustrated inFIG. 4 to identify and redact privileged information. - In
stage 502, LIT email addresses are extracted from a responsive document, e.g. an email, from the responsive set ofdocuments 500. Instage 504, these email addresses are searched for addresses from the domain of the party conducting e-discovery, indicating the email address potentially belongs to a company employee. Instage 506, if email addresses from the domain of the party conducting e-discovery are found, then instage 508 the identified email addresses are searched to determine whether in-house counsel email addresses are present. A list of in-house counsel 510 may be provided as an input. Instage 512, if email addresses of in-house counsel are not found, then instage 514 the email addresses searched are removed from the list generation analysis. If, instage 512, email addresses of in-house counsel are found, then instage 516 the identified email addresses are added to the list of attorney names generated. - If, in
stage 506, email addresses from the domain of the party conducting e-discovery are not found, then instage 518 the email addresses are searched to determine whether outside counsel email addresses or email addresses belonging to vendors or consultants related to the litigation are present. Instage 520, if email addresses of outside counsel, litigation vendor personnel, or litigation consultants are found, then the identified email addresses are added to the list of attorney names generated 516. - If in
stage 520, email addresses of outside counsel, litigation vendor personnel, or litigation consultants are not found, then instage 522 the email addresses are searched to determine whether email addresses of adverse parties are present. Instage 524, if email addresses of adverse parties are found, then instage 526 the identified email addresses are added to the list of adverse parties generated. If instage 524 email addresses of adverse parties are not found, then instage 528 the email addresses searched are removed from the list generation analysis. - Turning to
FIG. 6 , illustrated therein is an exemplary responsive email beforeredaction 602 and afterredaction 604 according to one embodiment. In originalresponsive email 602, the first email message inthread 606 occurs between two employees of the company and is not privileged. Thenext communications 608 seek out and result in advice from an attorney. These communications are identified bye-discovery server 204 as privileged and can be automatically redacted 610 byoutput module 308. In addition, in another embodiment, the identification of outside counsel in the LIT communication based on domain name can be used to automatically generate a list of attorney names for use in subsequent responsive email processing. - In an embodiment, the system and components of embodiments described herein are implemented using well known computers, such as
