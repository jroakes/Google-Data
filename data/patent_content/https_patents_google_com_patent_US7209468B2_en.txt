Definitions
- the present invention relates broadly to wireless transceivers, including the design of a wireless transceiver as well as to forming ad hoc networks with wireless transceivers and to communication protocols between wireless transceivers.
- Wireless ad hoc networks allow node-to-node communication without central control or wired infrastructure. Such networks may have dynamic, randomly-changing, multihop topologies composed of wireless data communication links between the nodes. Ad hoc networks are advantageous because they are inexpensive, fault-tolerant, and flexible. Various known methods relate to data transmission within an ad hoc wireless data communication network. However, most known methods do not address self-configuration of wireless nodes for the formation and maintenance of efficient network topology.
- Known ad hoc networking methods typically organize the network on the basis of geographic proximity of the nodes or the strength of signals received by the various nodes.
- Known methods of ad hoc network organization also require nodes to regularly transmit network information to all other nodes in the network, which results in increased radio traffic and interference. Increased radio interference inhibits the formation and maintenance of ad hoc networks having a large number of nodes and requires nodes to transmit at a greater power, which reduces their battery life.
- Bluetooth radio technology Short range wireless technology utilizing standards based radio technology, such as the Bluetooth radio standard (hereinafter “Bluetooth”), promises to remove price barriers to mobile network use. By doing so, wireless devices are becoming available for applications where wired networks have been impracticable and in which prior wireless communication networks have been too expensive or inflexible.
- Bluetooth radio technology is an ad hoc networking solution for personal data applications, it provides for only a limited number of communication channels, thereby restricting the number of Bluetooth devices that can communicate over an ad hoc network at any given time.
- wireless data networks are known for use in warehouse management and other asset-tracking applications.
- existing wireless data network technologies are not well suited to asset tracking, which involves a large number of network nodes (e.g., hundreds or even thousands).
- existing wireless technologies are cost prohibitive, are prone to radio frequency (RF) interference, and consume a large amount of electrical power. Accordingly, wireless data networks are not commonly used in asset tracking.
- RF radio frequency
- Bluetooth radios Another obstacle to widespread implementation of the use of standards based radios, such as Bluetooth radios, especially in asset-tracking applications, is the limited life of the radio due to its power consumption.
- Each standards based radio associated with an asset being tracked often operates from a battery that is included within the housing of the radio.
- the battery is able to effectively power the radio for only a short period of time.
- a Bluetooth radio whether of the class 1, 2, or 3 type, utilizes about 40 mAh of current when actively receiving transmissions. Even in standby mode, wherein the radio is neither receiving nor transmitting but is in a low power consumption mode from which it can quickly return to an active state, such a radio utilizes about 10 mAh of current.
- Bluetooth radios therefore can be expected to last less than about ninety (90) days, and only half that long in fairly active asset-tracking applications.
- a method of forming a wireless data communication network among a plurality of transceivers includes the steps of: assigning a common designation to a population of transceivers; selecting a primary transceiver from among the population of transceivers, the remainder of the population of transceivers being secondary transceivers; and forming a common designation, hierarchical ad hoc network among the population of transceivers.
- Another aspect of the present invention includes forming a wireless data communication network among a plurality of transceivers by: assigning a first common designation to a first plurality of transceivers; assigning a second common designation to a second plurality of transceivers; and propagating first and second common designation, hierarchical ad hoc communication networks for transmitting data among the respective first and second pluralities of transceivers based on their respective common designations, the first hierarchical ad hoc communication network including a first root transceiver, and the second hierarchical ad hoc communication network including a second root transceiver.
- Still another aspect of the present invention includes the forming of a hierarchical ad hoc network, comprising the steps of: assigning a first common designation or a second common designation to each of a plurality of wireless transceivers, each of the wireless transceivers including a digital processor, a memory, and a common designation network formation routine operable on the digital processor; and initiating the routines of the wireless transceivers to automatically propagate, in the absence of central control, a first hierarchical ad hoc network among the wireless transceivers of the first common designation and a second hierarchical ad hoc network among the wireless transceivers of the second common designation, the first hierarchical network automatically being organized so that it is logically distinct from the second hierarchical network.
- the dynamic distributed hierarchical database system includes a plurality of computer units each having a respective common designation.
- Each computer unit includes: a memory unit for storing a profile representative of its common designation; an ad hoc common designation network formation routine in communication with the memory for establishing a hierarchical ad hoc network with other computer units based on a shared common designation of the computer units; and a query handling routine for interpreting and responding to database queries received from an application server which database queries are directed to computer units sharing the particular common designation.
- An additional aspect of the present invention pertains to a method of forming a wireless data communication network among transceivers, wherein each transceiver includes a designation with a first plurality of transceivers having a first common designation and a second plurality of transceivers having a second common designation different from the first common designation.
- the method includes the steps of: forming an ad hoc hierarchical class based network for each of the first plurality and second plurality of transceivers; and communicating to an external network from each transceiver of each ad hoc hierarchical class based network.
- Communication to the external network from each transceiver of each ad hoc hierarchical class based network is accomplished by establishing a communication link between each transceiver in a level of the ad hoc hierarchical common designation network, other than the highest level, with a transceiver in the next higher level of the ad hoc hierarchical common designation network such that transceivers pass communications upward in the ad hoc hierarchical common designation network; and establishing a communication link between a transceiver in the highest level of the ad hoc hierarchical common designation network and an external network access transceiver, such that communications from transceivers in the ad hoc hierarchical common designation network are passed through the transceiver in the highest level of the ad hoc hierarchical common designation network to the external network access transceiver.

- the method comprising the steps of: transmitting a communication at a first power level such that only a first group of transceivers receive the broadcast, with the communication including a command causing each of the first group of transceivers not to respond to a subsequent broadcast; and subsequent thereto, transmitting a communication at a second power level greater than the first power level such that a second group of transceivers greater than and including the first group of transceivers receive the broadcast, but such that only a limited number of transceivers of the second group respond to the broadcast.
- the limited number of transceivers excludes the first group of transceivers.
- the plurality of transceivers actually exceeds the number of transceivers from which communications simultaneously can be received by the transceiver without radio frequency interference due to its channel capacity.
- the first group of transceivers comprises a number not greater than the number of transceivers from which communications can be received by the transceiver without radio frequency interference due to its channel capacity.

In this regard, a Wireless Reader Tag is capable of transmitting at different power levels. By transmitting a different consecutive power levels, a Wireless Reader Tag may read a large number of Wireless Tags that otherwise would not be read due to RF interference.

- the preferred WRT architecture significantly prolongs the useful life of a WRT.
- FIG. 23 illustrates in block diagram a Gateway 5000 making a WRT broadcast 5002 to a plurality of WRTs 5008 in accordance with the present invention.
- the Gateway 5000 represents the juncture between the networks formed by the WRTs 5008 and an external network, such as the Internet.
- the Gateway 5000 is the Network Interface Module (“NIM”) in FIG. 23 providing the wireless interface into the radio network of and controlling the messaging to the WRTs 5008 .
- the Gateway 5000 preferably includes software allowing it make broadcasts to and communicate with the WRTs 5008 .
- the Gateway 5000 preferably sends out a low frequency message in the band of the LPRF communications component 5010 of the WRTs 5008 (described in detail below).
- the message m(t) preferably is modulated on a carrier frequency, and the m(t) is likely to have a bias (k) due to the other radio communications in the same band.
- the m(t) will significantly reduce false turn on and provide the mechanism to wake the radios based on an object identifier, name, or classification (as described in detail below, once the WT component in the WRT receives the proper message from the Gateway, the WT component “wakes up” the LPRF communications component in the WRT).
- the Gateway 5000 In forwarding communications between the external network and the radio network of the WRTs 5008 , the Gateway 5000 translates a radio link protocol to Ethernet, PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), Mobile Phones (including GSM, TDMA, CDMA, PDC, AMPS, Ricochet, etc.) and other data communications networks that allows the information to be transferred to a database on the Internet or an Intranet.
- PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network
- Mobile Phones including GSM, TDMA, CDMA, PDC, AMPS, Ricochet, etc.
- the Gateway 5000 thus serves an external network communications function, providing the WRTs 5008 with an avenue for communication to external devices connected to the Internet.
- the Gateway 5000 itself preferably includes a network card component 5004 for interfacing with the external network using the appropriate protocols and a WRT component 5006 for communicating with the WRTs 5008 using the appropriate protocols.
- the WRT component 5006 interfaces to the network card 5004 , and the WRT component 5006 preferably comprises a LPRF communications component, such as a class 1 Bluetooth radio, for communicating directly with the LPRF communications component of each WRT 5008 , as described in greater detail below.
- the WRT component 5006 may further include a receiver circuit for performing the “tag turn-on” function of the present invention, in which case the Gateway 5000 may power off when not in use and be awaken by an appropriate broadcast when communication by way of the Gateway 5000 is desired. This is especially advantageous when the Gateway 5000 itself is powered by an internal energy source, such as a battery.
- Each WRT 5008 shown in FIG. 23 preferably is an active transceiver and includes several components. Specifically, with reference to FIG. 24 , each of the WRTs 5008 includes a LPRF communications component 5010 , a reader component 5012 physically connected to the LPRF communications component 5010 for data exchange therebetween, and a WT component 5014 physically connected to an “activation” input of the LPRF communications component 5010 for performing the “tag turn-on” function of the present invention. These components are hardwired into the WRT housing 5016 of the WRT 5008 .
- Each WRT 5008 also includes an energy source, such as a battery (not shown), as well as an antenna (not shown).
- the reader component 5012 preferably is connected to the LPRF communications component 5010 through a serial port of the LPRF communications component 5010 . Furthermore, the reader component 5012 preferably comprises an RFID tag reader for reading WTs that comprise RFID tags. However, in alternative preferred embodiments, if the WTs to be read comprise standards based radios, such as class 1 or class 2 Bluetooth radios, then the LPRF communications component 5010 itself is capable of communicating directly with the WTs, and the reader component 5012 need not even be included in the WRT 5008 .
- standards based radios such as class 1 or class 2 Bluetooth radios
- the WT component 5014 itself, like the WRT 5008 , includes several components. As shown in FIG. 25 , these components include a radio frequency (RF) detector component 5022 , an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) component 5024 , and a memory component 5026 .
- the WT component 5014 also includes an energy source, such as a battery 5026 , as well as an antenna 5028 .
- the antenna 5028 of the WT component 5014 and/or the battery 5026 of the WT component 5028 may be shared with the LPRF communications component 5008 . Alternatively, the antenna 5028 and/or the battery 5026 may be independent from that of the LPRF communications component 5008 .
- a WRT may include an external network communications component physically connected to the LPRF communications component for data exchange therebetween.
- the NIM may comprise a satellite transceiver and/or a cellular transceiver
- the LPRF communications component preferably includes a port for interfacing with the satellite transceiver and/or cellular transceiver. If the WRT includes an external communications component, then the WRT may directly communicate with an external network without relaying communications through the Gateway.
- the WRT additionally, or alternatively, may include a sensor component physically connected to the LPRF communications component by way of an appropriate port for data exchange therebetween.
- the sensor component may include a motion detector; a digital camera; a microphone; a temperature gauge; a thermistor; a vibration sensor; and/or a global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
- GPS global positioning system
- the LPRF communications component 5010 communicates with the reader component 5012 in reading WTs located within the vicinity of the WRT 5008 , and the LPRF communications component 5010 receives and transmits data to other WRTs 5008 or to a Gateway 5000 (specifically, the WRT component 5006 of the Gateway 5000 ). Furthermore, the LPRF communications component 5010 preferably is programmed to power down to an “off” state in order to conserve battery power when the LPRF communications component 5010 no longer is actively transmitting or receiving data packets.
- the LPRF communications component 5010 also may be capable of powering power down to a standby mode, in which case the LPRF communications component 5010 preferably includes a timer circuit or other microprocessor that automatically controls powering up after a predetermined period of time has elapsed since powering down to the standby mode.
- the WT component 5014 physically connected to the activation input of the LPRF communications component 5010 provides the electronic signal for waking up, i.e., activating, the LPRF communications component 5010 .
- the WT component 5014 generates this electronic signal by toggling the line 5018 that runs from the WT component 5014 to the LPRF communications component 5010 in response to receipt by the WT component 5014 of a radio frequency broadcast.
- the radio frequency broadcast to which the WT component 5014 responds is a “targeted” broadcast.
- the broadcast preferably includes in a preamble thereof one or more target identifications.
- the targeted broadcast that awakens a particular WRT may originate from a Gateway, such as Gateway 5000 of FIG. 23 .
- the targeted broadcast may also originate from or be rebroadcast by the LPRF communications component of another WRT 5008 .
- the WT component 5014 preferably stores (in read only or read/write memory) an identification in its memory component 5026 and/or permanently stores an identification in the integrated circuits of its ASIC component 5024 , and when a broadcast is received, the WT component 5014 screens or filters the broadcast to determine if the target identification in the broadcast matches the identification stored in the WT component 5014 . If there is no match, the WT component 5014 does not awaken the LPRF communications component 5010 and continues to await a broadcast containing a matching identification.
- a match results in the WT component 5014 generating the electrical signal by toggling the line 5018 , which awakens the LPRF communications component 5010 .
- the WT component 5014 responds to a radio frequency broadcast in this manner preferably only if the radio frequency broadcast includes a target identification matching its stored identification.
- the stored identification itself may uniquely identify its WRT or, alternatively, the identification may represent a WRT class or a WT class.
- the identification also may represent a selected plurality of WRTs such that specific WRTs respond out of the total possible WRTs that otherwise could respond.
- the WT component need only comprise at a minimum a “receiver” circuit, as the WT component need only receive incident RF energy and be capable of responding by providing the electronic signal to wake up the LPRF communications component.
- a receiver circuit is common, and is found, for example, in the simple and inexpensive Frequency-Shift-Key (FSK) radios, Phase-Modulated (PM) radios, and Amplitude-Modulated (AM) radios.
- FSK Frequency-Shift-Key
- PM Phase-Modulated
- AM Amplitude-Modulated
- the WT component could comprise a simple RFID tag modified to provide the wake up signal to the LPRF communications component.
- a wireless tag in standard operation “chirps” in response to receipt of incident RF energy, and the RFID tag would only need to be modified in order to channel the energy otherwise used for the “chirp” to the input of the LPRF communications component in order to wake it up.
- the present invention thus provides a method of using “wireless tag technology” (i.e., the receiver circuit of wireless tags) to wake the LPRF communications component when communication needs to commence.
- a characteristic of a wireless transceiver of the present invention includes two receivers and at least one transmitter.
- a receiver and transmitter pair is included in the LPRF communications component, and a second receiver is included in the WT component. Additionally, the range at which the second receiver is capable of detecting transmissions is at least approximately commensurate with the range at which the transmitter is capable of sending transmissions.
- the advantages of this arrangement originates from the power consumption of the LPRF communications component (the transmitter/receiver pair) while awaiting receipt of transmissions versus that of the WT component (the second receiver).
- the LPRF communications component which preferably comprises a Bluetooth radio, draws on the order of approximately 40 mA of current when awaiting receipt of a radio frequency broadcast and draws on the order of approximately 10 mA of current when powered down to a standby mode.
- the LPRF communication component draws approximately no current when powered down to an off state.
- the WT component comprises at least a receiver circuit that only draws on the order of approximately 10 to 15 microamps of current while awaiting receipt of the radio frequency broadcast.
- the WRT overall draws only on the order of approximately 10–15 microamps of current attributable to the WT component while awaiting receipt of the radio frequency broadcast.
- the LPRF communications component would not power down to the off state between time periods of actively receiving and transmitting but, instead, only would power down to standby mode and, thus, the WRT overall would draw on the order of approximately 10 mA of current. Consequently, by providing the WT component as part of the WRT, the LPRF communications component may power down to the off state such that the current requirement of the WRT is reduced three orders of magnitude, i.e., from milliamps to microamps.
- WRTs of the present invention preferably are utilized in sensor information collecting and/or asset-tracking applications, and methods for forming ad hoc networks by these WRTs will now be described in detail.
- the radio frequency utilized by the WRTs preferably is 2.4 GHz, for which no license is required in any country.
- the WRTs preferably read wireless tags that, themselves, are associated with the assets to be tracked.
- the WRTs also serve the wireless tag function, with each WRT being associated with an asset to be tracked.
- a reader component of the WRT may be omitted if no wireless tag is to be read by the WRT.
- each of the Wireless Reader Tags also includes a class-based network formation (CBNF) routine that enables the Wireless Reader Tags to coordinate with one another in collectively forming hierarchical ad hoc networks, each network being defined by Wireless Reader Tags of a common WRT Class (hereinafter “Class-Based Network”).
- the CBNF routine is executed upon startup of the Wireless Reader Tag, on specific command broadcast to the Wireless Reader Tag, or as otherwise needed (such as to maintain an ad hoc network).
- the CBNF routine is implemented in software operable on the digital processor of each Wireless Reader Tag in the preferred embodiments. Alternatively, the CBNF routine is implemented in other ways, such as hardwired logic circuitry in each of the Wireless Reader Tags.
- each Class-Based Network is a hierarchical network that provides an efficient topology for selective communication among Wireless Reader Tags of the same WRT Class.
- WRT Broadcasts are made by a network interface module (hereinafter “Gateway”) that serves as a communication link between the ad hoc hierarchical networks established by the Wireless Reader Tags and an external network, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or the Internet.
- the Gateway includes at least a network interface and an RF interface for communication with Wireless Reader Tags of the ad hoc networks.
- An asset-tracking application server or equivalent computer system is connected with the external network and obtains through the ad hoc networks information on the tagged assets for compilation, analysis, and/or display.
- Communication between the Gateway and a Wireless Reader Tag of the highest hierarchical level in each Class-Based Network may be established utilizing step-power filtering technique if a number of Class-Based Networks otherwise exceeds the multiple channel communication capabilities of the Gateway.
- the Gateway is enabled to selectively communicate with such Wireless Reader Tags based on physical distance from the Gateway.
- a Wireless Reader Tag or a Wireless Tag stores in memory not only a WRT ID or WT ID, respectively, but also may store additional information such as, for example: class designation; sensor derived information; a priority designation to provide improved response to selected broadcasts; a privilege level; time-sensitive information; a characteristic of the particular tagged asset; and/or a behavior of the tagged asset.
- This stored information becomes accessible by the asset-tracking application server through the Classed Based Networks.
- the asset-tracking application server also can obtain the WRT ID associated with each WT ID for intelligence gathering purposes.
- FIG. 1 a preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in a shipping environment 100 including a warehouse 104 .
- a Wireless Reader Tag 110 (also represented by “LPRF” in the drawings) is attached to each pallet 120 in the shipping environment 100 .
- An actual implementation would involve thousands of pallets and LPRFs; however, for clarity only three pallets 120 and Wireless Reader Tags 110 are shown in FIG. 1 .
- Assets 134 on the pallets 120 each are tagged with a Wireless Tag 130 (also represented by “RFT” in the drawings).
- Each Wireless Reader Tag 110 preferably is active, while each Wireless Tag 130 preferably is semi-passive.
- passive Wireless Tags 110 and Wireless Reader Tags 130 are devices that collect RF energy inductively and selectively respond, including sending information that is stored thereon. These type of devices may be viewed as selective reflectors of incident RF signals.
- Semi-passive and semi-active Wireless Tags 110 and Wireless Reader Tags 130 are devices that use internal energy, in the form of a battery, to power some portion of the circuit to either detect a transmission or make a transmission.
- Active Wireless Tags 110 and Wireless Reader Tags 130 are devices that use internal power, in the form of a battery, to both detect and make transmissions.
- both Wireless Tags 130 and Wireless Reader Tag 110 are read-write devices, but the Wireless Tags 130 may be read-only (generally characteristic of passive devices) within the scope of the present invention.
- Gateway 140 represents a communication link between an external network (LAN) 150 and Class-Based Networks formed by the Wireless Reader Tags 110 .
- the Gateway 140 is an external network access transceiver that comprises a radio base station directly or indirectly connected to a wired network (e.g., using Ethernet, or wireless Ethernet).
- the radio base station portion of Gateway 140 is an LPRF-compatible module that communicates with Wireless Reader Tags 110 of the Class-Based Networks.
- the Gateway 140 links the Class-Based Network of the present invention with conventional network topologies that use conventional network protocols.
- the Gateway 140 thereby facilitates monitoring, controlling, and querying Wireless Reader Tags 110 and Wireless Tags 130 in the Class-Based Networks using application software running on a server computer 160 connected to the external network 150 .
- the server 160 may be operated on a general purpose computer, such as a personal computer, minicomputer, or mainframe.
- a system in accordance with the present invention may include components in addition to those described above.
- a Communicator 170 also represented by “HIM” in the drawings
- a mobile locating Gateway 180 also represented by “MLG” in the drawings
- Communicator 170 is used to manually read class designations from network entities, such as Wireless Reader Tag 110 and Wireless Tags 130 , and to assign class designations.
- Gateway 180 which is installed in shipping vehicle 184 , has the core capabilities of a Wireless Reader Tag and a Gateway, plus at least two additional features.
- Gateway 180 includes a GPS receiver (not depicted) for determining geographic location of shipping vehicle 184 and a mobile interface such as a cellular or satellite transmitter 186 for transmitting data to server computer 160 via a mobile phone network 188 .
- the Communicator 170 and Gateway 140 , 180 each include a Wireless Reader Tag incorporated therein.
- Gateway 140 , 180 and Communicator 170 each includes the core hardware and software of a Wireless Reader Tag, each can actively participate in the formation, control, and maintenance of the Class-Based Networks.
- the CBNF routines of multiple Wireless Reader Tags cooperate to propagate a distinct hierarchical network among each of multiple WRT Classes of the Wireless Reader Tags.
- the WRT Class for each Wireless Reader Tag is stored in memory and included in the preamble of each network formation communication generated by the Wireless Reader Tag.
- the WRT Class may be identified by any series of codes or characters, the interpretation of which should be standardized and used by all possible recipients of network formation communications (including all Wireless Reader Tags 110 , Gateways 140 , 180 , and Communicator 170 ).
- a WRT Class may include a category/subcategory list such as “/Wal-Mart/Shipment — 123”, or a linked list representing relationships of various categories and subcategories defined in a profile of the Wireless Reader Tag.
- the WT Classes of Wireless Tags associated with a Wireless Reader Tag of the WRT Class “/Wal-Mart/Store — 290/Shipment — 123” could include “/Televisions/32 in” and “/Televisions/27 in”, representing 32 inch televisions and televisions 27 inch televisions on a pallet (to which the Wireless Reader Tag is attached) that is scheduled for inclusion with shipment number 123 to Wal-Mart store number 290.
- Wireless Reader Tags 110 may acquire a class designation by reading Wireless Reader Tags 110 or Wireless Tags 130 nearest to it, and then store the class designation and other profile information in non-volatile read/write memory.
- a WRT can acquire or “adopt” a class designation from a surrounding WRT or WT when that function is provided for in the “profile” of the WRT.
- a “profile” of a WRT includes a list of attributes that invoke operating system functions, and can include information such as “adopted class.” If, for example, a WRT that is in a manufacturing area moves past a physical boundary that puts it within a shipping area, then the WRT automatically adopts a shipping class for its previous manufacturing class.
- the class designations may look like this:
- the class on a pallet will not need to be manually changed because it automatically updates according to location (i.e., near the shipping docks). The same may happen once a driver leaves the parking lot and the radios no longer communicate to a NIM, but now communicate with a MLG.
- the class designations may look like this:
- Gateway 180 migrates to join a Class-Based Network headed by Gateway 180 .
- Gateway 180 then is able to report the migration to application server 160 via a network link that it has formed with Gateway 140 .
- the WRT Class may also include other information concerning a status, characteristic, or privilege of the Wireless Reader Tag, the network, or other conditions. Virtually any profile information can be included in the preamble and combined with class designation information to be used for network formation. Furthermore, the preamble information can be represented in any convenient format, including various encoding schemes. In one embodiment, a Walsh code is assigned to each class definition and provided to Wireless Reader Tags of the class.
- Walsh codes are well understood in the field of digital wireless communications and, therefore, require only a brief explanation here. Walsh codes are used to encode data packets and to designate the class of Wireless Reader Tags that are enabled to receive and decode a particular packet of data. The association of Walsh codes with class designation information facilitates reduced battery consumption in Wireless Reader Tags by utilizing targeting methods requiring very little processing power. The use of Walsh codes also improves data security by encoding of such communications. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many other methods may be used for encoding class designation information in the preamble of data packets to facilitate class-based network formation and network formation communications while reducing battery consumption and RF interference.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a preferred operation of the CBNF routine in accordance with the present invention to form a Class-Based Network.
- a first Wireless Reader Tag of a predetermined WRT Class initially listens (Step 210 ) for transmissions of other Wireless Reader Tags of the same WRT Class, which would indicate the presence of a Class-Based Network for such WRT Class. If such a Class-Based Network is detected, then the first Wireless Reader Tag attempts to join (Step 220 ) the Class-Based Network as a “secondary” unit by issuing a registration request signal.
- the first Wireless Reader Tag attempts join the overall network by establishing such a Class-Based Network as a “primary” unit. This is done by transmitting (Step 230 ) a “primary_ready” signal to all other Wireless Reader Tags of the same WRT Class within the broadcast range of the first Wireless Reader Tag. The first Wireless Reader Tag then listens (Step 240 ) for replies from other Wireless Reader Tags attempting to register as secondary units in the new Class-Based Network.
- the WRT Class is abstracted (Step 250 ) by truncating the class designation. For example, if the initial WRT Class is “/Wal-Mart/Store — 290/Shipment — 123”, then the class designation is abstracted to “/Wal-Mart/Store — 290”. The process then repeats starting at Step 210 for this abstracted class designation as the new WRT Class for the first Wireless Reader Tag. If this process continues to repeat, the class designation will not be able to be abstracted further without otherwise being generic to all classes of Wireless Reader Tags, i.e., WRT Class being “/”.
- the first Wireless Reader Tag attempts to connect (Step 294 ) to a Gateway (“NIM” in FIG. 2 ) and register as a member of the WRT Class that is the highest abstraction possible without being generic to all Wireless Reader Tags (i.e., as a member of the root class “/Wal-Mart”).
- NIM Gateway
- the first Wireless Reader Tag Upon successful registration with the Gateway, the first Wireless Reader Tag then enters (Step 296 ) sleep—or standby—mode to conserve battery power.
- the first Wireless Reader Tag registers (Step 260 ) the secondary unit and repeats the registration for each reply from other secondary units until a determination is made (Step 270 ) or until no more such replies are detected.
- a “cluster” in this context comprises a primary unit and the secondary units with which the primary communicates directly, and may be limited in number of units by the number of communication channels that can be supported by the primary unit operating as a cluster head. Once a cluster is full, the first unit (cluster head) responds to the next secondary unit attempting to register by promoting (Step 280 ) it to the status of a primary unit.
- the first Wireless Reader Tag now the cluster head of the full cluster—then attempts to register (Step 290 ) with the newly promoted primary unit as one of its secondary units.
- the new primary unit in turn, then is available to serve as a cluster head for other Wireless Reader Tags, to promote other Wireless Reader Tags to higher level primary units, and so forth, thereby propagating a hierarchical Class-Based Network from the “bottom-up.”
- the first Wireless Reader Tag and the other Wireless Reader Tags form the Class-Based Network using the same CBNF routine.
- Step 270 if the cluster of the first Wireless Reader Tag does not completely fill, if no more first Wireless Reader Tags attempt to register as secondary units, and if the first Wireless Reader Tag has a class designation that is other than its root class, then the first Wireless Reader Tags abstracts its WRT Class (Step 250 ) by truncating the class designation and starts over the entire CBNF routine beginning at Step 210 (i.e., listening for the presence of Wireless Reader Tags of the truncated class at Step 210 , etc.). Note that in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, a Wireless Tag or Wireless Reader Tag will respond if its class is identified in a communication, even if the class in the communication is abstracted.
- a Wireless Tag or a Wireless Reader Tag having a class designation of “/sony/tv/color/24” will respond to a communication identifying the class as “/sony/tv” as its class (i.e., its abstracted class) is identified in the communication.
- the first Wireless Reader Tag attempts to register (Step 294 ) with the Gateway and, thereafter, enters (Step 296 ) into an idle mode.
- the first Wireless Reader Tag may start attempting to register with the Gateway soon after it becomes a primary at Step 230 or concurrently with filling its cluster at Step 270 .
- the first Wireless Reader Tag would also pass to the promoted Wireless Reader Tag the responsibility for connecting with the Gateway on behalf of the cluster, if possible.
- the Gateway will be able to communicate with seven other WRTs simultaneously.
- the targeted WRT Class can revolve on each channel as a function of time in order to address multiple WRT Classes on the single channel.
- the system may establish a revolving communication schedule with revolving class addressing that allows the Gateway to communicate with hundreds or thousands of WRT Classes on the channel. Synchronization between the Gateway and Wireless Reader Tags is important for proper operation of revolving class addressing and to minimize battery consumption. Accordingly, as WRT Classes are added to the overall network and establish communication with a Gateway, the Gateway may synchronize, reconfigure, and optimize the WRT Class' schedule for revolving class addressing.
- the Class-Based Networks also are reconfigurable in response to changes in the location, status, behavior, characteristics or class designation associated with the Wireless Reader Tags. For example, assets of a class (e.g., in-production) can be selectively transferred to a new class (e.g., shipping) by merely changing the WRT Class designation with which the assets are associated.
- Class-Based Networks also facilitate the use of asset-tracking applications and process flow controls to track and manage the assets based on real-world requirements, such as manufacturing requirements, shipment, warehouse management, zone control, environmental impacts, etc. Class-Based Networks also facilitate automated segregation and delivery of assets.
- a “top-down” CBNF routine illustrated in FIGS. 12–21
- the cluster head may be promoted to assume the role of middle-hierarchy primary units, called “sub-primaries.”
- Sub-primaries which continue as secondary units below the first Wireless Reader Tag (cluster head), then provide connectivity for any additional Wireless Reader Tags that are attempting to join the Class-Based Network in clusters headed by the sub-primaries.
- FIGS. 3–11 depict Wireless Reader Tags in a time-sequence of events showing a bottom-up method of the CBNF routine.
- Wireless Reader Tags 1 – 6 and Wireless Reader Tags A–G are members of WRT Classes “circle” and “triangle,” respectively, which are arbitrary class designations assigned for purposes of illustration only.
- the Wireless Reader Tags 1 – 6 and Wireless Reader Tags A–G operate on up to three communication channels and one general channel (also called the control channel).
- the Wireless Reader Tags all include CBNF routines operating in accordance with the method shown in FIG. 2 .
- the CBNF routine of each Wireless Reader Tags 1 – 6 and Wireless Reader Tags A–G is configured to initially listen for a communication having a data packet with a preamble that identifies a Wireless Reader Tag of the same WRT Class as the Wireless Reader Tag executing the CBNF routine (see FIG. 2 , Step 210 ).
- the preamble of each packet is represented by a colon-separated string of information, as follows:
- Target Class is the WRT Class of Wireless Reader Tags directed to wake up from standby to receive and process the data packet.
- the Target Class is either “/circle” or “/triangle” (there are no subcategories in this example).
- the Target Class designation could include subcategory information in a slash-separated list, in a linked list, with Walsh codes, or by any other method of representing category and subcategory information.
- the “My Profile” section of the preamble identifies the Wireless Reader Tag transmitting the communication by WRT Class and WRT ID unique to the Wireless Reader Tag.
- the “Action Requested” includes the message, and the “Target Cluster Head ID” identifies the Wireless Reader Tag of the cluster head or proposed cluster head, if any.
- Wireless Reader Tag 1 After listening for data packets of its WRT Class (i.e., /circle) and detecting none, Wireless Reader Tag 1 attempts to start a Class-Based Network for the WRT Class of “/circle” as a primary unit by transmitting a data packet having the following preamble:
- the class designation “/circle” causes only Wireless Reader Tags of the WRT Class “/circle” to receive and process the message of the data packet.
- Wireless Reader Tag 1 if it receives no replies, may retransmit the communication multiple times before timing out and beginning a beacon procedure or entering a battery-saving lost mode.
- the data packets (and others described below) may encapsulate a data payload or may have a null payload.
- Wireless Reader Tags are preferably synchronized to allow scheduled communication to a particular WRT Class at regular intervals.
- the Wireless Reader Tag transmits a data packet at a time precisely synchronized with the targeted WRT Class.
- the receiving members of the WRT Class only power up to listen at each such interval and only for very small periods of time (e.g., a few milliseconds) when data packet for such WRT Class would normally be transmitted.
- the intervals at which a Wireless Reader Tag listens for communications directed to its WRT Class is called the duty cycle, which can be dynamically adjusted to respond to network communication demands while minimizing battery consumption.
- a period of inactivity may prompt a Wireless Reader Tag to limit its duty cycle to intervals of minutes or hours.
- a Wireless Reader Tag may ping (transmit) to determine whether other Wireless Reader Tags are still alive and available for communication. Assuming that no network changes have occurred, the Wireless Reader Tag goes back to sleep until the next duty cycle. Network changes may cause all or a part of a Class-Based Network to reconfigure.
- Wireless Reader Tags of WRT Class “/circle” within range of Wireless Reader Tag 1 respond with a registration request signal, as listed in Table 1 of FIG. 26 .
- the registration request packets include in their preambles a target WRT Class of Wireless Reader Tag 1 , only Wireless Reader Tag 1 will wake up from standby to receive and process the registration request packets.
- the transmitters of Wireless Reader Tags 2 – 6 would preferably include conventional collision avoidance routines to avoid interfering transmissions of the registration request packets, as set forth by the Bluetooth specifications.
- Wireless Reader Tag 1 in response to receipt at Wireless Reader Tag 1 of the registration_request signals from Wireless Reader Tags 2 – 6 , the CBNF routine of Wireless Reader Tag 1 registers and acknowledges the secondary Wireless Reader Tags to form a cluster.
- Wireless Reader Tag 1 has a maximum cluster capacity of three secondary units. Consequently, it only registers and acknowledges the three Wireless Reader Tags from which the strongest registration request signals are received which, in this example, are Wireless Reader Tags 2 – 4 .
- the CBNF routine By registering and acknowledging secondary units on the basis of signal strength, rather than on a first-come-first-served basis or some other basis, the CBNF routine establishes a cluster that is energy efficient for communication within the cluster. To acknowledge registration of the secondary units, Wireless Reader Tag 1 transmits an acknowledgement signal to the Wireless Reader Tags 2 – 4 , as set forth in Table 2 of FIG. 27 .
- the network topology is now shown in FIG. 6 and the cluster hierarchy is depicted in FIG. 6A .
- the two concentric circles of Wireless Reader Tag 1 indicate that it is a cluster head at Level 2 in the network hierarchy.
- Wireless Reader Tag 1 (the cluster head) selects from the other Wireless Reader Tags attempting to register the unit having the strongest registration request signal (in this example Wireless Reader Tag 5 ) and directs such unit to become a new primary unit.
- the new primary unit then serves as a new cluster head for a cluster in which Wireless Reader Tag 1 becomes a secondary unit (thus the “bottom-up” description of the method).
- the command from Wireless Reader Tag 1 to Wireless Reader Tag 5 is:
- Wireless Reader Tag 5 acknowledges the promotion signal from Wireless Reader Tag 1 and begins to propagate the Class-Based Network at the next higher level in the hierarchy, which now has three levels as depicted in FIG. 8A .
- Wireless Reader Tag 5 transmits its acknowledgement packet to all units of its class within range, by the following preamble:
- Wireless Reader Tag 5 By transmitting to all units of its WRT Class within range, Wireless Reader Tag 5 efficiently registers with Wireless Reader Tag 1 and concurrently shares primary status information with all Wireless Reader Tags of its WRT Class within its broadcast range (which is different from the broadcast range of Wireless Reader Tag 1 ).
- the three concentric circles around Wireless Reader Tag 5 indicate that it is a primary in the third-level of the hierarchy of the Class-Based Network.
- Wireless Reader Tag 6 upon receiving Wireless Reader Tag 5 's registration acknowledgement ( FIG. 8 ), requests to register as a secondary unit to Wireless Reader Tag 5 by sending a packet with the following preamble:
- unit 5 responds with:
- a Class-Based Network for the WRT Class “/triangle” is similarly formed by Wireless Reader Tags A–G concurrently with the steps shown in FIGS. 3–9 , whereby two distinct hierarchal Class-Based Networks result as shown in FIG. 10A .
- the highest level primary units register with the Gateway to establish connectivity to an external network including an application server (no shown) communicating therewith.
- FIGS. 12–21 illustrate another preferred top-down CBNF routine in which the Wireless Reader Tags transmit a series of network formation communications in the course of self-organizing a hierarchical network, the topology of which is shown at various stages adjacent to FIGS. 13 , 16 , 19 , and 21 in respective FIGS. 13A , 16 A, 19 A, and 21 A.
- the transmitting Wireless Reader Tags are shown in heavy bold outline, but the hierarchical levels are not indicated this time by inner circles and triangles.
- a first Wireless Reader Tag 1 wakes up and reads profile information stored in its memory, including a predefined class designation of “/circle” as its WRT Class. This profile is stored into the memory of the Wireless Reader Tag 1 during an initialization of the Wireless Reader Tag 1 . Based on this class designation, Wireless Reader Tag 1 then listens for transmission activity by other Wireless Reader Tags of the same WRT Class. If the nearby Wireless Reader Tags of the WRT Class have already formed a Class-Based Network for “/circle” accordance with the present invention, then Wireless Reader Tag 1 attempts to join such Class-Based Network. Otherwise, Wireless Reader Tag 1 attempts to organize a Class-Based Network for such WRT Class.
- Wireless Reader Tag 1 transmits a primary_ready signal including its designated WRT Class.
- the primary_ready signal is preferably a data packet that includes in its preamble data representative of the “circle” class designation.
- the bold boundary of Wireless Reader Tag 1 indicates that it transmits rather than receives.
- the range of the transmission is depicted by dashed circle “R.”
- each of Wireless Reader Tags 2 – 5 wakees up, receives, and processes the entire primary_ready signal, and then responds as shown in FIG. 13 and described below.
- each of the Wireless Reader Tags of the WRT Class “/circle” that received the primary_ready signal in FIG. 12 responds to the primary_ready signal with a registration_request signal.
- Upon receipt of the registration_request signal Wireless Reader Tag 1 assumes the status of a primary unit, while Wireless Reader Tags 2 – 5 assume the status of secondary units.
- FIG. 13A shows the resulting 2-tiered network hierarchy tree representative of the Class-Based Network thus formed between Wireless Reader Tags 1 – 5 .
- Wireless Reader Tag 6 was out of range of Wireless Reader Tag 1 's primary_ready signal shown in FIG. 12 , but is within range of the registration_request of Wireless Reader Tags 3 and 5 shown in FIG. 13 .
- Wireless Reader Tag 6 which was listening during the step shown in FIG. 13 , received the registration_request signals of Wireless Reader Tags 3 and 5 because those signals included the “/circle” class designation matching the “/circle” class designation of Wireless Reader Tag 6 .
- the registration request signals indicate to Wireless Reader Tag 6 the presence of a nearby Class-Based Network of corresponding WRT Class, which causes Wireless Reader Tag 6 to transmit a request to join this Class-Based Network.
- FIG. 14 also depicts the beginning stages of the formation of a Class-Based Network for the WRT Class of “/triangle” by Wireless Reader Tags A–G.
- Triangle Wireless Reader Tag A wakes up and listens for the presence of a “/triangle” class network. Detecting no other “/triangle” WRT Class signals, Wireless Reader Tag A transmits a primary_ready signal, similar to the transmission of Wireless Reader Tag 1 shown in FIG. 1 , but with a “/triangle” class designation forming part of the preamble of the primary_ready signal.
- triangle class Wireless Reader Tags B, C, and D receive the primary_ready signal of Wireless Reader Tag A and respond with registration_request signals, thereby forming a second hierarchal Class-Based Network, as shown in FIG. 16A .
- circle Wireless Reader Tags 3 and 5 respond to the request to join of Wireless Reader Tag 6 of FIG. 14 with primary_ready signals.
- Wireless Reader Tag 6 then responds to the strongest primary_ready signal received (in this example, the signal from Wireless Reader Tag 5 ), with a registration_request.
- Wireless Reader Tag 6 thereby forms a third tier of the Class-Based Network for “/circle” WRT Class, also as shown in FIG. 16A .
- Wireless Reader Tags E, F, and G of the WRT Class “/triangle” each joins the Class-Based Network for triangles formed by Wireless Reader Tags A, B, C, and D.
- FIGS. 20–21A illustrate the completion of the Class-Based Networks with the registration with the Gateway of the highest primary unit in each Class-Based Network hierarchy.
- Class-Based Networks facilitate automated and semi-automated segregation, tracking, monitoring, and delivery of assets.
- the server issues, via the Gateway, class-directed messages to monitor and track WRT Classes.
- User-defined class granularity facilitates the use of separate categories and/or subcategories for various attributes and states of the assets, e.g., production batches, phases of production, and the delivery process.
- messages or other class-directed communications from the application server can be directed to only those classes of interest representing such categories, subcategories, or sub-subcategories, as desired.
- messages or other class-directed communications are transmitted in packets that specify class designations for intended transceiver recipients, only those transceivers that are members of the specified class awaken from standby mode to receive and process the packets, and then to acknowledge or reply thereto as appropriate. Accordingly, this reduces RF interference and power consumption otherwise experienced, while making asset-tracking functions more efficient.
- Wireless Reader Tags and Wireless Tags preferably include a handling routine in communication with a memory of the Wireless Reader Tags and Wireless Tags.
- the handling routine interprets and responds to class-directed database commands, e.g., data queries or data updates from an asset-tracking application or a Communicator.
- Database queries may include status queries that provide the asset-tracking application with real-time up-to-date status information about tagged assets.
- Data updates may include requests to change data maintained on specified Wireless Reader Tags of the distributed database system.
- class-directed database commands include preambles that identify a WRT Class of Wireless Reader Tags to which they are directed.
- Class-directed database commands may also include, in their preambles, a wildcard that indicates to query handling routines that all Wireless Reader Tags of a particular abstracted WRT Class should receive and process the database commands. Class-directed commands thereby avoid unnecessary radio interference and reduce power consumption by Wireless Reader Tags that are clearly outside the scope of the database search criteria. Database performance is also enhanced by selecting Wireless Reader Tag classes and class abstractions in a way that mirrors a preferred hierarchical structure for the data they contain. In this way, increased class granularity facilitates improved data retrieval efficiency in the distributed database system by reducing the number of Wireless Reader Tags that must be involved in a database query or update transaction.
- the Class-Based Networks themselves act as a hierarchical database facilitating fast and efficient database queries.
- the CBNF routine used to form the Class-Based Networks in accordance with the present invention may also be used to perform autonomous modification and reconfiguration of such networks in response to changes in the location, status, behavior, characteristics or class designation of Wireless Reader Tags and/or Wireless Tags.
- the self-configuration methods of the present invention facilitate maintenance of radio communication links in response to changes in the operational characteristics of the Wireless Reader Tags and/or Wireless Tags that comprise the network fabric.
- self-configuration routines are responsive to changes caused by battery drain, radio transmitter failures, radio interference, and digital processor failure, by their inherent methods of organizing the network to have optimal link integrity and node connectivity.
- the following functions preferably are supported in an Wireless Reader Tag of the present invention—and in a Wireless Tag, where indicated—to accomplish the aforementioned class-based network formation and subsequent reformation.
- the name of the function is followed by the description of the function in the context of the type of transceiver in which it is to be implemented, i.e., Wireless Reader Tag and/or Wireless Tag.
- Wireless Reader Tags Software on the Wireless Reader Tags and Wireless Tags interprets category and subcategory structures represented by WRT and WT Classes, respectively.
- the Wireless Reader Tags arbitrarily form networks based on the ability to talk to other Wireless Reader Tags.
- a Wireless Reader Tags wakes up it broadcasts a message to other Wireless Reader Tags that it is a primary unit seeking secondary units.
- Other Wireless Reader Tags awaken to receive the message and attempt to register with the primary unit. If they are unable to communicate with the primary unit, or if the primary unit's cluster is full, then the secondary units will attempt to become a primary unit and continue the process.
- the highest primary unit of the hierarchy contacts the Gateway and communicates with the application server, whereupon a profile is downloaded to the primary unit and passed on to each Wireless Reader Tag of the network.
- the profile downloaded is based on options such as reading Wireless Tags, WRT IDs, business rules located at the application server and other information that has been downloaded by a Communicator.
- the profile is a list of attributes or “personalities” assigned to each WRT.
- the list in the profile will be determined by business rules (like “things move into the shipping are ready to be shipped”, “all fresh meat shipments must leave the plant within 24 hours of packing”, etc.); a Communicator (used, for example, by a supervisor who views the asset and determines that it needs another coat of painting and manually changes the class back to “pre-paint step”, etc.); and server application (first two-hundred assets shipped to New Jersey, next two-hundred assets shipped to Florida, last five-hundred assets shipped to California, etc.).
- the profile function can allow conditional class change.
- the Wireless Reader Tags reform in Class-Based Networks based on rules defined by the software located on the Wireless Reader Tags. If read-only Wireless Tags are used, then the WR Class can be pre-programmed into the Wireless Tags but will not be able to be modified dynamically. The dynamic acquisition of a WRT Class is based on rules defined by the application server.
- Class changes are allowed based on business rules setup by the customer to track and group their assets.
- the rules are built into the server application and the software on the Wireless Reader Tags.
- the profile provides information that allows dynamic decisions to be made by the Wireless Reader Tags. Once the Wireless Reader Tags have determined that their category, subcategory, etc. as represented by their WRT Class has changed, the Wireless Reader Tags must join the new WRT Class.
- the ability to allow such a class change provides functionality to allow dynamic changes to WRT Class by a Wireless Reader Tag. For example, with reference to FIGS.
- a Class-Based Network for a new class can be established by downloading a new profile and using the command “Determine Primary”. The command then uses techniques in FIGS. 2–21 to establish the Class-Based Network for the new class. Profiles and software on the Wireless Reader Tags form the basis for decisions on network formation. The profile must be preprogrammed in the Wireless Reader Tags or Wireless Tags or downloaded from the application server.
- the combination of classes is required when the user no longer wishes to differentiate between two originally defined classes.
- the profile is downloaded either as a new class profile that has a new class name or downloads to the class to be replaced by the other existing class.
- the Wireless Reader Tags may reform the network using the CBNF routines of the present invention.
- a Wireless Reader Tag When a Wireless Reader Tag “wakes up”, it determines whether it is able to become a primary unit with the determine primary command. If the health of the device is sufficient, it sends out a message to other Wireless Reader Tags of its WRT Class for registration of secondary units.
- a Wireless Reader Tag incorporated into a MLG, Gateway, or Communicator sends out a special message identifying itself as part of an MLG, Gateway, or Communicator.
- the purpose of this message is to inform other Wireless Reader Tags in stand-alone mode that the Wireless Reader Tag incorporated into the MLG, Gateway, or communicator has additional capabilities.
- the identifying message allows the Communicator to query information from the Wireless Reader Tags or Wireless Tags while the message from the Gateway and MLG indicate an ability to communicate to the external network.
- the Wireless Reader Tag will read all Wireless Tags within range.
- the profile downloaded from the application server will help the Wireless Reader Tag control misreads and extra tags. Multiple reads of the tags insures high reliability.
- a Wireless Reader Tag Upon formation of a Class-Based Network, a Wireless Reader Tag stores identifiers that describe the Wireless Reader Tags constituting neighbors in adjacent levels of the network hierarchy.
- the primary unit thus will store all the WRT IDs for its secondary units, while the secondary units will store the WRT IDs on the primary unit and any secondary units thereto.
- Wireless Reader Tag may store WRT Class information about other Wireless Reader Tags in their vicinity.
- the Wireless Reader Tags will support queries from the application server to supply this intelligence regarding local class information, regardless of whether the reported class even maintains connectivity to the application server.
- the secondary only command provides entry into a system without giving network formation rights.
- the Wireless Reader Tag with this designation in the profile is allowed to act like the other secondary Wireless Reader Tags, but it is unable to take on the role of a primary unit and, thus, is itself restricted from further propagating the network.
- This allows the Wireless Reader Tag the ability to move from one WRT Class to another WRT Class without otherwise disturbing the hierarchy of each Class-Based Network of which it becomes a part.
- a practical of this command enables a customer, who walks into a warehouse retailer, to read product names, costs, or locations in the store without interrupting or disturbing the resident asset-tracking application.
- each Wireless Reader Tag contains software that is preprogrammed to interpret class information contained in the preamble of messages being transmitted by other Wireless Reader Tags and then negotiate to be a primary unit.
- the Wireless Reader Tags use commands such as inventory Wireless Tags, determine primary, and others (described above) to make decisions on class and other profile information that has been preprogrammed in the Wireless Reader Tags.
- Wireless Reader Tags are attached to pallets or areas to read information from Wireless Tags.
- the Wireless Reader Tags are turned on and first form an arbitrary network using commands such as Determine Primary. This arbitrary formation is done so that the server can address particular Wireless Reader Tags, and the formation is not based on class designations.
- the Wireless Tags are read by the Wireless Reader Tags and profiles are downloaded to the Wireless Tags from the Wireless Reader Tags based on commands such as “Inventory RF Tags”, described above.
- Profiles defining a new class structure are then downloaded from the server to the Wireless Reader Tags (and any read/write Wireless Tags) based on business rules.
- the Wireless Reader Tags are then instructed to Determine Primary again, whereby Class-Based Networks are formed according to the newly-assigned class structure.
- the profiles are lists of options that the Wireless Reader Tag can use to make decisions. For example, if a pallet has TVs on it and the profile lists possible products as VCRs, TVs, Cameras and Unknown, then the Wireless Reader Tag knows to adopt the class of TVs and form a network accordingly. If TV was not in the list, then the Wireless Reader Tag could adopt the class Unknown and generate a system flag for further analysis.
- the Wireless Reader Tags are loaded with software preprogrammed to interpret profile information.
- the profile information may include WT IDs, states, and the like.
- the Wireless Reader Tags then are reset and boot up looking to read the saved profile, to form hierarchical networks based on class designations specified in the profile, and to look for primary/secondary configurations.
- network server business rules are downloaded to the Wireless Reader Tags in the form of new profiles to “fine tune” the network.
- general information about how a particular business operates is used to setup the network. Not enough information is known, however, about the assets.
- information can be stored in the Wireless Tags as they are attached to the assets, and profiles in the Wireless Reader Tags can enable the Wireless Reader Tags to read this information and make intelligent decisions about how to efficiently setup the network so that the data is an organized within the database in a performance-enhancing fashion.
- a Wireless Tag is attached to each item of the passenger's luggage.
- a corresponding Wireless Tag identifying the passenger is provided to the passenger to verify his/her identity at the destination baggage pickup location.
- a Wireless Reader Tag near the check-in counter detects and logs the Wireless Tags for the luggage in association with the passenger's Wireless Tag and related information into the asset-tracking system.
- the asset-tracking system downloads a profile into each of the Wireless Tags as identified by the Wireless Reader Tag at the check-in counter.
- the profiles are in the format:
- the luggage Upon successful check-in, the luggage is placed on the conveyer belt where it is read by another Wireless Reader Tag.
- the profile of each Wireless Tag on the luggage then is modified by altering the Tag_Status field from “check-in” to “luggage-transfer_station — 4334,” which identifies a location of the Wireless Reader Tag at the conveyor belt.
- Multiple Wireless Reader Tags are positioned along the conveyer belt system to identify the specific area of location of the luggage as it progresses. Trucks that deliver the luggage to the plane also have Wireless Reader Tags attached to the truck and alter the Tag_Status to “departure_on-transfer-truck-1441”.
- Yet another Wireless Reader Tag detects and logs the Wireless Tag into the asset-tracking system, whereupon a cross-check is made of the luggage as identified by the WT IDs with the luggage that is supposed to be on the plane. Any luggage that is not supposed to be on the plane is flagged for removal by the asset-tracking system and rerouted to its proper destination. Any luggage that is not accounted for raises an alarm, so that attendants are alerted to its arrival time, its position, or its last known position and an investigation can be made.
- the Wireless Tags of the luggage are detected and logged in by an Wireless Reader Tag and the Tag_Status field of each Wireless Tag is changed to “arrival_on-transfer-truck-6633”.
- the Wireless Tags on the luggage are read by a Wireless Reader Tag located near an exit of the baggage area.
- the Wireless Reader Tag detects and logs the luggage Wireless Tags in association with the Wireless Tag of the passenger claiming the luggage, whereupon the asset-tracking system assures that the passenger claiming the luggage is authorized to do so. A passenger inadvertently selecting the wrong luggage may then be alerted to the error.
- a warehouse store such as Costco carries hundreds of brands of products. Nevertheless, all products need to be inventoried on a real-time basis.
- a Wireless Reader Tag is attached to each pallet of goods and assigned a class designation that denotes the manufacturer of goods on that pallet (e.g., Pillsbury, Sony, Kellogg's, etc.).
- Each Wireless Reader Tag may also include in its class designation or profile, information about the goods on the pallet.
- Each boxes on the pallet carries a Wireless Tag that is read by the Wireless Reader Tag of the pallet.
- each Wireless Reader Tag gathers information about the Wireless Tags on its pallet and relays the information back to the asset-tracking application server.
- an employee of the warehouse store can inventory goods of a selected manufacturer by sending a query that will be received only by Wireless Reader Tags of the selected class corresponding to such manufacturer. Messages directed to a selected class will not appreciably affect the battery life of Wireless Reader Tags of other classes, as only Wireless Reader Tags of the selected class will wake up from standby mode to receive the messages and process the query.
- the manufacturer classes can be divided further into categories and subcategories, thereby further collectively reduce battery consumption and radio interference.
- Containers full of material shipped via rail or ship can be received and logged into a yard by manufacture based on class information stored on Wireless Reader Tags.
- the Wireless Reader Tags form a network with other containers from a particular manufacturer and allow quick and efficient tracking of containers. Messages directed to a selected class will not affect the battery life of Wireless Reader Tags of other classes because only Wireless Reader Tags of the selected class will wake up from standby to receive the messages and process the queries.
- the manufacturer classes can be divided into categories and subcategories, thereby further collectively reduce battery consumption and radio interference.
- a computer manufacturer may track the status of its supply chain in accordance with the asset-tracking application of the present invention.
- the classes defined are “raw material,” “component stuffing,” “monitor assembly,” “final assembly,” “shipping,” “in transit,” and “distributor.”
- the manufacture can inventory raw material throughout the process by addressing the raw material class, and can find out where in the manufacturing process the computer has reached by addressing monitor assembly or final assembly classes.
- each WRT Class has more than one member. Otherwise, the sole member of the WRT Class communicates directly with a Gateway. However, this scenario is contemplated within the scope of the present invention.
- each Wireless Reader Tag has been described as belonging to a particular WRT Class, class membership for each Wireless Reader Tag need not necessarily be exclusive, and a Wireless Reader Tag therefore may belong to more than one WRT Class as desired in any particular application of the present invention.
- each WRT Class has been described as reading a particular WT Class associated therewith, each Wireless Reader Tag may read Wireless Tags associated with different WRT Classes, as desired in the asset-tracking application.
- each Wireless Reader Tag includes the capabilities of each Wireless Tag and, therefore, it is contemplated within the scope of the present invention that each Wireless Tag of the present invention could be replaced with a Wireless Reader Tag.
- a Wireless Tag is passive, which is contemplated within the scope of the present invention, then it is believed that the Wireless Tag currently maintains therein only its unique WT ID. Being passive, no other information is maintained in the Wireless Tag. In this case, an associated Wireless Reader Tag maintains the identification of its WT Class in memory as indexed by the respective WT ID of the passive Wireless Tag. Any other information, if maintained, also is stored in the Wireless Reader Tag and indexed by WT ID, where appropriate. Of course, in this scenario, any broadcast generally is answered by each passive Wireless Tag that is within broadcast range and, hence, such implementation of passive Wireless Tags, while within the scope of the present invention, is not preferred.
- a “class-based” network represents a network, nodes of which (and specifically, the data communication devices of the nodes of which) share a common “class” designation, which class designation in such references is representative of an asset class.
- the asset class represents a grouping of assets—whether the same or different—that share something in common, such as an attribute, characteristic, relation, or behavior, and each asset comprises a person or thing that is desired to be tracked or monitored.
- an asset may be an employee, a team member, a law enforcement officer, or a member of the military.
- an asset may be, for example, a good, product, package, item, vehicle, warehoused material, baggage, passenger luggage, shipping container, belonging, commodity, effect, resource, or merchandise.

Each data communication device further is disclosed as preferably including memory for storing sensor-acquired data.
- LPRF low power radio frequency
- a class-based network is a network which nodes comprise data communication devices that share a common designation, and which network is formed based on such common designation.
- a network which nodes comprise data communication devices that share a common designation, and which network is formed based on such common designation is considered to be a “common designation” network.
- the common designation of the network is the class designation, and a class-based network therefore is representative of a common designation network.
- a remote sensor interface (RSI) network as used herein and in some of the incorporated references represents a network, nodes of which (and specifically, the data communication devices of the nodes of which) each are disposed in electronic communication with one or more sensors for acquiring data there from.
- the RSI network may be a class-based network, in which case the nodes also share a common class designation representative of an asset class.

- the sensors may be temperature and humidity sensors, for example, for detecting the temperature and humidity relative to an asset being tracked or monitored, with the sensor-acquired information being communicated back to an application server upon acquisition of the data by the sensor or at a predetermined time, as desired.
- an RSI network may include data communication devices that interface with certain types of sensors, and the data communication devices may share a common designation that is representative of such sensors.
- the common designation of the RSI network in this case is not necessarily representative of an asset to be tracked or monitored by such sensors, although it may be.
- the sensors may include, for example, cameras and microphones.
- Speakers and video displays also may be associated with the data communication devices for providing over the RSI network two-way audio and/or visual communications such as, for example, video conferencing.
- the data communication devices include Bluetooth radios
- the audiovisual data can be sent over TCP/IP links similar to VoIP communications.
