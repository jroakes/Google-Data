Definitions
- the disclosed embodiments relate generally to the field of image processing, and in particular to determining one or more textual terms in response to a visual query.
- Text-based or term-based based searching wherein a user inputs a word or phrase into a search engine and receives a variety of results is a useful tool for searching.
- Term based queries require a user to explicitly provide search terms in the form of words, phrases and or other terms. Sometimes a user may see an object in the physical world and want to locate information related to the object, but do know what terms to use for a term- based query in a search engine. Accordingly, a system that can receive a visual query such as an image, and use it to determine one or more terms would be desirable.
- a method is performed on a server system having one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors.
- the server system receives a visual query from a client system.
- the server system responds to the visual query by: generating a set of image feature values for the visual query; mapping the set of image feature values to a plurality of textual terms, including a weight for each of the textual terms in the plurality of textual terms; ranking the textual terms in accordance with the weights of the textual terms; and in accordance with the ranking the textual terms, sending one or more of the ranked textual terms to the client system.
- a server system includes one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors.
- the one or more programs include instructions for receiving a visual query from a client system, and responding to the visual query by: generating a set of image feature values for the visual query; mapping the set of image feature values to a plurality of textual terms, including a weight for each of the textual terms in the plurality of textual terms; ranking the textual terms in accordance with the weights of the textual terms; and in accordance with the ranking the textual terms, sending one or more of the ranked textual terms to the client system.
- a non-transitory computer readable storage medium stores one or more programs configured for execution by a computer, such as a server system having one or more processors for executing programs.
- the one or more programs include instructions for receiving a visual query from a client system, and responding to the visual query by:

- first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another.
- a first contact could be termed a second contact, and, similarly, a second contact could be termed a first contact, without changing the meaning of the description, so long as all occurrences of the "first contact” are renamed consistently and all occurrences of the second contact are renamed consistently.
- the first contact and the second contact are both contacts, but they are not the same contact.
- the phrase “if it is determined” or “if (a stated condition or event) is detected” may be construed to mean “upon determining” or “in response to determining” or “upon detecting (the stated condition or event)” or “in response to detecting (the stated condition or event),” depending on the context.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a computer network that includes a visual query server system according to some embodiments.
- the computer network 100 includes one or more client systems 102 and a visual query server system 106.
- One or more communications networks 104 interconnect these components.
- the communications network 104 may be any of a variety of networks, including local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), wireless networks, wireline networks, the Internet, or a combination of such networks.
- the client system 102 includes a client application 108, which is executed by the client system, for receiving a visual query (e.g., visual query 802 of Figure 8).
- a visual query is an image that is submitted as a query to a search engine or search system. Examples of visual queries, without limitations incl ude photographs, scanned documents and images, and drawings.
- the client application 108 is selected from the set consisting of a search application, a search engine plug-in for a browser application, and a search engine extension for a browser application.
- the client application 108 is an "omnivorous" search box, which allows a user to drag and drop any format of image into the search box to be used as the visual query.
- a client system 102 sends queries to and receives data from the visual query server system 106.
- the client system 102 may be any computer or other device that is capable of communicating with the visual query server system 106. Examples include, without limitation, desktop and notebook computers, mainframe computers, server computers, mobile devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, network terminals, and set-top boxes.
- the visual query server system 106 includes a front end visual query processing server 110.
- the front end server 110 receives a visual query from the client 102, and sends the visual query to a plurality of parallel search systems 112 for simultaneous processing.
- the search systems 112 each implement a distinct visual query search process and access their corresponding databases 114 as necessary to process the visual query by their distinct search process. For example, a face recognition search system 112-A will access a facial image database 114- A to look for facial matches to the image query. If the visual query contains a face, the facial recognition search system 112-A will return one or more search results (e.g., names, matching faces, etc.) from the facial image database 114-A.
- search results e.g., names, matching faces, etc.
- the optical character recognition (OCR) search system 112-B converts any recognizable text in the visual query into text for return as one or more search results.
- OCR optical character recognition
- an OCR database 114-B may be accessed to recognize particular fonts or text patterns.
- Any number of parallel search systems 112 may be used. Some examples include a facial recognition search system 112-A, an OCR search system 112-B, an image-to- terms search system 112-C (which may recognize an object or an object category), a product recognition search system (which may be configured to recognize 2-D images such as book covers and CDs and may also be configured to recognized 3-D images such as furniture), bar code recognition search system (which recognizes ID and 2D style bar codes), a named entity recognition search system, landmark recognition (which may configured to recognize particular famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and may also be configured to recognize a corpus of specific images such as billboards), place recognition aided by geo-location information provided by a GPS receiver in the client system 102 or mobile phone network, a color recognition search system, and a similar image search system (which searches for and identifies images similar to a visual query).
- a facial recognition search system 112-A an OCR search system 112-B
- an image-to- terms search system 112-C which may recognize an object or an object category
- Further search systems can be added as additional parallel search systems, represented in Figure 1 by system 112-N. All of the search systems, except the OCR search system, are collectively defined herein as search systems performing an image-match process. All of the search systems including the OCR search system are collectively referred to as query-by-image search systems.
- the visual query server system 106 includes a facial recognition search system 112-A, an OCR search system 112-B, an image-to-terms search system 114-C, and at least one other query-by-image search system 112. [0027]
- the parallel search systems 112 each individually process the visual search query and return their results to the front end server system 110.
- the front end server 100 may perform one or more analyses on the search results such as one or more of: aggregating the results into a compound document, choosing a subset of results to display, and ranking the results as will be explained in more detail with regard to Figure 3.
- the front end server 110 communicates the search results to the client system 102.
- the client system 102 presents the one or more search results to the user.
- the results may be presented on a display, by an audio speaker, or any other means used to communicate information to a user.
- the user may interact with the search results in a variety of ways.
- the user's selections, annotations, and other interactions with the search results are transmitted to the visual query server system 106 and recorded along with the visual query in a query and annotation database 116.
- Information in the query and annotation database can be used to improve visual query results.
- the information from the query and annotation database 116 is periodically pushed to the parallel search systems 112, which incorporate any relevant portions of the information into their respective individual databases 114.
- the computer network 100 optionally includes a term query server system
- a term query is a query containing one or more terms, as opposed to a visual query which contains an image.
- the term query server system 118 may be used to generate search results that supplement information produced by the various search engines in the visual query server system 106.
- the results returned from the term query server system 118 may include any format.
- the term query server system 118 may include textual documents, images, video, etc. While term query server system 118 is shown as a separate system in Figure 1, optionally the visual query server system 106 may include a term query server system 118.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a client system 102 in accordance with some embodiments.
- the client system 102 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 202, one or more network or other communications interfaces 204, memory 212, and one or more communication buses 214 for interconnecting these components.
- the communication buses 214 optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between system components.
- the client system 102 includes a user interface 205.
- the user interface 205 includes a display device 206 and optionally includes an input means such as a keyboard, mouse, or other input buttons 208.
- the display device 206 includes a touch sensitive surface 209, in which case the display 206/209 is a touch sensitive display.
- a physical keyboard is optional (e.g., a soft keyboard may be displayed when keyboard entry is needed).
- some client systems use a microphone and voice recognition to supplement or replace the keyboard.
- the client 102 includes a GPS (global positioning satellite) receiver, or other location detection apparatus 207 for determining the location of the client system 102.
- visual query search services are provided that require the client system 102 to provide the visual query server system to receive location information indicating the location of the client system 102.
- the client system 102 also includes an image capture device 210 such as a camera or scanner.
- Memory 212 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.
- Memory 212 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 202.
- Memory 212, or alternately the non-volatile memory device(s) within memory 212 comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium.
- memory 212 or the computer readable storage medium of memory 212 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof:
- an operating system 216 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks;
- a network communication module 218 that is used for connecting the client system 102 to other computers via the one or more communication network interfaces 204 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on; a image capture module 220 for processing a respective image captured by the image capture device/camera 210, where the respective image may be sent (e.g., by a client application module) as a visual query to the visual query server system;
- client application modules 222 for handling various aspects of querying by image, including but not limited to: a query-by-image submission module 224 for submitting visual queries to the visual query server system; optionally a region of interest selection module 225 that detects a selection (such as a gesture on the touch sensitive display 206/209) of a region of interest in an image and prepares that region of interest as a visual query; a results browser 226 for displaying the results of the visual query; and optionally an annotation module 228 with optional modules for structured annotation text entry 230 such as filling in a form or for freeform annotation text entry 232, which can accept annotations from a variety of formats, and an image region selection module 234 (sometimes referred to herein as a result selection module) which allows a user to select a particular sub-portion of an image for annotation;
- a query-by-image submission module 224 for submitting visual queries to the visual query server system
- a region of interest selection module 225 that detects a selection (such as a gesture on the touch sensitive
- an optional content authoring application(s) 236 that allow a user to author a visual query by creating or editing an image rather than just capturing one via the image capture device 210; optionally, one or such applications 236 may include instructions that enable a user to select a sub-portion of an image for use as a visual query; an optional local image analysis module 238 that pre-processes the visual query before sending it to the visual query server system.
- the local image analysis may recognize particular types of images, or sub-regions within an image. Examples of image types that may be recognized by such modules 238 include one or more of: facial type (facial image recognized within visual query), bar code type (bar code recognized within visual query), and text type (text recognized within visual query); and
- additional optional client applications 240 such as an email application, a phone application, a browser application, a mapping application, instant messaging application, social networking application etc.
- the application corresponding to an appropriate actionable search result can be launched or accessed when the actionable search result is selected.
- the image region selection module 234 which allows a user to select a particular sub-portion of an image for annotation, also allows the user to choose a search result as a "correct" hit without necessarily further annotating it.
- the user may be presented with a top N number of facial recognition matches and may choose the correct person from that results list.
- more than one type of result will be presented, and the user will choose a type of result.
- the image query may include a person standing next to a tree, but only the results regarding the person is of interest to the user. Therefore, the image selection module 234 allows the user to indicate which type of image is the "correct" type - i.e., the type he is interested in receiving.
- the user may also wish to annotate the search result by adding personal comments or descriptive words using either the annotation text entry module 230 (for filling in a form) or freeform annotation text entry module 232.
- the optional local image analysis module 238 is a portion of the client application (108, Fig. 1). Furthermore, in some embodiments the optional local image analysis module 238 includes one or more programs to perform local image analysis to pre-process or categorize the visual query or a portion thereof. For example, the client application 222 may recognize that the image contains a bar code, a face, or text, prior to submitting the visual query to a search engine. In some embodiments, when the local image analysis module 238 detects that the visual query contains a particular type of image, the module asks the user if they are interested in a corresponding type of search result.
- the local image analysis module 238 may detect a face based on its general characteristics (i.e., without determiiiing which person's face) and provides immediate feedback to the user prior to sending the query on to the visual query server system. It may return a result like, "A face has been detected, are you interested in getting facial recognition matches for this face?" This may save time for the visual query server system (106, Fig. 1). For some visual queries, the front end visual query processing server (110, Fig. 1) only sends the visual query to the search system 112 corresponding to the type of image recognized by the local image analysis module 238.
- the visual query to the search system 112 may send the visual query to all of the search systems 112A-N, but will rank results from the search system 112 corresponding to the type of image recognized by the local image analysis module 238.
- the manner in which local image analysis impacts on operation of the visual query server system depends on the configuration of the client system, or configuration or processing parameters associated with either the user or the client system.
- the actual content of any particular visual query and the results produced by the local image analysis may cause different visual queries to be handled differently at either or both the client system and the visual query server system.
- bar code recognition is performed in two steps, with analysis of whether the visual query includes a bar code performed on the client system at the local image analysis module 238. Then the visual query is passed to a bar code search system only if the client determines the visual query is likely to include a bar code. In other embodiments, the bar code search system processes every visual query.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a front end visual query processing server system 110 in accordance with some embodiments.
- the front end server 110 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 302, one or more network or other communications interfaces 304, memory 312, and one or more communication buses 314 for interconnecting these components.
- the communication buses 314 optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between system components.
- Memory 312 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.
- Memory 312 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 302. Memory 312, or alternately the non-volatile memory device(s) within memory 312, comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. In some embodiments, memory 312 or the computer readable storage medium of memory 312 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof:
- an operating system 316 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks
- a network communication module 318 that is used for connecting the front end server system 110 to other computers via the one or more communication network interfaces 304 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on;
- a query manager 320 for handling the incoming visual queries from the client system 102 and sending them to two or more parallel search systems; as described elsewhere in this document, in some special situations a visual query may be directed to just one of the search systems, such as when the visual query includes an client-generated instruction (e.g., "facial recognition search only");
- a results filtering module 322 for optionally filtering the results from the one or more parallel search systems and sending the top or "relevant" results to the client system 102 for presentation;
- a results ranking and formatting module 324 for optionally ranking the results from the one or more parallel search systems and for formatting the results for presentation;
- a results document creation module 326 is used when appropriate, to create an interactive search results document;
- module 326 may include sub-modules, including but not limited to a bounding box creation module 328 and a link creation module a label creation module 331 for creating labels that are visual identifiers of respective sub-portions of a visual query.
- an annotation module 332 for receiving annotations from a user and sending them to an annotation database 116;
- an actionable search results module 338 for generating, in response to a visual query, one or more actionable search result elements, each configured to launch a client-side action;
- examples of actionable search result elements are buttons to initiate a telephone call, to initiate email message, to map an address, to make a restaurant reservation, and to provide an option to purchase a product;
- a query and annotation database 116 which comprises the database itself 334 and an index to the database 336.
- the results ranking and formatting module 324 ranks the results returned from the one or more parallel search systems (112-A - 112-N, Fig. 1). As already noted above, for some visual queries, only the results from one search system may be relevant. In such an instance, only the relevant search results from that one search system are ranked. For some visual queries, several types of search results may be relevant. In these instances, in some embodiments, the results ranking and formatting module 324 ranks all of the results from the search system having the most relevant result (e.g., the result with the highest relevance score) above the results for the less relevant search systems. In other embodiments, the results ranking and formatting module 324 ranks a top result from each relevant search system above the remaining results.
- the results ranking and formatting module 324 ranks the results in accordance with a relevance score computed for each of the search results.
- augmented textual queries are performed in addition to the searching on parallel visual search systems.
- textual queries are also performed, their results are presented in a manner visually distinctive from the visual search system results.
- the results ranking and formatting module 324 also formats the results.
- the results are presented in a list format.
- the results are presented by means of an interactive results document.
- both an interactive results document and a list of results are presented.
- the type of query dictates how the results are presented. For example, if more than one searchable subject is detected in the visual query, then an interactive results document is produced, while if only one searchable subject is detected the results will be displayed in list format only.
- the label creation module is used to create labels for one or more images in the visual query.
- the label creation module 331 uses the terms to label the image(s) in the visual query.
- the label when the user clicks on the label, a term based query is launched for the term.
- the labels are links to the results for a term based query associated with labeled term. In these embodiments, the labels are part of an interactive results document explained below.
- the results document creation module 326 is used to create an interactive search results document (an example of which is shown in Figure 11.).
- the interactive search results document may have one or more detected and searched subjects.
- the bounding box creation module 328 creates a bounding box around one or more of the searched subjects.
- the bounding boxes may be rectangular boxes, or may outline the shape(s) of the subjects).
- the link creation module 330 creates links to search results associated with their respective subject in the interactive search results document.
- the subject searched is associated with one or more textual terms
- clicking within the bounding box area activates the corresponding link inserted by the link creation module.
- the query and annotation database 116 contains information that can be used to improve visual query results.
- the user may annotate the image after the visual query results have been presented.
- the user may annotate the image before sending it to the visual query search system. Pre-annotation may help the visual query processing by focusing the results, or running text based searches on the annotated words in parallel with the visual query searches.
- annotated versions of a picture can be made public (e.g., when the user has given permission for publication, for example by designating the image and annotations) as not private), so as to be returned as a potential image match hit.
- the information from the query and annotation database 116 is periodically pushed to the parallel search systems 112, which incorporate relevant portions of the information (if any) into their respective individual databases 114.
