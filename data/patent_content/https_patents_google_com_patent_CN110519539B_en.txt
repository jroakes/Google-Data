Detailed Description
According to various embodiments, mechanisms (which may include methods, systems, and/or media) are provided for rewinding media content based on detected audio events.
In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein enable monitoring of audio signals including ambient or background sounds of audio events during media content presentation. For example, the mechanism can receive an audio signal that includes ambient sounds in an environment in which the media content is presented (e.g., a living room environment). In a more specific example, a microphone can be located in the environment to receive audio data including ambient sounds when the media device is presented. The mechanism can then convert the ambient sound into an audio signal (e.g., using a microphone or hardware processor).
It should be noted that these mechanisms can provide the user with an opportunity to provide consent or authorization to perform an action, such as activating the audio input device and transmitting audio data, before receiving audio signals or any other audio data using the audio input device. For example, once an application is loaded on a computing device, such as a television device and a media playback device, the application can prompt the user to provide authorization to activate an audio input device, transmit audio data, detect an event in the audio data, and/or rewind media content based on the detected event. In more particular examples, in response to downloading an application and loading the application on a media playback device, the user can be prompted with a message requesting (or requiring) the user to provide consent prior to performing these actions. Additionally or alternatively, in response to installing the application, the user can be prompted with a permission message requesting (or requiring) the user to provide consent prior to performing these detections and/or communicating information related to these detections. In the event that the user agrees to the use of such data, audio data from the audio input device can be received and one or more audio events (e.g., a break point) can be detected.
In some embodiments, the mechanism can receive a user command to rewind the media content to a play position prior to the occurrence of the detected audio event (e.g., the detected interruption). For example, an audio event can be detected and media content can be presented at a playback position prior to the occurrence of the detected audio event in response to receiving a voice command issued by a user through an audio input device (e.g., a "rewind" voice input from the user). In another example, an audio event can be detected and media content can be presented at a play position prior to the detected audio event occurring in response to a user selecting a rewind button on a remote control, a mobile phone, a tablet computing device, a wearable computing device, or the like. The detection of an audio event (e.g., an interruption occurring during the presentation of media content) can be triggered by the receipt of a user command.
In some embodiments, the mechanism is capable of detecting an audio event occurring during presentation of the media content based on an audio signal received from an audio input device in response to receiving a user command to rewind the media content. For example, the mechanism can calculate an absolute ambient volume level within the audio signal. The mechanism can then detect an audio event occurring during the presentation of the media content by determining that at least one of the absolute ambient volume levels exceeds a value of a predetermined threshold. As another example, the mechanism can calculate one or more relative ambient volume levels within the audio signal (e.g., an amount of change between two absolute ambient volume levels, a rate of change corresponding to a plurality of absolute ambient volume levels, an amount of change between an absolute ambient volume level and an average ambient volume level, etc.). The mechanism can then detect an audio event occurring during the presentation of the media content by determining that at least one of the relative ambient volume levels exceeds a value of a predetermined threshold. As yet another example, the mechanism can detect audio events occurring during media content presentation by identifying particular types of ambient sounds within the audio signal (such as human voices, telephone calls, etc.).
Upon detecting an audio event occurring during the presentation of the media content, the mechanism can cause the media content to be presented from a particular playback position prior to the occurrence of the audio event. For example, in response to receiving a user command to rewind media content and detecting an audio event, the mechanism can automatically rewind the media content to a location a particular number of seconds before the detected audio event.
Alternatively, in some embodiments, the detection of an audio event (e.g., an interruption occurring during the presentation of the media content) can be performed during the presentation of the media content, where the playback position can be specified along a timeline of the media content. In response to receiving a user command to Rewind the media content, (such as a voice command "Rewind, i.e., interrupted)") the user command can trigger the mechanism to cause the media content to be presented from a play position prior to the occurrence of the detected audio event.
These and other features for rewinding media content based on detected audio events are described herein in connection with fig. 1-4.
Turning to fig. 1, a flow diagram of an illustrative process 100 for rewinding media content based on detected audio events is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
As illustrated, the process 100 can begin by presenting media content at 110. The media content presented may be any suitable content such as video content, audio content, television programs, movies, cartoons, music, sound effects, audio books, streaming content (e.g., a streaming radio show, a live concert, etc.), and so forth. For example, as shown in fig. 2, the hardware processor can cause media content 210 to be presented on display 200.
In some embodiments, the media content can be presented using any suitable media playback device, such as a streaming media playback device, a media center computer, a DVD recorder, a blu-ray player, a digital video recorder, a television device, a tablet computing device, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a mobile phone, a game console, a CD player, an MP3 player, an electronic book reader, or any other suitable media device.
At 120, the process 100 can accept an audio signal that includes ambient sounds in the environment in which the media content is presented. The audio signal can be generated using any suitable audio input device, such as a microphone or a sound meter. For example, a microphone can be located in an environment in which media content is presented to receive and/or record ambient sound in the environment (e.g., a living room environment). In another example, the microphone or other audio input device can be integrated with a media playback device and/or a mobile device, such as a built-in microphone of a gaming machine, mobile phone, tablet computing device, or television device.
It should be noted that prior to receiving an audio signal or any other audio data using an audio input device, the process 100 can provide the user with an opportunity to provide consent or authorization to perform an action, such as activating the audio input device and transmitting the audio data. For example, once an application is loaded on a computing device, such as a television device and a media playback device, the application can prompt the user to provide authorization for activating an audio input device, transmitting audio data, detecting events in the audio data, and/or rewinding media content based on the detected events. In a more specific example, in response to downloading an application and loading the application on a media playback device or mobile device, the user can be prompted with a message requesting (or requiring) the user to provide consent prior to performing these actions. Additionally or alternatively, in response to installing the application, the user can be prompted with a permission message requesting (or requiring) to provide consent prior to performing the detections and/or communicating information related to the detections.
In some embodiments, the process 100 can then convert the ambient sound to an audio signal (e.g., using an audio input device or hardware processor). For example, a media playback device or any other suitable device connected to an audio input device can temporarily store audio data and/or audio signals in a circular buffer (e.g., implemented in volatile memory to be overwritten when new audio data or audio signals are received). In a more specific example, the circular buffer can be used to temporarily store audio data corresponding to a predetermined amount of audio data (e.g., thirty seconds, one minute, ten minutes, thirty minutes, etc.), and the oldest audio data can be continuously overwritten by newly recorded audio data. It should be noted that in some embodiments in which media content is presented using one or more speakers, the components of the audio signal can correspond to the audio portion of the media content being presented.
In some embodiments, process 100 may store the received audio signal in any suitable manner. For example, the process 100 can store a portion of the audio signal in a temporary manner. In a more specific example, a segment of an audio signal corresponding to a given time interval or a given frequency band can be stored in a buffer for a period of time (e.g., a few seconds, a few minutes, or any other suitable period of time). In some embodiments, the period of time for which audio data is stored in the buffer can be specified by a user (e.g., upon launching an application). As another example, the process 100 can extract one or more features of the audio signal (e.g., by calculating one or more peaks, amplitudes, power levels, frequencies, signal-to-noise ratios, and/or other suitable features of the audio signal) and store the extracted features in a suitable storage device.
In some embodiments, process 100 can generate one or more audio fingerprints that can represent an audio signal or one or more suitable portions of an audio signal. The audio fingerprint may be a digital representation generated from a received audio signal, where the audio fingerprint can be used to identify the same or similar portions of the audio signal (e.g., portions of the audio signal corresponding to media content, portions of the audio signal corresponding to one or more interruptions that occurred during presentation of the media content, etc.). In some embodiments, the audio fingerprint can be generated using any suitable audio fingerprint algorithm, which may include one or more suitable two-dimensional transforms (e.g., discrete cosine transforms), three-dimensional transforms (e.g., wavelet transforms), hash functions, and the like. The audio fingerprint can then be stored in a suitable storage device.
At 130, the process 100 can determine whether a user command to rewind the media content has been received. In some embodiments, the user command to rewind the media file can correspond to one or more user inputs. For example, the user command can correspond to a voice command indicating that the user wants to rewind the media content. In a more specific example, the voice command "rewind" can be provided by a user consuming the media content and can be detected by a microphone connected to the media playback device and/or the mobile device. As another example, the hardware processor can determine that a user command to rewind the media content has been received in response to a user selecting a rewind button using a mobile device, such as a remote control, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, or the like. It should be noted that, in some embodiments, the user command to rewind the media content can be transmitted in any suitable form, such as one or more infrared signals, High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) communication channel protocol (CEC) commands, WiFi signals, and/or other suitable control signals.
In some embodiments, in response to determining that a user command to rewind the media content has not been received, process 100 can return to step 120.
At 140, in response to determining that a user command to rewind the media content has been received, the process 100 can generate a surrounding noise signal based on the audio signal or audio data. For example, in some embodiments in which media content is presented using one or more speakers, process 100 can generate a surrounding noise signal by subtracting or removing an audio portion representing the presented media content from the audio signal received at 120. In a more specific example, audio signals representing media content can be generated by a microphone that monitors the media content presented by the media playback device. In some embodiments, two microphones can be used to monitor ambient sound in the environment and media content presented by the media playback device, respectively. Additionally or alternatively, an audio portion representing audio data corresponding to the presented media content can be generated based on a media file containing the media content.
In some embodiments, upon determining that the media content is not being presented using one or more speakers, the process 100 can use the audio signal received at 120 as the ambient noise signal.
Additionally or alternatively, the process 100 can process the audio signal and/or the ambient noise signal using one or more suitable signal processing algorithms to generate the ambient noise signal. In a more specific example, the process 100 can use a suitable analog-to-digital converter to convert an analog audio signal to a digital audio signal. In another more specific example, the process 100 can convert the audio signal or the ambient noise signal to a frequency domain signal (e.g., by performing a fast fourier transform, etc.). In yet another more particular example, the process 100 can apply one or more of a low pass filter, a band pass filter, etc. to the audio signal and/or the ambient noise signal.
Next, at 150, the process 100 can detect an audio event occurring during the presentation of the media content based on the ambient noise signal. Illustrative examples of audio events that can occur during the presentation of media content can include a telephone ring, noise above a threshold value, music, a human voice, or any other suitable interruption that can interfere with the playing of media content.
In some embodiments, process 100 can process the ambient noise signal or a portion of the ambient noise signal (e.g., a segment of the ambient noise signal corresponding to a particular time period, a particular frequency band, etc.) using a suitable signal processing algorithm. Process 100 can then detect an audio event based on the processed ambient noise signal.
For example, the process 100 can calculate one or more absolute ambient noise levels based on the ambient noise signal. Process 100 can then detect the occurrence of an audio event by locating an absolute ambient noise level that exceeds a predetermined threshold. In a more specific example, the process 100 can calculate one or more suitable characteristics of the ambient noise signal, such as a peak value, amplitude, power level, and the like. The process 100 can then compare the feature to a predetermined threshold (e.g., by applying an appropriate filter) and detect the occurrence of an audio event based on the comparison.
As another example, the process 100 can calculate one or more relative ambient noise levels and detect the occurrence of an audio event based on the relative ambient noise levels. More specifically, for example, the process 100 can calculate the number of changes (e.g., in decibels) between two absolute ambient noise levels corresponding to different times, the rate of change corresponding to a plurality of absolute ambient noise levels, and so forth. The process 100 can then detect the occurrence of an audio event by locating a relative ambient noise level that exceeds a predetermined threshold.
As yet another example, the process 100 can locate the occurrence of an audio event during media content presentation by detecting a particular type of ambient noise. In some embodiments, the particular type of ambient noise can be predefined by a user and/or appropriate settings. In a more specific example, the process 100 can detect an incoming call as an audio event that occurs during the presentation of media content. In another more specific example, the process 100 can detect the presence of human speech or speech contained in the ambient noise signal using a suitable speech detection algorithm (e.g., by analyzing one or more frequency components in the ambient noise signal). It should be noted that the presence of human speech or voice can be detected without recognizing the voice content.
As a further example, the process 100 can locate the occurrence of an audio event during the presentation of the media content by comparing an audio fingerprint associated with the received audio signal to a plurality of audio fingerprints. In a more specific example, the process 100 can access a database or other suitable storage device containing a plurality of audio fingerprints and search for audio fingerprints representing one or more audio events (e.g., break points) that are the same as or substantially similar to the audio fingerprint associated with the received audio signal. In another more specific example, an audio fingerprint associated with the received audio signal can be compared to a set of audio fingerprints representing the presented media content.
In some embodiments, once one or more audio events and/or types of audio events occurring during presentation of media content are identified, the media content can be tagged based on the detected audio events. For example, the detected time or audio event can be associated with a description of the audio event, a temporal location in media content corresponding to the audio event, and/or other suitable information related to the detected audio event. The plurality of detected audio events can then be indexed and/or stored based on the associated information.
In a more specific example as shown in fig. 2, when media content is presented on the media playback device 200, one or more audio events can be detected during the presentation of the media content as described above. In some embodiments, the detected audio event can include a first event (e.g., a phone ring) occurring at time 215 during presentation of the media content and a second event (e.g., a talk event) occurring at time 220 during presentation of the media content. The first event and the second event can be associated with time 215 and time 220, respectively. Additionally or alternatively, the description can be associated with each of the first and second events (e.g., phone calls, conversations, etc.) and can be stored in a suitable storage device along with their corresponding times during the presentation of the media content. In such examples, audio data representing the audio signals and/or the ambient audio signals is not necessarily stored to rewind and/or represent the media content based on the detected event.
In some embodiments, process 100 may include communicating portions of audio data corresponding to detected audio events to a detection service (e.g., an audio search engine, an audio detection service, etc.). In response to receiving the portion of audio data, the detection service can determine a type of corresponding audio event, such as a telephone ring, a person speaking, a dog barking, an alarm ring, and so forth. For example, each different type of audio event can have an associated play position (e.g., a play position 30 seconds before any type of phone ring is detected, a play position one minute before any type of human speech is detected, etc.).
In some embodiments, once multiple audio events are detected during presentation of the media content, one or more appropriate user interfaces can be presented to the user to notify the user of the detected events. For example, the hardware processor can provide an indication on the display 200 that indicates to the user that "an interrupt has been detected. Do you want to rewind the video back before the interruption occurred? Now said 'rewind'. "in another example, the hardware processor can provide an icon or indicator on the display 210 that indicates to the user that a rewind option is available to automatically rewind before the occurrence of the detected audio event. Additionally or alternatively, the user may be prompted to select a detected event corresponding to a desired rewind point (e.g., by issuing a voice command corresponding to the detected event).
At 160, the process 100 can rewind the media content based on the detected audio event. In some embodiments, the process 200 can determine a playback position in the media content based on the occurrence of the audio event. For example, the process 100 can select a play position at a particular time corresponding to the detected beginning of an audio event (e.g., based on when a phone ring event is detected). In another example, the process 100 can automatically select a playback position that is a particular time period before the detected audio event (e.g., five seconds before the detected audio event). In another example, the process 100 can determine a preference for a specified play position selected by the user. In a more specific example, a user, when setting up a client application, can be requested to enter a time interval for specifying a playback position in response to a detected audio event (e.g., always thirty seconds before the detected audio event). In yet another example, the process 100 can detect a scene change in the media content prior to a time corresponding to the detected occurrence of the audio event. Process 100 can then cause the media content to be presented according to the detected scene transition.
In a more specific example, a play position can be generated and associated with the detected audio event. A user may consume media content on the media playback device during playback of the media content, and another user may begin speaking with the user. While the user is speaking, an audio input device connected to the media playback device can receive audio of the user's conversation and detect an event (e.g., an audio event). The media playback device executing the application is able to determine that the audio event is a spoken audio event and generate a playback position associated with the time at which the event was detected during the presentation of the media content (e.g., five seconds before the spoken audio event detected at the 55 second marker of the media content). In some embodiments, after generating the play positions, the audio data used to detect the audio events and generate the play positions can be disconnected. For example, after a play position has been generated, it is no longer associated with audio data (e.g., a word or phrase spoken by the user), but is only associated with one or more detected audio events. This can allow the rewind point to be determined without the risk of a dialog between users or other audio data being recorded. This can alleviate privacy concerns that users may be concerned about the device recording their conversations.
The process 100 can then reverse the media content back to the play position and cause the media content to be presented to the user from the play position.
It should be noted that the above-described steps in the flowchart of fig. 1 can be performed or practiced in any order or sequence and are not limited to the order or sequence shown and described in the figures. Moreover, some of the above-described steps in the flowchart of fig. 1 can be performed or practiced substantially simultaneously or in parallel where appropriate to reduce latency and processing time. Further, it should be noted that fig. 1 is provided as an example only. At least some of the steps shown in these figures may be performed in a different order than presented, performed simultaneously, or omitted altogether.
For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can generate a surrounding noise signal based on an audio signal or audio data, and can detect an audio event prior to receiving a user command, such as a voice command. In some embodiments, the audio data can be continuously saved in a circular buffer or any other suitable storage device, and ambient noise signals based on the audio data stored in the circular buffer can be generated and analyzed to determine if an audio event has occurred. In response to receiving a user command, such as a rewind voice command, the process 100 can rewind the presentation of the media content to a play position prior to the detected audio event. Further, in response to receiving a subsequent user opinion to rewind the media content, the process 100 can rewind the presentation of the media content to a play position prior to the previously detected audio event.
Turning to fig. 3, an example 300 of a system for rewinding media content based on detected events is shown, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. As illustrated, the system 300 can include a display device 302, a media playback device 304, one or more audio input devices 306, one or more mobile devices 308, a communication network 310, and communication links 312, 314, 316, 318, 320, and 322.

Alternatively or in addition, the audio data or appropriate portions of the audio data can be communicated to an appropriate service for analysis. In a more specific example, the audio data can be communicated to a search system that accesses a matching service (e.g., an audio fingerprint matching service). The search system can then generate one or more appropriate audio fingerprints for the audio data and/or search for stored reference audio fingerprints that match the generated audio fingerprints.
