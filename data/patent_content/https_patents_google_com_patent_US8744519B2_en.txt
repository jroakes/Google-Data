Definitions
- the present invention relates to mobile phone handset software and, more particularly, to preventing simultaneous data and voice channel transmissions in dual channel mobile phones.
- Dual mode devices can face a scenario in which one communication channel is active and a different channel wants to come into service. Even short periods of simultaneous dual transmissions can be disallowed for some dual mode device implementations. For example, Federal Communication Commission (FCC) guidelines, such as Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) requirements, can be violated when a mobile device transmits over more than one channel at a time. Antenna diversity, software/firmware infrastructure, service agreements, and other considerations can also limit a mobile device to a single active communication channel at a time.
- FCC Federal Communication Commission
- SAR Specific Absorption Rate
- a solution that utilizes software/firmware in a handset of a dual mode mobile communication device to avoid dual transmit states can detect and control data sessions to avoid simultaneous data session based transmissions and voice/dispatch session based transmissions.
- the solution can establish at least three different states for data communication sessions, which include an active state, a dormant state, and a disconnected state.
- Dispatch and voice sessions can have two states, an active state and a disconnected state. In a dormant state, system and network connectivity can be maintained while transmissions can be disabled.
- the data session manager can shift an active data session to a dormant state immediately before permitting a dispatch call, where the handset can establish a dispatch session. After the dispatch call has been ended, the dispatch session can be stopped and the original data session can be toggled from the dormant state to an active state.
- the data session manager can prevent simultaneous transmissions by interacting with a main handset modem controller.
- the data session manager can notify the main handset modem controller before acquiring any data traffic. This enables the modem controller to fulfill any requirements relating to blocking data sessions when other services are active (e.g., no data sessions are permitted when dispatch services are active).
- the data session manager can also be configured to terminate a data session when so requested by the modem controller.
- the data session manager can notify the modem controller whenever a data traffic channel changes its state, which permits the other modems to be blocked whenever a data channel is being used.
- the solution can establish one or more special states related to data transmissions, such as dedicated data transmission mode, which disables interconnect and/or dispatch calls, and a disabled data transmission mode, where data transmissions are not permitted.
- one aspect of the present invention can include a dual transmit mobile communication device that includes multiple modems, a modem controller, and a data session manager.
- the modem controller can programmatically control the modems.
- the data session manager can manage data sessions of the mobile communication device.
- the data session manager can programmatically interact with the software modem controller to ensure that only one of the modems is transmitting at any one time. States of data communication sessions can be automatically adjusted as necessary.
- the modem controller can block transmissions over a data traffic channel in order to use a modem other than one associated with the data traffic channel, such as using a modem to handle a dispatch session.
- the data session manager can preserve state information of blocked data sessions, so that the sessions can be resumed when a modem is available.
- Another aspect of the invention can include a method for preventing dual transmissions from concurrently occurring within a dual transmit capable mobile communication device.
- the method can include a step of identifying a modem controller that programmatically controls more than one modem.
- a data session manager can interact with the modem controller before performing any activity changing an activation state of a data traffic channel. For example, before a data traffic channel is acquired the modem controller can be queried to determine if a modem for the data traffic channel is available.
- the modem controller can prevent the data session manager from activating a data traffic channel whenever a modem other than the modem needed for the data traffic channel is active.
- Still another aspect of the invention can include another method for preventing a mobile communication device from performing concurrent dual transmissions.
- a data transmission channel can be associated with a first modem.
- An active data session can be established over the data transmission channel.
- An event can be detected for establishing a communication channel associated with a second modem.
- the first modem can be blocked so that transmissions over the data transmission channel are prevented.
- the data session can be changed from an active state to a dormant state. After the blocking step occurs, the communication channel can be established and the second modem can be enabled to permit transmissions over the second communication channel.
- various aspects of the invention can be implemented as a program for controlling computing equipment to implement the functions described herein, or a program for enabling computing equipment to perform processes corresponding to the steps disclosed herein.
- This program may be provided by storing the program in a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a semiconductor memory, or any other recording medium.
- the program can also be provided as a digitally encoded signal conveyed via a carrier wave.
- the described program can be a single program or can be implemented as multiple subprograms, each of which interact within a single computing device or interact in a distributed fashion across a network space.
- the method detailed herein can also be a method performed at least in part by a service agent and/or a machine manipulated by a service agent in response to a service request.

- the data session manager 124 can manage data channels and communication channels involving data channels.
- the modem controller 122 can manage which of multiple modems 114 or modem states are active.
- the data session manager 124 and the modem controller 124 interact with each other to prevent concurrent or simultaneous transmissions as described herein.
- Network 140 can include any hardware/software/and firmware necessary to convey digital content encoded within carrier waves. Content can be contained within analog or digital signals and conveyed through data or voice channels and can be conveyed over a personal area network (PAN) or a wide area network (WAN).
- the network 140 can include local components and data pathways necessary for communications to be exchanged among computing device components and between integrated device components and peripheral devices.
- the network 140 can also include network equipment, such as routers, data lines, hubs, and intermediary servers which together form a packet-based network, such as the Internet or an intranet.

For example, content can be stored within a relational database structure or can be stored within one or more files of a file storage system, where each file may or may not be indexed for information searching purposes.
- FIG. 2 includes a set of flow diagrams 200 and 230 showing interactions between a modem controller and a data session manager in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- the flow diagrams 200 and 230 can be implemented in the context of a system 100 or other such system where mobile device software/firmware prevents a dual capable mobile device from entering a dual transmit state.
- Diagram 200 illustrates how the data session manager 204 ensures that the no data session is placed in an active state while a modem controlled by the modem controller 206 is actively transmitting.
- the data session manager 204 can detect an event for initializing a data traffic channel.
- the data session manager 204 can notify 212 the modem controller 206 of the event 210 .
- the modem controller can determine 214 if any current modem activity exists that could prevent a data channel from being opened. For purposes of this determination 214 , only one modem is able to be simultaneously active. If no preventative activity exists, the modem controller 206 can send an allowance message 215 to the data session manager 204 .
- the data session manager 204 can initialize 222 a data traffic channel for the event.
- diagram 200 can progress to step 216 , where a priority of the data traffic channel can be optionally compared against a priority of an existing channel.
- a message 217 can be sent to the data session manager 204 to deny the initialization attempt.
- the data session manager 204 can be unable to initialize the channel due to the denial message 217 .
- the diagram 200 can progress to step 218 .
- step 218 activity can be blocked on the currently active channel, which disables transmissions over the blocked channel. After the previously active channel is blocked, an allowance message 219 can be conveyed to the data session manager 204 .
- the data session manager 204 can then initiate a data traffic channel 222 , which can require use of a modem controlled by modem controller 206 .
- Diagram 230 illustrates an interaction where an active data session 231 is selectively switched between an active and a dormant state, depending on whether a modem not associated with the active data session is needed to handle transmissions over a different channel.
- the modem controller 206 can receive 232 a request to activate a modem.
- the request can come from a component other than the data session manager 204 .
- a dispatch channel can be initialized by a mobile communication component other than manager 204 . It is assumed for purposes of diagram 230 that the request has a greater priority status than a priority status associated with the active data session.
- the data session manager 204 can selectively operate in a data dedicated mode where interruptions of an active data session 231 are prevented. No such data dedicated mode is active in diagram 230 .
- a message 234 to shift the data session to a dormant state can be sent to the data session manager 204 .
- the data session manager 204 can change the previously active data session to a dormant state 236 .
- the modem controller 206 can disable a modem used for the data session 238 .
- controller 206 can activate 240 a modem to handle the request.
- the controller 206 can disable 244 that modem and shift the associated communication session to a dormant mode.
- the data session modem can then be activated 246 .
- a notification message 247 can be sent to the data session manager 204 , which changes the dormant session to an active state 248 .
- the data session manager can continue in the active state, until transmission activity requiring the other modem is detected. At that point, steps 232 - 240 can be repeated.
- Adaptions for architectures can include architectures that utilize a single or centralized interface for handling services, such as Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) or DEFINITY Application Program Interface (DAPI).
- TAPI Telephony Application Programming Interface
- DAPI DEFINITY Application Program Interface
- the solution is also able to be utilized for architectures not having a single interface point, such as the MANHATTAN DATA ARCHITECTURE used in some Motorola mobile telephones.
- the present invention may be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.
- the present invention may be realized in a centralized fashion in one computer system or in a distributed fashion where different elements are spread across several interconnected computer systems. Any kind of computer system or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein is suited.
- a typical combination of hardware and software may be a general purpose computer system with a computer program that, when being loaded and executed, controls the computer system such that it carries out the methods described herein.
- the present invention also may be embedded in a computer program product, which comprises all the features enabling the implementation of the methods described herein, and which when loaded in a computer system is able to carry out these methods.
