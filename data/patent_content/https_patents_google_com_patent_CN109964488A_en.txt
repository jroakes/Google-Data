Specific embodiment
All aspects of this disclosure and embodiment are described, are improved for being counted using converging network from mobile device
Live video stream transmission quality and user experience.Adaptive bitrate is spread defeated (can also be claimed on the basis of downloading
To download side) it uses, multimedia (for example, video) is transferred to FTP client FTP (for example, visitor from server flows by network
Media player in the end equipment of family).Adaptive bitrate spread it is defeated can also be on the basis of upload (also referred to as upload side)
It uses, multimedia (for example, video) is streamed to server from FTP client FTP by network.Using certainly on uploading side
Adapt to bit rate stream transmission another example is for from broadcaster client end equipment (also referred to as " client device ") more matchmakers
The live stream of body transmits (for example, live video stream transmission).
Adaptive video stream Transmission system makes it possible to from the different coding bit rate encoded with it to source video, divides
Several versions of resolution and frame rate are iterated selection.The version of different coding bit rate, resolution ratio and frame rate allows visitor
Family end system (either upload or download) transmitted according to video flowing during network bandwidth and capacity of equipment adaptively select
Select version of code appropriate.For example, in response to change associated with client device condition (for example, CPU, network bandwidth
Deng), the media player of client device can be switched to the second coding of video from the first coding of video.
It is logical that this switching between the credit rating or format of video may cause video (or each segment of video)
It is multiple resolution ratio (for example, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p etc.) that adaptive video stream Transmission system, which is crossed, by transcoding.In addition, view
Each resolution ratio of frequency can be encoded with specific coding bit rate (referred to herein as " bit rate ").Bit rate (this
Text is also referred to as coding bit rate) it can refer to the information content or data volume of storage in video.In the context of video flowing transmission
In, bit rate can refer to the measurement of the bit number transmitted in the time span of setting and can be with each playback duration unit
The bit number used is measured.For example, the bit rate in video flowing transmission can be between 400k bps and 40M bps
Variation.In some cases, higher bit rate is related to the more preferable clarity of video and/or higher quality that present to audience.
Furthermore it is possible to specific frame rate transcoded video.Frame rate (also referred to as frame frequency) refers to that imaging device shows the sequential chart of referred to as frame
The frequency (rate) of picture.Frame rate can be indicated with number of pictures per second (FPS).Modification frame rate can generally also modify bit rate.
For the example of the live video broadcast from mobile device, in order to reach best quality video stream, user equipment
(for example, client device or broadcaster client end equipment) can adapt to network condition and in real time according to the available of user equipment
Bandwidth changes the video quality of video flowing.Video quality (being also referred to as " uploading quality " or " uploading mass parameter " herein) can
With by adjusting video video format and coding criterion change.Video format and coding criterion can include but is not limited to regard
Frequency bit rate, video resolution, video frame rate and/or video compression parameters, name a few.Compression parameters can refer to
It (can H.264 be regarded for example, can be used in for the specific compression applied to video/cataloged procedure configuration coding techniques and option
Option and technology (such as I frame and B frame the relevant technologies, instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR) interval, IDR frequency in frequency compression standard
Deng)).Video quality in embodiment of the present disclosure can refer to other attributes and ginseng for influencing the compressed/encoded process of video
Number.
In order to optimize the video quality of the video flowing for live streaming, broadcaster client end equipment should appreciate that how many bandwidth is
It is available and as much as possible use the available bandwidth.This can generate best quality video under given network condition
Stream.
However, the available bandwidth of broadcaster client end equipment may often change.For example, when broadcaster client end equipment is in honeycomb
Move between tower, moved between Wifi access point, being moved to honeycomb from Wifi, or even due to it is through walls, into stair, same
When demand fluctuation on Wifi router etc. is without changing network, bandwidth can change.When this variation occurs for bandwidth, even if
When using adaptive bitrate stream transmission procedure, broadcaster client end equipment also must be by conjecture/approximation (referred to as adaptive quality
Scheme) it is applied to expected amount of bandwidth so that the new video quality of video is arranged.
Traditional adaptive quality scheme quality different using different process iteration, until reaching new network condition
Until best in quality.During spending the time for executing these iteration in broadcaster client end equipment, video quality is likely to be broken simultaneously
It and is not optimal.For example, video quality may not as good as it if the bandwidth that uses of broadcaster client end equipment is fewer than possible
It is so good, and if the bandwidth that uses of broadcaster client end equipment be more than may, video flowing will not by real-time Transmission (that is,
Since no enough data for being presented video in real time, the buffering of video flowing occurs).Pass through embodiment of the present disclosure
Technical problems to be solved are to shorten (or even optionally being eliminated) for determining upload session (for example, video flowing, spreading defeated meeting
Words, upload spread transfer session, the video upload session of storage, live video upload session etc.) best in quality iterative process,
Quality (for example, video quality) is uploaded to improve user experience in a relatively short period of time and to improve to upload closer to best
Quality.Initial upload quality is selected when starting upload session, and there is also the same problems.
