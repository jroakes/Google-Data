Definitions
- the disclosed embodiments relate generally to chat systems. More particularly, the disclosed embodiments relate to methods, systems, and user interfaces for allowing a user to receive target messages from various users and sources that are of interest to the user without requiring the user to enter topic-specific chat rooms.
- chat system technology allows users to communicate in near-real time over a network, such as the Internet or an intranet.
- the most common forms of online chat are direct, one-to-one chat, commonly referred to as instant messaging (or “IM”), and chat rooms.
- IM instant messaging
- a chat room allows multiple users to communicate synchronously within the confines of the chat room.
- User interactions in chat room systems include: entering a particular chat room as an active user to type in messages and/or view messages, replying to messages in a chat room, saving messages displayed during a chat session, and switching to a different chat room.
- a user When a user is interested in conversing with other users (participants) in a particular chat room, the user enters the room either as a registered user or as a guest. Each participant in a particular chat room sees a message window for that chat room. Participants' messages appear in the message window in the order that the messages are posted. A user can respond to a recent message by posting a reply in a response dialog box. In a chat client, the newest messages are displayed either at the top or bottom of the message window. A message window will display a pre-determined number of messages. When the maximum number of messages is reached, older messages are scrolled off the message window to make room for newer messages as they are posted.
- IRC Internet Relay Chat
- IRC Internet Relay Chat
- TCP/IP Internet Protocol
- a user can only view or respond to messages that originate from a single topic-specific chat room. Thus, if a user wishes to participate in multiple chat rooms, the user must open multiple sessions to keep track of different chat rooms. Further, the current technology does not provide a convenient way for automatically determining which conversations are likely to be of interest to the user.

- a user in a chat system need not enter topic-specific chat rooms to view and reply to messages that are of interest to the user. Instead, the user specifies the types of messages that the user is interested in receiving. The chat system then sends messages based on the specified types. In addition, the chat system may send, to the user, messages that are popular or that are similar to messages that the user has received. The chat system may send advertisements to the user. Some of the advertisements may be based on the types of messages that the user receives or is interested in receiving. Further, the chat system enables the user: 1) to track one or more message threads, and 2) to give feedback on messages using a feedback GUI that is provided by the chat system.
- messages from real-time message streams are selected and filtered to obtain target messages for a given user.
- the system provides the user with a mechanism for specifying selection and filtering criteria that the system can use when selecting and filtering the real-time message streams to obtain the target messages for sending to the particular user.
- the user can specify selection criteria using a focus specification that can be modified by the user at any time.
- the system also provides the user with user controls for controlling filters that are used by the system to filter messages to obtain target messages to send to the user.
- the system creates a first inverted index based on the focus specifications of the plurality of users in the chat system.
- the system also creates a second inverted index based on words recently entered in the chat system by the plurality of users.
- the incoming real-time message streams are matched against at least one of the inverted indexes.
- a respective user of the chat system can provide feedback data with respect to target messages that the respective user receives.
- the chat system evaluates feedback data from the respective users to identify popular messages.
- the chat system processes the feedback data provided by the respective users to provide feedback results to at least some of the respective authors and to at least some of the respective users who receive popular messages.
- at least a portion of the popular messages is sent to a set of users that have not previously received the popular messages.
- the chat system identifies one or more advertisements based in part on the respective focus specification of the respective user and sends the identified advertisements to the respective user.

- the user can use his or her focus specification to specify selection criteria for selecting messages from the real-time message streams that are of interest to the user.
- the selected messages are assigned to the respective user. Assigning messages to a user means that an association is created between the selected message and the user. However, once a message is assigned to a user does not mean that the assigned message is automatically sent to the user.
- the messages that are assigned to a user are filtered using filtering criteria (rate slider data 408 of FIG. 4 ) that are controlled by the user to obtain target messages. At least a portion of the target messages are then displayed to the user. Whether or not all the target messages are displayed to the user depends on the volume of target messages and the transmission rate for sending the target messages to the user and/or the rate of display of the target messages.
- the user can specify topics of interest in the focus specification by specifying key words, natural language expressions (such as string 404 - 1 of FIG. 4 ), computer language expressions, Boolean operators, etc., for example.
- the system may support specialized pattern matching language to enable users to specify selection criteria in the form of high-precision constructs, for example.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram that illustrates a data structure 400 in user information database such as user information database 116 of FIG. 2 , according to some embodiments.

- Thread tracking data 410 includes message threads that are tracked by a specific user such as User 2 .
- the tracked threads may be Thread T 1 410 - 1 , Thread T 2 410 - 2 , . .
- Thread TZ 410 - 3 Each tracked thread may be associated with a set of attributes.
- Thread TZ 410 - 3 is associated with a set of attributes such as font type 410 - 3 a , font color 410 - 3 b , and language 410 - 3 c .
- the specified tracked thread may also be associated with a weight 410 - 3 d for use in obtaining target messages for the specified user. Tracked threads are described in greater detail below.
- the focus specification may be in the form of a file or data structure that can be modified by the user at any time.
- the focus specification may be presented in a window display for modification by the user.
- the user can edit the text in the focus specification window.
- the focus specification can optionally include display attributes associated with the respective user-specified selection criteria. Display attributes may include font type (font type 404 - 4 a ), font size, font color (font color 404 - 4 b ), style, indentation depth, language (language 404 - 4 c ), etc. To illustrate, assume that the user specifies “pottery” as one of the selection criteria in the focus specification.
- the user has selected italicized Ariel font in green, and the “English” language as the display attributes associated with the selection criterion, “pottery.”
- a target message regarding pottery is displayed to the user, such a message is displayed in English and in green italicized Ariel font.
- the user can visually identify “pottery” related target messages easily when the target messages are scrolling past in the message display window.
- the user can specify display attributes as visual aids by associating a topic of interest with a set of user-specified display attributes.
- the user can specify sources of real-time information that are of interest to the user in the user's focus specification.
- a source may specify a source as “messages by authors X, Y and Z” (identification of authors 404 - 2 ).
- the user can specify real-time information sources such as news feeds, RSS feeds (RSS 404 - 3 ), blogs (Blog 404 - 4 ), stock ticker data, TV close caption streams, etc.
- RSS 404 - 3 RSS feeds
- blogs Blog 404 - 4
- stock ticker data TV close caption streams
- the user can use the focus specification to exclude specific sources of real-time information.
- real-time information streams from the excluded sources are not matched against the user's selection criteria.
- the system creates an inverted index based on focus specifications of the users in the chat system and by using inverted indexing program 222 , according to certain embodiments.
- Such an inverted index is herein referred to as a focus specification index.
- the keys of the focus specification index are the user-specified words/expressions, user-specified channels (news feeds, blogs, RSS feeds, etc.), and the user id of the user that originated the user-specified words/expressions, etc.
- the focus specification index is periodically updated to reflect modifications made by users to their respective focus specifications.
- Message selection program 224 can use matching functions to match the words that appear in an incoming real-time information stream against the focus specification index.
- Such an incoming stream is assigned to those users for whom there is a match.
- the matching functions may include an appropriate time-dependent decay function. If a user neglects to specify any selection criteria in the user's focus specification, the system provides default selection criteria for selecting messages for assigning to the user. For example, default selection criteria may be stored in chat database 120 .
- the system may use inverted indexing program 222 to create a second inverted index based on words recently entered by the respective users.
- User-entry history data 116 b stores words recently entered by the respective users.
- user-entry history 406 stores recently entered words such as Entries 406 - 1 , 406 - 2 , . . . 406 - 3 , etc., associated with a particular user.
- Such an inverted index can be periodically updated and is herein referred to as a “recent-entry” index.
- message selection program 224 can use matching functions to match the words that appear in an incoming real-time information stream against both the focus specification index and the recent-entry index.
- User rate slider data 116 c stores settings specified by the respective user for filtering criteria or filters.
- filters include: 1) a transmission rate slider, 2) a popular slider, 3) a topical slider, and 4) a tracked-message slider.
- Such filter settings may be stored as transmission rate slider setting 408 - 1 , user specified popular slider setting 408 - 2 , user specified topical slider setting 408 - 3 , and user specified tracked message slider setting 408 - 4 as shown in FIG. 4 .
- the user can use the popular slider, topical slider, and tracked slider to control the mixing ratios of popular, topical and tracked target messages, respectively, that are sent to the user.
- the user-specified settings of the respective sliders correspond to weights in appropriate weighting functions that are used for scoring a user's assigned messages to obtain target messages.
- the system uses one or more user-specified filters to select high scoring assigned messages for sending as target messages to the user at a reasonable rate.
- the user can control the rate that messages are sent using the message transmission rate slider.
- the user can use the popular slider to control the mixing ratios of messages to include some “popular” messages sent to the user.
- the user can use the topical slider and tracked-message slider, for adjusting the mixing ratios of different types of messages sent to the user. Such sliders are illustrated in FIG. 12 herein.
- User thread-tracking data 116 d stores tracking information associated with the threads that are tracked by the respective user. For example, as shown in FIG. 4 , the tracking information identifies the specific threads such as threads 410 - 1 , 410 - 2 , . . . 410 - 3 , etc., tracked by a particular user. The tracking information can be used to select messages from the tracked thread for assigning to the user and/or for controlling one or more thread-tracking features such as display attributes and the display of anchor messages, as described in greater detail herein with reference to FIG. 10 and FIG. 11 .
- An anchor message is the first message of a tracked thread that the user has indicated interest in. To illustrate, if a user decides to begin tracking the thread at message X, then message X becomes the anchor message for the thread of subsequent messages that follow.
- users can explicitly deselect branches of a thread tree that do not interest them, and the system can automatically prune subtrees of the thread tree that do not receive attention in the form of comments of further selections as containing interesting messages or that receive deselection actions from a plurality of other users. This propagates the more interesting branches of the thread tree and keeps the thread tree to a manageable size.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram that illustrates a data structure 500 in a chat database such as chat database 120 of FIG. 2 , according to some embodiments.
- Data structure 500 includes user chat data 502 corresponding to the plurality of users such as User 1 , User 2 , . . . , User P of the chat system.

- the system can save “before modification” and “after modification” copies of the respective user's focus specification.
- the system can generate a list of differences based on the “before modification” and “after modification” copies.
- the system can then delete or add entries to the inverted index based on the generated list of differences.
- Updates to user-specified channels may result in updating associated data structures. For example, data structures that include lists of users that would like to see “blog A” ( 404 - 4 ) channel messages is updated if a user made a recent modification in his focus specification to include “blog A.”
- the server builds a second inverted index (recent-entry index) based on words recently entered by the respective users ( 604 ).
- server 112 of FIG. 2 uses inverted indexing program 222 to build the recent-entry index based on the recently entered words stored in user-entry history 406 .
- the recent-entry index may be updated as frequently as needed to reflect currently entered words.
- a message from the incoming real-time message streams is herein referred to as an incoming message.
- the chat system attaches to an incoming message one or more of the following: 1) a time stamp, 2) information on source language, 3) a link to the parent message if the incoming message is a reply to another message, 4) a unique identifier for identifying the message, and 5) the identity of the author.
- the server determines if an incoming message is to be selected for assignment to the respective users by matching the words in the incoming message against the focus specification index to determine which users have specified an interest in the words of the incoming message ( 606 ).
- server 112 uses message selection program 224 to determine if an incoming message is to be selected for assignment to the respective users.
- the incoming message is assigned to those users for whom there is a match.
- the assigned message includes an indication of the quality of the match.
- the selected message can include annotations of the reasons for selecting the message.
- the annotations can include the number of matching words, how unusual were the matching words. The more unusual the words, the greater the weight.
- server 112 uses message selection program 224 to match the words in the incoming message against the recent-entry index ( 608 ).
- the incoming message is assigned to those users for whom there is a match.
- the assigned message includes an indication of the quality of the match.
- the server 112 uses message selection program 224 to determine which users are tracking the thread to which the incoming message belongs ( 610 ).
- the incoming message is assigned to those users who are tracking the thread to which the incoming message belongs.
- the assigned message includes a relevance measure.
- the relevance measure can include the distance between the node of the anchor message and the node of the incoming message. Such a distance is also referred to herein as a thread length.
- the server 112 uses message selection program 224 to determine the popularity of the incoming message ( 612 ). For example, one measure of popularity may be determined by the number of matches the incoming message had when matched against the focus specification index and the recent-entry index. Another measure of popularity may be determined by the number of users that are tracking the thread to which the incoming message belongs. The popularity of the incoming message may also be determined by measuring the size of the sub-tree under the incoming message. Incoming messages that exceed a pre-selected level of popularity are assigned to the respective users.
- the server 112 uses message selection program 224 to determine the ancestor messages of the incoming message up to a pre-determined number of ancestor messages and assigns the incoming message to the authors of the ancestor messages ( 614 ).
- the acts of matching the incoming message against the focus specification index and the recent-entry index as well as the act of determining which users are tracking the thread of the incoming message may be done concurrently using a distributed process.
- the system is designed to be “best-effort”, i.e., it provides no guarantees that any message will reach any user, which enables the implementers to exploit considerable freedoms when distributing the system components among many computers.
- the system can perform filtering operations, described in greater detail with reference to FIG. 7 , as the incoming message is assigned to the respective user.
- a time slice approach is used for the filtering operations. For example, assume that the time slice is selected to be ⁇ t seconds. Rather than filtering an incoming message as soon as it is assigned to a user, the filtering operations are performed once every ⁇ t seconds. Thus, the filtering operations are performed on a bundle of assigned messages at a time for the respective user.
- the size of the time slice may be pre-selected or dynamically selected based on the system load. The more loaded the system, the larger the time slice, for example.
- the system can send the assigned messages to client 102 and allow client 102 to perform the filtering operations on the bundle of assigned messages.
- client 102 uses message filtering application program 331 to filter the bundle of assigned messages to obtain target messages for displaying to the respective user associated with client 102 .
- server 112 performs the filtering operations by using message filtering application program 226 to obtain target messages.
- message filtering application program 226 For purposes of explanation, FIG. 7 is described by assuming that server 112 performs the filtering operations.

FIG. 7 is described with reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 5 .
- the scoring record associated with an assigned message includes annotations of the reasons for selecting the message and/or other relevance measures for selecting the message.
- the reasons and relevance measures for selecting a message is herein also referred to as relevance factors. Each relevance factor is associated with a value.
- Server 112 uses the message filtering application program 226 to apply appropriate weighting functions to the relevance factors in the scoring record associated with the respective assigned message ( 704 ).
- the respective relevance factor value can be multiplied by appropriate normalizing factors and then multiplied by the user-specified settings of appropriate filters such as the transmission rate slider, popular slider, topical slider, and the tracked-message slider.
- appropriate time-dependent decay functions may be applied to one or more of the relevance factor values to discount the value of a given relevance factor.
- Server 112 may provide default values for any of the filters for which the user has not selected a setting.
- Server 112 uses the message filtering program 226 to sum the values of the relevance factors so that the respective assigned message is associated with a single score, according to certain embodiments ( 706 ).
- the above filtering operations are performed on the plurality of messages in the bundle of assigned messages for a given time slice for the respective user.
- the scored messages are merged with pending messages, if any ( 708 ).
- Pending messages are scored messages that are in a queue waiting for to be sent to the user.

Description
This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/968,098, filed Dec. 14, 2010, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,301,709, which is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/728,317, filed Mar. 22, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,865,553, which are incorporated by reference in its entireties.
This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/728,316, filed Mar. 22, 2007, entitled “Voting in Chat System Without Topic-Specific Rooms,” U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/728,318, filed Mar. 22, 2007, entitled “Broadcasting In Chat System Without Topic-Specific Rooms,” and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/728,319, filed Mar. 22, 2007, entitled “Advertising In Chat System Without Topic-Specific Rooms,” all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
The disclosed embodiments relate generally to chat systems. More particularly, the disclosed embodiments relate to methods, systems, and user interfaces for allowing a user to receive target messages from various users and sources that are of interest to the user without requiring the user to enter topic-specific chat rooms.
Chat system technology, commonly referred to as online chat, allows users to communicate in near-real time over a network, such as the Internet or an intranet. The most common forms of online chat are direct, one-to-one chat, commonly referred to as instant messaging (or “IM”), and chat rooms. A chat room allows multiple users to communicate synchronously within the confines of the chat room.
User interactions in chat room systems include: entering a particular chat room as an active user to type in messages and/or view messages, replying to messages in a chat room, saving messages displayed during a chat session, and switching to a different chat room.
When a user is interested in conversing with other users (participants) in a particular chat room, the user enters the room either as a registered user or as a guest. Each participant in a particular chat room sees a message window for that chat room. Participants' messages appear in the message window in the order that the messages are posted. A user can respond to a recent message by posting a reply in a response dialog box. In a chat client, the newest messages are displayed either at the top or bottom of the message window. A message window will display a pre-determined number of messages. When the maximum number of messages is reached, older messages are scrolled off the message window to make room for newer messages as they are posted.
There are various technologies for implementing chat systems. One common chat technology is referred to as IRC, short for “Internet Relay Chat.” IRC is a client-server technology in which users must use a specific IRC client program to select and log in to chat rooms. IRC chat clients and chat server employ the TCP/IP (Internet) protocol for communications. Web-based chat technologies are also available.
In current chat systems, a user can only view or respond to messages that originate from a single topic-specific chat room. Thus, if a user wishes to participate in multiple chat rooms, the user must open multiple sessions to keep track of different chat rooms. Further, the current technology does not provide a convenient way for automatically determining which conversations are likely to be of interest to the user.
For a better understanding of the aforementioned aspects of the invention as well as additional aspects and embodiments thereof, reference should be made to the Description of Embodiments below, in conjunction with the following drawings in which like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the figures.
Methods, systems, user interfaces, and other aspects of the invention are described. Reference will be made to certain embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to these particular embodiments alone. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents that are within the spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
Moreover, in the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these particular details. In other instances, methods, procedures, components, and networks that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art are not described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the present invention.
According to certain embodiments of the invention, a user in a chat system need not enter topic-specific chat rooms to view and reply to messages that are of interest to the user. Instead, the user specifies the types of messages that the user is interested in receiving. The chat system then sends messages based on the specified types. In addition, the chat system may send, to the user, messages that are popular or that are similar to messages that the user has received. The chat system may send advertisements to the user. Some of the advertisements may be based on the types of messages that the user receives or is interested in receiving. Further, the chat system enables the user: 1) to track one or more message threads, and 2) to give feedback on messages using a feedback GUI that is provided by the chat system.
According to one feature of certain embodiments, messages from real-time message streams are selected and filtered to obtain target messages for a given user. The system provides the user with a mechanism for specifying selection and filtering criteria that the system can use when selecting and filtering the real-time message streams to obtain the target messages for sending to the particular user. According to another feature of an embodiment, the user can specify selection criteria using a focus specification that can be modified by the user at any time. The system also provides the user with user controls for controlling filters that are used by the system to filter messages to obtain target messages to send to the user. According to yet another feature of certain embodiments, the system creates a first inverted index based on the focus specifications of the plurality of users in the chat system. The system also creates a second inverted index based on words recently entered in the chat system by the plurality of users. As part of the message selection process, the incoming real-time message streams are matched against at least one of the inverted indexes.
According to some embodiments, a respective user of the chat system can provide feedback data with respect to target messages that the respective user receives. The chat system evaluates feedback data from the respective users to identify popular messages. The chat system processes the feedback data provided by the respective users to provide feedback results to at least some of the respective authors and to at least some of the respective users who receive popular messages. According to some embodiments, at least a portion of the popular messages is sent to a set of users that have not previously received the popular messages.
According to certain embodiments, the chat system identifies one or more advertisements based in part on the respective focus specification of the respective user and sends the identified advertisements to the respective user.
In the case of multiple servers, each server, such as server 112, is coupled to a communications network 106 via a network communication module 122. The communications network 106 may be the Internet, but may also be any local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN). In some embodiments, server 112 is a Web server that manages chat messages using appropriate chat protocols. Alternatively, if server 112 is used within an intranet, it may be an intranet server.
In essence, server 112 is configured to manage certain aspects of chat subsystem 108, including receiving requests from the user (associated with client 102), sending chat messages to clients 102 for display and receiving information, such as messages, user registration information and user preferences from clients 102.
In some embodiments, fewer and/or additional modules, functions or databases are included in chat subsystem 108 and server 112. The modules shown in chat subsystem 108 and server 112 represent functions performed in a certain embodiments.
Notwithstanding the discrete blocks in FIG. 1 , the figure is intended to be a functional description of some embodiments of the invention rather than a structural description of functional elements in the embodiments. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that an actual implementation might have the functional elements grouped or split among various components. For example, user information database 116 may be part of server 112. In some embodiments, user information database 116 may be implemented using one or more servers whose primary function is to store and process user information. Similarly, chat database 120 may be implemented on one or more servers. Moreover, one or more of the blocks in FIG. 1 may be implemented on one or more servers designed to provide the described functionality. Although the description herein refers to certain features implemented in client 102 and certain features implemented in server 112, the embodiments of the invention are not limited to such distinctions. For example, features described herein as being part of server 112 could be implemented in whole or in part in client 102, and vice versa.

In some embodiments, server 112 includes the following non-limiting examples of elements, or a subset of such elements: a user information processing module 124, and an applications module 128 that includes application programs, such as a chat application program 218, an inverted indexing application program 222, a message selection application program 224 for assigning messages to the respective users, a message filtering application program 226 for obtaining target messages, a message transmission application program 228 for sending target messages to the user at an appropriate rate, a popular message selection application program 229 for selecting popular messages for sending to the user, and an advertisement selection application program 230 for selecting advertisements for sending to the user. According to certain embodiments, two or more of above application programs may be combined. As a non-limiting example, the functions of the above application programs may be performed by chat application program 218. According to some embodiments, server 112 uses chat application program 218 to manage various aspects of the chat subsystem such as coordinating the functions of the inverted indexing application program 222, the message selection application program 224, the filtering application program 226, the message transmission application program 228, user information database 116 and chat database 120. The functions of such application programs and the chat database 120 are described in greater detail herein with reference to FIG. 6 , FIG. 7 , FIG. 8 and FIG. 9 .

The above identified modules and applications in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 correspond to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. These modules (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. In some embodiments, memories 206 and 306 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore, memories 206 and 306 may store additional modules and data structures not described above.
Although FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 show chat subsystem 108 and client 102 as a number of discrete items, FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 are intended more as a functional description of the various features which may be present in chat subsystem 108 and client 102 rather than as a structural schematic of the embodiments described herein. In practice, and as recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated. For example, some items shown separately in FIG. 2 could be implemented on single servers and single items could be implemented by one or more servers. As another example, some of the databases shown in either of the figures may be combined while other databases may be separated into more granular components. The actual number of servers in chat subsystem 108 and how features are allocated among them may vary from implementation to implementation, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system handles during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
According to certain embodiments, a respective user is associated with a focus specification, such as focus specification 404 of FIG. 4 . The plurality of focus specifications may be stored as focus specifications 116 a in user information database 116, for example. The user can use his or her focus specification to specify selection criteria for selecting messages from the real-time message streams that are of interest to the user. The selected messages are assigned to the respective user. Assigning messages to a user means that an association is created between the selected message and the user. However, once a message is assigned to a user does not mean that the assigned message is automatically sent to the user. The messages that are assigned to a user are filtered using filtering criteria (rate slider data 408 of FIG. 4 ) that are controlled by the user to obtain target messages. At least a portion of the target messages are then displayed to the user. Whether or not all the target messages are displayed to the user depends on the volume of target messages and the transmission rate for sending the target messages to the user and/or the rate of display of the target messages.
According to certain embodiments, the user can specify topics of interest in the focus specification by specifying key words, natural language expressions (such as string 404-1 of FIG. 4 ), computer language expressions, Boolean operators, etc., for example. The system may support specialized pattern matching language to enable users to specify selection criteria in the form of high-precision constructs, for example.
The focus specification may be in the form of a file or data structure that can be modified by the user at any time. As another non-limiting example, the focus specification may be presented in a window display for modification by the user. The user can edit the text in the focus specification window. The focus specification can optionally include display attributes associated with the respective user-specified selection criteria. Display attributes may include font type (font type 404-4 a), font size, font color (font color 404-4 b), style, indentation depth, language (language 404-4 c), etc. To illustrate, assume that the user specifies “pottery” as one of the selection criteria in the focus specification. Further assume that the user has selected italicized Ariel font in green, and the “English” language as the display attributes associated with the selection criterion, “pottery.” In the event that a target message regarding pottery is displayed to the user, such a message is displayed in English and in green italicized Ariel font. Thus, at a glance, the user can visually identify “pottery” related target messages easily when the target messages are scrolling past in the message display window. In other words, the user can specify display attributes as visual aids by associating a topic of interest with a set of user-specified display attributes.
Further, the user can specify sources of real-time information that are of interest to the user in the user's focus specification. For example, the user may specify a source as “messages by authors X, Y and Z” (identification of authors 404-2). Also, the user can specify real-time information sources such as news feeds, RSS feeds (RSS 404-3), blogs (Blog 404-4), stock ticker data, TV close caption streams, etc. According to one embodiment, such real-time information sources are integrated into the chat system by creating pseudo users to represent such real-time information sources.
Also, the user can use the focus specification to exclude specific sources of real-time information. In other words, real-time information streams from the excluded sources are not matched against the user's selection criteria.
In order to match incoming real-time information streams against the users' focus specifications, the system creates an inverted index based on focus specifications of the users in the chat system and by using inverted indexing program 222, according to certain embodiments. Such an inverted index is herein referred to as a focus specification index. The keys of the focus specification index are the user-specified words/expressions, user-specified channels (news feeds, blogs, RSS feeds, etc.), and the user id of the user that originated the user-specified words/expressions, etc. The focus specification index is periodically updated to reflect modifications made by users to their respective focus specifications. Message selection program 224 can use matching functions to match the words that appear in an incoming real-time information stream against the focus specification index. Such an incoming stream is assigned to those users for whom there is a match. The matching functions may include an appropriate time-dependent decay function. If a user neglects to specify any selection criteria in the user's focus specification, the system provides default selection criteria for selecting messages for assigning to the user. For example, default selection criteria may be stored in chat database 120.
Optionally, the system may use inverted indexing program 222 to create a second inverted index based on words recently entered by the respective users. User-entry history data 116 b stores words recently entered by the respective users. For example, as shown in FIG. 4 , user-entry history 406 stores recently entered words such as Entries 406-1, 406-2, . . . 406-3, etc., associated with a particular user. Such an inverted index can be periodically updated and is herein referred to as a “recent-entry” index. As previously explained, message selection program 224 can use matching functions to match the words that appear in an incoming real-time information stream against both the focus specification index and the recent-entry index.
User rate slider data 116 c stores settings specified by the respective user for filtering criteria or filters. Non-limiting examples of filters include: 1) a transmission rate slider, 2) a popular slider, 3) a topical slider, and 4) a tracked-message slider. Such filter settings may be stored as transmission rate slider setting 408-1, user specified popular slider setting 408-2, user specified topical slider setting 408-3, and user specified tracked message slider setting 408-4 as shown in FIG. 4 . According to certain embodiments, the user can use the popular slider, topical slider, and tracked slider to control the mixing ratios of popular, topical and tracked target messages, respectively, that are sent to the user. According to certain embodiments, the user-specified settings of the respective sliders correspond to weights in appropriate weighting functions that are used for scoring a user's assigned messages to obtain target messages. As the volume of incoming real-time message streams increases, there may be more assigned messages than a user can view in a practical fashion. Thus, the system uses one or more user-specified filters to select high scoring assigned messages for sending as target messages to the user at a reasonable rate. The user can control the rate that messages are sent using the message transmission rate slider. The user can use the popular slider to control the mixing ratios of messages to include some “popular” messages sent to the user. Similarly, the user can use the topical slider and tracked-message slider, for adjusting the mixing ratios of different types of messages sent to the user. Such sliders are illustrated in FIG. 12 herein.
User thread-tracking data 116 d stores tracking information associated with the threads that are tracked by the respective user. For example, as shown in FIG. 4 , the tracking information identifies the specific threads such as threads 410-1, 410-2, . . . 410-3, etc., tracked by a particular user. The tracking information can be used to select messages from the tracked thread for assigning to the user and/or for controlling one or more thread-tracking features such as display attributes and the display of anchor messages, as described in greater detail herein with reference to FIG. 10 and FIG. 11 . An anchor message is the first message of a tracked thread that the user has indicated interest in. To illustrate, if a user decides to begin tracking the thread at message X, then message X becomes the anchor message for the thread of subsequent messages that follow.
In some embodiments, users can explicitly deselect branches of a thread tree that do not interest them, and the system can automatically prune subtrees of the thread tree that do not receive attention in the form of comments of further selections as containing interesting messages or that receive deselection actions from a plurality of other users. This propagates the more interesting branches of the thread tree and keeps the thread tree to a manageable size.
As described above, selected messages are messages selected based on the selection criteria specified in the respective focus specification for a specified user. The selected messages are associated with the specified user. For example, selected messages such as Message S1 504-1, . . . , Message Sn 504-n, etc., are assigned to User 2. The selected messages for User 2 are filtered using filtering criteria (rate slider data 408) to obtain target or filtered messages. For example, selected messages 504 are filtered using filtering criteria based on rate slider data 408 to obtain target messages such as Message T1 506-1, . . . , Message Tm 506-m, etc., for User 2. Feedback results 508 include the feedback received with respect to respective messages authored by User 2. For example, User 2 may receive feedback such as Feedback 508-1 for message A, . . . , Feedback 508-2 for Message B, etc. Further, the chat system may send advertisements such as advertisement A 510-1 . . . , Advertisement P 510-p, etc., to User 2.
In other words, the chat system may assign messages to a respective user based on one or more reasons including: 1) the message is an advertisement that the system would like to send to the user, 2) the message belongs to a thread that is explicitly tracked by the respective user, 3) the message is a popular message in the chat system (for example, the message is tracked by many users), and 4) the message matches at least one selection criterion in the respective user's focus specification. According to certain embodiments, the weight of the above reasons 2 to 4 are additive with respect to filtering selected messages to obtain target messages to send to the respective user.
Returning to FIG. 6 , the server builds a second inverted index (recent-entry index) based on words recently entered by the respective users (604). For example, server 112 of FIG. 2 uses inverted indexing program 222 to build the recent-entry index based on the recently entered words stored in user-entry history 406. The recent-entry index may be updated as frequently as needed to reflect currently entered words.
A message from the incoming real-time message streams is herein referred to as an incoming message. According to certain embodiments, the chat system attaches to an incoming message one or more of the following: 1) a time stamp, 2) information on source language, 3) a link to the parent message if the incoming message is a reply to another message, 4) a unique identifier for identifying the message, and 5) the identity of the author.
The server determines if an incoming message is to be selected for assignment to the respective users by matching the words in the incoming message against the focus specification index to determine which users have specified an interest in the words of the incoming message (606). For example, server 112 uses message selection program 224 to determine if an incoming message is to be selected for assignment to the respective users. The incoming message is assigned to those users for whom there is a match. The assigned message includes an indication of the quality of the match. For example, the selected message can include annotations of the reasons for selecting the message. The annotations can include the number of matching words, how unusual were the matching words. The more unusual the words, the greater the weight.
According to certain embodiments, server 112 uses message selection program 224 to match the words in the incoming message against the recent-entry index (608). The incoming message is assigned to those users for whom there is a match. The assigned message includes an indication of the quality of the match.
The server 112 uses message selection program 224 to determine which users are tracking the thread to which the incoming message belongs (610). The incoming message is assigned to those users who are tracking the thread to which the incoming message belongs. The assigned message includes a relevance measure. As a non-limiting example, the relevance measure can include the distance between the node of the anchor message and the node of the incoming message. Such a distance is also referred to herein as a thread length.
The server 112 uses message selection program 224 to determine the popularity of the incoming message (612). For example, one measure of popularity may be determined by the number of matches the incoming message had when matched against the focus specification index and the recent-entry index. Another measure of popularity may be determined by the number of users that are tracking the thread to which the incoming message belongs. The popularity of the incoming message may also be determined by measuring the size of the sub-tree under the incoming message. Incoming messages that exceed a pre-selected level of popularity are assigned to the respective users.
The server 112 uses message selection program 224 to determine the ancestor messages of the incoming message up to a pre-determined number of ancestor messages and assigns the incoming message to the authors of the ancestor messages (614).
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that some of the above acts described with reference to FIG. 6 need not be performed in the order described. For example, the acts of matching the incoming message against the focus specification index and the recent-entry index as well as the act of determining which users are tracking the thread of the incoming message may be done concurrently using a distributed process. In certain embodiments, the system is designed to be “best-effort”, i.e., it provides no guarantees that any message will reach any user, which enables the implementers to exploit considerable freedoms when distributing the system components among many computers.
As described above with reference to FIG. 6 , as the real-time incoming messages stream into the chat system, various selection operations are performed on the incoming message to assign the message to one or more respective users. According to certain embodiments, the system can perform filtering operations, described in greater detail with reference to FIG. 7 , as the incoming message is assigned to the respective user. According to other embodiments, a time slice approach is used for the filtering operations. For example, assume that the time slice is selected to be Δt seconds. Rather than filtering an incoming message as soon as it is assigned to a user, the filtering operations are performed once every Δt seconds. Thus, the filtering operations are performed on a bundle of assigned messages at a time for the respective user. The size of the time slice may be pre-selected or dynamically selected based on the system load. The more loaded the system, the larger the time slice, for example.
According to one embodiment, the system can send the assigned messages to client 102 and allow client 102 to perform the filtering operations on the bundle of assigned messages. In other words, client 102 uses message filtering application program 331 to filter the bundle of assigned messages to obtain target messages for displaying to the respective user associated with client 102.
According to certain other embodiments, server 112 performs the filtering operations by using message filtering application program 226 to obtain target messages. For purposes of explanation, FIG. 7 is described by assuming that server 112 performs the filtering operations.
The scored messages are merged with pending messages, if any (708). Pending messages are scored messages that are in a queue waiting for to be sent to the user. The merged set of scored messages is sorted based on the scores.
The server uses message transmission program 228 to transmit the sorted messages at an appropriate transmission rate to client 102 associated with the respective user (710). The messages with the highest scores are sent first. According to certain embodiments, messages with scores below a pre-selected score are discarded. According to certain other embodiments, pending messages are timed out after a pre-selected period of time.
According to some embodiments, the chat system may re-broadcast messages that exceed a pre-selected threshold of popularity in order to disseminate such messages to a larger audience. For example, if the chat system detects that message M receives tracking request that exceed a pre-selected amount and/or the message receives positive feedback above a pre-selected threshold, message M is re-broadcast to a set of users who have not previously received message M. Feedback regarding received target messages and/or regarding the author of the target messages are described in greater detail herein with reference to FIG. 10 , FIG. 11 and FIG. 12 .
According to certain embodiments, messages that are advertisements that the system would like to send to a respective user are not subject to the message selection and filtering process and are automatically sent to the respective user as a high priority target message. However, according to some other embodiments, advertising messages may be selected based on the selection criteria in the user's focus specification.
As a non-limiting example, the scrolling message window 1002 displays target messages 1012 to the user. Incoming target messages are displayed to the user at a reasonable display rate. Older messages are scrolled off the message window to make room for newer messages. According to one embodiment, message 1012 may be preceded by several user-interface buttons such as:
-
- A tracking-on button 1004: the user can begin tracking a given message by clicking on the tracking-on
button 1004 that corresponds to the particular message. According to one embodiment, by clicking ontracking button 1004 that corresponds to a message that the user is already tracking, the user can “vote” for such a message as being highly interesting to the user. - A tracking-off button 1006: by clicking once on the tracking-
off button 1006 that corresponds to a given message from a tracked thread, the user can stop tracking subsequent messages in the sub-thread of the given message. According to one embodiment, by clicking on the tracking-off button 1006 twice corresponding to a message in a tracked thread, the user can turn off tracking for the entire thread. By clicking the tracking-off button 1006 associated with a message that has not been previously tracked by the user, the user can indicate that the user does not wish to receive messages that are similar to the message on which the user clicked. According to certain embodiments, by clicking the tracking-off button 1006 associated with a message that has not been previously tracked by the user, the user creates a selection criterion in the user's focus specification for excluding such messages. - An author button 1010:
author button 1010 identifies the author of a given message. Associated with theauthor button 1010 are votingbuttons 1010 a (“+” button) and 1010 b (“−” button), according to certain embodiments. For example, the user can click onvoting button 1010 a once corresponding to a given message, when the user wishes to see more messages on the topic of the given message by the author of the given message. As another example, the user can click onvoting button 1010 a twice when the user wishes to see more messages by the author of the given message on any topic. Clicking onvoting button 1010 a three times can mean that the user wishes to all subsequent messages by the author of the given message, for example. As yet another example, the user can click onvoting button 1010 b once to indicate that the user does not wish to see any messages from the corresponding sub-thread, clicking twice to indicate that the system should ignore the corresponding selection criteria in the user's focus specification that caused the given message to be selected, and clicking thrice to indicate that the given message is spam. -
Feedback buttons messages 1012 that scroll through the scrollingmessage window 1002. According to some embodiments, the user can designate a given message as spam by using a spam feedback button such asfeedback button 1020. Non-limiting examples of feedback buttons include buttons for sentiments such as “good”, “bad”, “funny,” “punny,” “boring,” “redundant,” “agree”, “disagree”, “funny”, “cannot understand”, “irrelevant”, “spam”, “obscene”, “objectionable”, “please continue”, “interesting”, “uninteresting”, etc.
- A tracking-on button 1004: the user can begin tracking a given message by clicking on the tracking-on
According to alternate embodiments, instead of preceding a given message, the user-interface buttons may be semi-transparent buttons that appear as an overlay on a given message when the user's mouse hovers over the given message. In another embodiment, the buttons may appear at the side of scrolling message window 1002. The embodiments are not limited to the user interface buttons and associated operations described herein. Other appropriate buttons may used for allowing the user to perform desired operations with respect to the selection and display of messages. In certain embodiments, pop-up menus may be used in lieu of or in addition to user interface buttons.
According to certain embodiments, the target messages may be associated with specific display attributes. As a non-limiting example, when tracking is turned on for a given message, the messages in the tracked thread change from a lighter washed out color to a richer tone. As previously described, the user may specify color, font and style for the various selection criteria selected by the user in the user's specification. Further, advertisements may be displayed to the user in the advertising area 1026 using appropriate display attributes to attract the attention of the user. Similarly, “popular” messages may be displayed to the user using distinguishing display attributes.
Tracked thread windows 1128 display to the user the target messages that belong to threads that are tracked by the user. For example, tracked thread window 1128 a displays the target messages that belong to the thread associated with anchor message J. Similarly, tracked thread windows 1128 b, . . . , 1128 n display the target messages that belong to the threads associated with anchor message K, . . . , and anchor message P, respectively. For example, if the user terminates tracking the thread associated with anchor message J, tracked message window 1128 a would close automatically, according to certain embodiments.
The user can use transmission rate slider 1206 to control the overall rate of transmission of target messages to the user. Similarly, the user can use popular slider 1208, topical slider 1210, and tracked slider 1212 to control the mixing ratios of popular, topical and tracked target messages, respectively, to the user. Such sliders are also referred to as message fraction sliders. The user setting for the rate slider 1206, popular slider 1208, topical slider 1210, and the tracked slider 1212 may be stored in data structure 400 (rate slider 408) as illustrated in FIG. 4 , according to certain embodiments. Note that in some embodiments the slider settings may be advisory only, and the system may return a different mixture, as traffic warrants.
