Abstract
Aspects of the present technology evaluate places familiar to a given user in order to provide contextualized location information about other places of interest. This may include evaluating the actual number of visits by a given user to one or more locations in a given geographic area. For example, places that have been visited a sufficient number of times within a particular schedule are identified as personal landmarks for the user. Thus, when a user searches a particular place or otherwise requests results that are appropriate to a query, the system may use personalized landmark information to help rank search results and provide location hints to help the user quickly and efficiently reach the location of the search results. Personal landmarks are necessarily familiar to the user and may reduce the number of turn-by-turn turns or simplify the graphical interface of the client device.
Description
Background
The map and navigation type application can provide street addresses within a geographic area and indicate the location of points of interest. This information may be presented to the user on a display device. However, if he or she is unfamiliar with the displayed area, this information may be substantially irrelevant to the user, and thus may cause the user to be unable to efficiently perform his/her tasks. For example, the user may be coming to a city. If he or she makes a query for restaurants or other places of interest in the city, the application may return a result with a street address or a map with pushpins. Unfortunately, this information may not be useful or may actually confuse the user as to where to go or how to get there. A more robust approach to providing contextual information would be more useful to the user and would provide improved interaction between the user and the device for presenting contextual information.
Disclosure of Invention
To provide relevant personalized location information, various aspects of the present technology focus on where the user is familiar. Although well-known landmarks may be used to target a user when viewing a map or reading directions, it is more likely that returning results related to some place that the user is personally familiar with will help the user. Such landmarks may provide contextual suggestions or other cues to help orient the user when viewing the results on the map, and may help the user efficiently reach particular places of interest through interaction with his or her computing device. For example, using landmarks with which the user is personally familiar may streamline turn-by-turn directions that otherwise need to be provided to the user. This is one example of how aspects of the technology may provide a differentiating scheme to select particular information to provide from a computing device to a user. Aspects of the technology may reduce the density of information displayed on the screen of such devices and make selected displayed information more visible to a user, for example, by drawing the user's attention to landmarks and places of interest in the information displayed on the screen.
According to one aspect, a computer-implemented method is provided. The method comprises the following steps: obtaining, by one or more processors, a search request for a given geographic area from a client query at a client device; obtaining, by the one or more processors, one or more search results for the search request, the one or more search results corresponding to one or more places of interest in a given geographic area; and identifying, by the one or more processors, one or more personalized landmarks in a given geographic area, the personalized landmarks associated with a user of the client device. The method further comprises the following steps: selecting, by the one or more processors, at least one personalized landmark that satisfies physical location criteria associated with a given one of the one or more places of interest; and generating, by the one or more processors, at least one of textual, auditory, or visual information for presentation by the client device to guide a user of the client device from the at least one personalized landmark to the given place of interest.
In one example, the one or more personalized landmarks are areas or points of interest that the user is personally familiar with, as determined from one or more previous actions of the user. The one or more previous actions may include visiting an area familiar to the individual or a point of interest familiar to the individual a minimum number of times within a given schedule. The personalized landmark may be in a geographic location previously visited by the user. The association between the user and a personalized landmark may include data stored in computer memory indicating that the user has previously visited the personalized landmark.
The physical location criterion may be a predetermined physical distance or line of sight between a particular personalized landmark and the given place of interest. Generating at least one of textual, auditory, or visual information may include obscuring information about the at least one personalized landmark. Selecting at least one of the personalized landmarks to satisfy the physical location criteria may include evaluating a current viewport of the client device. Evaluating the current viewport of the client device may include determining that a map displayed in the current viewport includes a location of the selected personalized landmark.
The computer-implemented method may further include applying data identifying the identified one or more personalized landmarks as a ranking signal to select a subset of search results to present in response to the search request. The computer-implemented method may further include determining whether the location of any personalized landmark falls within a geographic area displayed within a current viewport of the client device. Determining whether the location of any personalized landmark falls within a geographic area displayed within a current viewport of the client device may be performed prior to obtaining a search request.
The selection of at least one personalized landmark may be based on one or more of a previous visit to the particular personalized landmark, and easy accessibility between the particular personalized landmark and the place of interest. And the what visual information can be other non-textual visual information.
Another aspect is directed to a system configured to perform the above method. Yet another aspect is directed to computer readable instructions which, when executed by a computing device, cause the method as described above to be performed. Yet another aspect is directed to a non-transitory computer-readable recording medium having instructions stored thereon. The instructions, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the method as described above.
Yet another aspect provides a client device. The client device includes: a user interface module comprising one or more user input devices configured to receive user input; a processing module comprising one or more processors; a memory module having one or more memories configured to store data and instructions for execution by the processing module; and a communication module comprising a wireless transceiver configured to bi-directionally communicate with one or more remote devices. The processing module is operatively coupled to the user interface module, the memory module, and the communication module. The processing module is configured to: obtaining a search request for a given geographic area from a client query at a client device; obtaining one or more search results for the search request, the one or more search results corresponding to one or more places of interest in a given geographic area; identifying one or more personalized landmarks in the given geographic area, the personalized landmarks associated with a user of the client device; selecting at least one personalized landmark that satisfies physical location criteria associated with a given one of the one or more places of interest; and generating at least one of textual, auditory, or visual information for presentation by the client device to guide a user of the client device from the at least one personalized landmark to a given place of interest.

Detailed Description
SUMMARY
By using contextual landmark information in response to search queries to provide driving (or walking) directions or to highlight routes on a map, users are enabled to quickly and easily orient themselves with respect to a place of interest. One way to do this is to find famous places, including the first N places in a city visited by many people. The first N places visited may be, for example, 1-3 places, no more than 5 places, a maximum of 10 places, etc. It is also possible to view visited places via location history or places queried in search requests and to aggregate this information among many users. Here, the first few visited places may be evaluated to determine whether they should be given the status of a "famous" (or popular) landmark. Another approach is to evaluate the local visit of a given user. For example, places that have been visited more than X times (e.g., 5 times) within a predetermined period of time (e.g., 1 year, 3 months, last week) may be identified as "personal" landmarks for a given user.
Once the personalized or famous landmark has been determined, search results associated with a particular location are presented to a user in relation to the proximity of such landmark(s). If the result is already familiar to the user, for example due to a previous visit in person, it is not necessary to interpret the location of the result. However, if the result is new to the user (e.g., a new restaurant or store), and a relevant landmark is present nearby, the location of the result or the direction of the result is presented by the device based on proximity to the landmark (e.g., by text, orally, visually, and/or via tactile/haptic feedback). This may be done, for example, by using the device to instruct the user to drive (or walk) towards the personalized landmark, turn right, walk 2 blocks, and the place of interest (i.e., the location associated with the search result) will be to the left of the street. By doing so, the density of information presented to the user by the device to allow the user to efficiently navigate to the location of interest is reduced relative to, for example, a full set of turn-by-turn instructions from the user's current location. A differentiation scheme is used to select specific information, including personalized landmarks, that, once displayed or otherwise output to the user from his/her device at a relatively low information density facilitated by the differentiation, allows the user to effectively interact with the device to move to a location of interest. In examples where the information is displayed on a screen of the device, a low density of the information may allow the landmark or location of interest to be highly visible to a user. This may be due, at least in part, to the greatly reduced extent to which such items of information are undesirably hidden by other information displayed on the screen. The personal landmark must be familiar to the user. Conversely, if he or she is coming to a region, even a famous landmark may not be helpful to the user. It is also of no help if a famous landmark is considered famous for a particular reason, for example as a popular sports facility or museum that the user is not interested in. Thus, in many cases, personal landmarks may be preferred, especially when they can easily orient the user about the place of interest due to proximity (e.g., within 1-4 blocks, less than 1 kilometer distance, etc.). In such a case, the personalized landmark may reduce the number of turn-by-turn turns to a few simple steps, or may not even need to provide turn-by-turn turns at all. These and other aspects of the techniques are described further below.
Example arrangement
FIG. 1 illustrates an exampleArrangement 100, wherein different client devices 102 (e.g., notebook computers 100)1 Tablet computer 1002 Mobile telephone 1003And a smart watch 1004And desktop PC1005) Content or other information may be requested from the server 104 via the communication system 110. However, other types of client devices may also be employed. As discussed herein, any such client device may send a request from server 104 and receive query results. The server 104 may be coupled to one or more databases 106 via links 108. The databases may include a query database for responding to search requests from users, a mapping database for generating map information related to the location of user devices, a geographic location database for determining the location of the user devices, or other types of databases.
By way of example only, queries received from a client device may be analyzed and routed to a server-managed service. The service may be a query response service. Although one server is shown, the functionality of the service may be performed by one or more server devices or other computer systems (such as a cloud computing network). The service may use the database to identify a location and results related to the query, and map information for a region of interest including the location and results.
Fig. 2A illustrates an example client device 200 that can be employed with the techniques disclosed herein. As shown, the client device 200 includes a processing module 202 (such as a central processing unit 204 and/or a graphics processor 206) having one or more computer processors and a memory module 208 configured to store instructions 210 and data 212. The processors may or may not operate in parallel, and may include ASICs, controllers, and other types of hardware circuitry. The processor is configured to receive information from a user through the user interface module 214 and to present the information to the user on a display device having a display module 216 with a display interface.
The user interface module 214 may receive commands from a user via user input and convert the commands for submission to a given processor. The user input may include one or more of a touch screen, keypad, mouse, stylus, microphone, or other type of input device. The display module 216 may include suitable circuitry for driving a display device to present graphical and other information to a user. By way of example, the graphical information (such as map details) may be generated by a graphics processor 206, while a CPU 204 manages the overall operation of the client device 200. The graphical information may display a response to the user query on the display module 216. For example, the processing module may use instructions and data stored in the memory module 208 to run a browser application or other service and present information associated with the browser application or other service to the user via the display module 216.
The memory module 208 may be implemented as one or more of one or more computer-readable media, one or more volatile memory units, or one or more non-volatile memory units. The memory module 208 may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM, and may be embodied as a hard disk drive or memory card. Alternatively, the memory module 208 may also include DVDs, CD-ROMs, high density tape drives, and other types of memory that have write capability or are read-only. In one embodiment, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions (such as instructions 210) that, when executed by one or more processors, perform one or more methods, such as those described herein. The information carrier is a computer-readable medium or machine-readable medium, such as the memory module 208. Although fig. 2A functionally illustrates the processor, memory module, and other elements of the apparatus 200 as being within the same general block, such components may or may not be stored within the same physical housing. For example, some or all of the instructions and data may be stored on an information carrier (e.g., optical drive, high density tape drive, USB drive) as a removable storage medium and other instructions and data may be stored in a read-only computer chip.
The instructions 210 may be any set of instructions to be executed directly (such as machine code) or indirectly (such as scripts) by the processor. For example, the instructions may be stored as computing device code on a computing device readable medium. In this regard, the terms "instructions" and "programs" may be used interchangeably herein. The instructions may be stored in an object code format for direct processing by the processor, or in any other computing device language, including script or collection of independent source code modules, interpreted or pre-compiled as needed. The function, method, and routine of the instructions are described in more detail below.
As also shown in fig. 2A, the mobile client device 200 includes a communication module 218 for communicating with other devices and systems. The communication module 218 includes a wireless transceiver; alternatively, the module may include a wired transceiver in addition to or instead of a wireless transceiver. Client device 200 may communicate with other remote devices via communication module 218 using various configurations and protocols, including short-range communication protocols (such as near field communication, Bluetooth @)TM、BluetoothTMLow power (BLE)), or other ad hoc networks, the internet, an intranet, a virtual private network, a wide area network, a local area network, a private network using one or more company-specific communication protocols, ethernet, WiFi, and HTTP, and combinations of the foregoing.
Additionally, the illustrated client device 200 may include one or more position and orientation sensors 220. The position and orientation sensor 220 is configured to determine the position and orientation of the client device 200. For example, these components may include a GPS receiver for determining the latitude, longitude, and/or altitude of the device, as well as an accelerometer, gyroscope, or other direction/velocity detection device. The client device 200 may also include one or more cameras 222, one or more speakers 224, and a power module 226 for capturing still images and recording video streams, as well as actuators (not shown) for providing haptic feedback or other information to the user. Such haptic feedback may be used when guiding a user to a place of interest via a route including one or more personalized landmarks as described below.
Fig. 2B illustrates an example server system 250 that can be used with the techniques disclosed herein. As shown, server system 250 includes various components similar to those described above for mobile client device 200. For example, the server device includes a processing module 252 having one or more computer processors (e.g., a central processing unit 254 and/or a graphics processor 256), and a memory module 258 configured to store instructions 260 and data 262. The processors may or may not operate in parallel, and may include ASICs, controllers, and other types of hardware circuitry.
As with the memory module 208, the memory module 258 may be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units. The memory module 208 may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM, and may be embodied as a hard disk drive or memory card. Alternatively, the memory module 258 may also include DVDs, CD-ROMs, high density tape drives, and other types of memory that have write capability or are read-only. In one embodiment, the computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions, such as instructions 260, that when executed by one or more processors perform one or more methods, such as those described herein. The information carrier is a computer-readable medium or machine-readable medium, such as the memory module 208. Although fig. 2B functionally illustrates the processors, memory modules, and other elements of the server system 250 as being within the same general block, such components may or may not be stored within the same physical housing. For example, some or all of the instructions and data may be stored on an information carrier (e.g., optical drive, high density tape drive, USB drive) as a removable storage medium and other instructions and data may be stored in a read-only computer chip.
As an example, the processors of the processing module 252 may be arranged in a distributed architecture. In a distributed architecture, the server system 250 may include multiple server units, for example, in a cloud computing arrangement. The processor is operatively coupled to a database 264, whether in an inclusive or distributed architecture. In one example, the database 264 includes a map database 266, the map database 266 having geographic location data regarding particular physical locations in different areas of interest. Database 264 may also include a search database 268 to respond to queries from various client devices. Although the database 264 is shown to include a map database 266 and a search database 268, such information may be stored in a plurality of discrete databases. The database may be distributed, for example, across multiple memory modules or other storage devices of the cloud computing architecture.
As also shown in fig. 2B, server system 250 includes a communication module 270 for communicating with other devices and systems, including with client devices and other elements in a network. The communication module 270 may include a wireless transceiver.The communication module 270 may include a wired transceiver in addition to or instead of a wireless transceiver. Server system 250 may communicate with other remote devices via communication module 270 using various configurations and protocols, including short-range communication protocols (such as near field communication, Bluetooth @)TM、BluetoothTMLow power (LE)), or other ad hoc networks, the internet, intranets, virtual private networks, wide area networks, local area networks, private networks using one or more company-specific communication protocols, ethernet, WiFi, and HTTP, as well as combinations thereof.
In addition, the illustrated server system 250 includes a power module 272. Other system elements, including the computer components shown in fig. 2A, may also be included within the server system 250.
Example methods and use cases
As described above, the features of the present technology may be implemented in different use cases. Examples of certain use cases are discussed below, although the present techniques may be employed in other cases and are not limited to those explicitly provided herein. For different use cases, a user may request information via a mobile application or service on his or her client device. The requested information may be places in a particular area, such as restaurants, coffee shops, gas stations, museums, and the like. Other situations may involve queries related to maps or navigation. The provided results, location or orientation information, or any combination thereof, may incorporate personalized landmarks to provide useful contextual information to the user.
One use case includes browsing a map. The user may pan the map and/or zoom in or out of the map displayed in the viewport 302 on the display screen of the client device 300, as shown in fig. 3A-3C. For example, a user may view a map 304 of the northern region of san francisco (fig. 3A), pan to the south and zoom in (fig. 3B), and then focus on a place of interest such as a rapheite Park (Lafayette Park) (fig. 3C).
In this case, the location of a region or point of interest (e.g., a frequently visited store, restaurant, museum, or home) that is familiar to the individual may be highlighted or otherwise emphasized in the current viewport. This helps the user to target himself/herself on the map and can be done in combination with or instead of other map markers, such as famous landmarks or paid advertiser elements. For example, as shown in FIG. 3A, a personalized landmark 306 is shown in the lower right corner of the viewport. Additionally, an arrow 308 may optionally be presented to indicate that one or more other personalized landmarks are not on the map. When the map displayed in the viewport is panned or zoomed in response to a user request or action (e.g., by manipulating a graphical interface or physically moving, tilting, or reorienting the client device), a different or additional personalized logo may appear, for example, on the right side of a raphe Park (Lafayette Park), such as in fig. 3B. Here, the arrow may indicate the direction of the personalized landmark from fig. 3A, which is now not on the map due to the panning and zooming performed in the viewport. And fig. 3C shows a further enlarged map within the display port, with the personalized landmark from fig. 3A and 3B visible.
Another use case includes presentation of an address, for example, as part of a set of search results. In one example, a user submits a query for hamburger restaurants. The client device may format the query and send it to a remote server (e.g., server 104 in fig. 1). In this case, the server will parse the query and any location information associated with the client device, using this information to identify and select relevant search results. The results are then sent back to the client device, formatted to conform to the characteristics or limitations of the client device (e.g., the size, resolution, or color capabilities of the display device), and then presented in a viewport 400 of the client device display, as shown in the example of fig. 4. In particular, a set of results 402 may be shown on a map in the viewport as pushpins 402 or other indicators. In this example, pushpin 4021、4022And 4023Representing the locations of the hamburger restaurants identified in the list 406, which can be presented, for example, below, to the side, or above the viewport 400. In the above-mentionedAlso shown on the map in the viewport are one or more personalized landmarks 404. Here, three personalized landmarks 4041、4042And 4043Shown as stars on the map, although other indicators may be employed.
For address results, the system is configured to provide a hint based on one or more personalized placemarks. Thus, if multiple hamburger restaurants are returned as results within the displayed viewport, one or more of these restaurant results can be annotated with the nearest personalized landmark. In this example, Burger Palace may correspond to pushpin 4021And the personalized landmark "Steve's apparent (Steve apartment) 4041In the vicinity. The results presented show that Burger Palace is 2 blocks west of Steve's approximate. Similarly, Burger Joint Deluxe may correspond to pushpin 4022And personalized landmark "hairdresser" 4042Is in the vicinity. The results listed show that the Burger Joint Deluxe is located 40 meters north of the user's hairdryer. Also, Burger World Extreme may correspond to thumbtack 4023Therein "laundromat" (laundromat) 4043Is a personalized landmark of interest. The results for Burger World Extreme show that it is separated from laundromat by only three gates. Since the user already knows the location of each personalized landmark, no more specific information about where to find the search results is required. This can significantly simplify the user interface, for example, by reducing clutter on the screen and providing the user with more personally relevant and meaningful information.
With respect to navigation, a personalized landmark may be used to guide a user to a destination, which may be one of the search results provided in response to a query, for example. Here, the user may know how to get relatively close without directions, but need help regarding the "last mile" (or last few blocks) where the search results or other places of interest are located. Creating an icon or otherwise highlighting a personalized landmark on a displayed map within the viewport will assist the user, for example, by interpreting or showing points of interest related to the personalized landmark.
Fig. 5A-5D provide an example of one such navigation. FIG. 5A shows a viewport 500 presenting a portion of san Francisco, Calif. Fig. 5B shows a pushpin 502 on a map. The pins may indicate search results, desired destinations, or other places of interest. One or more personalized landmarks 504 (fig. 5C) will also be presented as part of the navigation. For example, FIG. 5C shows a map with the pushpin and several personalized landmarks 504. Fig. 5C also shows a dashed path 506, which may be used to show the direction of travel or walking. FIG. 5D presents illustrative directions associated with the personalized landmark. Here, the directions may include guiding the user past landmarks 504, which may be personalized1"Extreme Kobe Burger" (honored Shenhu hamburg). The directions may then guide the user at what may be a personalized landmark 5042"Uncle Jim's" (Jim Uncle) of (C). The destination may then be presented as a landmark 504, which may be personalized3Is opposite the user's "barber shop". Although 3 personalized landmarks are provided in this example, more or fewer personalized landmarks may be presented. For example, the number of personalized landmarks displayed may depend on the number of personalized landmarks identified by the system in (or adjacent to) the current viewport.
The physical proximity or line of sight between the personalized landmark and the point of interest may also affect the number of landmarks displayed, as well as which particular landmarks were selected. For example, personalized landmarks may be analyzed to determine whether they are within a maximum number of feet or meters (e.g., between 30-75 meters, no more than 200 meters, about 10-500 meters). The maximum distance acceptable may vary due to line-of-sight limitations. For example, if a first personalized landmark is 85 meters from the place of interest, but there is a clear line of sight between them, the first landmark may be selected instead of a second personalized landmark that is 45 meters from the place of interest but is obscured by a building or other structure. The system may also select the number of personalized landmarks to reduce screen clutter or information overload, especially when considering the form factor of the client device and the parameters of the display screen.
In these use cases and other scenarios, how to highlight objects familiar to an individual as personalized landmarks may be accomplished in different ways. One option is to avoid unnecessarily cluttering the map. Such guidelines may be particularly relevant for small form factor client devices, such as mobile handsets or smartwatches, which necessarily have a small display and a correspondingly small map viewport. A ranking system may be employed to help determine which entities or other elements to display on a base map (e.g., map 304 in fig. 3A). For example, places of interest with higher ratings and/or large visits (e.g., physical and/or online) and the like may be ranked higher than places of interest with lower ratings and/or relatively fewer visits. Thus, places of interest with higher ranks are more likely to appear and appear earlier than places of interest with lower or no ranks, little visits, little information.
According to one aspect, the system will introduce the user's familiarity with places of interest to enhance the signal for a given point of interest and make it appear more prominent and/or appear earlier on a map. In one example, the actual presentation on the map may be the same as the existing place of interest. Alternatively, additional processing, such as bold text or specific images or colors, may be employed to emphasize the relevance of familiar places. This may include user selectable icons, text annotations or images of familiar places.
For example, the client device may provide an address hint to the user. Here, the system may select the most relevant personalized landmark and use it via input to the client device. For map highlighting, the system may similarly select only a few personalized landmarks that are easily visible in the viewport.
The personalized placemarks may be used as ranking signals to return relevant search results to the user. This provides an enhancement that not only allows the remote server to obtain useful results, but also reduces the number of user queries and hence the number of data packets sent over the network. The results information may also identify street or public transportation options, helping the user to efficiently reach a particular location. In addition to using personalized placemarks as a ranking signal for search results, such placemarks may take precedence over famous placemarks, sponsored elements (e.g., paid advertisements), and/or other layers of information that may be presented on a display device.
Personalized placemarks are of interest to provide relevant contextual information for a given user. Thus, where the user agrees to store information using, for example, previous location visits, calendar entries, invitations, etc., the data may be analyzed to generate personalized placemarks. Such data may not be tied to the identity of the respective user. Additionally, personalized landmarks may be generated or presented in a manner that does not indicate an exact location or address. Here, the system may "blur" certain landmark information to summarize the location by referring to points of interest at different stores or places of business within a building or across streets that a user may know, to indicate the street address of the building rather than a particular suite or floor within the building. In other cases, the system may selectively ignore certain types of businesses or places in case of being highlighted or otherwise identified as a personalized landmark (e.g., a medical facility, a home or apartment, etc.).
In addition to the above, the user may be provided with controls that allow the user to select whether and when the systems, programs, or features described herein are capable of collecting user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, user preferences, or the user's current location), and whether to send content or communications from the server to the user. In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways to remove personally identifiable information before being stored or used. For example, the identity of a user may be processed such that no personal identity information for the user can be determined. Thus, the user may control which information about the user is collected, how the information is used, and which information is provided to the user.
An example scenario is illustrated with respect to flowchart 600 of fig. 6. Here, at block 602, a search query for a given geographic area is obtained. The search query may be, for example, in response to a request by a user of the client device for a business, restaurant, museum, etc. Alternatively, the search query may be directed to a particular business, address, or other place of interest. The search query may also include selecting a link in an email, address book, or browser webpage, where the link is associated with a place of interest. These are non-limiting examples of the types of search queries that may be received, e.g., search queries obtained by a client device or received on a remote server.
At block 604, one or more search results are obtained in response to the search request. The search results correspond to one or more places of interest in a given geographic area. At block 606, one or more personalized landmarks are identified that are within or potentially proximate to a given geographic area. The personalized landmark is associated with a user of a client device, which enables the personalized landmark to provide useful contextual information about the location of the search result. The personalized landmark may be identified prior to or in response to obtaining the search query. For example, based on a current viewport of a map displayed on a display screen of a client device, a processor of the client device can prospectively determine whether any personalized landmarks fall within the current viewport.
Then, at block 608, one or more identified personalized landmarks are selected, for example, by one or more processors of the client device. The selection is based on one or more of a physical proximity between the personalized landmark and the place of interest, a line of sight between the personalized landmark and the place of interest, a previous visit to the personalized landmark, and an ease of access between the personalized landmark and the place of interest. The accessibility may include assessing whether the personalized landmark is on the same street or on an adjacent street, but the street is a one-way street that is headed in the wrong direction. The accessibility may also include whether there are streets or street parking lots between the personalized landmark and the place of interest.
Also, at block 610, the system generates at least one of textual, auditory, or visual information for presentation by the client device to guide a user of the client device from the selected personalized landmark to the given place of interest. This may include, but is not limited to, visually showing a personalized landmark in a viewport of the displayed map, highlighting or emphasizing such a personalized landmark, providing driving or walking directions based on the location of the personalized landmark, or otherwise indicating to the user a physical geographic relationship between the personalized landmark and the place of interest.
