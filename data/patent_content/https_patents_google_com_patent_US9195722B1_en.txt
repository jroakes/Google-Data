Definitions
- recommendations users tend to give more weight to recommendations from people they know, e.g., the more the users know the recommenders the higher the weight.
- some people who provide recommendations may not want to reveal their identities. For example, these people may want to recommend doctors, dentists, lawyers, etc. to their friends and acquaintances but may not want their friends and acquaintances to know that they use these service providers, which include, for example, a doctor specializing in a certain field.
- the subject matter discussed herein relates generally to data processing and, more particularly, to privacy-protected search.
- the subject matter described may herein provide various advantages, such as enhancing user experience (e.g., a user does not have to search for a service or product and consult with his or her friends regarding the service or product); allowing users to share their feedback, such as comments and/or recommendations anonymously or openly; and allowing a user to request search results with or without annotation with comments and/or recommendations.
- the subject matter includes a method for obtaining a set of search results responsive to a search input from a first user; determining, from the search results and based on a social graph, that a first search result associated with a second user is indicated as keeping an identity of the second user hidden; determining whether other search results in the set are indicated as keeping respective identities of associated other users hidden; calculating a score for the first search result based at least on the determinations, the score indicates the likelihood of the first user guessing the identity of the second user; and determining whether to provide to the first user the first search result based on the score for the first search result.
- the calculating the score for the first search result is further based on a hop value provided by the first user.
- the search input includes the hop value.
- the calculating the score for the first search result is further based on a position with respect to the social graph of a node associated with the second user.
- the determining whether to provide to the first user the first search result is further based on another input from the first user.
- the method includes providing the first search result to the first user based on the score meeting a threshold value.
- the method includes providing the other search results to the first user, wherein the other search results are not indicated as keeping identities associated respectively with the other users hidden.
- the first search result and the other search results are provided for presenting in two separate regions of a user interface.
- the method includes providing to the first user at least a portion of the set of search results; and based on the score, not providing the first search result to the first user.
- the implementations may include a system or a computer-readable medium, but are not limited thereto.
- FIG. 1 shows a search interface of some example implementations.
- FIG. 2A shows an example social graph.
- FIG. 2B shows an example score computation
- FIG. 3 shows example results based on FIGS. 2A-B .
- FIG. 4A shows another example of identifying nodes of a social graph.
- FIG. 4B shows another example score computation.
- FIG. 6 shows an example of a process implementation.
- FIG. 7 shows an example computing environment with an example computing device suitable for use in some example implementations.
- FIG. 1 shows a search interface of some example implementations.
- Search user interface (UI) 100 shows that the search is requested by a logged in user Alice 110 (e.g., showing Alice's email address) who requests a search with search input “dentist” 112 .
- a search is conducted as soon as search input 112 is entered.
- Alice may presses (e.g., clicks on) a “Search” button 114 to trigger the search.
- Alice may requests searches that include searching data associated with users or people she knows (individualized searches). For example, when Alice wants to find a dentist, she may want to know what dentists her friends and/or acquaintance use or recommend. Alice may indicate an individualized search using one or more search options 120 . For example, Alice may activate an individualized search by using checkbox 122 (e.g., a check mark).
- checkbox 122 e.g., a check mark
- individualized searches may be performed or conducted using a social graph (described further in FIG. 2 below).
- Alice may be provided a mechanism 124 to indicate a portion of her social graph to be used in the search.
- Alice indicates that two hops of her social graph are to be used in the search.
- Alice may provide other input or filtering criteria for the search. For example, Alice may activate a criterion using UI element 126 (e.g., checking a checkbox) and enter a value to a field 128 (e.g., search within 10 miles of my location 129 ).
- UI element 126 e.g., checking a checkbox
- search options 120 there may be no checkboxes 122 and 126 . Entering a value in input box 124 would activate an individualized search and entering a value in input box 128 would activate that criterion. In some implementations, there may be different, additional, or fewer search options 120 . In some implementations, individualized searches can be implemented as default searches, and Alice may deactivate individualized searches by not logging in before requesting a search, by adjusting a setting, or by other manner. In some implementations, search options may be entered along with search input using search input box 112 . For example, Alice may enter “dentist recommendations from 2 hops within 10 miles” to input box 112 .
- Alice may want to search for “dentist” using data associated with two hops of her social graph. Alice may be interested in dentists within 10 miles from her location and enters “10” in input box 128 . Alice's may want to search data associated with the web 132 or another one of data groups 130 (e.g., images, maps, video, news, shopping, blogs, etc.).
- data groups 130 e.g., images, maps, video, news, shopping, blogs, etc.
- search results may be provided for presenting or displaying as search results 140 and 150 .
- Search results 140 are resulted from searching any available data enhanced with searching data associated with Alice's social graph and/or other data associated with her. Search results 140 are described further below in FIG. 3 .
- Search results 150 are resulted from searching any available data without searching data associated with Alice's social graph. If Alice requests the search without login in or with individualized search disabled, if implemented, Alice would get the same or similar search results 150 with the same “dentist” search input 112 and “San Francisco, Calif.” location.
- FIG. 2A shows an example social graph.
- Social graph 200 A may represent Alice's connections with people or users she knows.
- Alice is represented by node 1 or a root node, which may be considered as hop 0 .
- One hop away (e.g., hop # 1 ) or one degree of separation from Alice are Bob, Chris, and Daisy at nodes 2 - 4 . These may be people or users Alice knows directly.
- Chris at node 3 may know Elen at node 5 .
- Daisy at node 4 may know Fay and Gill at nodes 6 - 7 .
- Elen, Fay, and Gill at nodes 5 - 7 may be considered two hops away from Alice (e.g., hop # 2 ).
- Alice knows Elen through Chris.
- At hop # 3 is Haley and Ian at nodes 8 and 9 .
- At hop # 4 is Jason at node 10 .
- Social graph 200 A shows, as an example, that Bob and Chris are open to sharing their recommendations and/or comments (feedback) about dentists (e.g., Bob and Chris do not indicate that they want to be anonymous with respect to their recommendations and comments about dentists).
- Bob and Chris at nodes 2 - 3 are shown in group 210 (the open group).
- Group 230 (the outside group) includes nodes 8 - 10 that are outside the two hops Alice is interested in. Regardless of whether Haley, Ian, and/or Jason has shared any recommendations and/or comments about dentists or whether they want to share them anonymously, data associated with these nodes are not included in the search for “dentist” within two hops (or are excluded after the search).
- FIG. 2B shows an example score computation.
- Table 200 B includes the nodes within two hops as indicated by Alice. Each node is shown on a row.
- Column 240 shows the user name of a node.
- Column 245 shows the hop number.
- Column 250 show whether the user prefers to hide (value “1”) his or her identity (e.g., being anonymous) or not (value “0”).
- Column 255 in an example computation, may indicate a distance from Alice. The distance may be, for example, 10 times the hop number. The distance may be computed for the nodes associated with users who want to be anonymous (anonymous nodes, Daisy, Elen, Fay, and Gill).
- Column 260 may compute a value for the public nodes (e.g., not anonymous nodes, Bob and Chris).
- the public nodes are included based on a threshold value.
- a value in column 260 may be a product of the threshold value and a multiplier of at least one (e.g., two).
- Column 265 where a score for each node is computed, may be the sum of the distance value (column 255 ) and public value (column 260 ). Please note that columns 255 and 260 are mutually exclusive in this example.
- a score in column 265 that meets (e.g., equal to or greater than) the threshold value (shown in column 270 ) provides an indication that data associated with the corresponding node can be shown in a search results, which may be subjected to other filtering and/or restrictions, such as within 10 miles of Alice.
- Column 275 shows that all the nodes except Daisy, which has a score of 10 that is less than the threshold value of 12, the data associated with which can be included in the search for “dentist.”
- FIG. 3 shows example individualized results based on FIGS. 2A-B .
- Table 200 B of FIG. 2B indicates that data associated with the nodes of Bob, Chris, Elen, Fay, and Gill may be searched to provide the individualized results 140 .
- Bob's dentist may be a dentist at UCSF School of Dentistry, and Bob may so indicated on a social network (e.g., Bob may provide a feedback or comment, such as “My dentist” associated with the UCSF School of Dentistry).
- Chris may indicate that he highly recommends his dentist at the University of the Pacific (e.g., on a social network or website where rating is sough from users on the University of the Pacific).
- Alice's search on “dentist” with a location of “San Francisco, Calif.” may yield the results shown in areas 150 as well as UCSF School of Dentistry, City Hall Dental Group, University of the Pacific, and Smiley White DDS. If Alice's search is requested without search her social graph data (e.g., she disables individualized search or requests the search without logging in), all the search results, including UCSF School of Dentistry, City Hall Dental Group, University of the Pacific, and Smiley White DDS would be provided for presenting in results 150 .
- individualized search When individualized search is enabled (e.g., searching data associated with her social graph), Bob's comment associated with the UCSF School of Dentistry is revealed in individualized results 140 alone with an indication (e.g., “This is Bob's dentist” or the like 142 ).
- the University of the Pacific is also shown in individualized results 140 due to Chris's recommendation associated with the University of the Pacific 146 .
- the City Hall Dental Group and Smiley White DDS are shown in individualized results 140 due to the comments and/or recommendations from Elen and Gill 144 and 148 . To honor their wishes to not be identified in the results, Elen's and Gill's recommendations are shown without attribution.
- FIG. 2 AB and FIG. 3 show one example of computing a score associated with a node.
- the score can be computed in any manner.
- the score serves at least the purpose of determining and/or selecting a node for inclusion or exclusion.
- selecting a node for inclusion or exclusion does not involve a score (e.g., a node can be selected based on hop information and/or other information). For example, if the number of nodes in the anonymous group 220 , FIG. 2A , is less than a number (e.g., two or three), all nodes in group 220 are excluded. If data from one or two anonymous nodes are include in the search results, it may be easier for Alice to guess which user provides the anonymous recommendations.
- FIG. 4A shows another example of identifying nodes of a social graph.
- Alice wants to search for “dentist” and search data associated with two hops of her social graph.
- the two hops may be applied to nodes for the users who do not wish to have attribution for their content.
- Group 410 shows the open nodes (e.g., in addition to Bob and Chris, Haley and Jason want to openly share their comments and/or recommendations about dentists).
- Group 420 same as group 220 above, shows the non-attribution user nodes.
- Group 430 shows that Ian at node 9 is the only node excluded by the two hops input (e.g., Ian either does not share any comments and/or recommendation about dentist or want the share them anonymously).
- FIG. 4B shows another example score computation.
- Columns 440 - 455 and 465 - 670 are the same as columns 240 - 255 and 270 - 275 , FIG. 2B , respectively.
- the different example of score computation is shown in column 460 where a guessable score is computed. The lower the value of the guessable score, the easier for Alice to guess the identity behind an unattributed comment and/or recommendations.
- An example threshold value, column 465 is set at 15. The threshold value can be set and/or adjusted to any value based on implementation and/or other factors.
- the guessable score may be set to any value equal to or above the cut-off value (e.g., threshold 460 ).
- a collective value (e.g., maximum, average, or minimum) of all the GS values may be used. For example, if T is at least 2 and if the collective value meets a threshold (e.g., 13), select all the anonymous nodes.
- FIG. 5 shows an example environment suitable for some example implementations.
- Environment 500 includes devices 505 - 545 , and each is communicatively connected to at least one other device via, for example, network 550 (e.g., by wired and/or wireless connections). Some devices may be communicatively connected to one or more storage devices 530 and 545 .
- one or more devices 505 - 545 may be computing device 705 described below in FIG. 7 .
- Devices 505 - 545 may include, but are not limited to, a computer 505 (e.g., a laptop computing device), a mobile device 510 (e.g., smartphone or tablet), a television 515 with one or more processors embedded therein and/or coupled thereto, a device associated with a vehicle 520 , one or more server computers 525 , computing devices 535 - 540 , storage devices 530 , and 545 .
- devices 505 - 520 may be considered user devices (e.g., devices used by Alice to access services and/or issue requests, such as search request).
- Devices 525 - 545 may be devices associated with one or more service providers (e.g., used by service providers to provide social network services and/or search services and/or store data, such as webpages, text, text portions, images, image portions, audios, audio segments, videos, video segments, and/or information thereabout).
- FIG. 6 shows an example of a process implementation.
- Process 600 may begin with receiving search input from a user at block 610 .
- a user e.g., Alice
- search input e.g., “auto mechanics”
- a user interface that includes the search input box may be provided (e.g., by a search engine, server, or system of a search provider) for presenting to the user on a user device, from which the user accesses the search services.
- data associated with the user may be used in the search (e.g., to annotate or the search results).
- a social graph associated with the user may be identified and/or generated (e.g., from the user's social network account, email account, and/or another source where contact information associated with the user may be available).
- the user has a choice or option to request a search without using data associated with the user (e.g., disabling such option where implemented or requests the search without login in).
- one or more computing devices associated with the search service provider perform the requested search based on the input (e.g., obtaining a set of search results responsive to a search input from a user). If the user is logged in and/or has permitted use of data associated with the user, such data may be searched. Data may be associated with one or more nodes of a social graph associated with the user. The nodes may be selected for inclusion or exclusion based on one or more input and/or factors.
- search result associated with a node of the social graph may be determined to identify whether the node is an anonymous node (e.g., a user associated with the node includes an indications to keep the user's identity hidden).
- Search results associated with other nodes may be determined to identify whether any of these nodes are anonymous nodes and/or open nodes.
- Each node may be selected using, for example, a score (e.g., calculated based on one or more determinations) that meets or exceeds a threshold value.
- the search results, portion of the search results, and/or data associated with one or more nodes may be determined whether to provide to Alice based on the one or more scores of the nodes.
- the search results annotated with data from the user's social graph are presented to the user.
- process 600 may be implemented with different, fewer, or more blocks.
- Process 600 may be implemented as computer executable instructions, which can be stored on a medium, loaded onto one or more processors of one or more computing devices, and executed as a computer-implemented method.
