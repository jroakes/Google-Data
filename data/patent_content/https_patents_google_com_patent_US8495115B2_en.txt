- Combinatorial coding circuitry 106 receives vector x i and uses Factorial Pulse Coding to produce a codeword C. As discussed above Factorial Pulse Coding can code a vector x i using a total of M bits, given that
- all values of vector x i are integral valued such that ⁇ m ⁇ x i ⁇ m, where m is the total number of unit amplitude pulses, and n is the vector length.
- combinatorial function generator 108 utilizes a low complexity technique for producing F′(n,d).
- Combinatorial coding circuitry 106 then utilizes F′(n,d) to produce codeword C.
- Circuitry 108 utilizes relatively low resolution approximations (bits of precision) of factorial combinations F′(n,d), which provide only enough precision to allow a valid codeword to be generated. That is, as long as certain properties are maintained, a suitable approximation of the function F(n, d) is sufficient to guarantee that the resulting codeword is uniquely decodable.
- F(n, d) and F′(n, d) it is not necessary for F(n, d) and F′(n, d) to be equivalent in order for the resulting codeword to be uniquely decodable. There are only two conditions that are sufficient for this to hold true: F ′( n,d ) ⁇ F ( n,d ), (10) and F ′( n,d ) ⁇ F ′( n ⁇ 1, d )+ F ′( n ⁇ 1 ,d ⁇ 1). (11)
- the restriction simply says that if F′(n,d) ⁇ F(n,d), then there will be overlapping code-spaces, and subsequently, there will be more than one input capable of generating a particular codeword; thus, the codeword is not uniquely decodable.
- the second condition states that the “error” for a given n, d shall be greater than or equal to the sum of the error terms associated with the previous element of the recursive relationship described by Peng, et. al in U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,960.
- F(n,d) may satisfy another inequality derived from Eq. 31 of Peng, et al. and is given by:
- P ′( i ) 2 ⁇ l(i) ⁇ 2 l(i) log 2 ( i )+1 ⁇ ,i ⁇ [1, 2, . . . , n], (15)
- l(i) is a shift factor that may vary as a function of i.
- the 2 l factor is equivalent to a shift of l bits to the left, whereby the floor function ⁇ x+1 ⁇ removes the fractional bits while rounding up to the next highest integer, and finally the 2 ⁇ l factor shifts the results back to the right by l bits.
- k is preferably a 32 bit number with an 8 bit unsigned integer component k i and a 24 bit fractional component k f .
- R′(k) cannot be practically pre-computed for efficient real-time operation, great care must be taken in specifying the exact operations necessary in both the encoder and decoder to ensure that the reconstructed signal vector matches the input signal vector exactly.
- R′(k) may be obtained from left shifting ⁇ 2 l K f ⁇ , which can be accurately represented by l bits.
- any functions P′(i), Q′(d), and R′(k) may be used without loss of generality as long as the properties on Eqs. 10 and 11 are satisfied. Care must be taken however, that an increase in bit rate may occur if too little precision is used. It should also be noted that there is an inherent tradeoff in bit rate and complexity, and for large values of m, n, an increase of 1 or 2 bits may be a reasonable tradeoff for a significant reduction in complexity.

- decoder 200 comprises combinatorial decoding circuitry (decoder) 206 , signal reconstruction circuitry 210 , other decoding circuitry 204 , and combinatorial function generator 108 .
- a combinatorial codeword is received by combinatorial decoding circuitry 206 .
- Combinatorial decoding circuitry 206 provides n and d to combinatorial function generator, and receives F′(n,d) in response.

- the other parameters may include any number of signal reconstruction parameters associated with the signal coding paradigm being used in a particular embodiment. These may include, but are not limited to, signal scaling and energy parameters, and spectral shaping and/or synthesis filter parameters. Normally these parameters are used to scale the energy of and/or spectrally shape the reconstructed signal vector x i in such a manner as to reproduce the final output signal.

Abstract
Description
and all values of vector xi are integral valued such that −m≦xi≦m, where m is the total number of unit amplitude pulses, and n is the vector length. The total M bits are used to code N combinations in a maximally efficient manner, such that the following expression, which describes the theoretical minimum number of combinations, holds true:
For this equation, F(n,d) are the number of combinations of d non-zero vector elements over n positions given by:
D(m,d) are the number of combinations of d non-zero vector elements given m total unit pulses given by:
D(m,d)=F(m−1,d−1), (4)
and 2d represents the combinations required to describe the polarity (sign) of the d non-zero vector elements. The term min(m, n) allows for the case where the number of unit magnitude pulses m exceeds the vector length n. A method and apparatus for coding and decoding vectors of this form have been fully described in the prior art. Furthermore, a practical implementation of this coding method has been described in 3GPP2 standard C.S0014-B, where the vector length n=54 and the number of unit magnitude pulses m=7 produce an M=35 bit codeword.
Direct implementation is problematic because F(144, 28) would require 197 bits of precision in the numerator and 98 bits of precision in the nominator to produce a 99 bit quotient. Since most digital signal processors (DSPs) used in today's handheld devices typically support only 16 bit×16 bit multiply operations, special multi-precision multiply/divide routines would need to be employed. Such routines require a series of nested multiply/accumulate operations that typically require on the order of k multiple/accumulate (MAC) operations, where k is the number of 16 bit segments in the operand. For a 197 bit operand, k=┌197/16┐=13. So, execution of a single 197×16 bit multiply would require a minimum of 13 MAC operations plus shifting and store operations. The denominator term is calculated in a similar manner to produce a 98 bit result. In addition, a 197/98 bit division is required, which is an extremely complex operation, thus computation of the entire factorial relation in Eq. 5 would require considerable resources.
In this expression, the dynamic range of the divide operations is reduced, but unfortunately, increased resolution of the quotient is needed to accurately represent division by 3, 7, 9, etc. In order to accommodate this structure, a rounding operation is also needed to guarantee an integer result. Given the large number of high precision divide operations, this implementation does not adequately address the complexity problem for large m and n, and further has the potential to produce an incorrect result due to accumulated errors in precision.
If this expression is evaluated from left to right, the result will always produce an integer value. While this method controls the precision and dynamic range issue to some degree, large values of m and n still require extensive use of multi-precision multiply and divide operations.
and using F′(n, d) to code or decode the vector.
where P′(i) and Q′(r) are 32 bit lookup tables given as:
and where R′(k) is an approximation of the function R′(k)≈2k, given as:
R′(k)=└2k
where k=ki+kf is broken down into integer and fractional components of k, and Kf=2k

The apparatus additionally comprises a decoder using F′(n, d) to decode a codeword, and outputting the vector.
and all values of vector xi are integral valued such that −m≦xi≦m, where m is the total number of unit amplitude pulses, and n is the vector length. As discussed above, larger values of m and n can quickly cause problems, especially in mobile handheld devices which need to keep memory and computational complexity as low as possible.
where the function expa(k)=ak. Next, define functions P(i), Q(d), and R(k), and substitute into Eq. 8 such that:
F′(n,d)≧F(n,d), (10)
and
F′(n,d)≧F′(n−1,d)+F′(n−1,d−1). (11)
In this case, Eq. 11 has to be satisfied with strict inequality for certain (m,k), (m≦n), (k≦d), that is:
F(m,k)>F(m−1,k)+F(m−1,k−1),m≦n,k≦d. (13)
and where the conditions given in Eqs. 10 and 11 are satisfied. Considering P(i), we may wish to approximate the function such that P′(i)≧loga(i), iε[1, 2, . . . , n]. If we choose a=2 and then restrict P′(i) to 32 bits of precision, the resulting operations are easy to implement on a handheld mobile device since most DSPs support
P′(i)=2−l(i)└2l(i) log2(i)+1┘,iε[1, 2, . . . , n], (15)
where l(i) is a shift factor that may vary as a function of i. In the preferred embodiment, l(i)=l=21, but many other sets of values are possible. For this example, the 2l factor is equivalent to a shift of l bits to the left, whereby the floor function └x+1┘ removes the fractional bits while rounding up to the next highest integer, and finally the 2−l factor shifts the results back to the right by l bits. Using this methodology, the function P′(i)≧log2(i) for all i≧1, and also provides sufficient dynamic range and precision using only 32 bits because 9 bits of positive integer resolution in the log2 domain can represent a 512 bit number. To avoid the complexity of computing these values in real-time, they can be pre-computed and stored in a table using only 144×4 bytes of memory for the F(144, 28) example. Using a similar methodology for approximating Q(d), we get:
where the floor function └x−1┘ is used because of the subtraction of the quantity from the total. This guarantees that
log2(j) so that the contribution of Q′(d) will guarantee F′(n,d)≧F(n,d). While l(j) can assume many values depending on the configuration of m and n, the preferred embodiment uses a value of l(j)=l=14 for the variable shift factor. Like P′(i), Q′(d) can be pre-computed and stored in a table using only 28×4 bytes of memory for the F(144, 28) example. For defining R′(k), we need to first define k as:
With P′(i) and Q′(d) defined above, k is preferably a 32 bit number with an 8 bit unsigned integer component ki and a 24 bit fractional component kf. Using this, we may derive R′(k)≧exp2(k)=2k by letting k=ki+kf and then taking the inverse logarithm base 2 to yield 2k=2k
R′(k)=2k

where γm is a global scale factor, and the range 0 to 143 corresponds to the frequency range 0 to 3600 Hz. For this case, m can be either 28 for NB or 23 for WB inputs.
