- content relating to the media item e.g., a link to an a web page of an actor appearing in the media item, etc.
- content relating to the media item that is obtained from another database (e.g., a proprietary database) and/or from web pages including content related to the media item (e.g., a web page for a television program, a web page for an actor, etc.).
- previously queries and search results are stored in a cache to speed up query responses.
- the previous queries and search results may be periodically removed from the cache to ensure that the cache is not storing search results for instances of media items that are no longer available (e.g., a show time of an episode of a television series may have passed since information relating to the instance of the episode was stored in the cache).
- the server 110 is described in more detail below with reference to Figure 2.
- Figure 1 illustrates that the client device 101 is coupled to one media device (e.g., the media device 103), one output device (e.g., the output device 102), and one input device (e.g., the input device 105), the client device 101 may be coupled to multiple media devices, multiple output devices, and multiple input devices.
- Figure 1 illustrates one client device (e.g., the client device 101) and one metadata provider (e.g., metadata provider 111)
- the network system 100 may include multiple client devices and metadata providers.
- Figure 1 illustrates one content provider (e.g., the content provider 130) coupled to network 121 and one content provider (e.g., the content provider 131) coupled to network 120, multiple content providers may be coupled to each network.
- the server 110 may include a plurality of distributed servers.
- the plurality of distributed servers may provide load balancing and/or may provide low-latency points of access to nearby computer systems.
- the distributed servers may be located within a single location (e.g., a data center, a building, etc.) or may be geographically distributed across multiple locations (e.g., data centers at various geographical locations, etc.).
- the client device 101 is described in more detail below with reference to
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating example modules of the server 110, according to some implementations.
- the server 110 includes a front end module 201, an availability module 202, a content mapping module 205, metadata importer modules 206- 207, and a web crawler module 208.
- the front end module 201 provides an interface between the modules of server 110 and the client device 101.
- the availability module 202 identifies instances of media items that satisfy a search query received from the client device 101 and that are available on content sources that are accessible to the client device 101. As discussed above, the client device 101 may be only able to access a particular set of content sources. Thus, it is beneficial to provide the user 106 only with information for instances of media items that are available on content sources accessible to the client device 101.
- the content mapping module 205 processes metadata obtained by the metadata importer modules 206-207 and the web crawler module 208 to generate a search index 203 and an availability database 204.
- the metadata importer modules 206-207 obtain metadata 240 and 241 for instances of media items from metadata providers 111 and 220, respectively.
- the server 110 includes a metadata importer module for each metadata provider.
- the web crawler module 208 imports and processes web pages 221 to produce metadata 242 for instances of media items.
- the metadata 240, 241 and 242 may include duplicate information.
- the metadata provider 1 11 and the metadata provider 220 may both provide metadata for instances of media items available from a particular cable television service. However, each metadata provider may use different identifiers for the instances of the media items available from the particular cable television service.
- the content mapping module 205 analyzes the metadata 240, 241, and 242 for the instances of the media items to identify unique media items. For example, the content mapping module 205 identify unique media items by grouping instances of media items for which a predetermined subset of the metadata for the instances of the media items match (e.g., a group of instances of media items is formed when the series name, the episode number, and the actors match for each of the instances of the media items in the group, a release year etc.). In some implementations, a group of instances of media items is formed when the series name, the episode number, and the actors match for each of the instances of the media items in the group.
- a predetermined subset of the metadata for the instances of the media items match e.g., a group of instances of media items is formed when the series name, the episode number, and the actors match for each of the instances of the media items in the group.
- a group of instances of media items is formed when the movie name, release year, and the actors match for each of the instance of the media items in the group.
- the content mapping module 205 then generates content identifiers 243 for each unique media item and generates metadata 244 for the unique media items.
- a content identifier includes an identifier for a series of related media items (e.g., a content identifier for a television series) and an identifier for a media item (e.g., a content identifier for an episode of the television series).
- the metadata 244 for a unique media item includes, but is not limited to, the content identifier 243 for the unique media item, at least a subset of the metadata 240, 241, and 242 for each instance of the unique media item.
- Episode 1 of "The Simpsons” may have 6 instances across various content sources.
- the content mapping module 205 may assign a content identifier 243 having a value of "1" to Episode 1 of "The Simpsons” and may include metadata for each instance of Episode 1 of "The Simpsons.”
- the content mapping module 205 uses the content identifiers 243 and the metadata 244 for the instances of the unique media items to generates a search index 203 that is used to efficiently identify content identifiers 243 for media items.
- the content mapping module 205 also uses the content identifiers 243 and the metadata 244 for the instances of the unique media items to generate an availability database 204 that is indexed by the content identifiers 243 and content sources on which the corresponding instances of the media items are available.
- the front end module 201 receives a search query 230 from the client device 101 and dispatches the search query 230 to the availability module 202. Prior to dispatching the search query 230 to the availability module 202, the front end module 201 optionally normalizes and expands the search query 230. In some
- the front end module 201 optionally receives information relating to content sources 231 accessible to the client device 101 from the client device 101.
- the availability module 202 obtains the information relating to content sources 231 accessible to the client device 101 from a database (e.g., a profile of the user 106 of the client device 101, a profile for the client device 101, etc.).
- the availability module 202 queries the search index 203 using the search query 230 to obtain content identifiers 232 and metadata 233 for instances of media items that satisfy the search query 230.
- the availability module 202 queries the availability database 204 using the content identifiers 232 and content sources 231 accessible to the client device 101 to obtain instances 234 of media items that are available on content sources 231 accessible to the client device 101.
