Storage resource 114 (such as, memorizer, flash memory, dynamic RAM (DRAM), the phase change memory of speed caching
Device (PCM) and/or dish) calculating resource 112 (such as, one or more processors or the CPU that communicate
(CPU)).Cover the storage in storage resource 114 abstract (such as, key/value storage or file system) to allow by one or many
Individual client 120, the 120a-n expansible use to storage resource 114.Client 120 can pass through network 130 (such as, warp
By RPC) communicate with memorizer main frame 110.
In some implementations, distributed memory system 100 is " monolateral ", thus eliminates for from client
The remote procedure call (RPC) of end 120 responds with storage or fetches the data on their corresponding memorizer main frame 110
The needs of any server operation of 312, and specialized hardware can be relied on the contrary to carry out processing remote request 122." monolateral " is
Refer to can be completed in storage within hardware rather than by operating in the software on the CPU 112 of memorizer main frame 110 by it
The method that most of requests on device main frame 110 process.It it not the processor 112 making memorizer main frame 110 (such as, server)
Run and export to operate in the client in client 120 by the access of corresponding storage resource 114 (such as, non-transient memorizer)
The server processes 118 of end process 128, on the contrary, client 120 can be by the network interface controller of memorizer main frame 110
(NIC) 116 direct accessing storage resources 114.In other words, operating in the client process 128 in client 120 can be directly
Dock with one or more storage resources 114, and without to any server processes 118 operated in calculating resource 112

And data storage section 106.Storage logical gate 102 can include that transactional applications DLL (API) 350 is (such as, monolateral
Transaction system client library), it is responsible for such as via RPC or monolateral operational access bottom data 312.Data control section 104
Can manage, about task, appointment and the access, such as appointment of storage resource 114 be stored resource 114, connect with corresponding network
Mouth controller 116 registration storage resource 114, sets up the company between (one or more) client 120 and memorizer main frame 110
Connect, dispose the mistake in the case of mechanical disorder, etc..Data storage section 106 can include loosely-coupled memorizer
Main frame 110,110a-n.
Data 312 can be stored in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) 114 and warp by distributed memory system 100
Data are supplied from distance host 110 by the network interface controller 116 with Remote Direct Memory access (RDMA) ability
312.Network interface controller 116 (being also known as NIC, network adapter or lan adapter) can be computer
Hardware component, calculating resource 112 is connected to network 130 by it.Both memorizer main frame 110a-n and client 120 can all have
There is the network interface controller 116 for network service.Operate in the main frame on the computation processor 112 of memorizer main frame 110
Process 118 is registered the Remote Direct Memory of memorizer 114 with network interface controller 116 and be may have access to the set of district 115a-n.
The Remote Direct Memory of memorizer 114 can be may have access to district 115a-n and be registered as having read-only or read/write by host processes 118
Authority.The network interface controller 116 of memorizer main frame 110 creates the client for each registered memory areas 115a-n
End key 302.
The monolateral operation performed by network interface controller 116 can be limited to simple reading and writing and compares and exchange behaviour
Making, none of which operation can be enough complicated for use as performing cache request and manage cache by being used for
The simple replacement of the software logic that the traditional cache server operation of strategy realizes.Affairs API 350 will such as search or
The order inserting data command changes into the sequence of primitive network interface controller operation.Affairs API 350 and distributed storage
The Data Control of system 100 and data storage section 104,106 docking.
Distributed memory system 100 can include depositing for remote access for register to network interface controller 116
The software of the common location of reservoir 114 is also set up and the connection of client process 128.Once establish connection, client process
128 just can access, via the engine in the hardware of network interface controller 116, the memorizeies 114 that be registered, and without from
Any participation of the software on the local cpu 112 of corresponding memorizer main frame 110.
With reference to Figure 1B, in some implementations, distributed memory system 100 includes multiple unit 200 (each unit
200 include memorizer main frame 110) and the manager (curator) 210 that communicates with memorizer main frame 110.Manager
210 (such as, processes) may operate in and are connected to the computation processor 202 of network 130 and (such as have non-transient memorizer 204
Server) upper and manage data storage (such as, management is stored in the file system on memorizer main frame 110), control data
Place and/or initiate data to recover.Additionally, manager 210 can follow the tracks of the data 312 on memorizer main frame 110 existence and
Storage position.Redundancy Management person 210 is possible.In some implementations, (one or more) manager 210 follows the tracks of across many
Point bar (striping) of the data 312 of individual memorizer main frame 110 and for redundancy and/or multiple pairs of the given band of execution
This existence and/or position.In computer data stores, date classification is to different physical storage main frame 110 (examples
As, unit (cell) 200 and/or memorizer main frame 110) make sequential segment access mode by alphabetic data 312 (such as
File 310 (Fig. 2)) logically it is divided into the technology of band.Access can be provided than memorizer main frame 110 in processing equipment request
When accessing data quickly, a point bar is useful.Access by performing the segmentation on multiple equipment, it is possible to access many concomitantly
Individual segmentation.This provides more data access handling capacity, and it avoids making processor wait data access idly.(the most more
Describing in detail) in some implementations, each band can be further divided into organizing G (such as, including block), wherein makes
Different physical storage main frame 110 access order groups G.Packet to the segmentation in band can also be at processing equipment request ratio
The access that memorizer main frame 110 can provide accesses during data 312 useful quickly.By providing on multiple equipment group G
Segmentation access, it is possible to multiple segmentations of the G of access group simultaneously.This also provides for more data access handling capacity, its avoid so that
Processor waits data access idly, therefore improves the performance of system 100.
In some implementations, affairs API 350 are at (such as, having client process 128) client 120 and pipe
Dock between reason person 210.In some instances, client 120 is by one or more remote procedure calls (RPC) and pipe
Reason person 210 communicates.Asking 122 in response to client, affairs API 350 can find (one or more) memorizer master
Particular data 312 on machine 110 storage position and obtain allow access data 312 key 302.Affairs API 350 (via
Network interface controller 116) directly communicate with suitable memorizer main frame 110 (such as, to use Remote Direct Memory
Access) read or write data 312.It is non-operational or data 312 are moved to different memory master at memorizer main frame 110
In the case of machine 110, client request 122 is broken down, thus points out client 120 searching and managing person 210 again.
With reference to Fig. 2, in some implementations, manager 210 stores and manages file system metadata 212.Metadata
212 can include file 3101-nIt is mapped to filec descriptor 3001-nFile Mapping 214.Manager 210 can check also
Revise the expression of its persistent metadata 212.Manager 210 can use three kinds of different access modules for metadata 212:
Read-only, file transaction and band affairs.Such as, metadata 212 can specified file 310 which part which is stored in
At data center, where the redundant copy of data 312 is stored in, and which data block 330nD and encoding block 330nC form coding
Word, etc..
With reference to Fig. 3 A-3K, data 312 can be one or more file 310.Manager 210 can be by each file 310
Being divided into the set of band 320a-n, the most each band 320a-n is encoded independently with residue band 320a-n.Each
Can be encoded and be stored in 320 on different memorizer main frames 110.As shown in Figure 3A, each band 320 is based on coding
Rank 313 and be divided into data block 330nD and non-data block 330nC, code level 313 such as Read-Solomon (Reed-
Solomon) coding (Fig. 3 B), hierarchical coding (Fig. 3 C-3G) or nested coding (Fig. 3 H-3K) or other hierarchical structures coding.Non-
Data block 330nC can be encoding block 330nC (such as, for Reed Solomon Coding).In other examples, non-data block
330nC can be that coding check block 330nCC, word inspection block 330nWC and coding check word check that block 330nCCWC is (for dividing
Layer coding or nested coding).Data block 330nD is the data 312 of specified amount.In some implementations, data block 330nD is
Data 312 from the continuous part of file 310.In other implementations, data block 330nD is from file 310
Individual or the data 312 of multiple discontinuous part.Such as, data block 330nD can be the data 312 of 256 bytes or other unit.
The block 330 (such as, data block 330nD or non-data block 330nC) damaged is the block comprising one or more mistake
330.Generally, the block 330 of damage uses error detection coding 313 to identify.Such as, the block 330 of damage can be wiped completely
(such as, if block 330 is stored in hurricane in destroyed hard disk drive) removed, or the block 330 damaged can
There is individual bit upset.Healthy block 330 is the most impaired piece 330.The block 330 damaged such as can be existed by intentional damage
In the case of specific memory main frame 110 is turned off to safeguard.Damage block can be missing from or disabled piece.?
In this case, the block 330 of damage can be stored in the block 330 at the memorizer main frame 110 being shut down and marks by mark
Know.
The non-data block 330nC of file 310 includes error correction encoding block 313.Error correction encoding block 313 include based on
The block 330 of the data 312 of one or more data blocks 330nD.In some implementations, each encoding block 330nC have with
The appointment size (such as, 256 byte) that data block 330nD is identical.Encoding block 330nC is to use error correction coding 313 (such as
Ultimate range segmentation (MDS) coding) generate.The example of MDS coding includes Reed Solomon Coding.Various technology can
It is used for generating encoding block 330nC.Such as, error correction coding 313 can be used, it is possible to from unique healthy block 330
Any set d data block 330nD of reconstruct of (data block 330nD or encoding block 330nC).
Coded word is data block 330nD and the set of encoding block 330nC based on those data blocks 330nD.If MDS compiles
Code is used for generating and comprises d data block 330nD and the coded word of c encoding block 330nC, the most all pieces 330 (data or volumes
Code) can be reconstructed, as long as any d healthy block 330 (data or coding) can be obtained from coded word.
Fig. 3 B illustrates that Reed Solomon Coding is as error correction encoding block 313.Each band 320 is divided into storage
Block 330 in multiple storage resources 114.Block 330 can be data block 330nDkOr encoding block 330nCm, it forms list together
Individual coded word.Data block 330nDkIncluding real data 312；And encoding block 330nCmIt is to determine file 310 for even-odd check
Whether it is intact.Reed Solomon Coding allows up to encoding block 330nCmThe loss of total quantity, wherein band
312 still can be according to data block 330nDkIt is reconstructed.Therefore, each band 320a-n of file 310 includes multiple data
Block 330nDkWith non-data block 330nCm(such as, encoding block), manager 210 places it in multiple storage resource 114, its
Middle data block 330nDkWith non-data block 330nCmSet form single encoded word.Generally, manager 210 can be by each
Band 320a-n is placed in storage resource 114, how to be placed on storage resource with other bands 320a-n in file 310
On 114 unrelated.Reed Solomon Coding 313 adds redundant data 312 or parity data 312 to file 310 so that
File 310 can be recovered by recipient after a while, even when introducing many mistakes (ability of the coding up to used).In
Moral-Saloman coding 313, for maintaining the data integrity in memorizer main frame 110, is used for reconstructing data 312 for execution
(delay), or (drain) machine is consumed for quickly.
With reference to Fig. 3 C-3I, encode in (Fig. 3 H-3K) technology at hierarchical coding (Fig. 3 C-3G) with nested, coded data partition
314 include deblocking 316 (having data block 330nD) and error correction encoding block 313 (that is, non-data block 330nC), its quilt
Storage is considered to form two dimension R x C array.The damage individual or less for X of reconstruct each column C is can be used in for the existence of each column C
X the encoding block 330nC (being referred to as " coding check block 330nCC ") of block 330.Y encoding block is there is for whole 2-D array
330nC (is referred to as " coding check block 330nWC ").When there is the block 330 damaged more than X in a line or multirow C, remove
Also use the coding check block 330nWC to reconstruct the block 330 of damage outside other healthy blocks 330.Although retouching in this manual
Some examples stated are by coded data partition 314 (that is, deblocking 316 and encoding block 330nC (that is, non-data block 330nC))
It is illustrated as forming two-dimensional array, but can carry out creating the coding techniques of the coded data partition 314 being configured differently.Example
As, different row can have the coding check block 330nCC of varying number, and comprises the row energy of coding check block 330nCC
The row R of the quantity different for row C enough having and comprise coding check block 330nD and coding check block 330nC.
Coding 330nC can be used by data block 330nD of each column C is assigned to data center by data 312
Store across memorizer main frame 110.The every piece 330 memorizer main frame 110 can being assigned in data center in row C.Afterwards,
If X or less block 330 are lost data center at, then block 330 can use only to communicate in data center and be weighed
Structure (such as, does not therefore have other data centers must provide data 312 in performing reconstruct).If it exceeds X block 330 is one
Lose in individual or multiple data center, then Y word checks that block 330nWC is used for attempting reconstructing.Therefore, communicate between data center (its
Can be that cost is higher, such as slower than communicating in data center) only damaged when X block 330 intracardiac in individual data
Bad time is needs.
Coding can also intracardiac in individual data be used.Replace different row C is assigned to different data centers,
All row C are stored in individual data center by coding system 102.Data block 330nD and encoding block 330nC can be stored in
At different memorizer main frame 110 in this data center.This such as reads data from memorizer main frame 110 during reconstructing
312 is in the case of cost high (such as, time-consuming) to be useful so that coding system 102 can read ratio during reconstructing
Use less block 330 that conventional coding technology will need.A small amount of block 330 damaged can be by reading other blocks 330 a small amount of
(the coding check block 330nCC in row C and other data blocks 330nD) are reconstructed, and the block 330 damaged in a large number can lead to
After using word to check when needed, block 330nWC is reconstructed.In some instances, manager 210 is to allow system 100 basis
Data block 330nD and some non-data block 330nC are grouped in this by the mode of the block 330 that other blocks 330 of group G reconstruct disappearance
In group G.This group G can include one or more columns per page C or its part.
With reference to Fig. 3 C-3G, in some implementations, layered coding technique illustrates data block 330nD forming coded word
With encoding block 330nC.If the coded word obtained can be divided two set of in bulk 330, a set includes data block
330nD and a set include encoding block 330nC, then error correction coding 313 employing system form.Use system form
Encode its have N number of encoding block 330nC and its can correct the block 330 of any N number of damage in the case of be can to separate
Big distance (MDS).Hierarchical coding creates from the two kinds of MDS codings using system form, and two kinds of MDS encode such as Reed-institute
Sieve door coding or checksum coding.A kind of coding is used to create a log assembly that coding check block 330nCC, and another coding is used for
Create word and check block 330nWC.
With reference to the example shown in Fig. 3 D-3F, deblocking 316 includes utilizing hierarchical coding and encode be labeled as D0-
Data block 330nD of D41.In fig. 3d, it is shown that first row data block 330nD, D0-D5.Two are shown for row C0 and C1
Individual coding check block 330nCC.C0 and C1 is based on D0-D5.Therefore D0-D5 and C0-C1 forms coded word.In fig. 3e, it is shown that
There is the coded data partition 314 of deblocking 314 (D0-D41) and six encoding block C0-C5.C0-C5 is based on D0-D41.Cause
This, D0-D41 and C0-C5 forms coded word.
Fig. 3 F illustrate obtain include deblocking 314 (D0-D41) and extra encoding block 330nC (coding check block
330nCC and word check block 330nWC) coded data partition 314.I-th coding check block in jth row is denoted as Ci,
j.Therefore C0,0 and C1,0 is both for the coding check block 330nCC of D0-D5.
D0-D5 and C0,0 forms coded word together with C1,0.Show that word checks block C0-at last string to the right
C5.Coded word is formed together with D0-D41 with C0-C5.C0,7 and C1,7 can generate based on C0-C5 so that C0,7 and C1,7 with
And C0-C5 forms coded word.
In example shown in Fig. 3 F, word checks that block 330nWC fills permutation C.But, hierarchical coding can utilize appoints
The word inspection block 330nWC of the full row C of meaning quantity adds the word of optional part row and checks that block 330nWC creates.If data block
330nD and word check that block 330nWC does not fill the row C of integer, then the block 330 of blank null value can be added to 2D array.That
A little blocks 330 are the most actually stored and they will never be made mistakes.
Generally, there is each column C and have X coding check block 330nCCkWith the hierarchical coding energy that N number of word checks block 330nWC
Enough blocks 330 rebuilding up to each column X damage in execution only row C while communication.If at those blocks damaged of reconstruct
After 330, (add in word checks block 330nWC part in the data of 2D array) in 2D array and yet suffer from N number of or less damage
Bad block 330, then the block 330 damaged can use word inspection block 330nWC and coding check block 330nCC to be reconstructed.This is
Really, because the block 330 of the N number of or less damage in data block 330nD adds word and checks that block 330nWC can use only word
Check that block 330nWC is reconstructed.Afterwards, if any coding check block 330nCCkDamaged, then they can be according to its phase
Data block 330nD that should arrange C is reconstructed.
With reference to Fig. 3 G, in some implementations, manager 210 uses hierarchical coding to distribute data 312.Manager
210 receive the deblocking 316 (step 362) including data block 330nD.Such as, deblocking 316 can be stored from it
File 310.Deblocking 316 can include md*ndIndividual data block 330nC, mdIt is the quantity of data row, and ndIt is data
The quantity of row, and mdAnd ndMore than or equal to one.Coding piecemeal includes m*n block 330, and it includes md*nd, wherein m is data
The total quantity of the row R of block 330nD and non-data block 330nC, and n is the row C of data block 330nD and non-data block 330nC
Quantity；M and n is more than or equal to one.Manager 210 uses the first error correction coding 313 and the data block using system form
330nD generates word and checks one or more columns per page C (step 364) of block 330nWC.Word checks that the row C of block 330nWC can be at row C
In have varying number word check block 330nWC.Data block 330nD checks with word and forms coded word together with block 330nWC.
For each column C of one or more columns per page C of data block 330nD, manager 210 uses the second mistake using system form
Data block 330nD of correction coding 313 and row C generates the one or more coding check block 330nCC (steps for row C by mistake
366).First error correction coding and the second error correction coding 313 can be different.Row C can have varying number
Coding check block 330nCC.System 100 can also generate the coding check block 330nCC of the row C checking block 330nWC for word.
System 100 stores data block 330nD, coding check block 330nCC and word and checks block 330nWC (step 368).In some realization sides
In formula, the coding check block 330nCC in each column C and/or row C is assigned to different groups of memorizer main frame 110 by system 100.?
In other implementations, data block 330nD is stored in identical group of memorizer main frame 110 by system 100 with encoding block 330nC
(such as individual data center) place.System 100 can be by data block 330nD and some coding check block 330nCC and word inspection
Block 330nWC is stored in group G, and the most unhealthy piece 330 can be recovered from other blocks 330 one or more of group G.Therefore, it is
The block G of group G is stored at different memorizer main frames 110 by system 100.
When the block 330 of row C is assigned to storage stack main frame 110 by system, coding check block 330nCC can be not
Same position is generated.Such as, coding check block 330nCC can be by Central encoder system (such as, the figure performing this distribution
The server 202 of 1B) or generated after receiving data block 330nD of row C by this group memorizer main frame 110.In often group
At memorizer main frame 110, it is each that data block 330nD distributed, coding check block 330nCC and word check in block 330nWC
Can be stored at different memorizer main frames 110.
When system 100 identifies data block 330nD of the damage at storage stack main frame 110, system 100 is attempted
(coding check block 330nCC is used) heavy in the case of not communicating with the memorizer main frame 110 of other groups of the group G of block 330
The block 330 that structure damages.In some cases, system 100 uses the storage stack master being assigned to the group G from block 330
The coding check block 330nCC and any health data block 330nD of machine 110 carrys out the block at storage stack main frame 110
Group G reconstruct other data blocks 330nD damaged as much as possible of 330.If the block 330 that system 100 determines damage can not
It is reconstructed in the case of not communicating with other other memorizer main frames 110 organized organizing G with block 330, is then
System mark (such as, by request and receive) is from memorizer main frames 110 strong of other groups of the blocks 330 with other groups G
Health block 330 makes at least m*n healthy block 330 be available, and wherein healthy block 330 is data block 330nD, word inspection block
330nWC or both, and use healthy block 330 to reconstruct data block 330nD of damage.
With reference to Fig. 3 H-3J, in some implementations, nested coding techniques illustrates data block 330nD forming coded word
With encoding block 330nC.As shown, nested coding techniques is the nested coding techniques of two dimension (2D), but three-dimensional (3D) is nested
Coding techniques can also be employed.
Be different from layered coding technique creates at coding check block 330nCC and word inspection block nested coding techniques
Different relations between 330nWC.2D nesting coding creates according to the most linear MDS coding using system form.Based on number
Checking that block 330nWC is divided into two groups according to the word of piecemeal 316, first group includes X encoding block 330nC, and second group includes
N number of encoding block 330nC.Coded data partition 316 is considered to be formed the array of row C, and X encoding block in first group
330nC for by " splitting " the component of the separation of each column to create each column X row block 330 (" fractionation " coding inspection by them
Look into block 330nCC).N number of encoding block 330nC in second group forms word and checks block 330nWC.
Such as, Fig. 3 H illustrates deblocking 314 (D0-D41) and encoding block (C0-based on deblocking 316 (D0-D41)
C7)330nC.Data block (D0-D41) 330nD and encoding block (C0-C7) 330nC forms coded word.Encoding block 330nC is divided
Becoming first group and second group, wherein first group includes C0-C1, and second group includes C2-C7.C0-C1 is split to form fractionation
Coding check block 330nCC.C2-C7 is used as word and checks block 330nWC.
Fig. 3 I illustrates and includes deblocking 316 (D0-D41) and extra encoding block 330nC (the coding check block of fractionation
330nCC and word check block 330nWC) the coding piecemeal obtained.In order to generate and arrange j C0 (be denoted as C0, j) corresponding
The coding check block 330nCC split, generates C0, even if not being that all data blocks 330nD in row j all have value zero.Namely
Saying, C0, j have from performing to use partial data piecemeal 316 rather than what contrary use only row j obtained to the operation generating C0
Value, the most every other row are cleared.Such as, if generator matrix is by being used for generating the C0 of deblocking 314, then generate
Device matrix can be modified to generate C0, j so that it has and use is originally generated device matrix and this is originally generated device matrix
It is applied to the value that deblocking 316 obtains, is wherein cleared except data block 330nD in the row C of row j.
But coding check block 330nCC for the C1 of the fractionation of each column C, j similarly uses C1 to replace C0 to generate.
As a result, C0 is the linear combination of C0,0-C0,6, and C1 is the linear combination of C1,0-C1,6.It is to say,
Fig. 3 I is denoted as "？" block 330 can come in the various modes that such as further describe below with reference to Fig. 3 J
Generate.
In the example of Fig. 3 H and 3I, the coded data partition 314 obtained includes 42 data blocks 330nD and 8 codings
Block 330nC.With reference to the original coding for creating coding piecemeal, encoding block 330nC belongs in two groups as described above
One group, during wherein X=2 is in first group, and N=6 therein is in second group.The no matter when string in seven row
Interior existence two or the block 330 of less (X or less) damage, it becomes possible to use the healthy block 330 of row C and for row C
The coding check block 330nCC of fractionation correct the block 330 of damage.In order to prove this, it is assumed that j indicates and includes two or more
Class C of the block 330 of few damage and consider to obtain by will reset from all data blocks 330nD in addition to j of row C
Coded word.In this coded word, C0=C0, j and C1=C1, j.As a result, two or less damage in other row
Block 330As comprises all zero data blocks 330nD equally, and by checking that word checks that block 330nWC is impaired.
In example shown in Fig. 3 F, word checks that block 330nWC intactly fills permutation C (row on the right).2D nesting is compiled
Code 313b can utilize word to check, and any number of row C of block 330nWC creates.Word checks that the row C of block 330nWC can have
With the row R or the row R of varying number of the row equal number of data block 330nD, and word check block 330nWC row C can have
The row R of quantity different from each other.Word check block 330nWC row C can but necessarily there is coding check block 330nCC, i.e. compile
Code check word checks block 330nCCWC.Increase word check the quantity of block 330nWC improve the reliability of data 312 stored but
It is at memorizer main frame 110, use more storage.Generally, nested coding row C includes that data block 330nD or word check block
330nWC but whether both.
Generally, there is coding check block 330nCC that each column C has X to split and N number of word checks that the 2D of block 330nWC is embedding
Set coding reconstructs each column C while can be used communicate in performing only to arrange (communicating in it typically is such as data center)
There is X the block damaged 330 (in those row including data block 330nD).The block of the multiple damages in reconstruct coding piecemeal
In 330, first those blocks 330 damaged generally are reconstructed, because communication is more relatively low than communication cost between row in row, but other damage
Bad block 330 may possibly still be present.If after the block 330 of the damage in reconstruct row, however it remains (N+X) is individual or less
Other blocks 330 (because in they can not use row, communication is reconstructed), then those other blocks 330 damaged can use word
Check that the coding check block 330nCC of block 330nWC and fractionation is reconstructed.Word in first group checks that block 330nWC is (in Fig. 4 B
C0 and C1) can according to split coding check block 330nCC such as use formulaDetermine, even if
Those words check that block 330nWC is not clearly stored.
In order to prove this, it is assumed that Z indicates impaired word and checks the quantity of block 330nWC, and assumes that Y indicates first
In group can not be according to formulaFrom the coding check block 330nCC of the fractionation of they correspondences be reconstructed into by
The word of the coding check block 330nCC of the fractionation damaged checks the quantity of block 330nWC.Use this formula, it is possible to determine from
Y word of the X of a group checks block 330nWC, thus obtains the word inspection block 330nWC and second of Y the damage having in first group
The word of in group Z damage check block 330nWC coded word (such as, the coded word shown in Fig. 3 H).Exist because being at most
Amount to N+X the block 330 damaged, so at most there is N+X-Y-Z data block 330nD damaged.Obtain therefore, it is possible to use
Coded word reconstruct the block 330 of all damages, because it includes at most N+X-Y-Z+Y+Z=N+X the block damaged 330.
With reference to Fig. 3 J, in some implementations, the coding piecemeal obtained includes checking the coding of block 330nWC for word
Check block 330nCC (that is, coding check word checks block 330nCCWC).Compared with the coding piecemeal of Fig. 3 I, the coding of Fig. 3 J divides
Block include coding check block C0,7 and C1,7 330nCC to replace in Fig. 3 I utilizing "？" position of labelling.This is a kind of offer weight
The word building damage checks that block 330nWC is independent of the mode of communication between row.Coding check block C0,7 and C1,7 330nCC can
Generate in every way.Such as, those coding checks block 330nCC can based on C2-C7 to generate C0 based on D0-D5,0
The mode identical with C1,0 generates.The coding piecemeal that (the using example nesting coding) of Fig. 3 J obtains can be used and performing
Up to eight blocks 330 damaged of reconstruct after reconstruct in row, and the coding piecemeal that (the using example hierarchical coding) of Fig. 3 E obtains
Can be used up to six blocks 330 damaged of reconstruct after reconstructing in performing row.Can be for including that word checks block
Any amount of row of 330nWC add coding check block 330nC.
With reference to Fig. 3 K, in some implementations, manager 210 uses nested coding 313b to distribute data 312.System
100 receive deblocking 316 (step 372).Deblocking 316 can include md*ndData block 330nC, mdIt it is the number of data row
Amount, and ndIt is the quantity of data row, and mdAnd ndMore than or equal to one.Coding piecemeal includes m*n block 330, and it includes
md*nd, wherein m is the total quantity of row R of data block 330nD and non-data block 330nC, and n is data block 330nD and non-number
Quantity according to the row C of block 330nC；M and n is more than or equal to one.System 100 uses the first linear faults school using system form
Just encoding 313 and data block 330nD to generate word check block 330nWC one or more columns per page C (step 374).Go together mutually the word of R
Check that block 330nWC and data block 330nD form coded word.M for data block 330nCdOften going in row, system 100 generates
Coding check block 330nCC (step 376) for one or more fractionations of row C.The coding check block 330nCC split is given birth to
The linear combination becoming the coding check block 330nCC making n the fractionation from different lines C is formed and includes data block 330nD and m
Individual word checks the first coding check block of block 330nWC.First word inspection block 330nWC (and from the fractionation from different lines C
Any other word that the linear combination of coding check block 330nCC obtains checks block 330nWC) formed have data block 330nD and
The word generated in step 374 checks the coded word of block 330nWC.Such as, for the coding check block of fractionation of each column C
330nCC can use the error correction coding 313 and m of fractionationdIndividual data block 330nD or word check that block 330nWC generates, its
The error correction coding 313 of middle fractionation includes encoding 313 with for the linear error correction of be applied to data block 330nD first
The generator matrix of the generator matrix identical fractionation of coding, wherein data block 330nD is for the row C quilt in addition to row C
Reset.
System 100 stores the coding check block 330nCC and the row C of word inspection block 330nWC of data block 330nD and fractionation
(step 378).In some implementations, all pieces 330 are stored at single group of memorizer main frame 110 by system 100.?
In some other implementations, each column C is assigned to different groups of memorizer main frame 110 by system 100.In some implementations
In, system 100 is to being grouped according to the block 330 that other blocks 330 in this group G reconstruct, and by the block 330 points of this group
It is fitted on different groups of memorizer main frame 110.
When system 100 identifies the block 330 of one or more damage, system 100 can use the coding check block of fractionation
330nCC and word check that block 330nWC reconstructs the block 330 of damage.Generally, the examination of system 100 prelibation uses with the fractionation in a line C
Coding check block 330nCC and other data blocks 330nd reconstruct the block 330 of damage.If at the coding that use only splits
After checking the block 330 that block 330nCC reconstruct damages, some blocks 330 damaged yet suffer from, then system 100 uses word to check block
330nWC rebuilds, and can be determined by the linear combination of coding check block 330nCC split and the word determined including using
Check that block 330nWC rebuilds.If it addition, come at the coding check block 330nCC of the fractionation using the block 330 only organizing G
After the block 330 that reconstruct damages, some blocks 330 damaged yet suffer from, then system 100 uses other groups G's from block 330
Block 330 reconstructs the block 330 of damage.
Refer back to Fig. 2, in some implementations, manager 210 filec descriptor 300 stored1-nComprise metadata
212, such as File Mapping 214, band 320a-n is mapped to and is stored in memorizer master by File Mapping 214 in appropriate circumstances
Data block 320nd on machine 110kWith non-data block 320ncm.In order to open file 310, request 122 is sent to by client 120
Manager 210, and it returns filec descriptor 300.Client 120 uses filec descriptor 300 blocks of files skew to be transformed into
Remote memory location 115a-n.Filec descriptor 300 can include client key 302 (such as, 32 keys), and it is to depositing
Block 330 on reservoir main frame 110 is unique and reads this block 330 for RDMA.At client 120 load document descriptor
After 300, client 120 can take reading method to access the data 312 of file 310 via RDMA or another data.
Manager 210 can maintain the status information of all memorizer main frames 110 for the part for unit 200.Shape
State information can include the load on capacity, free space, memorizer main frame 110, from the memorizer main frame at the visual angle of client
The delay of 110 and current state.Manager 210 can by the memorizer main frame 110 in directly query unit 200 and/
Or obtain this information by inquiring client terminal 120 to collect delay statistics from the visual angle of client.In some instances,
Manager 210 use memorizer main machine status information to make reequilibrate, consume, recover decision-making and assign decision-making.
(one or more) manager 210 can be with assignment blocks 330 to dispose for the more memory spaces in file 310
And client request 122 for reequilibrate and recovery.Manager 210 can maintain memorizer load on host computers and vigor
Load diagram 216.In some implementations, manager 210 carrys out assignment blocks by generating the list of candidate memory main frame 110
330 and by assignment blocks each candidate memory main frames of being sent in candidate memory main frame 110 of request 122.If memorizer
Main frame 110 overloads or does not have free space, then memorizer main frame 110 can refuse this request 122.In this case, pipe
Reason person 210 selects different memorizer main frames 110.Each manager 210 can its of scanning file name space constantly refer to
Determine part, check the most all metadata 212 every about minute.Manager 210 can use file scan to check metadata
The integrity of 212, determines the work needing to be performed, and/or generates statistics.File scan can concomitantly with manager
Other of 210 operate.Scanning itself can not revise metadata 212, but scheduling will be by other portions of system 100
Work counting statistics that part completes are digital.
In some implementations, processor 202 can be by the one or more data blocks in data block 330nD and non-number
It is grouped in group G according to the one or more non-data blocks in block 330nC.One or more pieces 330 of this group G can be according to this group
Other blocks 330 of G are reconstructed.Therefore, when the block 330 of reconstruct group G, manager 210 reads the block 330 of this group G with reconstruct
The block 330 of the damage in this group G.This allows the more efficient reconstruction of the block 330 to disappearance, and reduces the block 330 being read
Quantity.Specifically, the quantity reducing block reading can reduce the cost of reading, because to hardware device (such as, memorizer master
Machine 114) less reading be performed, and reduce the delay of reconstruct, because equipment is the most to be accessed slowly.
With reference to Fig. 4 A-4C, manager 210 may determine that the level of maintenance structure 400 of distributed memory system 100 identifies
At which it may happen that safeguard rank (such as, rank 1-5), and do not affect the user to the data 312 stored access.Dimension
Protect and can include that power is safeguarded, cooling system is safeguarded (Fig. 4 C), networking maintenance, renewal or renewal part or affects distributed depositing
Other of storage system 100 are safeguarded or power failure.
Level of maintenance structure 400 mark safeguards the rank (such as, rank 1-5) in territory 402, the most each safeguards that territory 402 can
To be in active state or disabled state.Each memorizer main frame 110 and one or more dimensions of distributed memory system 100
Protect territory 402 to be associated.Additionally, processor 202 to memorizer main frame 110 with safeguard territory 402 and parts 410 thereof, 420,430,
440, the association of 114 maps.Fig. 4 A shows Strict Hierarchy 400a, the most each parts 410,420,430,440,
114 depend on a miscellaneous part 410,420,430,440,114, and Fig. 4 B shows non-critical rank 400b, one of them
Parts 410,420,430,440,114 have the feeding of the input more than.In some instances, processor 202 is by levels of maintenance
400 are stored on the non-transient memorizer 204 of processor 202.Such as, storage resource 114a is mapped to frame 440a, frame
440a is mapped to bus duct 430a, bus duct 430a and is then mapped to Distribution Center's module 420a, Distribution Center's module
420a is mapped to power plant 410a then.Processor 202 mapping based on parts 410,420,430,440,114 determines works as
It is sluggish that parts 410,420,430,440,114 are experiencing which resource host 110 when safeguarding.Once system 100 will
Safeguard that, when territory 402 is mapped to storage resource 114, system 100 is determined to highest level (such as, the level performing to safeguard at which
Other 1-5), maintain availability of data simultaneously.
Safeguard parts 410,420,430,440,114 that territory 402 includes that experience safeguards and depend on parts 410,420,
430, any parts of 440,114.Therefore, when parts 410,420,430,440,114 are experiencing and are safeguarding, these parts
410,420,430,440,114 is sluggish, and parts 410,420,430,440,114 safeguard in territory 402 any
Parts 410,420,430,440,114 are also sluggish.As shown in Figure 4 A, rank 1 parts can include storing resource 114a-
n；Rank 2 parts can include frame 440a-n；Rank 3 parts can include bus duct 430a-n；Rank 4 parts can include

Rank 3-dimensional is protected territory 402c and is in disabled state.When power model Distribution Center 420a is experiencing and safeguarding, including power mould
Block Distribution Center 420a safeguards territory with the rank 4 of any parts being subordinated in the rank 1 to 3 of power model Distribution Center 420a
402d is in disabled state.Finally, when power plant 410 is experiencing and safeguarding, including any power model Distribution Center
420, the rank 5 of bus duct 430, frame 440 and the memorizer main frame 110 that is subordinated to power plant 410 safeguards that territory 402e is not live
Jump, and therefore user can not access and is positioned at rank 1 and safeguards the data 312 of territory 402a.
In some instances, as shown in Figure 4 B, relaxed layer aggregated(particle) structure 400b parts 410,420,430,440,114 have
Dual feeding, i.e. parts 410,420,430,440,114 depend on two or more miscellaneous parts 410,420,430,440,
114.Such as, bus duct 430n can have the feeding from two power models 410；And/or frame 440 can have from
The dual feeding of two bus ducts 430.As shown, first safeguards that territory 402c can include two frames 440a and 440n,
Wherein the second frame 440n includes two feedings from two bus ducts 430a, 430n.Therefore, the second frame 440n is two
Safeguard a part of territory 402ca and 402cb.Therefore, the higher level of level of maintenance structure 400 is maintained, and does not cause maintenance
The other loss of lower level of hierarchical structure 400.This causes the redundancy in system 100, and it allows data accessibility.Specifically,
Power model Distribution Center 420 can be maintained, and do not lose in the bus duct 430 being subordinated to it any.In some examples
In, frame 440 includes dual power supply frame 440, and it allows the maintenance of bus duct 430 not to be lost to be subordinated to its dual power supply machine
The power of frame 440.In some instances, it is maintained and does not cause the maintenance territory 402 of fault out in the cold to permit when distribution block 330
Permitted to safeguard；But, unheeded safeguard that territory 402 can be comprised when distribution block 330, this is because unplanned fault is permissible
Still the loss of block 330 is caused.
In some instances, as shown in Figure 4 C, level of maintenance structure 400 is cooling layer aggregated(particle) structure 400c (or power level
