Embodiment
The various report of the various user interactions of open and content is provided to content provider (for example, advertiser).Each user interactions can comprise a plurality of dimensions, and described dimension can comprise the data associated with this user interactions.Can generate report so that the information about user interactions to be provided to advertiser.Such report can have a large amount of unique user interactions.For simplifying report, can to mating the various user interactions of various groups of rules, divide into groups by create-rule.Can generate the report of the user interactions that comprises a plurality of groupings.
As running through the term that used all the time herein, user interactions comprises any content displaying to user, and user for example, in response to show content (chosen content after showing content to this user, or any certainty action or non-action (being referred to as unless otherwise, " action ") subsequently of chosen content not after showing content) taking.Therefore, user interactions not necessarily need to be by this user in selecting content (or any other certainty action).
User interactions is estimated can comprise one or more time intervals appraisals (estimating from the user interactions of one or more appointments to the time transforming), path appraisal (quantity of the user interactions occurring conversion), user interactions path (sequence of the user interactions occurring before conversion), assist mutual appraisal (the mutual quantity of specific user occurring before conversion) and auxiliary conversion to estimate (quantity of the conversion of being assisted by given content).
Fig. 1 is according to the block diagram of the example context of an exemplary embodiment, wherein Advertising Management System managing advertisement service.Example context 100 comprises network 102, for example Local Area Network, wide area network (WAN), internet or above-mentioned combination.Network 102 connects website 104, user's set 106, advertiser 108 and Advertising Management System 110.Example context 100 can comprise thousands of or more websites 104, user's set 106 and advertiser 108.
User's set 106 is electronic installations of being controlled by user, and can ask and receive resource 105 by network 102.The example of user's set 106 comprises personal computer, mobile communications device and other devices that can transmit and receive data by network 102.User's set 106 generally includes the user of being convenient to transmit and receive data by network 102 and applies, for example web browser.
User's set 106 can be asked the resource 105 from website 104.Conversely, the data that represent resource 105 can be offered to user's set 106, for being shown by user's set 106.The data that represent resource 105 can comprise the data of the part of the resource that appointment wherein can display advertisement or the part that user shows (for example, pop-up window or the display location in the position of webpage).These specified portions that resource 105 or user show are called location advertising.
For ease of search, by the addressable ample resources 105 of network 102, environment 100 can comprise search system 112, and it carrys out recognition resource 105 by the resource 105 capturing and index provides on website 104.Data about resource 105 can the resource 105 based on this data correlation be carried out index.Alternatively, the index copy of resource 105 and (optionally) cached copy are stored in search index (not shown).
User's set 106 can be submitted search inquiry to search system 112 by network 102.As response, search system 112 access search index, to identify the resource relevant to search inquiry 105.In one exemplary embodiment, search inquiry comprises one or more keywords.Search system 112 identification is to the resource 105 of this inquiry response, provide the information about this resource 105 with the form of Search Results, and towards user's set 106, returns to Search Results with search results pages.Search Results can comprise the data that generated by search system 112, and its identification response is in the resource 105 of particular search query, and Search Results can be included in the link of resource 105.The example of Search Results can comprise the presenting of part, resource 105 of web page title, the text fragments that extract from webpage 104 or image, and the URL of webpage 104.Result of page searching can also comprise one or more location advertisings that can display advertisement.
Result of page searching can be arranged to HTTP(HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) with the web browser for user's set 106 from search system 112) send together with the request of cookie.For example, cookie can represent particular user device 106 and particular webpage browser.For example, search system 112 comprises server, and this server is answered in the face of inquiring about by send search results pages in http response.This http response comprises and makes website that browser storage posts year about server or for example, about the instruction (, cookie instruction being set) of the cookie in the territory of server.If browser supports cookie and enable cookie, to each page request subsequently of the server in same server or server domain, will comprise this cookie.Cookie can store various kinds of data, comprises unique or part unique identifier.It doesn't matter can to conceal this unique or part unique identifier and this unique or part unique identifier and user's name.Because HTTP is stateless protocol, use cookie to allow external service (for example search system 112 or other system) in a plurality of sessions, to follow the tracks of user's specific action and state.For example, user can, by the middle forbidding of arranging of browser cookie, select to exit tracking user action.
When user's set 106 request resource 105 or Search Results, or when resource 105 or Search Results are offered to user's set 106, the requests that Advertising Management System 110 receives the advertisement that will provide together with resource 105 or Search Results.To the request of advertisement, can be included as the feature of the location advertising of requested resource 105 or result of page searching restriction, and can be provided for Advertising Management System 110.For example, can provide to Advertising Management System 110: quote (for example URL) to resource 105, wherein limits location advertising for this resource 105; The size of location advertising; And/or be used in the medium type of showing in this location advertising.Similarly, the search inquiry of the keyword associated with the resource 105 of asking one or more words of relevance (with) (" resource keyword ") or request Search Results can also be provided to Advertising Management System 110, to help the advertisement that identification is relevant to resource 105 or search inquiry.
Data based on the request of advertisement is comprised, Advertising Management System 110 can be provided by the qualified advertisement (" suitable advertisement ") that will ask to provide in response to this.For example, suitable advertisement can comprise having the advertisement of the feature matching to the feature of location advertising and be identified as and the resource keyword of appointment or the relevant advertisement of search inquiry.In certain embodiments, by Advertising Management System 110, elect the advertisement with the target keyword of the part of mating resource keyword, search inquiry or search inquiry as suitable advertisement.
Similarly, when user selects the advertisement of (clicking) displaying, can select the data of advertisement store in journal file 116, cookie or history data repository 119 by representing.In certain embodiments, in response to the request of the webpage to by advertisement link, store data.For example, user selects advertisement can initiate to show the request of the webpage being provided by (or being) advertiser.This request can comprise that sign is about the data of the specific cookie of user's set, and these data can be stored in advertisement data store.
User interactive data can be associated with unique identifier, and this unique identifier represents to carry out the corresponding user's set of user interactions.For example, in certain embodiments, user interactive data can be associated with one or more cookie.Each cookie can comprise the content of specifying initialization time, and this initialization time indication arranges at first the time of this cookie in particular user device 106.
As described above, the report that offers certain content supplier can be specified the user of appraisal generation before transforming and the mutual Performance Evaluation of content.When user carries out required movement, transform, and conversion pathway comprises the one group of user interactions that transforms and occurred before carrying out this conversion by user.Forming the factor transforming may be different because of thing, and can in all sorts of ways to determine to be that what formation transforms.For example, when user clicks advertisement, forward webpage or website to, then complete while buying leaving before this webpage or website at that, can transform.Again for example, when user during the more more time, can transform than preset time in specific website cost.Data from a plurality of user interactions can be used for determining the time quantum at specific website.
Can specify the action that forms conversion by each advertiser.For example, each advertiser can select one or more measurable/observable user actions as conversion, for example download white paper, at least navigate to the given depth of website, at least check the webpage of some, at least on website or webpage, spend time of scheduled volume, buy product, or register on website.Also can use and form other actions that transform.
Follow the tracks of conversion (and mutual with other of advertiser's website), advertiser can comprise embedding instruction in this advertiser's webpage, wherein this embeds mutual (for example the page is selected, content item is selected and other mutual) of instruction supervisory user and advertiser's website, and can detect the user interactions (or a series of user interactions) that forms conversion.In certain embodiments, when user is during from webpage referenced (or other resources) accessed web page or another resource, for example, can be by carrying out the code snippet be quoted by just accessed webpage and/or based on identifying about this mutual webpage referenced (or other resources) for accessing the URL of this webpage.
For example, user can visit advertiser's website by being chosen in the link of showing on webpage, for example, select the link of the popularization activity part of the affiliate (affiliate) as advertiser.This link can be associated with the URL that comprises the data (being text) of unique identification resource, and wherein user navigates from this resource.For example, link http://www.example.com/homepage/%affiliate_identifier%promotion _ 1 is specified user is navigate to example.com webpage from the associated affiliate webpage of the affiliate identifier with appointment this URL, and based on being chosen in linking of comprising in the popularization activity associated with pro motion_1, user is directed to example.com webpage.Can deposit the user interactive data about this mutual (selecting link) in database, and as mentioned below, use this user interactive data to help performance report.
When detecting conversion for advertiser, the conversion data that represents this conversion can be transferred to the data processing equipment (" analytical equipment ") that receives this conversion data, and then this conversion data is kept in data-carrier store.Can by this conversion data with for carrying out together with one or more cookie of user's set of user interactions, store, make the user interactive data associated with cookie can be associated with this conversion, and can be used for generating the performance report about this conversion.
Conventionally, when the advertisement of using target keyword to be decided to be target is, while transforming the front last advertisement of clicking, to think that this conversion is owing to this target keyword.For example, advertiser X can be associated keyword " tennis ", " footwear " and " brand X " with advertisement.In this example, suppose that user submits the first search inquiry to " tennis " to, to this user, show the result of page searching of the advertisement that comprises advertiser X, and this user selects this advertisement, but this user does not take to form the action transforming.Further this user of hypothesis submits the second search inquiry to " brand X " subsequently to, and to the advertisement of this user's display advertisement client X, user selects the advertisement of advertiser X, and user takes to form the action (for example, user buys brand X tennis shoes) transforming.In this example, this is the advertisement of showing because last advertisement of selecting before transforming (" advertisement of finally selecting ") is in response to coupling " brand X " conversion to be given the credit to keyword " brand X, ".
To the keyword that causes showing the advertisement of last selection before conversion, provide that to transform contribution volume (" finally selecting contribution volume ") be a kind of effective methods of evaluation to advertisement performance, yet be singly that this methods of evaluation can not be offered help and analyze the data of transformation period to advertiser, this transformation period is included in the advertisement of last selection before to advertisement user contact and/or selection.For example, independent last selection contribution volume methods of evaluation do not specify may be by increased the keyword of brand or product popularity to presenting to user's and/or the advertisement selected by user displaying before selecting this last advertisement of selecting.Yet these advertisements may be to taking the user who forms the action transforming to have major contribution subsequently.
In the above example, even if the advertisement of showing in response to the search inquiry of matching keywords " tennis " may for example, have contribution to the user of the action (buying brand X tennis shoes) of taking form to transform, but does not also provide any contribution volume about transforming to keyword " tennis ".For example, when user selects the advertisement of the displaying in response to matching keywords " tennis ", user may check the brand X tennis shoes that can obtain from advertiser X.Contact based on user to brand X tennis shoes, user may submit to search inquiry " brand X, " to find the tennis shoes from brand X subsequently.Similarly, the selection regardless of user to advertisement, user to the contact of advertisement of using keyword " tennis " and being decided to be target also for example, to taking subsequently the user who forms the action (buying the product from advertiser X) transforming to contribute to some extent.Analysis the user who selects to occur before the last advertisement of selecting and advertiser's advertisement (or other guide) alternately, can improve the ability that advertiser understands this advertiser's transformation period.
Transformation period is during to user's display advertisement, and when user takes to form the action transforming, finish during.Can estimate and/or retrain the transformation period by time or action, and this transformation period can cross over a plurality of user conversations.User conversation is the set condensing together for the user interactions analyzed.Each user conversation comprises expression data that carried out by specific user and the user interactions in session window (being designated duration).For example, session window can be the time period (for example 1 hour, 1 day or 1 month) of appointment, or can delimit this session window with required movement.For example, user search session user search queries that occur in can being included in during 1 hour and/or that for example, occur before in conversation end event (, closing search browser) and action subsequently.
Analyze the transformation period can improve advertiser understand within the transformation period its client how with the mutual ability of advertisement.For example, if advertiser determines that contacting for the first time advertisement from user is 20 days to the averaging time transforming, advertiser can infer that user is transforming (taking to form the action transforming) the front time spending for studying alternate source by these data.Similarly, if determining, advertiser showing that using particular keywords to be decided to be a lot of users that transform after the advertisement of target does like this, advertiser may wish to increase the amount of funds that it spends in the advertisement of using this keyword to distribute, and/or improves the quality of using this particular keywords to be decided to be the advertisement of target.
Help the user interactions appraisal of analyzing the transformation period can be called conversion pathway Performance Evaluation.Conversion pathway is by specific user, transformed front and comprising one group of user interactions of this specific user of this conversion.As be described in more detail below, conversion pathway Performance Evaluation is specified the duration of transformation period, the amount of user interaction occurring within the duration of transformation period, transforms the path of front user interactions, is transformed the front mutual quantity of specific user occurring, and other appraisals to the user interactions occurring within the duration of transformation period.
Can provide config option to reduce the deviation in performance report.There is no config option, some performance report may have deviation, for example, be partial to short conversion pathway.For example,, if comprise that by the basic data of giving a report performance report may be partial to short conversion pathway higher than the number percent in the Partial Conversion path of threshold percentage.Partial Conversion path be wherein about some user interactive datas of user rather than all user interactive datas all with transform associated conversion pathway.For example, if be less than request report advertiser typical transformation period length generate during the reporting period this report, can in this report, add Partial Conversion path.
Determine during the reporting period the maximum length (Yi Tianlaiwei unit) of the transformation period of report, this is because outer excessive data during operation report not generates this report.Performance report can (be looked back window) based on during the reporting period, makes when generating report not the user interactions before during the reporting period regard as the part of transformation period.Being called during the reporting period like this " looked back window." for example, when generating report according to the review window of 30 days, be illustrated in the available subscribers interaction data of the user action occurring between July 1 in given time and July 31, will be available to the conversion occurring this year July 31.
For example, when using acquiescence to look back window (30 days), if being greater than this acquiescence, the typical transformation period length of the product associated with report looks back window, performance report can be partial to short conversion pathway.For example, in example above, the typical transformation period of " brand X " tennis shoes (for example 30 days) is with for example, compare compared with the transformation period of your make (, new car) may be relatively short.New car can have the longer transformation period (for example, 90 days).
Different advertisers or advertiser's different product can have different associated transformation period length.For example, sell (being for example less than 100 dollars) advertiser of product at a low price and can specify the review window of 30 days, and the advertiser who sells more expensive product (for example at least 1000 dollars) can specify the review window of 90 days.
In certain embodiments, advertiser 108 can when request performance report, for example, specify the review window that will use by input number of days or for example, by selecting to look back window (30 days, 60 days, 90 days) the review window list from appointment.Allow advertiser to configure the review window of their performance report, make advertiser can select the review window corresponding with their transformation period of product.Allow to look back window configuration and also make advertiser to test by enough different review windows, its possibility of result causes finding to improve the method for conversion rate.
Other factors can have contribution to report section conversion pathway.For example, as described above, with giving a report, basic user interactive data can be associated with the unique identifier that represents to have carried out the user's set of user interactions.As described above, unique identifier can be stored as to cookie.For example, can by delete cookie user, delete the browser (for example, when exiting browser, setting based on browser parameters) of cookie, or some other softwares (for example Rogue Anti-Spyware) of deleting cookie are deleted cookie from user's set.
If deleted cookie from user's set, for example, when user's accessed web page (search system 112), new cookie can be set on user's set.This new cookie can be used for storing new part unique identifier, and the user interactive data subsequently therefore occurring on this user's set can be associated from different identifiers.Therefore,, because each user identifier is considered to represent different users, so being identified as the user different with the user interactive data of associated new cookie, the user interactive data associated from deleted cookie be associated.
For example, in example above, suppose that user deletes cookie after carrying out first search inquiry of " tennis ", and in the deleted rear generation of cookie the second search inquiry to " brand X ".In this example, may there is deviation in the Performance Evaluation that the user interactive data based on about user calculates.For example, because the advertisement selection the first search inquiry not being caused is regarded the part of the transformation period that the advertisement selection that causes with the second search inquiry is identical as, so estimating, path may be calculated as one, rather than two, this is because two user interactions seem not to be to be carried out by identical user.
Check the report that reduces the deviation being caused by Partial Conversion path, advertiser can be this report and specifies review window.As described above, looking back window appointment is the user interactive data associated with unique identifier for generating the user interactive data of report, wherein, this unique identifier has designated duration (for example 30 days, 60 days, 90 days) before conversion initialization time before.Therefore, for the conversion that wherein user interactive data is associated with the unique identifier with the initialization time after this designated duration, be not included the basis that is used as this report.Have on the user's set that the unique identifier indication of nearest initialization time may represent at this unique identifier recently and reinitialized this unique identifier.Therefore, the user interactive data associated with relatively new unique identifier can only represent part conversion pathway.Or, for user interactive data wherein, be comprised in this report with the conversion that the unique identifier with the initialization time after this designated duration is associated.For reducing deviation, before adding report, from conversion pathway, remove any user interactions comprising in this conversion pathway, occur after designated duration.
Fig. 2 is according to the process flow diagram of the process for integrated user interactions daily record data of an exemplary embodiment.This process 200 is to upgrade conversion pathway and the definite process transforming of the user's conversion pathway based on upgrading.
Can on Advertising Management System 110, performance evaluation equipment 120 or another calculation element, realize this process 200.In one embodiment, this process 200 of encoding on computer-readable medium, this computer-readable medium comprises when being carried out by calculation element and makes this calculation element carry out the instruction of the operation of this process 200.
As described above, journal file 116 can comprise user interactive data.Journal file 116 can be before processing combines with the user interactive data of other daily records from other servers, comprises those user interactive datas of realizing search system 112.Processing starts from realizing the calculation element of this process 200 and determines that new daily record can be used for processing (210).For example, can send the notice that the new daily record of indication has been ready for processing to calculation element, or the existence of new daily record can indicate this new daily record to be ready for processing.
Next, retrieving novel daily record (220).Can retrieving novel daily record on network 102.User action based on being indicated by new daily record upgrades each user's state history.New daily record can comprise the information relevant to a plurality of users' user interactions.History data repository 119 comprises the user interactive data from previously processed journal file.Owing to can by user identifier, user interactive data being divided into groups and by the time, it be sorted, so the user interactive data comprising in history data repository 119 can have state.Fig. 3 is described in the block diagram of the user interactive data upgrading in the duration of user interactions daily record data integrating process 200 according to an exemplary embodiment.Fig. 3 shows four example user's identifiers, yet history data repository 119 can comprise the data associated with thousands of or millions of different user identifiers with journal file 116.In one embodiment, previously stored user interactive data 310 is stored in history data repository 119.As shown in the figure, previously also without any the user interactive data associated with user identifier 3, be stored in history data repository 119.
New daily record can comprise the user interactive data about one or more user identifiers.Can to user interactive data, divide into groups according to user identifier and then by time sort (230).Row 320 illustrate the user interactive data that divides into groups and sort.As shown in the figure, user identifier 2 does not comprise any new user interactive data, and user identifier 1,3 and 4 has upgraded user interactive data.For example, new journal file comprises the mutual a of associated user with user identifier 1
13and a
14associated user interactive data.Then, divided into groups can merge mutually (240) with the user interactive data of storage in history data repository 119 with the user interactive data of sequence.If preexist user identifier in history data repository 119, adds new user interactive data to previous user interactive data.Otherwise, add new user interactive data and new user identifier.
Row 330 illustrate the user interactive data about the renewal of each user identifier.User interactive data based on upgrading, can determine any conversion (250) occurring in the more new route of each user interactions.User interactions path is restricted to those user interactions relevant to particular advertisers 108.The conversion of particular advertisers 108 transforms for determining whether alternately.For example, suppose user interactions a
13and a
32represent to transform mutual.Correspondingly, find conversion pathway 340 and 350.Once find, conversion pathway can be write to another part or another data-carrier store of history data repository 119, for further analysis.
Each user interactions comprises associated with this user interactions one group of data or dimension.Can sparsely fill this dimension, make any user interactions can there are the data that subset is relevant to dimension.Can generate a large amount of conversion pathway by the user interactive data based on receiving.About how, the various report of executed activity or advertiser's arrangement can comprise the various information about conversion pathway.Consider a large amount of potential conversion pathway, each conversion pathway can be aggregated to together to reduce the quantity of the different conversion pathway of report.In one exemplary embodiment, the conversion pathway that polymerizable has the user interactions of equal number and has corresponding data.
In one embodiment, user can create different groups independent user interactions is classified.Group comprises group definition, and group definition comprises determines whether specific user interactions belongs to one or more groups of rules of particular group.Organize the mutual dimension data of regular user and determine the group of user interactions.Various groups of rules can using the Boolean operator such as " with, " " non-, " "or" etc. to be connected in group definition.Each group also comprises that group name claims.In certain embodiments, group can comprise demonstration information, such as but not limited to, for showing textcolor and/or the background color of group name.Default set also can be used user.When default set is available, user can copy default set (comprising associated group rule), then revises one or more groups of rules and/or group name and claims.The group that user can be created is stored in storer, for example Local or Remote database.Then can these groups be conducted interviews, be revised or delete in the time after a while.
In the sequence or ordered list of grouping definition, one or more groups can be interrelated.Group in this ordered list is for determining the group of each user interactions.The priority of particular group is determined in the sequence of this list.User can be assigned in the coupling group with limit priority.The coupling group of lower priority will be left in the basket.
