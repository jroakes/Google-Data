Abstract
The present disclosure describes methods and apparatus for beamforming enhancement via policy resource utilization. In some aspects, air interface resources are used to exchange wireless communications using one or more signal beams. In some embodiments, the end user devices are classified into beamforming states, such as active, idle, or inactive, based on the level of activity with the base station. To facilitate antenna beamforming between a base station and an end user device, opportunities for beamforming training are provided by strategically admitting resource units based on one or more resource allocation rules. For example, for each end user device, control and data information may be allocated together on the same frequency. In addition, an uplink or downlink grant may be provided prior to the downlink or uplink allocation, respectively. In some embodiments, the resource allocation rules are applied based on the beamforming state to which the end user equipment has been classified.
Description
Background
Electronic devices play an indispensable role in manufacturing, healthcare, commerce, social interaction, entertainment, and communications. For example, most people consider their smart phones to be a critical part of their daily lives. The electronic device also enables a computer server farm that provides cloud-based distributed computing functionality for business and social interactions. Furthermore, devices with computing capabilities are embedded in many different types of modern devices, from medical devices to household appliances, from vehicles to industrial tools. Accordingly, electronic devices are manufactured in a variety of sizes, form factors, and capabilities for a wide range of purposes. One particularly prominent purpose of electronic devices is communication, including communication over long distances.
Prior to the development of electronic devices, long-range communication was generally limited to the physical transportation of letters by humans. Other options include signaling smoke or advising the pigeon to carry a short letter. The former option is limited to short distances and is affected by sudden changes in weather, while the latter option has significant reliability problems. Fortunately, the invention of telegraph opened the era of reliable long-distance communication using electrical signals that encode written words, for example using morse code for each letter. Finally, telegraph technology is upgraded to telephone technology so that people can talk to each other simply using electrical signals that span large distances. However, both telegraph and telephone technology require wires extending between the communicating parties.
The next step in the evolution of communications involves the utilization of Electromagnetic (EM) waves that propagate in free space without the use of wires. However, EM waves generally travel along straight lines and thus cannot easily cover long distances. An exception to this is the short wave EM signal. Short-wave EM signals still travel in straight lines, but they reflect off of layers of the earth's atmosphere called ionosphere. Thus, short-wave EM signals can be reflected through the earth's horizon, enabling communication across thousands of miles. Unfortunately, communicating with short-wave EM signals typically involves the use of antennas that are tens of feet tall. These are expensive and impractical for mobile communications. To achieve portability, Civil Band (CB) radios and walkie-talkies have been developed for mobile use. Even in the 1960 s and 1970 s, CB radios and interphones could be produced in portable and even hand-held form. Unfortunately, communication with any of these portable devices is limited to only a few miles.
By the 1980 s, communications using electrical or EM signals were generally classified as using either all wired or all wireless technology, particularly for consumers and other low cost scenarios. For example, telephony enables long distance voice communication, but telephony is still generally limited to wired connections. On the other hand, portable radios use EM waves to establish wireless connections, but voice communications with these consumer-level devices using EM waves are typically limited to a range of no more than a few miles. To combine these two technologies and achieve some of the advantages of both, cellular technologies were created. Cellular technology may be implemented using a communication network that combines wireless and wired networks. As a result, cellular technology enables mobile electronic devices to be used for long-range communications.
With cellular technology, communication between two people typically has both a wireless and a wired portion. The partial communication near a party is established using a wireless connection between the mobile phone and the base station, which is part of a cellular or wireless network of the communication network. Such wireless connections typically extend from a few feet to miles. The communication network also includes or is coupled to a wired network. Thus, the base station continues communication using a wired connection through a wired network. Wired networks may extend from hundreds of feet to thousands of miles. If the other party is also using the mobile phone, the communication can be converted back to another wireless part and routed to the other party using another wireless connection.
To enable cellular technology to operate in a wide geographic area, many base stations are distributed so that the wireless portion of the communication is implemented. Each of these base stations is typically capable of supporting multiple users by simultaneously establishing multiple wireless connections with respective ones of multiple mobile telephones. Thus, by the 1990's, cellular technology enabled voice calls to be made using communications that included both wireless and wired connections. To expand the ability to use cellular technology to communicate with more than speech, cellular systems have been enhanced to include text communication capabilities. This communication uses text messages, which are referred to as Short Message Service (SMS) messages. This has led to continued efforts to enable mobile telephones and other electronic devices to send and receive data and to enable voice communications.
With the development of second generation (2G) wireless networks, data communication other than voice becomes feasible. However, before third generation (3G) wireless networks were deployed, data communication was of no significance for most purposes. The 3G wireless network enables mobile phone users to send and receive simple e-mails and access basic web pages without experiencing long delays. However, fourth generation (4G) networks, such as those based on the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard, truly enable data-based wireless services that users enjoy today. For example, using a smartphone operating over a 4G network, a user may now engage in a video call in addition to a voice call. In addition, users can surf the internet without restriction and can receive real-time, turn-by-turn navigation directions. In addition, the user can keep the latest social media information anytime and anywhere, upload own images and even videos, and watch high-definition videos.
To accommodate these existing services, wireless networks have been expected to process large amounts of data with little to no significant delay. However, newer services are ready to place higher demands on cellular wireless networks. Users will desire greater data bandwidth and even less delay or latency to accommodate such services. These new services include high data bandwidth applications such as Ultra High Definition (UHD) video wirelessly transmitted from certain streaming video services. Such services also include low latency applications, such as autonomous vehicles that communicate with each other, and thus may operate more safely if near instantaneous data communication capabilities are provided. Some applications, such as Virtual Reality (VR), will require data transfer that provides high bandwidth and low latency. Furthermore, there is a continuing development of the internet of things (IoT), which involves providing wireless communication capabilities for everything from medical devices to security hardware, from refrigerators to speakers. The deployment of Iot devices means that hundreds of millions to trillions of new devices will soon attempt to communicate wirelessly.
Current 4G wireless networks are not expected to be able to handle the data bandwidth and latency specifications of these new applications. Therefore, new wireless technologies are being developed to enjoy these new applications. Fifth generation (5G) wireless network technologies will employ higher frequency EM waves (e.g., 6GHz to 100GHz for millimeter wave (mmW) wireless connections) to achieve higher data bandwidth and lower latency. However, these new applications and higher EM frequencies introduce new and different challenges that remain to be overcome.
For example, as a large number of IoT devices come online, the EM spectrum allocated for cellular wireless usage will be shared among more wireless connection endpoints. Also, with mmW EM signaling to be used in 5G cellular networks, wireless signals may be attenuated more quickly by air molecules and environmental factors such as humidity or physical obstructions than those signaling frequencies used in earlier generation wireless networks. Thus, mmW EM signals cannot propagate far into the atmosphere until their quality degrades to the level where information in the wireless signal is lost. To address these problems, engineers and manufacturers are striving to create new wireless signaling technologies that enable these GHz frequencies to be used in cellular wireless networks, including those operating in accordance with the 5G wireless network standard.
This background description is provided to generally present the background of the disclosure. Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described in this section are not admitted to be prior art to the present disclosure or the appended claims either explicitly or implicitly.

Detailed Description
SUMMARY
The ability to enjoy different types of digital content, services, and other applications over wireless connections continues to improve. Today, users can watch HD videos, monitor social network feeds, and participate in video conferencing using cellular wireless networks operating according to 4G standards such as LTE or LTE-Advanced. In the near future, cellular wireless networks will be required to handle more technically difficult newer applications. Such applications may include viewing Ultra High Definition (UHD) video or wirelessly coupling billions of more communication endpoints to the internet to support IoT devices. Such applications may also include providing safer road sharing from driving vehicles, or the exchange of three-dimensional (3D) VR data for gaming and educational activities. To support these newer applications, current cellular wireless networks are expected to be upgraded from 4G.
To upgrade from current 4G wireless networks, destination targets have been established for next generation 5G networks. The destination goal involves employing higher EM frequencies for signal transfer in a 5G network than used in a 4G network. For example, 5G networks are expected to operate at tens of GHz (e.g., from 6GHz to 100GHz for mmW signaling), rather than hundreds of MHz to several GHz as in 4G networks. These higher frequencies offer some advantages, such as the possibility of greater communication bandwidth and lower latency. However, there are many challenges to operating with these higher frequencies, and some of these challenges have not been overcome by the telecommunications industry. In other words, although this high frequency destination or target has been established for the 5G network, no path has been found to this high frequency destination of an efficient, viable 5G wireless network.
Several examples of existing challenges for implementing an operational, high frequency wireless 5G network are set forth herein. For example, in the case of mmW signal transmission at such frequencies for 5G wireless networks, the signal strength decays or decreases rapidly as the EM signal propagates through the earth's atmosphere, particularly in humid weather. Thus, the potential distance between the transmitter and the receiver is reduced for mmW signals. As another example, at some of these higher frequencies, divergence of EM signals near and in the direction of the skin should be avoided for a long period of time. However, beamforming can solve both problems.
With beamforming, signals are spread from an antenna array in a particular direction or pattern, rather than being equally spread from a single antenna in all directions. This enables the resulting signal beam to be directed away from the skin to accommodate any relevant Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) criteria imposed for health reasons. Furthermore, the diverging power may be concentrated in a particular direction that extends from the transmitter in one direction toward the receiver. Thus, a signal transmitted at a given power level may travel farther through the air, even at higher frequencies that attenuate faster in the earth's atmosphere.
Antenna beamforming provides another advantage: increased or more efficient sharing of the EM spectrum. By concentrating the signal in one direction from the first transmitter to the first receiver, the signal is less likely to cause interference in other directions. As a result, the second transmitter and the second receiver can reuse signals on the same frequency in a spatial region close to that of the first transmitter and the first receiver. This space-based frequency reuse technique enables more devices to wirelessly communicate within a given geographic area using a specified frequency range.
Thus, antenna beamforming may provide a number of advantages, including some that relate specifically to wireless communication of mmW signals destined for 5G wireless networks. However, wireless communication using beamforming is more complex than wireless communication without beamforming. Without antenna beamforming, the transmitter only diverges the EM signal omnidirectionally. On the other hand, with antenna beamforming, the transmitter must determine the direction in which to direct the signal beam. Determining the appropriate direction is referred to as training the antenna beamforming. This training may be done in different ways, but each takes some time period and consumes some resources at the transmitting device and/or the receiving device. If the time period is too long, antenna beamforming can create signal delays that slow down communication. Furthermore, while the transmitting or receiving device trains beamforming, the processor and RF resources and power resources of the device are being consumed. Such resource consumption may, for example, shorten battery life at the mobile phone or limit the number of mobile phones that the base station can serve at any given time.
To improve the potential impact of antenna beamforming on wireless communication systems, embodiments described herein facilitate training of antenna beamforming by arranging communication exchanges between a base station and User Equipment (UE) (e.g., a mobile phone, security sensor, or vehicle). The communication exchange enables at least some beamforming training to be performed before scheduled Uplink (UL) or Downlink (DL) communication is to occur. The beamforming training prepares the beamforming apparatus at least in part by predetermining beamforming parameters. Further, the communications exchange is arranged to effectively enable beamforming training while reducing the impact of the training on communications latency and/or resource utilization, including reducing the impact on power consumption, communications unit utilization, and EM spectrum usage.
To this end, an electronic device of a base station or UE performs one or more actions in accordance with at least one resource allocation rule that facilitates beamforming training. For example, control-related communication and data-related communication between any two pairs of electronic devices are assigned to the same one or more frequency tones according to a resource allocation rule. Thus, training of data communication can be performed while participating in control communication, and vice versa. Additionally, the UE may be classified into two or more different beamforming states based on the activity level, e.g., according to at least one beamforming training rule.
In some embodiments, the UE is classified into three beamforming states: an active beamforming state, an idle beamforming state, and an inactive beamforming state. In the active beamforming state, UL and/or DL traffic is ongoing. Thus, air interface resource units used to transmit control and data between the base station and the UE may be scheduled to occur on the same frequency tones. Also, a DL allocation may precede each UL allocation to facilitate training of UL allocations. The previous DL allocation may be explicit or implicit. Similarly, a UL allocation may precede each DL allocation to facilitate training of the DL allocations. The previous UL allocation may be explicit or implicit. Further, each UL and DL allocation may be made periodic to ensure that the beamforming information is up-to-date. In this context, "periodic" means that the resource allocation rules ensure that continuous wireless communication is caused to occur within some maximum period of time based on at least one time threshold. The time threshold may vary based on the beamforming state classification.
In the idle beamforming state, UL and DL traffic is not currently in progress. However, when traffic does occur, control and data communications may be scheduled on the same frequency tones according to resource allocation rules. Also, the allocation in the other direction may precede the resource allocation in the one direction to facilitate training according to another resource allocation rule. Furthermore, resource allocation for wireless communication may be performed periodically to ensure that beamforming information is up-to-date. However, the maximum period between continuous wireless communications in the idle beamforming state is configured to be longer than the maximum period between continuous wireless communications in the active beamforming state. In the inactive beamforming state, the most recent UL or DL transmission has not been performed. Therefore, neither the base station nor the UE generally has the latest beamforming information for this inactive state. According to example resource allocation rules for beamforming training, UL/DL communication pairs are not exchanged, just to keep beamforming parameters current for the inactive beamforming state.
Thus, using these embodiments, antenna beamforming may be implemented in a wireless network system while reducing latency and reducing the impact on resources that beamforming training may otherwise result. Other techniques described herein may also be implemented to facilitate beamforming training. For example, Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) may be beamformed by the UE on the UL based on DL wideband cell-specific reference signals (CRS) or channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS). Also, if no other DL traffic is scheduled, e.g., for a given frequency and time block, the base station may transmit a null Downlink Control Information (DCI) signal. In an alternative embodiment, control beamforming may be allocated independently so that UEs without active data traffic may still maintain beamforming information.
Example embodiments of various levels of detail are discussed below with reference to associated figures. The following discussion first sets forth an example operating environment, and then describes example schemes, techniques, and hardware. Exemplary methods are described next with reference to various flow diagrams, and the discussion then concludes with exemplary electronic devices and related aspects thereof.

The computer-readable storage medium 114 may include a beamforming enhancement module 116 and a beamforming training module 118 described below.
Processor 112 of end-user device 102 may execute processor-executable instructions or code stored by computer-readable storage medium 114(CRM) to cause end-user device 102 to perform operations or implement various device functions. In some cases, processor 112 is associated with a system on chip (SoC) implemented as a general purpose processor (e.g., a multi-core Central Processing Unit (CPU)), an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), or other component in which the end-user device is integrated. The CRM 114 may include any suitable type of memory medium or storage medium, such as read-only memory (ROM), Programmable ROM (PROM), Random Access Memory (RAM), Dynamic RAM (DRAM), Static RAM (SRAM), or flash memory. In the context of this discussion, the CRM 114 of the end user device 102 is implemented as at least one hardware-based storage medium that does not include transitory signals or carriers. In some cases, the CRM 114 stores the firmware, operating system, and/or applications of the end-user device 102 as instructions, code, or other information. The instructions or code may be executed by the processor 112 to implement various functions of the end user device 102, such as those related to beamforming, beamforming training, resource utilization, network access, and so forth. In this example, the CRM 114 stores processor executable instructions or code to implement a beamforming enhancement module 116 or a beamforming training module 118 of the end user device 102.
The communication unit 120 of the end-user device 102 may include an antenna, a receiver, a transmitter, a baseband processor, and associated circuitry or other components (not shown) for communicating with the base station 104 via a wireless signal propagation medium (e.g., air). For example, the communication unit 120 may send data or control information to the base station 104 via the uplink 108 via a transmitter. The data or control information sent to the base station 104 may include any suitable type of framed or packetized information, such as device state information, radio link control information, data requests, data, network access requests, channel quality indications, and so forth. The communication unit 120 may also receive data or control information, such as radio link configuration settings, network control information, resource grants, data traffic, etc., from the base station 104 via the receiver.
In fig. 1, base station 104 is depicted generally as a cellular base station of a wireless network (not separately shown). Using a wireless network, the base station 104 may enable or provide access to other networks or resources, such as a network 132 (e.g., the internet) connected via a wired network interface portion of the communication unit 130 and a backhaul link 134 (e.g., a fiber optic network). Base station 104 may be implemented to implement or manage at least one cell in a wireless network that includes a plurality of other base stations, each implementing other respective cells of the wireless network. As such, the base station 104 may communicate with a network management entity or other base stations to coordinate connection or handover of end user devices within or across cells of the wireless network. The base station 104 may be configured as any suitable type of base station or network management node, such as a global system for mobile communications (GSM) base station, a node base station (node B) transceiver station (e.g., for UMTS), an evolved node B (eNB, e.g., for LTE), a next generation node B (gNB, e.g., for 5G), and so on. As such, the base station 104 may control or configure parameters of the uplink 108 or downlink 110 in accordance with one or more of the wireless standards or protocols identified herein.
In an example embodiment, the base station 104 includes at least one processor 122, one or more computer-readable storage media 124, and at least one communication unit 130. The processor 122 may execute processor-executable instructions or code stored by the computer-readable storage medium 124(CRM) to perform operations or implement various base station functions. In some cases, processor 122 is implemented as a plurality of processor cores or multi-core processors configured to execute the firmware or operating system of base station 104 and any applications thereof. CRM 124 may include any suitable type of memory medium or storage medium, such as ROM, PROM, RAM, DRAM, SRAM, or flash memory. In the context of this discussion, CRM 124 is implemented as at least one hardware-based storage medium that does not include transient signals or carriers. The CRM 124 of the base station 104 may store the firmware, operating system, or application of the base station as instructions, code, or other information. The instructions or code may be executed by the processor 122 to implement various functions of the base station 104, such as managing connections or parameters with the wireless link 106 of the end user device 102. In this example, the CRM 124 also stores processor-executable instructions or code to implement a beamforming enhancement module 126 and a beamforming training module 128 of the base station 104.
In some aspects, a resource manager (not shown) of the base station 104 may be implemented to perform various functions associated with allocating physical access resource units (e.g., resource blocks or resource elements) or communication resources available to the base station 104. Physical access resources, such as air interface resources available to the base station 104, may be partitioned or divided into various resource units (e.g., frames or blocks) of bandwidth, time span, carrier or frequency band, symbols, and so forth. For example, within the framework of the LTE standard, the resource manager may allocate the accessed spectrum and time intervals in resource blocks, each of which may be fully or partially allocated to one or more end user devices in communication with the base station 104.
The resource manager may also communicate the identity of the allocated resource units for communication to the end user equipment 102 via the uplink 108 or the downlink 110. The identification may include one or both of a frequency band or a time location of a respective resource block or element of the allocated resource unit. The frequency band or time location may be effective to enable the end user device 102 to communicate via the allocated resource units in a pattern or manner as described herein. In such a case, each indication in the allocated resource units may be transmitted from the base station 104 to the end user equipment 102 as part of, for example, a Radio Resource Control (RRC) message or a Downlink Control Information (DCI) message.
The communication unit 130 of the base station 104 may include an antenna, a receiver, a transmitter, a baseband processor, and associated circuitry or other components (not shown) for communicating with the end user devices 102 via a wireless signal propagation medium. In some cases, the communication unit 130 includes or is coupled to a plurality of transceivers and antenna arrays configured to establish and manage a plurality of wireless links with respective ones of a plurality of end user devices (e.g., according to a massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) implementation). Base station 104 may transmit any suitable data or control information to end user equipment 102 (or other devices) over downlink 110, such as scheduling of allocated resource units, data traffic, radio link state information, radio link control information, and so forth.
Fig. 2 illustrates an example wireless system 200 in which end user devices 102 and base stations 104 can communicate in accordance with one or more aspects described herein. The wireless system 200 includes respective instances of the end user device 102 and the base station 104. The base station 104 provides the portion of the wireless network with which the end user device 102 may be associated to enable the exchange of wireless communications 202. The wireless system 200 may include other base stations, network management entities, etc. (not shown) to provide a wireless Wide Area Network (WAN), such as an LTE network or a 5G network that provides related data services.
The end user device 102 and/or the base station 104 may communicate using at least one wireless communication 202 through any suitable type of channel, message exchange, or network management procedure, or combination thereof. As shown, each communication 202 may include an UL communication 202U from the end user device 102 to the base station 104 or a DL communication 202D (or both-e.g., a UL/DL pair) from the base station 104 to the end user device 102. UL communication 202U may include an uplink data channel and/or an uplink control channel, some examples of which are shown at the top left of fig. 2. Similarly, DL communication 202D may include a downlink data channel and/or a downlink control channel, some examples of which are shown in the upper right-hand corner of fig. 2. Alternatively, wireless communication 202 may include DL communication 202D and UL communication 202U. Further, UL and DL communications of wireless communication 202 may be related, such as by being exchanged between the same two electronic devices or by being adjacent to each other.
The end user equipment 102 may transmit data to the base station 104 via a Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) 202U-2. PUSCH 202U-2 may include Radio Resource Control (RRC) communications, Uplink Control Information (UCI) messages, application data, and so on. PUSCH 202U-2 is typically the channel on which end user equipment 102 transmits application data to base station 104. Another example channel of UL communication 202U is a Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) 202U-3. Using PRACH 202U-3, the end user equipment 102 may conduct non-synchronous transmissions to the base station 104.
The base station 104 may transmit control information to the end user equipment 102 via a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) 202D-1. PDCCH 202D-1 can be used by base station 104 to transmit Downlink Control Information (DCI) and/or Radio Resource Control (RRC) information to end user equipment 102. In some scenarios, the DCI includes an identification of resource units (e.g., resource blocks or resource elements) used to transmit data to the end user equipment 102. The DCI may also include a modulation scheme and coding/decoding information for end user device 102 to access data transmitted to end user device 102.
The base station 104 may transmit data to the end user device 102 via a Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) 202D-2. Thus, PDSCH 202D-2 is typically the channel on which the base station 104 transmits application data to the end user device 102. Alternatively or additionally, the base station 104 may send information to the end user device 102 via a Physical HARQ Indicator Channel (PHICH) 202D-3. The PHICH 202D-3 may include an Acknowledgement (ACK) or a non-acknowledgement (NACK) for data received from the end user equipment 102 via the PUSCH 202U-2. Another example channel of DL communication 202D is Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH) 202D-4. Using the PCFICH 202D-4, the base station 104 may inform the end user device 102 of the format of the signal being received.
The terminology used with reference to fig. 2, e.g., UL communication 202U and DL communication 202D, relates to at least the LTE standard. However, as used herein, the terminology of these particular channels and other particular standards (e.g., Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) or Downlink Control Indicator (DCI)), the corresponding underlying concepts, and similar techniques are not limited to wireless systems or devices that conform to the 4G standard. Rather, these terms may be used as shorthand for referring to underlying physical principles or similar general wireless system technologies. Furthermore, embodiments described herein may additionally or alternatively relate to other wireless standards, specifications, and techniques, including other existing and future standards (e.g., 5G NR) affiliated with 3 GPP.
Fig. 3 shows an example of air interface resources 302 extending between an end user device 102 and a base station 104. The air interface resources 302 may be strategically utilized to enhance antenna beamforming as described herein. The air interface resource 302 may be divided into resource elements 312, each occupying some intersection of frequency spectrum and elapsed time. Portions of air interface resource 302 are illustrated graphically in a grid or matrix having a plurality of resource blocks 304, the resource blocks 304 including resource blocks 304-1, 304-2, 304-3 … 304-n, where "n" represents some positive integer. Thus, an example of a resource unit 312 includes at least one resource block 304. As shown, time is depicted along the horizontal dimension as the abscissa axis, and frequency is depicted along the vertical dimension as the ordinate axis. The air interface resources 302 defined by a given communication protocol or standard may span any suitable specified frequency range and/or may be divided into intervals of any specified duration. The increment of time may correspond to, for example, milliseconds (ms). The increments in frequency may correspond to megahertz (MHz), for example.
In general example operation, base station 104 allocates portions of air interface resources 302 (e.g., resource elements 312) for UL and DL wireless communications 202. Each resource block 304 of network access resources may be allocated to support respective wireless communications 202 for a plurality of end user devices 102. In the lower left corner of the grid, resource block 304-1 may span a specified communication range 308 as defined by a given communication protocol and may include multiple subcarriers. Resource block 304-1 may include any suitable number of subcarriers (e.g., 12) that each correspond to a respective portion (e.g., 15kHz) of a specified frequency range 308 (e.g., 180 kHz). Resource block 304-1 may also span a specified time interval 306 or slot (e.g., lasting approximately one-half millisecond or 7 Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols), as defined by a given communication protocol. Time intervals 306 comprise sub-intervals that may each correspond to a symbol, such as an OFDM symbol. As shown in fig. 3, each resource block 304 may include a plurality of resource elements 310 (REs) corresponding to or defined by the subcarriers of the frequency range 308 and the subintervals (or symbols) of the time interval 306. Alternatively, a given resource element 310 may span more than one frequency subcarrier or symbol. Thus, a resource unit 312 may include at least one resource block 304, at least one resource element 310, and so on.
In an example embodiment, a plurality of end user devices 102 (one of which is shown) communicate with the base station 102 through access provided by portions of the air interface resources 302. A resource manager (not shown in fig. 3) may determine a respective type or amount of information (e.g., data or control information) to be communicated (e.g., sent) by the end user device 102. For example, the resource manager may determine that each end-user device 102 will transmit a different respective amount of information. The resource manager then allocates one or more resource blocks 304 to each end user device 102 based on the determined amount of information.
In addition to or instead of block-level resource grants, the resource manager may allocate resource units at the element level. Thus, the resource manager may allocate one or more resource elements 310 or individual subcarriers to different end user devices 102. By doing so, one resource block 304 may be allocated to facilitate network access for multiple end user devices 102. Thus, the resource manager may allocate one or up to all subcarriers or resource elements 310 of a resource block 304 to one end user device 102 or split across multiple end user devices 102 at various granularities to achieve higher network utilization or increased spectral efficiency.
Thus, the resource manager may allocate air interface resources 302 by resource blocks 304, frequency carriers, time intervals, resource elements 310, frequency subcarriers, time subintervals, symbols, spreading codes, some combination thereof, and so forth. Based on the respective allocations of resource units, the resource manager can send respective messages to the end-user devices 102 indicating the respective allocations of resource units to each device. Providing an indication of the allocated resource units is further described below with reference to fig. 5. Each message may enable the respective end user device 102 to queue information or configure the communication unit 120 to communicate via the allocated resource units of the air interface resource 302. For example, end user device 102 can prepare an antenna beamformer to direct signal beams back to base station 104. To this end, the end user device 102 may train the beamformer in response to receiving signals transmitted from the base station 104.
Fig. 4 shows an exemplary beamforming scenario 400 including a transmitting device 424 and a receiving device 426. The transmitting device 424 comprises an example of a communication unit 402, the communication unit 402 being configured to implement antenna beamforming to generate a plurality of signal beams 416. As shown, the communication unit 402 is transmitting four signal beams 416-1, 416-2, 416-3, and 416-4; however, more or fewer signal beams 416 may be generated. The plurality of signal beams 416 are formed such that a first signal beam 416-1 extends farther than the other signal beams. In addition, the communication unit 402 directs the first signal beam 416-1 in a direction towards the receiving device 426.
In some cases, the end user device 102 (e.g., of fig. 1-3) serves as the transmitting device 424 and the base station 104 serves as the receiving device 426. In other cases, the base station 104 serves as the transmitting device 424 and the end user device 102 serves as the receiving device 426. Thus, in the former case, the communication unit 402 corresponds to the communication unit 120 of the end user equipment 102, whereas in the latter case, the communication unit 402 corresponds to the communication unit 130 of the base station 104.
The communication unit 402 is configured to transmit information 410 (e.g., data or control information) or receive information 410. The communication unit 402 includes a baseband (BB) portion 404, a transceiver 406 (e.g., a transmitter or receiver), and an RF front end (RFFE) 408. The RFFE 408 includes a plurality of antennas 412-1, 412-2.. 412-n, where "n" represents some positive integer. The plurality of antennas 412 may collectively form an antenna array, or each antenna 412 may include a plurality of antenna elements that function as an array. RF signals transmitted from different ones of the multiple antennas 412 combine constructively and destructively at different physical or geospatial locations to create multiple signal beams 416 that provide different spatial patterns of the resulting signal beams 416. In addition to direction, each signal beam 416 may have a different height, shape along the beam, width, shape of incidence on the earth's surface, length, and so forth.
In general, baseband section 404 includes at least one baseband processor to modulate or apply information 410 to a baseband signal. The transceiver 406 includes one or more low pass filters and processes the baseband signal using at least one mixer to up-convert or down-convert the frequency. In addition to the multiple antennas 412, the RFFE 408 includes one or more band pass filters. The RFFE 408 also includes one or more Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) for receiving signals and one or more Power Amplifiers (PAs) for transmitting signals. The transceiver 406 or the RFFE 408 may include one or more phase shifters to delay a signal in time or change its phase.
The communication unit 402 generates different patterns of signal beams 416 by adjusting one or more beamforming parameters 418. The beamforming parameters 418 may also be referred to as weights. The beamforming parameters 418 establish a different amplitude 420, phase 422, etc. for each version of the signal provided to one of the plurality of antennas 412. By varying the aspect of the signal emanating from the plurality of antennas 412, the manner in which the RF signals interact and the geospatial location vary, thereby producing different signal beam patterns.
The beamforming parameters 418 may be implemented at any portion of the communication unit 402. For example, the baseband section 404 may implement the beamforming parameters 418 using pre-coding at the baseband processor. The transceiver 406 or the RFFE 408 may implement the beamforming parameters 418 using, for example, phase shifters to shift the phase of one signal version relative to the phase of the other signal version. Alternatively, a hybrid approach may be implemented in which the beamforming parameters 418 are established partially at the baseband portion 404 and partially at the transceiver 406 or the RFFE 408.
As shown in fig. 4, the receiving device 426 also includes a Communication Unit (CU) 402. Thus, the receiving device 426 may use the communication unit 402 to transmit or receive beamformed signals. Furthermore, although the communication units 402 of the transmitting device 424 are described above primarily in terms of transmitting signal beams 416-1, each communication unit 402 may also receive signals using antenna beamforming. In other words, the inverse beamforming process may be implemented by the receiving device 426. To this end, the communication unit 402 at the receiving device 426 receives multiple RF signals at multiple antennas 414 and processes the multiple RF signals using different beamforming parameters 418 until a received signal beam 416 with a sufficiently strong signal is detected.
This process of searching for beamforming parameters 418 that are acceptable for at least the receive signal beam 416 is referred to as training the communication unit 402 to receive the signal beam 416 or training the beamformer. Beamforming training may be implemented by beamforming training module 118 (of fig. 1) of end user device 102 or beamforming training module 128 (of fig. 1) of base station 104. Because the RF propagation is at least partially mutual in nature, the beamforming parameters 418 determined as part of the receive operation at the receiving device 426 may also be used for transmission. In other words, the beamforming parameters 418 that facilitate receiving a signal beam 416 from one device may then be used to transmit another signal beam 416 back to the device. Similarly, beamforming parameters 418 that have been confirmed to facilitate transmission may be used for reception.
Thus, the antenna beamforming hold beamformer warms up (e.g., is prepared with the most recently determined beamforming parameters 418) for subsequent reception during transmission, and warms up for subsequent transmission during reception. Thus, by maintaining the current beamforming parameters 418 to keep the beamformer warm, latency may be reduced and the use of useless, inefficient transmission and reception may be reduced. This is especially true if the transmitting or receiving device is moving, or the signal propagation channel is otherwise changing rapidly. Thus, strategic resource utilization as described herein can be used to enhance beamforming by helping to keep the beamformer warm-up when channel conditions change or when the location of at least one device that is the communicating party moves.
Example schemes, devices and assemblies
Fig. 5 illustrates an example environment 500 in which beamforming enhancements via policy resource utilization can be implemented in accordance with an air interface signaling protocol 502. As shown, the base station 104 includes a beamforming enhancement module 126 and the plurality of end user devices 102 each include a beamforming enhancement module 116. In some embodiments, both beamforming enhancement module 116 and beamforming enhancement module 126 operate according to air interface signaling protocol 502 or otherwise adhere to air interface signaling protocol 502. The air interface signaling protocol 502 specifies procedures, specifications, operating parameters, techniques, timing, etc. that enable the end user device 102 and the base station 104 to implement beamforming enhancements, either individually or collectively, via strategic resources as described herein. In an example operation, the base station 104 allocates resource units 312 (e.g., resource blocks 304 or resource elements 310) from air interface resources 302 to a plurality of end user devices 102 to produce allocated resource units 504, at least in part according to an air interface signaling protocol 502. The base station 104 sends an indication 506 of the allocated resource units 504 to the plurality of end user equipments 102.
In an example embodiment, air interface resources 302 are strategically utilized by allocating frequency-time resource elements 312 to keep the beamformers in end user equipment 102 and/or base station 104 "warm up". In other words, the beamforming enhancement module 126 grants the allocated resource elements 504 from the air interface resources 302 to the plurality of end user devices 102 to keep the beamforming parameters 418 (of fig. 4) current-e.g., determined sufficiently recently to enable the parameters to be reused for subsequent wireless communications. To this end, the beamforming enhancement module 116 and the beamforming enhancement module 126, either individually or collectively, implement the air interface signaling protocol 502 to provide an opportunity to train a beamformer at the end user device 102 or the base station 104.
Fig. 6 illustrates an example beamforming enhancement module 126 of a base station 104 for implementing beamforming enhancement via strategic resource utilization, generally at 600. The beamforming enhancement module 126 may include one or more of the illustrated modules or rules. Each individual module or set of rules may comprise instructions or code stored in at least one computer-readable storage memory and executable by one or more processors. The modules or rule sets may be distributed across different memories and/or executed by one or more processors.
As shown, the beamforming enhancement module 126 includes an activity level determination module 602, a beamforming state classification module 604, and a resource allocation module 606. The beamforming enhancement module 126 further includes one or more classification rules 608, at least one end user device-to-beamforming state correspondence table 610, and one or more resource allocation rules 612. Example operations of the activity level determination module 602 and the beamforming state classification module 604, as well as the classification rules 608 and the EUD-to-beamforming state correspondence table 610, are described below with reference to fig. 7. Exemplary operations of resource allocation module 606 and resource allocation rules 612 are described below with reference to fig. 8-11.
Fig. 7 illustrates an example scheme 700 for classifying end user devices 102 into a beamforming state 702 based on a determined activity level 704. In fig. 7, a plurality of end user devices 102 are associated with a base station 104. Each end user device 102 has a respective activity level 704 with respect to the base station 104. In an example embodiment, the activity level determination module 602 determines a respective activity level 704 for each respective end user device 102. The activity level 704 may correspond to: for example, the frequency at which the wireless communication is transmitted or received (e.g., the frequency of the wireless communication), how much data is exchanged between the respective end user equipment 102 and the base station 104 per unit time (e.g., the communication bandwidth), how many resource blocks or other elements of the air interface resource 302 (e.g., of fig. 3 and 5) allocated to the respective end user equipment 102 within a given recent time period, how much time has occurred since the allocation of portions of the air interface resource to the respective end user equipment 102 for data UL or DL traffic, some combination thereof, and so forth. The activity level 704 may be based at least in part on, for example, a Radio Resource Control (RRC) state (e.g., idle/disconnected, connected, or inactive (but connected)). In some embodiments, the determination of different activity levels for respective end user devices 102 focuses on activities that utilize beamforming (e.g., by prioritizing wireless communication implemented using antenna beamforming, or by excluding any wireless communication implemented without using antenna beamforming).
Based on the determined respective activity level 704 and one or more classification rules 608, the beamforming state classification module 604 classifies each respective end user device 102 into a beamforming state 702. The classification rules 608 may identify, for example, different beamforming states 702 to which the end user device 102 may be classified. Additionally or alternatively, the classification rule 608 may specify an activity level threshold (e.g., in terms of bits per second, an average number of resource blocks, a total number of discrete wireless communication events within a certain time period, or an average duration between successive radios) that corresponds to or is delineated among different beamforming states 702. The classification rules 608 may also specify various activity types corresponding to different beamforming states 702. Examples of activity types include control traffic versus data traffic, continuous communications versus sporadic/intermittent communications, and so on.
An example set of beamforming states 702 includes: an active beamforming state 702-1, an idle beamforming state 702-2, and an inactive beamforming state 702-3. The active beamforming state 702-1 corresponds to the time when UL or DL traffic is currently ongoing. For example, end user device 102 may currently be engaged in a voice call or streaming video. One example analogy to this state is a vehicle traveling using a conventional internal combustion engine that ignites at high Revolutions Per Minute (RPM). The idle beamforming state 702-2 corresponds to when UL or DL traffic is not occurring periodically but other future traffic is still possible. For example, the end user device 102 may experience an interruption or some delay period between downloading social media updates. An analogy to this situation is a vehicle idling at a traffic light. The engine is not operating at high RPM, but the engine remains running to keep it warm and ready to provide power.
The inactive beamforming state 702-3 corresponds to a time when there is no recent UL or DL wireless communication. The classification rule 608 may specify a time span defined to be the most recent for assigning the inactive beamforming state. If the end user device 102 is in the inactive beamforming state 702-3, the most recent beamforming information is typically not known. An analogy to this situation is a vehicle that is parked with the engine off. In general, to leave the inactive beamforming state 702-3, two-way beamforming training is performed to determine current beamforming parameters 418 for both sides of the wireless communication. However, the beamforming states 702 may be defined, numbered, or organized differently than these three examples. Furthermore, from an application layer perspective, the end user device 102 may have more knowledge of how the device is being used. Accordingly, the end user device 102 may send a message to the base station 104 indicating the desired future activity level or type. Additionally or alternatively, the active beamforming state 702-1 and the idle beamforming state 702-2 may correspond to other levels of activity of the end user device 102. For example, idle beamforming state 702-1 may correspond to an idle state in which the end user device is going to sleep or enter a low power mode.
Using the determined activity level 704 and the classification rules 608, the beamforming state classification module 604 associates each end user device 102 with a device-classified beamforming state 702. The beamforming state classification module 604 stores these associations in the EUD-to-beamforming state correspondence table 610. For example, each end user device 102 may have a respective entry that includes an indication of the corresponding beamforming state 702. Alternatively, the group of beamforming states corresponding to a given beamforming state 702 may list a plurality of end user devices 102 that have been classified into that given beamforming state 702. However, the EUD-to-beamforming state correspondence table 610 may be implemented in alternative ways.
Accordingly, the beamforming state classification module 604 classifies each end user device 102 into a beamforming state 702. Those end user devices 102 that are classified to the same beamforming state 702 may be combined into a group of beamforming states for control or allocation purposes. For example, resource allocation module 606 (e.g., of fig. 6) may allocate resource units of air interface resource 302 to each member of a given group using the same or similar resource allocation rules 612. An example of an allocation process using one or more resource allocation rules 612 is described next.
Fig. 8 illustrates an example of resource allocation rules 612 for allocating resource elements 312 of air interface resources 302 to facilitate beamforming training, generally at 800. To illustrate each rule, frequency band 802 is depicted as part of air interface resources 302 (e.g., of fig. 3 and 5) as compared to a length of time. The resource allocation rules 612-1 to 612-3 as shown in fig. 8 relate to end user devices classified into the active beamforming state 702-1. With resource allocation rule 612-1, the allocation includes scheduling control communications and data communications on the same frequency band or bands for a given end user device. As shown, a control information allocation 804 and a data information allocation 806 corresponding to a given End User Device (EUD)102 are scheduled on at least one same frequency band 802. In other words, the resource allocation module 606 can schedule control and data on the same frequency tones for a given end user device. The rules provide an opportunity for the base station (e.g., the gNB) and the end user equipment (e.g., the UE) to learn the channel. In 3GPP terminology, this corresponds to scheduling, e.g., PUCCH, PDSCH, PHICH and PUSCH on the same frequency tones for each given end user equipment 102.
With resource allocation rule 612-2, scheduling includes granting DL resource allocations to a given end user device classified to an active beamforming state so as to precede UL resource allocations for the given end user device. As shown, DL resource allocation 808 is granted to a given end user device 102 so as to precede UL resource allocation 810 for the given end user device 102. In other words, for each UL grant (e.g., for outgoing data traffic) from the base station to the end user device, the resource allocation module 606 also provides a DL grant prior to the UL transmission and on the same tone or tones. This enables the end user equipment to train the beamformer on the DL portion of the UL/DL grant pair.
The content of the DL grant may include DL data information, DL control information (e.g., an indication of a UL grant or UL ACK/NACK), sounding transmissions, and the like. The DL grant may be implicit or explicit. In the case of explicit grants, the corresponding DL transmission may have a shorter duration, or frequency/time interleaving may be performed to cover the full frequency assignment of UL transmissions to facilitate beamforming training across the full assigned spectrum.
Using resource allocation rules 612-3, scheduling includes granting uplink resource allocation grants to a given end user device classified in an active beamforming state so as to precede downlink resource allocation for the given end user device. As shown, UL resource allocation 812 is granted to a given end user device 102 so as to precede DL resource allocation 814 for the given end user device 102. In other words, for each DL grant from the base station to the end user device (e.g., for data traffic that is arriving at the mobile device), the resource allocation module 606 also provides the UL grant prior to the DL transmission and on the same frequency tone or tones. This enables the end user equipment to train the beamformer on the UL part of the UL/DL grant pair.
The content of the UL grant may include UL data information, UL control information (e.g., measurement information or DL ACK/NACK), sounding transmission, and the like. The UL grant may be implicit or explicit. In the case of an explicit grant, the corresponding UL transmission may have a shorter duration or frequency/time interleaving may be performed to cover the entire frequency assignment of the DL transmission. The resource allocation rules 612-1 to 612-3 are described above in terms of being applied to end user devices 102 that have been classified into the active beamforming state 702-1 (of fig. 7). However, the resource allocation module 606 may also apply any one or more of these three rules to end user devices 102 that have been classified into the idle beamforming state 702-2.
The previous grant of DL resource allocation 808 is adjacent to the grant of UL resource allocation 810 as shown by resource allocation rule 612-2. Similarly, for resource allocation rule 612-3, the previous grant for UL resource allocation 812 is adjacent to the grant for DL resource allocation 814. As used in this context, two allocations for a given end user device may be adjacent to each other if one or more resource units disposed between the two allocations (if there are resource units so disposed) are not licensed to any other end user device. Alternatively, if there are no definable resource units (e.g., neither resource block 304 nor resource element 310) between the two allocations, the two allocations for a given end user device may be adjacent to each other. Here, the definable resource units may correspond to some resource blocks 304, resource elements 310, and so on.
Fig. 9 illustrates additional examples of resource allocation rules 612 for allocating resource elements 312 of air interface resources 302 to facilitate beamforming training, generally at 900. For each rule, frequency band 802 is depicted as having multiple resource allocations as part of air interface resources 302 as compared to a length of time. Each resource allocation may be identified as a wireless communication 902, including a first wireless communication 902-1 and a second wireless communication 902-2. In this context, each wireless communication 902 may include uplink transmissions, downlink transmissions, or both. In the upper half of fig. 9, the resource allocation rule 612-4a corresponds to the active beamforming state 702-1. In the lower half, resource allocation rule 612-4b corresponds to idle beamforming state 702-1.
With the resource allocation rule 612-4a, for a given end user device 102 classified into the active beamforming state 702-1, scheduling includes scheduling the wireless communication 902 to reoccur within a period of time that does not exceed the first time threshold 904-1. As shown, the second wireless communication 902-2 is scheduled to occur (e.g., begin or end) after an elapsed period of time that is not allowed to exceed the first time threshold 904-1 from the occurrence of the first wireless communication 902-1. Accordingly, the resource allocation module 606 allocates the second wireless communication 902-2 to not exceed the first time threshold 904-1 after the first wireless communication 902-1.
With the resource allocation rule 612-4b, for a given end user device 102 classified into the idle beamforming state 702-2, scheduling includes scheduling the wireless communication 902 to reoccur within a period of time that does not exceed the second time threshold 904-2. As shown, the second wireless communication 902-2 is scheduled to occur (e.g., begin or end) after an elapsed period of time that is not allowed to exceed the second time threshold 904-2 from the occurrence of the first wireless communication 902-1. Accordingly, the resource allocation module 606 allocates the second wireless communication 902-2 to not exceed the second time threshold 904-2 after the first wireless communication 902-1. These time thresholds 904 may be adjustable to account for channel conditions, cell congestion, and the like.
By adhering to a time threshold 904 that establishes a maximum time period between successive wireless communications 902, the resource allocation module 606 may keep the beamforming parameters 418 current. In some embodiments, the length of the time threshold 904 is different. For example, the first time threshold 904-1 corresponding to the active beamforming state 702-1 is implemented to be shorter than the second time threshold 904-2 corresponding to the idle beamforming state 702-2. For example, the first time threshold 904-1 may last X milliseconds and the second time threshold 904-2 may last Y milliseconds, where X is less than Y. This enables a trade-off between beam forming information recency and resource usage overhead. This makes the beamforming information relatively new for end user devices in the idle beamforming state 702-2, but with less overhead compared to the overhead for end user devices in the active beamforming state 702-1, for example. The length of X and Y, or the time separating two consecutive wireless communications 902 for a given end user device 102, may be set based on a number of factors. Including, for example, how much the channel is changing, how fast the beamforming parameters are changing, how close the signal beam is to be tracked, and so forth.
Fig. 10 illustrates generally at 1000 other examples of resource allocation rules 612 for allocating resource elements 312 of air interface resources 302 to facilitate beamforming training. The resource allocation rules 612-5 through 612-8 may be implemented individually or collectively. Each may provide other opportunities for beamforming training. For resource allocation rule 612-5, frequency band 802 is depicted as having multiple resource allocations as part of air interface resources 302, as compared to a certain length of time. Each resource allocation is identified as including control information for control information allocation 1002. In some embodiments, beamforming for control information may be independently configured by the beamforming enhancement module 126. With this scheme, the narrow subbands may enable most end user devices 102 to remain in an active beamforming state while having little data traffic. This keeps the nearest beamformer maintained so that it can quickly communicate with the user if appropriate. This scheme may alternatively be implemented with a wideband frequency control region.
With resource allocation rules 612-6, the beamforming enhancement module 116 controls the end user equipment 102 to transmit Sounding Reference Signals (SRS)1004 using at least one signal beam 416. For example, the beamforming enhancement module 116 may configure an antenna array comprising a plurality of antennas to generate the signal beam 416 that transmits the SRS 1004. SRS 1004 provides a (e.g., known) reference signal that base station 104 can use to analyze channel characteristics, such as channel quality, of the uplink from end user device 102. In some embodiments, SRS 1004 is beamformed based on DL wideband communication of cell-specific reference signals (CRS) or channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS).
With the resource allocation rule 612-7, the beamforming enhancement module 126 controls the base station 104 to transmit a null Downlink Control Indicator (DCI)1006 in the at least one signal beam 416. For example, if no other DL traffic is scheduled for transmission by the base station 104, the beamforming enhancement module 126 schedules a null (e.g., null, predetermined, fixed, or otherwise non-informational with respect to the downlink) DCI. In operation, the beamforming enhancement module 126 causes the base station 104 to emit one or more signal beams 416 including null DCI 1006.
With resource allocation rules 612-8, base station 104 balances UL flow 1010U with DL flow 1010D on each layer 1008. For example, the resource allocation module 606 (not shown in fig. 10) of the beamforming enhancement module 126 may be configured to balance the number of UL streams 1010U with the number of downlink streams 1010D on a per-layer basis based on the resource allocation rules 612-8. This scheme may produce, for example, the same number of UL streams 1010U and downlink streams 1010D as the number of layers 1008 employed. Thus, the UL and DL beams for each layer may train the corresponding beam for that layer 1008 in the other direction.
Fig. 11 shows an example of scheduling 1100 with multiple sample allocations for different end user devices for a portion of air interface resources. The scheduling example 1100 includes a subframe schedule 1102 and four allocation rows 1104. The subframe schedule 1102 depicts a plurality of alternating regions that indicate how air interface resources are allocated in time for each frequency range or row. These regions include a DL region 1106 and an UL region 1108. DL region 1106 is shaded in a dashed-line pattern and UL region 1108 is shaded in a cross-hatched pattern. These patterns are carried down into the dispense row 1104. The distribution rows 1104 include a first row to a fourth row, each indicated by a circled number. Each of the allocations of grants across four rows has a pattern indicating which user (1, 2, 3 or 4) is assigned to the uplink "UL" as compared to the downlink "DL" and a label indicating to which user the allocation has been granted.
In allocation row 1104, the resource allocation for four different users is depicted across the first, second and third rows. User 1 has primarily DL data traffic as shown in the first row. Thus, user 1 can share the frequency range of the first row with user 2, which has predominantly UL data traffic. User 3 has UL and DL data transmission as shown in the second row. The user 4 has mainly DL traffic and does not consume all resources of the third row. Thus, unused resource units are available in the third row. In some embodiments, all users transmit and receive control information in the DL and UL regions of the fourth row. In other embodiments, users 1-4 may exchange control information within the frequency range they use to transmit data traffic (e.g., in the first to third rows), but other users rely on the fourth row to exchange control information.
In the first row, an uplink grant "UL 1" also for user 1 precedes each downlink grant "DL 1" for user 1. Similarly, a downlink grant "DL 2" also for user 2 precedes each uplink grant "UL 2" for user 2. In the second row, user 3 does not share resources with another user, but consumes all frequency-time resource units. Thus, also the uplink grant "UL 3" for user 3 precedes each downlink grant "DL 3" for user 3, and the downlink grant "DL 3" for user 3 precedes each uplink grant "UL 3" for user 3. In the third row, an uplink grant "UL 4" also for user 4 precedes each downlink grant "DL 4" for user 4. The empty space in the third row represents unallocated resource units for the frequency range at a particular time.
Having generally described schemes and apparatus for beamforming enhancement via strategic resource utilization, the discussion now turns to an example approach.
Example method
Example methods are described below with reference to various flow diagrams. These methods involve beamforming enhancements via strategic resource utilization. Aspects of the methods may be implemented, for example, in hardware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry or a general purpose processor), firmware, or some combination thereof. The techniques may be implemented using one or more of the electronic devices or components shown in fig. 1-11 or fig. 13 (electronic device 1300 is described below in fig. 13), which may be further divided, combined, etc. The electronic devices and components of these figures generally represent firmware, hardware, IC chips, circuits, or a combination thereof. Thus, these figures illustrate some of the many possible systems or devices capable of implementing the described techniques.
The order in which the operations are illustrated and/or described with respect to these flow diagrams is not intended to be construed as a limitation. Any number or combination of the described method operations can be combined in any order to implement a method or an alternative method. Further, the described operations may be implemented in a fully or partially overlapping manner. Fig. 12 illustrates an example method at flow diagram 1200 for implementing beamforming enhancements via policy resource utilization. Flow diagram 1200 includes five operations 1202-1210.
At 1202, communications with a plurality of end user devices are monitored. For example, an electronic device (e.g., base station 104) may monitor wireless communications 202 with a plurality of end user devices 102. For example, the activity level determination module 602 can track wireless communications 202 using at least one respective signal beam 416 that occur between the base station 104 and each respective end user device 102.
At 1204, based on the monitoring, a respective activity level for each of the plurality of end user devices is determined. For example, the base station 104 may determine a respective activity level 704 for each end user device 102 of the plurality of end user devices 102 based on the monitoring. To this end, activity level determination module 602 may calculate how often or for how long each respective end user device 102 communicates with base station 104 using signal beam 416 to produce a respective activity level 704.
At 1206, each end user device of the plurality of end user devices is classified into a beamforming state of a plurality of beamforming states based on the respective determined activity level of each end user device. For example, the electronic device may classify each end user device 102 of the plurality of end user devices 102 into a beamforming state 702 of the plurality of beamforming states 702 based on the respective determined activity level 704 of each end user device 102. To perform the classification, the beamforming state classification module 604 may assign a beamforming state 702 (e.g., active, idle, or inactive beamforming states 702-1, 702-2, or 702-3, respectively) to each end user device 102 based on the respective corresponding activity level 704 using one or more classification rules 608.
At 1208, resource elements from the air interface resource are allocated to each of at least some of the plurality of end user devices based on the beamforming state to which the end user device is classified. For example, the base station 104 may allocate resource units 312 from the air interface resources 302 to each of at least some of the plurality of end user devices 102 based on the beamforming state 702 into which the end user device 102 is classified. The allocation may be performed by resource allocation module 606 applying one or more resource allocation rules 612 to grant resource units 312 for uplink or downlink communications in a manner that provides opportunities for beamforming training between end user equipment 102 and base station 104. The resource allocation rules 612 may depend on the corresponding beamforming state 702.
At 1210, an indication of the allocated resource units is sent to the portion of the plurality of end user devices. For example, the base station 104 may transmit an indication 506 of the allocated resource units 504 to the portion of the plurality of end user devices 102. For example, the beamforming enhancement module 126 or resource manager module (not shown) may cause the base station 104 to transmit one or more signal beams 416 with corresponding resource allocation indications 506 from the communication unit 402 to those end user devices 102 that have been classified into the active beamforming state 702-1 or the idle beamforming state 702-2.
