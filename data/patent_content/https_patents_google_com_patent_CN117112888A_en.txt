Description
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates generally to computer systems. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to automatically generating an immersive interface for a distributed computing device via a computer network and internet service.
Background
Global production of over 250 gigabytes of data per day. Technology providers store hundreds of gigabytes of content that users can access via internet search engines and other tools. In addition, users perform more than 50 hundred million searches worldwide per day to query and access various forms of content. Most of this information exists in long text forms with little or no accompanying visual or audio content.
Content curation (curation) generally refers to the collection of information related to a particular topic and the selection, organization, and presentation of such information in an interesting and meaningful way. Content curation is a time-consuming process requiring specific skills and specialized software. Furthermore, existing methods of content curation are expensive, typically consider only a small portion of the available content, and quickly become outdated in view of the ever-increasing amount of new information generated per day. Furthermore, most content is not available in different formats, languages, and interfaces that may benefit various users around the world.

In general, the present disclosure is directed to an extensible pipeline for automatically generating content associated with a live event. In particular, the techniques described in this disclosure are capable of automatically generating multimedia stories of live events in real-time for a large number of users in a scalable manner. To do so, the content generation system may automatically request media data (e.g., one or more media assets) associated with a particular live event (e.g., a sporting event, a political election, etc.). The content generation system may receive media data and select one or more page templates from a plurality of possible page templates based at least in part on the received media data. The content generation system may automatically customize media data for one or more groups of users (e.g., users grouped by country of residence, user interest data, user language, etc.). The content generation system may use the selected one or more page templates and the customized media data to generate one or more content pages associated with the live event. The content generation system may provide one or more user devices with access to one or more content pages via a computer network.
For example, the content generation system may provide content of a live sporting event to a user. To do so on a large scale, the content generation system may periodically request data associated with the live event from the provided media data. The media data provider may provide media data (e.g., one or more media assets or one or more pieces of media content) associated with the live event, including but not limited to images, text, video, and audio. In response to the request, the content generation system may receive media data from a media provider. Based on the type of media data and the amount of media data received, the content generation system may select one or more page templates. For example, the media data may include one or more images of highlights within a live sporting event as well as text describing those images. The content generation system may customize media data by translating text into multiple languages. The content generation system may use the customized media data and the selected page template to generate a plurality of content pages. The generated page may be stored on a web server for transmission to the user device upon request.
More specifically, the content generation system may be executed by a server computing system that provides information about live events as a service to a user computing device. Given the large number of users that may wish to access data about a particular live event at any particular time, the content generation system may generate content (e.g., pages of content) that provides information about one or more aspects of the live event on a large scale and in real-time (or pseudo-real-time).
In response to determining that content is required for a particular live event, the content generation system may access media data associated with the live event. In some examples, media data associated with a live event may include images, text, video, and any other media type.
In some examples, the content generation system may periodically generate queries for third party services while the live event is occurring. For example, if an olympic games is ongoing, the content generation system may generate a query every five minutes for a media server that provides media data about the olympic games. Such queries may be automatically generated when a live event is in progress. The query may include the particular live event for which the content generation system is generating content, and may specify the amount and type of media assets that the content generation system is requesting.
In some examples, the content generation system may generate the query in response to determining that a news valued live event is currently occurring. For example, the content generation system may monitor public social media feeds, public news sources, and other data. Based on the monitored data, the content generation system may determine that a news valued live event is currently occurring. Based on the determination, the configuration system may initiate a query to the media server based on the live event.
The content generation system may receive media data from a remote third party media content server. Based on the received media data, the content generation system may select one or more templates for generating the content page. For example, the content generation system may store a plurality of templates for generating content pages. Each template may describe a layout of one or more sub-portions, each of which may describe the type of media asset to be displayed, its size, and its particular location. In addition, the templates may describe which assets are in the foreground and which assets are in the background. Portions of the template may be partially or fully transparent.
Each template may be associated with a particular type of content, a particular live event, or a particular category of users. Thus, the templates may be selected based on available media data, the type of live event, the intended group of users, or several other factors. For example, if the received media data includes two images and descriptive text for the images, a first page template may be selected. If the media data includes video without text, a second page template may be used. Similarly, a particular template may be associated with presenting a score associated with a baseball game (e.g., listing the scoring situation by office), while another template may be used to present a score associated with an olympic race (listing the race times associated with multiple runners).
In some examples, media content may be customized for one or more user groups. A specific example of such customization may be the translation of written content into a plurality of different languages. In this way, content may be generated for different language groups by automatically translating any text within the media data for a particular language group. Thus, content pages can be automatically generated on a large scale for a large number of different user groups. In some examples, translating text between languages may result in different templates being used for different languages. For example, if the number of lines of text that describe a word varies between languages, the content generation system may select a more appropriate template for the different languages.
Once one or more templates are selected and the media content is customized, the content generation system may automatically generate one or more content pages. Each content page may include one or more pieces of media content and one or more lines of text (e.g., descriptive text for images, video, or audio). In some examples, multiple content pages may be combined into a multi-page content story. In this way, a particular live event may have a plurality of content pages associated therewith arranged in a particular order.
In some examples, the page template includes portions associated with images having certain characteristics (height, width, resolution, aspect ratio, etc.). In some examples, the image included in the received media data may have characteristics that do not exactly match the characteristics associated with the particular portion of the template. To successfully generate a content page based on the template, the content generation system may crop one or more images to match the size and/or aspect ratio indicated by the target page template.
To do so, the content generation system may select one or more candidate images in the media data. Each candidate image may be cropped based on characteristics associated with the target content data. For example, if the image is too long or too wide, the process removes a portion of the image. In other examples, portions of the image may be removed to match a particular aspect ratio.
In some examples, the content generation system may access metadata associated with each image. In some examples, the metadata may identify particular content in one or more portions of the image. For example, if a person is present in the image, the metadata may define the location of the person, the identity of the person in the image, the activity in which the person is participating, and so on. Similarly, if the image includes text, the metadata may determine where the text is and what the text says. The content generation system may filter the image to remove any image in which the cropping process results in the removal of a significant portion of the image. For example, if a portion of text is removed from an image such that it is no longer easily readable, the image may be removed from the candidate image. Similarly, if an important person or event in an image is partially obscured by cropping, the image may be removed from the candidate image list.
The content generation system may generate an aesthetic score for each remaining candidate image using a machine learning model. The candidate image with the highest aesthetic score may be selected for insertion into a portion of the target page template. In some examples, thumbnail images may be generated in this manner. A particular page may present multiple thumbnails of multiple different live event or content pages. The user may select a particular thumbnail to view an associated story, page, or live event.
In some examples, the content generation system may update existing content pages with media content. In this example, the content generation system may receive media data associated with an existing content page (e.g., an ongoing sporting event). In response to receiving the additional content, the content generation system may generate an additional content page for the existing multi-page story or remove the content from the existing content page and replace it with updated content.
In some examples, the content generation system may receive feedback from the user indicating that one or more content pages include incorrect information or content that does not match other media in the page. For example, if an image associated with a particular page does not match the descriptive text displayed with that page, the user may report this information to the content generation system. In response, the content generation system may remove one or more content pages from the content server such that it is not available to the user in the future.
In some examples, the content generation system may generate a content score for each content page (or multi-page story). In some examples, the content score may be based on the relative importance of the associated live event, the recency of the live event, the estimated user's interest in a particular content page, and so forth. In some examples, the target user group may be used to determine a content score for a particular content page. In this way, multiple content pages associated with one or more live events may be ranked such that they may be displayed to a user in order of estimated importance to the user. In some examples, the location associated with a particular user group may affect the ranking of content pages. For example, sports results associated with teams closer to a particular user group may be ranked higher than sports results of teams farther from the particular user group. In this way, the content score for a particular content page may be different based on the intended group of users. The user group may be determined based on location, nationality, language, user interests, etc.
In some examples, once the content generation system has generated a plurality of content pages and/or a plurality of multi-page stories, the content generation system may store the generated content in a cache. The cache may be used to provide content to users requesting information about a particular live event. In this way, the content generation system can retrieve the appropriate content page and/or multi-page story from the cache whenever the user requests content for a live event, without having to begin the page generation process again.
The systems, methods, and computer program products described herein provide a number of technical effects and benefits. As one example, embodiments described in this disclosure automatically request media data, customize the media data, and include it in a content page for more efficient and real-time presentation to users of live sporting events with less computing resources (e.g., less processing power, less memory usage, less power consumption, etc.), which would otherwise be wasted using manual investigation, creation, editing, and discovery processes.
Referring now to the drawings, example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in more detail.
FIG. 1 depicts an example computing system 100 according to an example embodiment of the disclosure. In some example embodiments, computing system 100 may be any suitable device including, but not limited to, a smart phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, server computing system, or any other computing device configured such that it may generate or present a content page to a user. Computing system 100 may include one or more processors 102, memory 104, one or more sensors 110, a page generation system 112, a page update system 120, a story generation system 122, a cache system 124, a ranking system 130, a template data store 234, and a content cache 150.
The one or more processors 102 may be any suitable processing device, such as a microprocessor, microcontroller, integrated circuit, or other suitable processing device. Memory 104 may include any suitable computing system or medium including, but not limited to, non-transitory computer readable media, RAM, ROM, hard disk drive, flash memory drive, or other memory device. The memory 104 may store information accessible by the one or more processors 102, including instructions 108 executable by the one or more processors 102. The instructions may be any set of instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors 102, cause the one or more processors 102 to provide the desired functionality.
In particular, in some devices, memory 104 may store instructions for implementing page generation system 112, page update system 120, story generation system 122, cache system 124, and ranking system 130. Computing system 100 may implement page generation system 112, page update system 120, story generation system 122, cache system 124, and ranking system 130 to perform aspects of the present disclosure, including accessing media data for live events, selecting pages and story templates for live events, customizing the media data, generating content pages and/or stories for live events, and providing the generated content pages to a user.
It will be appreciated that the term "system" or "engine" may refer to specialized hardware, computer logic executing on a more general purpose processor, or some combination thereof. Thus, the system or engine may be implemented in hardware, dedicated circuitry, firmware, and/or software which controls a general purpose processor. In one embodiment, the system may be implemented as program code files stored on a storage device, loaded into memory, and executed by a processor, or may be provided by a computer program product, such as computer-executable instructions, that are stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium (such as RAM, a hard disk, or an optical or magnetic medium).
The memory 104 may also include data 106, such as data associated with the page generation system 112 (e.g., data describing when media data is requested, what media data is requested, and how to generate a content page according to a template), the data 106 may be retrieved, manipulated, created, or stored by the one or more processors 102. In some example embodiments, such data may be accessed and used to perform particular functions associated with computing system 100.
In some example embodiments, computing system 100 includes page generation system 112, page update system 120, story generation system 122, cache system 124, and ranking system 130. Page generation system 112 can include a data request system 114, a template selection system 116, and a customization system 118. In some examples, page generation system 112 may also access data provided by template data store 234 and provide the generated pages/stories to cache system 124.
In some examples, page generation system 112 may use data request system 114 to periodically request data from a media data provider. In some examples, the media data provider may be a remote third party server that provides media data including images, video, audio, and text associated with a live event. For example, while a live sporting event is in progress, one or more media organizations may capture images, video, audio, and text regarding the sporting event and make these media assets available to requests on a media data server. In some examples, media assets may be ranked in order of importance. In some examples, a ranking of importance may be received from a third party media data provider. The data request system 114 may request data by automatically generating a query based on a periodic schedule. For example, if a sporting event is currently occurring, the data request system 114 may send a query to the data provider every five minutes. In some examples, the periodic schedule for automatically generating the query may be based on the type of event for which data is being requested.
In some examples, the data request system 114 may monitor one or more information sources to automatically determine when a news valued event is currently in progress. For example, the data request system 114 may monitor social media feeds to identify a currently occurring live event for which a content page should be generated. If based on social media data, the data request system 114 determines that a particular live event exceeds a threshold importance level, the data request system 114 may generate a query to be sent to a media provider (e.g., a media provider associated with the computing system 100 or a third party media provider).
In some examples, the query may include information specifying a particular live event of interest, date, time, event type, and one or more types of media content requested. For example, if an olympic games in summer is currently in progress, the request may include a particular event, date, time, and specify the image and associated descriptive text of the particular competitor being requested. In response, the remote media server may send media data to the data request system 114. The remote media server may send a certain number and type of media assets based on a particular amount included in the query. The remote media server may have metadata associated with each media asset and may prioritize the sending media assets based on importance or news value ranking. In some examples, the audio data may include a variety of different types of media content, including images, audio, video, and text.
In some examples, template selection system 116 may select one or more page templates (or story templates) from a plurality of pages and/or story templates stored in template data store 234. In some examples, the templates may be selected based on ranking heuristics. For example, a ranking heuristic may identify pages and/or story templates associated with a particular live event. In some examples, the ranking heuristics may rank the page templates based on the types and numbers of media assets available to the page generation system 112. Template data store 234 may include a plurality of page templates. Each page template may include data describing the location, size, and resolution of the media to be displayed in the user interface. Thus, as defined by the page template, a single page may represent one or more media assets arranged in a particular layout that are intended to be displayed together in a user interface of the device (e.g., a display of a smartphone, a display associated with a laptop, etc.). In some examples, a story template may represent a series of pages that are intended to be grouped or linked together. Using the story template, the page generation system 112 may provide the user with much more information than is available via a single page. In some examples, pages in the story may be ordered to present a narrative about the live event. For example, each page may represent a goal during the game in the order in which it was played, and each page includes one or more images of the goal and/or goal player. In this way, the story may relate to narrative information about a live event through a series of ordered content pages.
In some examples, the template selection system 116 may select one or more page templates for a particular event based on the priority of the factors. For example, a particular sports or event may have predetermined established templates that have been customized to more effectively display information associated with the sports live event. In addition, a particular live event may have a custom or specialized template that is intended to display information associated with the particular live event (e.g., having a common context associated with the event, or being customized to show particular data generated by the particular live event). For example, a live election may have a particular template or series of templates that have been customized to display the results of the election from a particular location.
In some examples, the template selection system 116 may select a template based on the amount and type of available media. For example, if a large number of media assets (e.g., pieces of media content) are available in the received media data, the template selection system 116 may have a large amount of flexibility in the particular templates it selects. However, if the number of media assets is limited, the templates that the template selection system 116 can select may be limited to only those templates that are sufficient for the existing media assets. In some examples, if only two images are available, the template selection system 116 cannot select any templates that require more than two images. In addition, if a particular template has a portion intended to include video media, the template may be selected only when video media is received from the media server. In some examples, the template selection system 116 may allow flexibility such that templates that do not exactly match the received media asset may be used. For example, if more images are needed that are available for a particular page template, the page generation system 112 may use generic images associated with a particular live event.
In some examples, template selection system 116 may select a template such that the amount of change in a particular story increases. Thus, if a particular template has been selected for one page in the story, the template selection system 116 may prioritize other templates when evaluating later pages. In this way, the generated story may be more visually interesting or attractive to the user.
The customization system 118 may customize the media data based on one or more requirements. For example, if the media data includes one or more portions of text, the customization system 118 may translate the text into a plurality of different languages. In some examples, text (e.g., descriptive text associated with an image) may require a different amount of space once it has been selected. As a result, once the text has been translated, the template selection system 116 may select a different template for one or more languages. For example, in some languages, the descriptive text may be capable of being represented in only two lines of text, while in another language, three lines may be required to present the associated descriptive text. Thus, a first template may be selected for languages requiring only two rows, while a second template may be selected for languages requiring three rows to display declarative text. Furthermore, different languages may require different formats (e.g., the direction in which text is read may be changed).
In some examples, media assets may be customized by altering one or more images or videos to fit within the space allocated by a particular page template. For example, if the space allocated for an image in a particular template is 100×100 pixels and the first image is 120×100 pixels, the customization system 118 may crop the first image so that it fits within the allocated region. In some examples, multiple images may potentially be able to be cropped to fit within a particular region. In this example, the customization system 118 may evaluate the image to determine the best image to crop for the template portion assigned to the image.
Customization system 118 may identify a plurality of candidate images (or other media) from within the received media data of a particular live event for a particular portion of the page template. The customization system 118 may then crop each potential image such that it matches the characteristics outlined by the metadata associated with the particular portion in the page template. Customization system 118 may then access the metadata for each image. Metadata may include information describing the content of the image (or other media), including the location and type of objects within the media, the location and identity of people within the media, and the location of any text within the media.
The customization system 118 may then evaluate each cropped image to determine whether the cropping process has removed any significant portions of the image. For example, if a portion of text is removed during cropping, the image may be removed from the candidate image list. Similarly, if an important person is removed or partially obscured, the image may be removed from consideration. In some examples, the significant portion of the image may be referred to as a salient portion of the image. Only images that retain all significant portions will be evaluated for potential inclusion in the generated page. Once the images have been filtered to remove any images that do not have all of their significant portions, the customization system 118 may use a machine learning model to generate aesthetic scores for the remaining candidate images. The machine learning model may be trained such that it imparts a high aesthetic score to images that are likely to be of interest to the user. For example, images that are in focus and frame interesting actions, important people, important information, etc. may receive a higher aesthetic score. The cropped image with the highest aesthetic score may be selected and used in a page generated based on the selected page template.
In some examples, customization system 118 may use the cropping process described above to generate one or more thumbnail images. Thumbnail images may be used to represent a particular story or event with very low resolution or detail. These images must be cropped and/or resized to fit into a page, which may have multiple different thumbnails for multiple different live events. In some examples, the customization system 118 may zoom in or out on the image (rather than crop the image) to fit into the space allocated for it. For example, a 200x200 pixel image may be scaled down to fit into a region of a 100x100 pixel image because the aspect ratio remains unchanged. In some examples, the metadata for a particular page template specifies the resolution required for a particular portion of the template. Customization system 118 may reduce or increase the resolution of a particular image so that it matches the criteria established by the page template.
In some examples, the image may be cropped based on the theme of the particular content page. For example, if a particular page is about a particular player in a game, one or more images may be cropped to highlight that player. Similarly, if the content page is associated with a particular story (e.g., accident, episode, or thing) during the event (e.g., kick a ball or penalty), the cropped image may be evaluated based on how much the cropped image represents the particular story.
In some examples, when an image is cropped to act as a thumbnail (e.g., an image representing a multi-page story or a group of stories), the image may be cropped to focus on popular topics. For example, if a particular athlete is trending on social media, the image may be cropped to include the particular athlete. The particular athlete may be different for different locations (e.g., countries) or interest groups. By including popular people, events, or items in the thumbnail, the page generation system can increase the likelihood that the user will access and/or view the associated multi-page story.
Once the appropriate media data has been received, one or more page templates have been selected and one or more pieces of media content have been customized, the page generation system 112 can generate a page based on the selected templates. For example, the page generation system 112 may identify the appropriate pieces of media content for each portion of the page defined in the media template. Pages with the selected pieces of media content in the appropriate portions may then be generated. As above, template data store 234 may also include a story template that is made up of multiple pages. In these examples, page generation system 112 can generate a plurality of content pages, each content page associated with a particular content page in the story template. One or more content pages may be linked together in a particular order to create a story.
In some examples, the generated pages may be stored in content cache 150 for distribution to multiple users. In some examples, the stored pages may be updated by page update system 120. For example, if the data request system 114 receives information associated with a live event with an existing page or story, rather than generating a new story or page, the page update system 120 may change or update relevant information in the existing page. For example, if the score of a particular sporting event changes, page update system 120 may use this information to update the appropriate fields in the page and/or story that have been generated.
Story generation system 122 may use the output of page generation system 112 and combine several generated pages into a single story. In some examples, the combination is based on information stored in a template associated with the story accessed from template data store 234. In some examples, a particular live event may be initially represented by the content of a single page. However, as additional information comes in, additional pages may be added to create a multi-page story. In general, a story may include several pages linked or otherwise connected in a particular order. In some examples, the user interface display includes interface elements that allow a user to easily switch between pages. For example, if a story is being displayed on a smartphone, each page may occupy the entire screen. Sliding left or right on the currently displayed page may change to the previous or next page in the story. In some examples, the display application may automatically transition to the next page in the story after a predetermined amount of time.
In some examples, the cache system 124 may store the generated pages and stories, and the content cache 150 may retrieve the generated pages and stories from the content cache 150 as needed. Because if a user requests information about a particular live event, computer system 100 may use cache system 124 to access pages that have been generated in content cache 150. In this way, the content page need only be generated once and retrieved by the cache system for transmission to multiple users interested in a particular live event.
In some examples, computing system 100 uses ranking system 130 to organize the generated pages in an order of potential interest to the user. In this way, the application at the user device may present a series of pages and/or stories to the user in an order in which the user will be most interested. For example, content pages and/or stories may be ranked according to location. Thus, live events that occur near a user may be ranked higher than live events that occur far from the user. In some examples, the user interests may be represented in a user profile. The user profile may then be used to rank the pages based on the live event that the user will be most interested in. In some examples, users are grouped into groups based on nationality, language, particular teams, or organizations of interest to the user (e.g., clubs or fan-ups), and so forth. Ranking system 130 may generate a ranking tailored to a particular group. In some examples, the ranking given to a particular live event and its associated page may decay over time such that the further in time the event becomes less important.
Fig. 2 depicts an example client-server system environment 200, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. The client-server system environment 200 includes one or more user computing devices 202 and a server computing system 230. One or more communication networks 220 may interconnect these components. The communication network 220 may be any of a variety of network types, including a local area network (local area network, LAN), wide area network (wide area network, WAN), wireless network, wired network, the internet, personal area network (personal area network, PAN), or a combination of these networks.
User computing device 202 may include, but is not limited to, smart phones, smart watches, exercise bands, navigation computing devices, laptop computers, and embedded computing devices (computing devices integrated into other objects such as clothing, carriers, or other objects). In some examples, the user computing device 202 may include one or more sensors intended to collect information having user permissions associated with the user computing device 202.
In some examples, the user computing device 202 may be connected to another computing device, such as a personal computer (personal computer, PC), laptop, smart phone, tablet, mobile phone, wearable computing device, or any other electronic device capable of communicating with the communication network 220. The user computing device 202 may include one or more applications 212, such as a search application, a communication application, a navigation application, a productivity application, a gaming application, a word processing application, or any other application. The application(s) 212 may include a web browser. The user computing device 202 may use a web browser (or other application) to send requests to the server computing system 230 and to receive requests from the server computing system 230. The application(s) may include a web browser or other media application that may present media content in the form of generated pages or stories.
In some examples, the user computing device 202 may include one or more sensors that may be used to determine information associated with the environment of the user computing device 202 or information associated with the user of the user computing device 202 (such as the user's location or movement) under explicit permission of the user. In some examples, the sensors may include a motion sensor for detecting movement of the device or associated user, a location sensor (e.g., GPS) for determining a current location of the user computing device 202, an audio sensor for receiving control commands from the user, and so forth.
As shown in FIG. 2, the server computing system 230 may generally be based on a three-tier architecture, including a front-end tier, an application logic tier, and a data tier. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the relevant computer and internet related arts, each of the components shown in fig. 2 may represent a set of executable software instructions and corresponding hardware (e.g., memory and processor) for executing the instructions. To avoid unnecessary detail, various components and engines that are not germane to conveying an understanding of the various examples have been omitted from fig. 2. However, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that various additional components, systems, and applications may be used with a server computing system 230, such as that shown in FIG. 2, to facilitate additional functionality not specifically described herein. Furthermore, the various components depicted in FIG. 2 may reside on a single server computer or may be distributed across several server computers in various arrangements. Further, although the server computing system 230 is depicted in fig. 2 as having a three-tier architecture, the various example embodiments are in no way limited to such an architecture.
As shown in fig. 2, the front end may be comprised of interface system(s) 222, with the interface system(s) 222 receiving communications from one or more user computing devices 202 and communicating appropriate responses to the user computing devices 202. For example, interface system(s) 222 may receive requests in the form of hypertext transfer protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP) requests, or other web-based application programming interface (application programming interface, API) requests. The user computing device 202 may execute a conventional web browser application or an application that has been developed for a particular platform to include any of a wide variety of computing devices and operating systems.
As shown in fig. 2, the data layer may include a template data store 234. Template data store 234 may include a plurality of page templates. Each page template may include data describing the location, size, and resolution of the media to be displayed in the user interface. Thus, a single page may represent a set of media data intended to be displayed together in a user interface of a device (e.g., a display of a smartphone, a display associated with a laptop, a display of a tablet computer, etc.). In some examples, a story template may represent a series of pages that are intended to be grouped or linked together. Using the story template, the page generation system 112 may provide the user with much more information than is available via a single page.
The application logic layer may include application data that may provide a wide variety of other applications and services that allow a user to access or receive geographic data for navigation or other purposes. The application logic layer may include a page generation system 112 and a ranking system 130.
In some examples, page generation system 112 may periodically and automatically request media data for a particular live event. The live event may include a sporting event, a weather event, a political event, and the like. The server computing system 230 may provide information about the live event at the user computing device 202 via the application 212. The application may receive information via the network in a format that may be displayed on a device associated with the user computing device 202. For example, the server computing system 230 may provide the description in a format that the application 212 may interpret (e.g., HTML for a web browser) to generate a display for the user in the user interface.
In some examples, the page generation system 112 can access media data from a media database associated with the server computing system 230. Additionally or alternatively, the media data may be accessed from a remote third party server. The media data may include images, video, audio, and text associated with the live event. If an international sporting event, such as an olympic games, is occurring, the user may request information about a particular contest. For example, if a user is interested in a badminton, the user may use an application on their user computing device 202 to request up-to-date information about the badminton game currently occurring. The page generation system 112 may obtain information about the game in advance in response to a user's request or based on data about important live events and when those events occur. The story may be presented to the user based on previous interests in the shuttlecock.
In some examples, the page generation system 112 can submit a query for media data associated with a particular live event. In some examples, the query may include information specifying a particular live event of interest, a date, a time, an event type, and one or more types of media content requested. For example, if an olympic meeting in summer is currently occurring, the request may specify a particular event. In some examples, the query may describe a particular event, date, time, and specify the type and number of media assets requested. In response, the remote media server may send media data to the page generation system 112. In some examples, the media data may include a variety of different types of media content, including images, audio, video, and text.
In some examples, page generation system 112 can select one or more page templates (or story templates) from a plurality of pages and/or story templates stored in template data store 234. Template data store 234 may include a plurality of pages and/or story templates. Each page template may include data describing the location, size, and resolution of the media to be displayed in the user interface. Thus, a single page may represent a set of media data intended to be displayed together in a user interface of a device (e.g., a display of a smartphone, a display associated with a laptop, etc.). In some examples, a story template may represent a series of pages that are intended to be grouped or linked together. Using the story template, the page generation system 112 may provide the user with much more information than is available via a single page.
In some examples, page generation system 112 may select one or more page templates for a particular event based on the priority of the factors. For example, a particular sports or event may have predetermined established templates that have been customized to more effectively display information associated with the sports live event. In addition, a particular live event may have a custom or specialized template that is intended to display information associated with the particular live event. The live event may be associated with a multi-page story template having a common background associated with the event or a page customized to show specific data generated by the event. For example, a live election may have a particular template or series of templates that have been customized to display the results of the election from a particular location. In some examples, no specific page template is associated with a particular live event. Rather, page generation system 112 may rank the possible page templates using heuristics that take into account a number of factors such as the type, location, date and time of the live event, the number of available media assets. In some examples, page generation system 112 can also rank page templates to increase the diversity of templates used in a particular multi-page story (e.g., page templates that have not been used can be ranked higher). The page generation system 112 can select the page template with the highest rank. In some examples, page generation system 112 may use different ranks for different users or groups of users. In this way, one or more user characteristics may be used to select a template. In some examples, user characteristics such as age, location, nationality, language, interests, etc. may be used to rank templates for the user. In some examples, users may also be grouped based on the type of device they use to view the page. Templates may be selected for particular devices or device types.
In some examples, page generation system 112 may select a page template based on the amount and type of available media. For example, if a large number of content assets are available in the received media data, the page generation system 112 may have a large amount of flexibility in the particular pages or story templates that it selects. If the number of content assets is limited, templates that the page generation system 112 can select may similarly be limited. For example, if only two images are available, the template selection system 116 cannot select a page template that requires more than two images.
The page generation system 112 can customize the media data based on one or more requirements. For example, if the media data includes one or more portions of text, the page generation system 112 can translate the text into a plurality of different languages. In some examples, the translated text may require a different amount of space. As a result, once the text has been translated, page generation system 112 can select different templates for one or more languages. For example, in some languages, the descriptive text may fit in two rows, while in other languages, three rows may be required. The first template may be selected for languages requiring only two rows and the second template may be selected for languages requiring three rows to display descriptive text.
In some examples, pieces of media content may be customized by altering images or videos to fit within the space allocated by a particular page template. For example, if the space allocated in the template for a particular image is 100×100 pixels and the selected image is 120×100 pixels, the page generation system 112 may crop the selected image so that it fits within the region. In some examples, multiple images may potentially be able to be cropped to fit within a particular region. In this example, the page generation system 112 can evaluate the image to determine a best image to crop for the template portion assigned to the image.
Once the appropriate media data has been received, the template has been selected, and one or more pieces of media content have been customized, the page generation system 112 may generate a page based on the selected template. For example, the page generation system 112 may identify the appropriate pieces of media content for each portion of the page defined in the media template. A content page may then be generated having the selected pieces of media content in the appropriate portions. As above, the template data store 234 may also include a story template that is made up of multiple pages of content. In these examples, page generation system 112 can generate a plurality of content pages, each content page associated with a particular page in the story template. Multiple content pages may be linked together in a particular order to create a story.
In some examples, the server computing system 230 may include a ranking system 130 that organizes the generated pages in an order of potential interest to the user. In this way, the application 212 at the user computing device 202 may receive a series of pages and/or stories and present them to the user in the order in which they will be most interesting. For example, content pages and/or stories may be ranked according to location. Thus, live events occurring in the vicinity of a user may be rated higher than live events occurring away from the user. In some examples, the user interests may be represented in a user profile. The user profile may then be used to rank the pages based on the live event that the user will be most interested in. In some examples, users are grouped into groups based on nationality, language, particular teams, or organizations of interest to the user, etc. Ranking system 130 may generate a ranking tailored to a particular group. In some examples, the ranking given to a particular live event and its associated page may decay over time such that the further in time the event becomes less important.
FIG. 3 illustrates an example page generation system 112, according to an example embodiment of the disclosure. The page generation system 112 may include a query generation system 320, a media customization system 322, a template selection system 324, and a positioning system 326.
In some examples, query generation system 320 may generate a query requesting media data from a media data source. In some examples, the media data may include any type of media content, such as images, audio, video content, text, or any other type of media content. The query generation system 320 may generate the query in response to a periodic schedule. The periodic schedule may be predetermined or may be generated in response to determining that an event is in progress. Thus, the query generation system 320 may access a database that includes information about when the query was generated. The query may include data that allows the media server to know what types of media to return to the query generation system 320. For example, the query may include information describing a particular live event, a type of media asset requested, a time, one or more particular entities (e.g., people, teams, countries, etc.), a size of the media file, and/or a resolution or other quality of the media.
The media customization system 322 may customize one or more pieces of media content received in response to the media data query. Customizing one or more pieces of media data may include, but is not limited to: translation of text from one language to another, cropping images, editing video, adjusting the resolution of images or video up or down, changing the volume of audio clips, etc. In some examples, the media customization system 322 may customize the pieces of media content based on requirements associated with a particular page template.
In some examples, the template selection system 324 may select a page template from a plurality of possible templates stored in the template data store 234. Multiple templates may be associated with different live events, different types of events, specific live events, specific locations, seasons, sports, and events. In some examples, template selection system 324 may select a multi-page story template. Each page template may define a particular manner in which media, text, and other components of the user interface will be displayed on the screen of the user device. In some examples, the page template may have associated metadata that defines portions of the page and describes the types of media content that should be included in the portions. In some examples, the metadata associated with the page may also describe the size, resolution, aspect ratio, etc. of the media to be included in the particular portion.
The positioning system 326 may generate the content page (or pages of content) by arranging one or more pieces of selected media content into pages of content that may be sent to the user as specified by the selected template. In some examples, the generated content page may be defined using a markup language. The page generation system may then send the generated one or more pages to a cache where they may be retrieved as requested by the server computing system 230, such as one or more user computing devices 202.
FIG. 4 illustrates an example customization system 118 according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Customization system 118 may include cropping system 402, image filter 404, scoring system 406, and selection system 408.
In some examples, clipping system 402 may access metadata associated with a particular page template. In some examples, metadata may be accessed from media data store 424. Media data store 424 may store media assets and associated metadata. In some examples, media assets can be customized (e.g., translated, edited, cropped, etc.), and the customized data can be stored in the media data store 424.
The page template may define the size and location of one or more pieces of media content within the page. Accordingly, clipping system 402 may determine the size of a particular piece of media content in the template based on one or more of: the number of pixels associated with the image or video, the percentage of the total user interface, the particular aspect ratio or resolution.
Once the cropping system 402 has determined a particular size or aspect ratio of the media, the server computing system may identify a plurality of candidate pieces of media content. For example, cropping system 402 may access one or more received images associated with a particular live event. In some examples, the cropping system may crop the one or more candidate pieces of media content to a size or aspect ratio that matches a size or aspect ratio of a portion of the page template.
In some examples, the image filter may analyze one or more cropped images. For example, analyzing more images may involve accessing metadata associated with the content of each image. The metadata may describe the location and size of one or more features within the image (or another type of media content). In some examples, the metadata may describe the importance of each feature. For example, if an image is associated with a sporting event, one or more people in the image may be the focus of the image and thus more important than others within the image. Metadata may also describe the location and content of any text within the image. Image filter 404 may determine for each cropped image whether cropping results in important aspects of the image being removed or blurred. For example, if a portion of text is partially removed during the cropping process, the filter may remove the cropped image from the candidate image list.
Once the image filter 404 filters out any images that have changed or removed important aspects of the image during the cropping process, the candidate image list may be passed to the scoring system 406. In some examples, scoring system 406 may include a machine learning model that generates an aesthetic score for each remaining cropped image. The aesthetic score may be based on one or more factors to indicate how pleasing the cropped image is in the sense of being aesthetically. For example, these factors may include the degree to which the content of the image is related to the event, the particular live event, whether the image includes important information about the event (e.g., kicking a ball), and whether key elements of the image are framed in an aesthetically pleasing manner (e.g., important characters are presented in a manner that they are clear and easily visible).
The selection system 408 may select one or more images to place in the generated page based on one or more cosmetic scores. In some examples, selection system 408 may select the image with the highest aesthetic score. In some examples, selection system 408 may select one image from a plurality of different image groups. For example, if there are several sets of images, each set representing a key player in a particular live game, the selection system 408 may select the image from each set that has the highest aesthetic score. In this way, pages or stories highlighting several different players in the game may be generated even though the images associated with a single hand selection have the highest overall aesthetic score.
Fig. 5 shows an example flowchart in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure. In this example, a server computing system (e.g., server computing system 230 in fig. 2) may receive event information 502. Event information 502 may be any information describing a particular live event that is occurring or will occur in the future. Event information 502 may include data describing the type of event, the time of the event, how long the event was requested, information about the type of user that may be interested in the event, and other information. The template retrieval system 506 may retrieve the existing template 504 from the structured store 540. The structured store 540 may enable the template retrieval system 506 to quickly identify an appropriate set of templates for a live event.
The server computing system may query the data provider 512. In some examples, the data providers may include a source media provider 542 and a source narration provider 544. In some examples, a source media provider provides media assets including images, audio, video, and potentially text. The source narrative provider 544 may provide narrative details about the live event. For example, if the live event is a football match, the narrative details may include information about important events that occur during the match, including goals, traders, penalties, injuries, and the like. The narrative details may be used to determine the specific content of each page in the multi-page story (e.g., the page for each goal and/or highlight). The server computing system may access the media asset 508 and the narrative metadata 510 by querying a data provider.
Media assets 514 and narrative metadata 516 can be provided and used in a data fusion 518 to combine the narrative and media information. In some examples, the data fusion 518 includes, for a series of narrative events described in the narrative data, identifying appropriate media assets to display on the contest for each narrative event. For example, if each page is associated with a goal in a football match, the data fusion 518 system may identify an image of each player playing a corresponding ball or an image of a goal. In addition, the data fusion may also include the step of customizing the media asset for inclusion in a particular page. For example, these steps may include transforming image 520 and transforming text 522. Transforming the images may include cropping, resizing, and scaling the one or more images to ensure that the one or more images will fit into the selected template. In some examples, text 522 may be transformed. Transforming text 522 may include translating the text into a plurality of different languages.
In some examples, the server computing system may generate one or more templates 528. Generating the template may include updating the template from an existing template. In other examples, the template may be newly generated based on the transformed image and the transformed text. In some examples, the updated template 526 may be stored in a structured store 546.
The template engine 530 may take as input updated templates, image information, and text information. The template engine 530 may generate one or more HTML pages including the transformed image and the transformed text based on the selected template. In some examples, these HTML pages may be grouped into ordered multi-page stories by HTML generation system 532. Story content may be uploaded 534 to unstructured storage 548 that may be accessed, retrieved, for transmission to one or more users.
In some examples, a distribution notification 536 may be generated. Story metadata 538 may be sent to story distributor 550. This information may be used to inform the user that the story is available. The user may then request story content that may be accessed from, for example, unstructured storage 548.
Fig. 6 shows an example flowchart in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure. In some examples, a server computing system for accessing live event media data (e.g., server computing system 230 in fig. 2) may include scheduler 602, message queue 606, live event data access system 610, event detection system 620, and event information database 624. In some examples, event detection system 620 may determine when a current live event is occurring. To do so, the event detection system 620 may monitor 622 (or access) information stored in the event information database 624. Event information database 624 may include information collected from social media sources. The web service may provide information entered by the user describing when and where a particular live event occurred. The event information database 624 may be populated with information downloaded from publicly available social media posts. In other examples, the web server may enable a user to submit data describing one or more live events when the event is occurring in a manner accessible to the server computing system via a computer network.
When a new event is identified, the event information database 624 may send information about the new event 618 to the scheduler 602. Similarly, when a new event is identified based on information in event information database 624, event detection system 620 may send notification 616 to scheduler 602.
Scheduler 602 may send information about the event to message queue 606. The information about the event may include a name and time of the event. In some examples, the scheduler 602 may also request 614 the message queue 606 to store events 608 or messages to be executed at a particular time. In this way, the scheduler 602 may plan when information for events that have not yet occurred will be received. Message queue 606 may preload one or more requests to be performed at a particular time or according to a particular schedule. In some examples, message queue 606 may operate to periodically request events on a fixed repeating schedule (e.g., every five minutes).
The message queue 606 may store a plurality of query events based on information received from a schedule. Query events may be ordered based on when the query is to be submitted. Thus, when new information is received from the scheduler regarding when to query a particular live event, the message queue 606 may insert the new query event into the queue at the appropriate location. Message queue 606 can process stored queue events (e.g., scheduled queries) to execute the queue events based on the order in which the queue events are stored in the queue and/or the scheduled time at which the queue requests are scheduled for execution.
When the message queue 606 determines that a query event is scheduled, it may send the query to the live event data access system 610. In some examples, live event data access system 610 may resend query events back to a message queue query to be run as part of a response to a particular query. In this way, the query may be executed during the entire time that the live event is occurring. For example, if the live event is a volleyball game, the query event may be scheduled to occur periodically from the time the volleyball game is scheduled to begin until a predetermined amount of time after the volleyball game is predicted to end. In some examples, the queries may continue to be executed until the data received from one of the queries indicates that the volleyball game has ended. In some examples, live event data access system 610 may schedule a next queue event (e.g., a query) based on the amount of media data received from a previous queue event by resending 612 the event back to message queue 606. Thus, if a large amount of media data is being returned in response to a query, the next query may be scheduled to occur more frequently. If very little media data is received, the next query may be scheduled to be executed after a longer period of time.
Fig. 7 shows an example flowchart in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure. One or more pages may be determined to need to be updated or removed. In some examples, a page may be updated when new information about a live event to which the page relates is received. In other examples, the user may notice that the content within the generated page is incorrect or outdated.
A server computing system (e.g., server computing system 230 in fig. 2) may access a document ID 702 associated with a particular page. The server computing system may use the document ID 702 to query the page store 720 to identify one or more pages associated with a request to update or remove one or more content pages. In some examples, the server computing system may remove the associated page template from the template database and access the reported story 706. In this way, if the problem arises in the template itself, no new page will be created when the correction is made.
The server computing system may regenerate 708 one or more pages/stories and use template engine 710 to generate new or updated pages and stories. This information may be stored in unstructured database 722 from which it may be sent or accessed by multiple users. In addition, information about the generated story may be uploaded 712 to web server 724. The web server 724 may send data about one or more stories to an application (e.g., google exploration) on the user device so that the user can know the content and can access it.
FIG. 8 illustrates an example user interface according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. In this example, three different pages of a multi-page story are displayed. Each page has a background 806, one or more pieces of media content, and user interface elements that allow the user to view the story.
For example, the first page 802 includes an image of a cricket player 804 and text describing what is happening in the scene being photographed. In addition, it includes an indication 808 of the location of the page in the multi-page story. For example, the first page appears on the second page from the beginning. The page also includes two arrow icons 810 that allow the user to move to the next page or the previous page in the story.
The second page 820 includes similar features, a center image, associated descriptive text, user interface elements for browsing stories, and the like. In addition, page 2 includes a user interface element 822, which user interface element 822 allows a user to request or view additional information about a cricket player displayed in an image associated with the page.
In this example, the third page 830 does not include a large image. Instead, it includes information about the game 832 for which the page or story was generated. Thus, the page includes a descriptor of the game (e.g., team or country of the game), the time at which the game occurred, the competitor, and relevant details about the game itself.
Fig. 9 depicts an example flowchart of a method according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. One or more portions of the method may be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as, for example, the computing devices described herein. Furthermore, one or more portions of the method may be implemented as an algorithm on a hardware component of the device(s) described herein. For purposes of illustration and discussion, FIG. 9 depicts elements that are performed in a particular order. Using the disclosure provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that elements of any of the methods discussed herein may be adapted, rearranged, expanded, omitted, combined, and/or modified in various ways without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The method may be implemented by one or more computing systems, such as one or more of the computing systems depicted in fig. 1-4.
A server computing system (e.g., server computing system 230 in fig. 2) may include one or more processors, memory, and other components that together enable the computing system to automatically generate content pages of a live event. At 902, a server computing system can access media data associated with a live event. In some examples, the server computing system may automatically submit the query to the media provider. In some examples, a server computing system may receive media data associated with a query from a media provider. The media provider may include a remote third party computing server.
In some examples, the query includes parameters describing one or more of the following: a particular live event, date, time or location. The media data may include one or more images and one or more text portions. The media data may include one or more videos. In some examples, the query may be automatically generated based on a periodic schedule.
In some examples, at 904, the server computing system may customize media data for one or more groups of users. In some examples, customizing the media content may include translating one or more text portions of the media data into a plurality of different languages. In some examples, customizing may include cropping, by the computing system, one or more images based on information describing the particular page template. Users may be grouped based on the language they use or the region of the world in which they are located. In some examples, the language groups may be subdivided based on different dialects. For example, different spellings and/or vocabularies may be used for different dialect groups. Further, when generating speech audio (e.g., TTS) of text based on a particular set of specific accents or dialects, different accesses may be used. In some examples, users may be grouped into one or more groups based on their interests.
In some examples, at 906, the server computing system may select one or more page templates from a plurality of page templates based at least in part on the customized media data. In some examples, live events may have an associated event type. For example, the live event may be a sporting event, a political event, a musical event, and the like. In some examples, one or more page templates are selected based at least in part on an event type of the live event. Each page template may include one or more sub-portions, each sub-portion being associated with a particular media type at a particular location within the page.
In some examples, the template may include data describing the look and feel of the content page. For example, the template description may be used to generate specific colors, fonts, text sizes, animations, transitions, effects, etc. of the complete content that are applied to the image or text. In some examples, the same look and feel characteristics may be used for a multi-page story. The templates may also describe whether the page is in portrait or landscape mode. In some examples, the template may determine the location of the text based on characteristics of the image used as background to the text. In some examples, the system may identify salient regions of the image and rank the text such that it does not obscure the salient regions of the image. The characteristics of the image may also be used to customize the color and size of the text. In addition, the image may be cropped to enlarge a particular person in the image.
In some examples, the server computing system may determine the number and type of pieces of media content included in the media data. The server computing system may select one or more page templates based on the number and type of media content in the media data. In some examples, the page templates include templates for multi-page stories.
In some examples, at 908, the server computing system may generate one or more content pages based on the customized media data and the one or more page templates. The server computing system may automatically assemble one or more pieces of media content in the media data into one or more content pages based on content associated with the respective piece of media content. In some examples, the server computing system aggregates two or more pages into a multi-page story. In some examples, at 910, the server computing system may provide one or more content pages to one or more user computing devices.
The technology discussed herein relates to sensors, servers, databases, software applications, and other computer-based systems, as well as actions taken and information sent to and from such systems.
