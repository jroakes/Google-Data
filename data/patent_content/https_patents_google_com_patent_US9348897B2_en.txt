Definitions
- Example embodiments of the present application generally relate to task management and, more particularly, to a system and method for providing intelligent task management services to users.
- task management involved creating and maintaining one or more paper to-do lists.
- task management software tools allow users to manage multiple tasks on multiple task lists, share tasks with other users, set alerts and reminders for certain tasks, and prioritize tasks based on the wishes of the user.
- the task lists of traditional task management tools are often outdated, unstructured, and incomplete or unmanageably long.
- the information for describing individual tasks is often scant, containing little more than a subject and a due date.
- the tasks on these lists are often mismanaged and quickly become irrelevant or moot due to the passing of time or a change in other circumstances.
- these task management tools allow users to schedule tasks, they do not assist users in determining when to schedule certain tasks or how to prioritize each task on the list of tasks.
- traditional task management tools do not assist users in tracking available time at which one or more tasks may be performed.
- traditional task management tools provide little assistance to users in actually undertaking or completing the tasks on the task lists.

- Embodiments may also be tangibly embodied as a set of computer instructions stored on a computer readable medium, such as a memory device.
- the method may include obtaining activity data that defines a plurality of activity attributes of an intention of a user to undertake an activity and obtaining content data including one or more content items related to undertaking the activity.
- the plurality of activity attributes may include temporal attributes defining time constraints related to the intended activity and contextual attributes that identify contexts related to the intended activity.
- the data may be obtained from user input or from one or more communications received by the user related to the activity.
- the plurality of activity attributes may also include categorical attributes defining a category or type of activity and dependency attributes related to one or more associated activities or users.
- an intention object may be generated based on the plurality of activity attributes.
- the intention object may comprise a data structure including the plurality of activity attributes and the content data.
- the method may further include inferring an additional attribute of the intention object and updating the intention objects based on the additional object.
- Each generated intention object may simultaneously reside in an intention object collection and one or more communications (e.g., email, calendar invite, etc.) or calendar event.
- Each generated intention object may have a number of different actions that may be taken with regard to the intention objects themselves (e.g., sharing via email) and a number of different executable actions that may be executed with regard to the respective activities of the intention object.
- a particular intention object may persist regardless of the actions taken with respect to that object.
- a user may receive an email confirming a dentist appointment at the dentist's office that same day at 2:30 PM.
- the system may then analyze the email to obtain the activity attributes defining the user's intended activity, which in this example is the dentist appointment.
- the activity attributes obtained from the email may include the date and time of the appointment (e.g., a temporal attribute) and the location of the appointment (e.g., a contextual attribute), which in this case is the dentist's office.
- An intention object including these obtained activity attributes may then be created.
- a travel time e.g., an additional attribute
- 15 minutes may then be inferred based on the current location of the user and the location of the dentist's office.
- the intention object may then be updated to include the inferred attributes.
- aspects of the present disclosure describe systems and methods for intelligent task management services including selectively presenting a user with a collection of intention objects.
- the method may include accessing a collection of intention objects belonging to the user.
- Each of the intention objects may comprise a data structure including a plurality of activity attributes of an intended activity.
- the plurality of activity attributes may comprise temporal attributes and contextual attributes including a location associated with the intended activity.
- the method may also include determining a relevancy rank for each of the collection of intention objects based on the plurality of activity attributes corresponding to each intention object.
- the relevancy rank indicates a suggested order in which the user undertakes each of the respective activities.
- one or more intention objects with a relevancy rank above a predefined threshold are identified.
- Graphical representations of the above-threshold intention objects may be presented to the user in a free form spatial interface.
- the identified intention objects may be presented to a user in an order listed with the order of the intention objects determined based on the respective relevancy rank.
- the user may have created an additional intention object for rearranging his sock drawer, which includes a temporal attribute indicating that the duration of this activity is 30 minutes.
- the user may have created another intention object for a date with his wife at a time and location to be determined at a later time.
- the user's collection of intention objects may thus comprise the intention objects for the dentist appointment, rearranging the sock drawer, and the date with his wife.
- a relevancy rank is then determined for each intention object, and assuming each intention object is above the predefined threshold, a graphical representation of each intention object is presented to the user in a free form spatial canvas.
- the rearranging sock drawer intention object may have the highest relevancy ranking, followed by the dentist office intention object, and then finally the date with his wife.
- the intention objects may be presented to the user in this order in an ordered list.
- the method may also include determining an updated relevancy rank for each intention object and identifying a particular intention object with an updated relevancy rank that is below the threshold. In response to the particular intention object being below the threshold, the particular intention object is removed from the free form spatial interface and from the ordered list.
- an updated relevancy ranking for each intention object may be determined in response to the time of day being later than the dentist appointment without the user indicating that the dentist appointment was completed.
- the updated relevancy rank of the dentist appointment may then be determined to be below the predefined threshold.
- the graphical representation of the dentist appointment intention object may be removed from the free form spatial interface.
- the method may include accessing a collection of intention objects belonging to the user.
- Each of the intention objects may be comprised of a data structure including a plurality of activity attributes defining an intention of the user to undertake an intended activity.
- the plurality of activity attributes may comprise temporal attributes and contextual attributes including a location associated with the intended activity.
- the method may also include accessing calendar data from a calendar of the user and determining an available time slot on the calendar.
- a suggested intention object is selected from the collection of intention objects.
- the selection of the suggested intention object may be based on one or more of the plurality of activity attributes of the suggested intention object.
- the user may then be provided a scheduling suggestion including a suggestion to schedule the activity associated with the suggested intention object in the available time slot.
- the activity is scheduled in the available time slot.
- the calendar of the user may be accessed and it may be determined that the user currently has a 30 minute opening in his schedule. If the user is home (e.g., the location of his sock drawer), the user may then be provided with a suggestion to rearrange his sock drawer. Upon approval from the user, the rearranging of the sock drawer activity may be scheduled on the user's calendar. Alternatively, it may be determined that the user has a 2 hour opening in his schedule later that day. The user may then be provided a suggestion to schedule a date with his wife during that available time slot. Upon approval from the user, the date with his wife may be scheduled on the user's calendar.
