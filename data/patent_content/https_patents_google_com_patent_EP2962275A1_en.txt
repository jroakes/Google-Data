Definitions
- the respective user-provided brand identifier may be a hashtag.
- the content items may comprise social media messages transmitted within the social network by other users of the social network.
- the method may further comprise determining, for a respective aggregate identity group, one or more brand identities, and providing content related to the one or more brand identities to users of the social network who have indicated a desire to receive brand-related content by subscribing to a brand identifier of the respective aggregate identity group.
- the respective brand identity may be representative of a celebrity, a retail product, or a product manufacturer.
- the first brand identifier may not be currently associated with any aggregate identity group, and the method may comprise, after receiving the first brand identifier, associating the first brand identifier with the respective aggregate identity group, and providing, based on the associating, content related to the one or more brand identities to the user associated with the content subscription request.
- the plurality of different user-provided brand identifiers may be aggregated into two or more aggregate identity groups based on a predetermined algorithm.
- the predetermined algorithm may comprise comparing the plurality of different user-provided brand identifiers using a phonetic algorithm, approximate string matching, or by determining the edit distance or hamming distance between each of the different brand identifiers.

- the step of coalescing may further comprise providing an interface for selection of one or more of the plurality of different brand identifiers, and receiving an instruction to place a selected one of the different brand identifiers into one of the two or more groups of similar identifiers.
- Associating the one or more brand identifiers with the one or more brand identities may comprise replacing the one or more brand identifiers with a common brand identifier for the one or more brand identities.
- Meta information provided by content managers to their content has additional rich information (e.g. prices, locations, styles, and the like) that can automatically be associated with the content allowing the subject technology to make other inferences about the brand identity and community members who interact with the content, providing a mechanism to create relationships across content.
- FIG. 1 depicts example components for crowdsourcing user-provided brand identifiers and coalescing the identifiers for association with one or more brand identities.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating an example process for crowdsourcing user-provided brand identifiers and distributing content based on crowd-sourced identifiers.
- FIG. 3 is an example system flow diagram for crowdsourcing user-provided brand identifiers and distributing content based on crowd-sourced identifiers.
- FIG. 6 is an example system flow diagram for indexing content meta identifiers.
- FIG. 7 is an example system flow diagram for associating content items with content subscription requests using a common brand identifier.
- FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating an example computing device for crowdsourcing user- provided brand identifiers and coalescing the identifiers for association with one or more brand identities, including a processor and other internal components.
- Brand identifiers in the form of hashtags and other user-provided identifiers may be used to aggregate data on popular social networking services.
- Certain applications have been implemented to identify keywords and their relationships to known entities, but these implementations are not concerned with using disparate keywords to subscribe to content on a community product, where such association is critical for content discoverability and community growth.
- the subject technology When operably coupled to a community product, the subject technology identifies recurrences of brand identifiers for subject matter (e.g., hashtags) used by community members, consolidates them into groups, and associates the groups with established brand identities. Dissimilar identifiers within a group that are not directly associated with any brand identity may then be associated with brand identities of other identifiers in the group. Likewise, content managers may review consolidated groups to determine which identities should be directly or indirectly (through the group) associated with a brand identity. Content managers may further choose to remove or add identifiers to or from a group. In this manner, it is not necessary for an identifier to be associated with a brand before the identifier is used by a community member to subscribe to brand-related content.
- subject matter e.g., hashtags
- Computing system 100 includes one or more data storages for association of brand identifiers with groups of identifiers, and brand identities.
- a subscription storage 103 is configured to store content subscription requests made by community members of the social network.
- a subscription request includes, for example, an indication of an interest of a community member to subscribe to content associated with a user-provided identifier (e.g., a hashtag).
- the community member may provide the identifier in a social media message, for example, posted to the member's activity stream. Content annotated with the identifier may then be distributed to the subscribing community member.
- indices storage 106 may pair a user- provided identifier stored in subscription storage 103 with one or more aggregate groups of identifiers, or with one or more brand identities stored in brand identity storage 104.
- brand indices storage 106 may facilitate delivery of content to community members by providing software module 101 with indices for brand identities stored in identity storage 104.
- Software module 101 may use the indices in determining what content in content storage 106 to deliver in connection with a subscription request stored in subscription storage 103.
- Computing system 100 may include one computer (e.g., a server) or multiple computers.
- the functionality of computer system 100 and community product 102 may be implemented on the same physical computer or distributed among a plurality of computers.
- the functionality of subscription storage 103, brand identity storage 104, and content storage 105, and indices storage 106 may be implemented in the same storage device or computer, or distributed across a plurality of storage devices or computers.
- the storages may take any form such as relational databases, object-oriented databases, file structures, text-based records, or other forms of data repositories. While each storage is illustrated as a single storage, it is understood that software module 101 can control access to and coordinate retrieval of information from a cloud computing environment including multiple databases and database servers.
- Computing system 100 may be further connected via a network to an online community product (e.g., a social network), and/or one or more client devices (for example, a personal computer, server, smart phone, PDA, tablet, or the like).
- client devices for example, a personal computer, server, smart phone, PDA, tablet, or the like.
- the various computers and/or storages may be connected to and/or communicate with each other via the Internet, or a private LAN/WAN.
- the various connections may be made over a wired or wireless connection.
- Computing system 100 may be configured to communicate with a content feed 107 of community product 102.
- Content feed 107 may provide content to one or more members of community product 102 via integration with respective activity feeds for the members.
- computing system 100 is configured to facilitate the receiving by software module 101 of content subscription requests 108 from community members.
- content subscription requests 108 are extracted from one or more data sources in community product 102, or from messages transmitted within community product 102.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating an example process for crowdsourcing user-provided brand identifiers and distributing content based on crowd-sourced identifiers.
- one or more blocks of FIG. 2 may be executed by computing system 100 (including, e.g., software module 101).
- a non-transitory machine-readable medium may include machine-executable instructions thereon that, when executed by a computer or machine, perform the blocks of FIG. 2. Accordingly, the blocks of FIG. 2 may be performed within the context of a social network system environment.
- a plurality of user-provided brand identifiers are extracted from messages provided by a plurality of users of a social network.
- the messages may include, for example, posts to an activity stream and other social media messages transmitted within the social network.
- the user-provided brand identifiers may be identified from the use of special characters (e.g., #, $, %, and the like) at the beginning of a character string, or within a character string.
- a user-provided identifier is a hashtag.
- the plurality of different user-provided brand identifiers are aggregated into two or more aggregate identity groups. Some identifiers may be different in spelling, but refer to the same subject matter. Accordingly, the plurality of user-provided brand identifiers are aggregated into the two or more aggregate identity groups based on a predetermined algorithm. In some implementations, spelling heuristics may be used to identify similar identifiers. For example, the predetermined algorithm may compare the plurality of different user-provided brand identifiers using a phonetic algorithm, approximate string matching, or by determining the edit distance or hamming distance between string representations of each of the different brand identifiers.
- the subject technology extends an interface to content managers (e.g., volunteers and owners of the community product) for manual consolidation of the identifiers.
- the interface may provide sorting and selection of user-provided identifiers based on selection criteria. For example, identifiers may be ranked according to popularity, time ranges, and the like, and then provided to the interface for display based on the ranking.
- Computing system 100 may provide confidence values in connection with identifiers. In this regard, when a confidence value of a certain identifier does not satisfy the predetermined threshold, computing system 100 may suggest the identifier for consolidation as a less confident suggestion. Using popularity, confidence values, and the like, content managers may prioritize which identifiers needs consolidation.
- a content subscription request comprising a first brand identifier is received.
- the first brand identifier is received as part of a message transmitted in the social network.
- the social network may be configured to detect the use of brand identifiers (e.g., by the use of special characters) by a community member and, on detecting a brand identifier, provide the member the option to subscribe to content related to the detected identifier. The member may then initiate the content subscription request in response to affirmatively selecting the option to subscribe. Additionally or in the alternative, the member may opt-in to automatically receive content related to brand identifiers used by the member.
- the first brand identifier is determined to be in at least one of the aggregate identity groups.
- the first brand identifier may be determined to be in a group by a directly matching a previously stored brand identifier of the group. Additionally or in the alternative, the first brand identifier may be consolidated into the group as described in block 202.
- content items comprising one or more other brand identifiers of the at least one aggregate identity group are provided to a user associated with the content subscription request.
- the content items may be provided, for example, in an the user's activity stream, or in a stream specifically configured to receive content for the first brand identifier.
- content items may include email, blog posts, or social media messages transmitted within the social network by other users of the social network.
- Computing system 100 may search the user's social graph for uses of brand identifiers related to the at least one aggregate identity group, and provide messages and other content identified by those brand identifiers to the user.
- community members can subscribe to any identifier, much like they would subscribe to another member's content.
- a member receives content associated with the identifier.
- content is associated with an identifier by annotating the content with the identifier, for example, an explicit hashtag within the content or as part of a message connected to the content.
- the subscribing member may receive content made available from other members.
- many brand identifiers can be associated with a general identifier which is used to replace occurrences of the consolidated identifiers in content and subscriptions.
- associating user-provided identifiers as described previously without the need to replace them allows the computing system 100 to retain the same identifier type before and after consolidation, which simplifies the overall design.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example a process for associating user-provided brand identifiers with brand identities, according to some aspects of the subject technology.
- the blocks of FIG. 4 may optionally follow the blocks of FIG. 2, depending on whether an aggregate identity groups is being associated with one or more brand identities.
- a content manager for the brand identity is able to manage the brand representation along related aggregate identifiers and their subscriptions.
- content managers may define brand entities and associate these entities with as many user-provided identifiers as possible.
- one or more brand identities are determined for a respective aggregate identity group.
- a respective brand identity may be representative of a celebrity, a retail product, a product manufacturer, or other entity to which content may be attributed.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example a process for associating user-provided brand identifiers with brand identities, according to some aspects of the subject technology.
- the blocks of FIG. 5 may optionally follow the blocks of FIG. 2.
- a plurality of meta identifiers are extracted from a plurality of content items provided by a content provider for the social network.
- a content manager may annotate content items with one or more meta identifiers to associate the content items with predetermined content types, or to distribute the content items to a predetermined demographic.
- Meta identifiers may include meta data about the content items or describe the content items.
- a meta identifier may include a product or brand name, a product type, a service or service type, a name of a celebrity, a location or place, or any other information that may be used to associate the content with other content.
- a meta identifier may be structured like the previously described user-provided brand identifiers (e.g., may be a hashtag, or start with a special character).
- meta identifiers may be constructed by detecting and selecting identifiable information (e.g., a name), for example, from within the content.
- identifiable information e.g., a name
- keywords variations may be normalized without relying solely on machine learning thus allow high quality association on low volumes of data, and content creators are encouraged to provide meta information which in itself has other rich data making the overall quality of content better for the consumer.
- the plurality of meta identifiers are aggregated into two or more content meta groups.
- the meta identifiers may be consolidated into the group as described in block 202 for brand identifiers. Additionally or in the alternative, the meta identifiers may be aggregated into a group by manually placing them into the group.
- computer system 100 may extend a management console that includes a selection screen for selection and grouping of meta identifiers detected by computer 100.
- a respective content meta group is associated with the at least one aggregate identity group.
- associating the respective content meta group may include comparing one or more meta identifiers of the respective content meta group with one or more identifiers of the at least one aggregate identity group, and determining, based on the comparing, that the one or more meta identifiers are related to the one or more identifiers. The comparison may be made according to the process described in blocks 502 and 202.
- content items associated with meta identifiers of the content meta group are provided to the user. In this regard, the content items need not be manually assigned a specific destination, but may be distributed to community users in the same way as described previously with respect to block 205 (e.g., as a post to an activity stream).
- content may be distributed to members in two ways.
- the user can provide explicit identifiers (e.g., as hashtags) in content provided by the user (e.g., in a social network post).
- a content manager may associate content with brand-related meta information, for example, corresponding to a product, place, person, or the like.
- the meta data may be selected from one or more predetermined sets of meta data, or by entering new data in connection with the content.
- the meta data provides rich content, and may be used to determine the relevance of the content as well as its relationship to others.
- the meta data may become meta identifiers which may be aggregated into groups for a brand identity in the same way as user-provided identifiers.
- the subject technology may convert identifiable aspects of meta data (e.g. name) to hashtags that get added to the regular hashtag pool and can be consolidated with others as indicating a single brand entity. Accordingly, users may add rich content that is great for their audience, and which will automatically and simultaneously expand in distribution channels through the previously defined process. Accordingly, the content manager need not worry about how to position their content to benefit from wider distribution (ie. the correct tag to use or the correct spelling of a brand name) because the subject technology consolidate all variants and ensures the desired distribution.
- meta data e.g. name
- users may add rich content that is great for their audience, and which will automatically and simultaneously expand in distribution channels through the previously defined process. Accordingly, the content manager need not worry about how to position their content to benefit from wider distribution (ie. the correct tag to use or the correct spelling of a brand name) because the subject technology consolidate all variants and ensures the desired distribution.
- FIG. 6 is an example system flow diagram for indexing content meta identifiers, according to some aspects of the subject technology.
- a content manager annotates content with certain meta data.
- meta identifiers are extracted from the meta data associated with each content item.
- the extracted meta identifiers are normalized to produce a common meta identifier for the content items.
- each content item is indexed by the common meta identifier and stored in indices storage 106.
- FIGS. 2-6 provide several advantages. For example, a proxy for popular brand entities is provided, reducing the need for those entities presence within community product 102 to attract community growth.
- the distribution of information is increased in a way that does not require content creators to know exactly how to construct the correct distribution terms (e.g the right hashtag to maximize distribution), and consumers do not have to know the most relevant or popular representation of a brand entity (e.g., a name, hashtag, or the like) to subscribe to in order to get relevant content about that brand entity.
- a brand entity e.g., a name, hashtag, or the like
- the process for identifying which brand entities a community should prioritize for partnership or onboarding is streamlined, and a ready audience is created for a brand identity for the brand entity as well as an easier way for the brand entity to evaluate its distribution return on investment for joining the community product. Accordingly, the subject technology facilitates distributing and receiving relevant content at low cost to content creators and consumers while mitigating empty room situations caused, in part, by not having well-known content sources in new and growing community products.
- a brand identity may be associated with any keyword rather than using one form of user-provided identifiers as an intermediary.
- brand identities may be provided directly to the member community as subscribable entities no different from other community members, and not expose brand identifiers for following or subscribing to the brand identities to receive related content. In this case, meta information may still be combined in the previously described manner to correlate content to the brand identities.
- user-provided identifiers may be resolved to their associated brands before committing a subscription.
- a meta identifier for one or more content items could be resolved prior to indexing the content.
- much of the offline postprocessing may be done just-in-time (e.g., as a background process initiated immediately after an identifier is introduced into the system).
- One advantage of applying things offline is that fewer lookups are required and the system scales better as the number of annotations per content item increases.
- An offline process also affords other content computations while the user-provided identifiers are being resolved, including scoring and the like which would otherwise be expensive in terms of processing power and time in real-time.
- computing system 100 reads all content meta identifiers, all brand identities, and all content subscription requests, and associates the brand identities (e.g., using meta data for the brand identities) with the user-provided brand identifiers obtained from the subscription requests.
- the meta identifiers for content items associated with the brand identifiers provided in subscription requests, and those brand identifiers, are then replaced with a common brand identifier for each corresponding brand identity.
- Computing system 100 then re- indexes the associated content items with the common brand identifier, and updates the associated content subscription requests in indices storage 106.
