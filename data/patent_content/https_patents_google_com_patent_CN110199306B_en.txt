Abstract
A computing device is described that receives notifications generated by a notification source, determines a set of notification channels defined by the notification source, each notification channel having one or more parameters defined by the notification source, and determines a particular notification channel from the set of notification channels that is assigned to the notifications. The computing device determines one or more parameters of the particular notification channel and outputs an indication of the notification based on the one or more parameters of the particular notification channel. In this way, an indication of the manner in which a given notification is being handled by the computing device may be provided to the user. This may provide further information about the notification itself and allow efficient interaction in accordance with the knowledge provided thereby.
Description
Background
Some applications or services may generate "notifications" for various reasons that alert the user to new or interesting information. The computing device may display, among other things, a graphical indication of notifications received from applications executing at the computing device or services accessible to the computing device as notification messages in a notification area of a graphical user interface (e.g., notification pane, notification window, notification curtain (notification shade)) and/or as a "notification logo (notification badge)". Each notification message contained in the notification area may be composed of one or more graphical elements (e.g., icons, actionable elements), text (e.g., titles, detailed information), and/or other content. Unlike being displayed in the notification area, the notification logo is typically shown as a graphical element that overlaps or is adjacent to the startup icon and indicates the total amount of notifications (e.g., not viewed, not heard, not felt, or not otherwise cleared) that are currently pending (pending) for the particular application or service associated with the startup icon. Some computing devices receive a large number of notifications-thus, their display (whether as multiple messages in a notification area and/or as multiple notification logos) can lead to undesirable confusion, clutter, or annoyance.
Disclosure of Invention
In general, the techniques of this disclosure relate to managing notifications and outputting an indication of the notification as part of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) of a computing device. The computing device may receive notification data (referred to herein simply as a "notification") generated by an application executing at the computing device or a service accessible to the computing device (otherwise referred to herein as a "notification source"). When the computing device receives the notification, the computing device may process the notification and display a graphical indication of the latent (unrerling) notification as part of a GUI of the computing device.
The graphical indication of the notification may take the form of a notification logo that is displayed adjacent to or as part of the launch icon of the application or service that generated the notification. However, unlike typical notification logos that merely indicate the total amount of currently pending notifications for an application or service associated with a startup icon, example notification logos may reflect the content of the pending notifications. For example, if the notification is for alerting a user of the computing device of a message from a particular sender, the logocon may be a graphic (e.g., icon) or image associated with the particular sender. The results of the user's interactions with the computing device may be further advertised so that the user may make decisions based on knowledge that the user is not otherwise available. Thus, in reflecting the content of the notification, the logocon may facilitate efficient interaction with the computing device by resolving one or more ambiguities that may otherwise occur. Thereby, a reduction in processing load on the device can be achieved. Displaying notification logos reflecting the content of pending notifications may reduce anxiety and/or confusion for some users due to seeing other types of notification logos.
After displaying the notification logo at or near the particular start icon, the computing device may detect user input selecting the particular start icon. While selecting one type of user input (e.g., a tap input) for a particular startup icon may cause the computing device to execute an application or access a service associated with the startup icon, selecting a different type of user input (e.g., a long press) for the particular startup icon may cause the computing device to display (e.g., display in the vicinity of the startup icon being selected) a message preview of one or more individual notifications associated with the notification logo. For example, if the computing device receives a plurality of notifications for alerting a user of the computing device of a plurality of messages received from a plurality of senders, the computing device may cause the message preview to include a respective notification message for each of the plurality of notifications, where each notification message may include one or more graphical elements (e.g., icons, actionable elements), text (e.g., titles, detailed information), and/or other content displayed within the message preview. In a similar manner that a user may interact with a notification message when the notification message is displayed in a notification area of a GUI, the user may be able to interact more quickly with a particular notification message from a message preview.
The computing device may display a graphical indication of the notification in a notification area of the GUI as a notification message. The notification area may be a notification pane, notification window, or notification curtain that shows notification messages for each notification received by the computing device that has not been viewed, read, heard, or otherwise cleared.
To increase availability and reduce interaction time between users and notification areas, or otherwise promote more efficient user interaction with notifications, a computing device may categorize notifications and display notification messages of the notifications in a ranked order of categorization importance, the categorization importance being linked to the manner in which the notification messages will be presented when presented in a notification pane or other notification area of a GUI. For example, the computing device may classify the notification as: important and in-progress (important and ongoing) type notifications, person-to-person type notifications, general type notifications, "by-the-road" type notifications, or system informative notifications, and then display graphical indications of the notifications according to their classification importance.
The notification area may be divided into a plurality of sections, wherein each section is associated with a particular category. The computing device may display notifications with higher ranked classification importance in a more highlighted section of the notification area (e.g., in a top section or foreground section) and the computing device may display notifications with lower ranked classification importance in a less highlighted section of the notification area (e.g., in a bottom section or background section). For example, if the notification area is a notification curtain that expands from an upper edge (e.g., status bar) of the GUI when brought into view, the computing device may display important and ongoing type notifications in the most prominent section (e.g., uppermost area) of the notification curtain, interpersonal type notifications in the next most prominent section (e.g., second uppermost area) of the notification curtain, general type notifications in the middle section of the notification curtain, "incidentally" type notifications in the next least prominent section (e.g., second lowermost area) of the notification curtain, and system informative notifications in the least prominent section (e.g., lowermost area) of the notification curtain. The appropriate classification of notifications may provide the user with information related to the underlying operation of the computing device, and may, for example, immediately indicate the importance of one or more notifications to the operation.
Each notification source may generate various types of notifications and the computing device may use the notification channel to manage notifications. This is to enable an application or service to define categorizations, prioritization, and settings of its own for different types of notifications, which the computing device may enable to define one or more "channels". Each channel may have a corresponding tag, alert setting (e.g., sound, vibration, banner, etc.), prioritization level, channel graphics, and other parameters. Upon generating a notification, an application or service may assign the notification to a particular channel. In this way, the user may be provided with an indication of the manner in which the computing device handles a given notification. This may provide further information about the notification itself and allow efficient interaction in accordance with the knowledge provided thereby. The notification settings menu of the GUI may enable user control of some or all of the notification parameters (e.g., prioritization, alert settings, etc.) for a particular channel and may further enable user control of: how the computing device uses and/or stores personal information that may be associated with the notification such that the personal information remains private or is not stored at all.
Unlike other computing devices that may only output all notifications from a particular application or service using the same label, alert setting, and prioritization level, the computing device may instead use the label, alert setting, and prioritization level for each channel to which the notification belongs to notify from the application or service output. In this way, when an application or service generates notifications for various reasons, the application or service may have finer control over the manner in which its different types of notifications are grouped and/or output as part of the GUI of the computing device.
To further increase availability and reduce interaction time between the user and the notification area, the computing device may display individual notification graphical elements (e.g., channel graphics, notification icons, logocons, or other graphics or images) for each pending notification or each pending notification group in a status bar area of the GUI or other designated area of the GUI. The graphical element may correspond to a category of notification, a channel, and/or other attributes of the notification.
For example, the notification area may be a notification curtain that appears to fold behind the status bar area of the GUI when hidden from view and to unfold behind the status bar area when pulled into view. When collapsed, the computing device may display individual graphical elements of each pending notification in a status bar region. When the notification curtain is deployed, the computing device may animate the graphical element and cause the graphical element to appear to move with the leading edge of the notification curtain as the notification curtain enters the view from behind the status bar. As individual notification messages within the notification curtain enter the view, the computing device may further animate respective graphical elements associated with notifications associated with the individual notification messages to move from a leading edge region of the notification curtain to a region of the notification curtain where the notification messages are displayed. In this way, when the notification area is collapsed, the computing device provides graphical elements in the status bar area as an indication of the number and type of notifications pending. As the notification area expands, the computing device provides an indication of the number and type of pending notifications associated with notification messages that have not been displayed in the notification area by displaying graphical elements in the leading edge area. In this way, interaction with the notification area may be more efficient because the user may be generally notified of the underlying status of a set of pending notifications during the process of expanding or contracting the area. For example, information indicating whether the notification area needs to be further expanded may be provided to the user. In some cases, an indication of the type of notification that has not been displayed in the notification area may be provided to the user to allow an appropriate decision to be made. In addition, animation may be used to demonstrate logical connections between graphical elements and notification areas. By reducing the interactions necessary to discover information about the system, a reduced load may be placed on the computing device.
By managing notifications and outputting indications of notifications as part of a GUI in this manner, example computing devices may improve usability of the GUI, reduce interaction time between users and the GUI when interacting with notifications, and promote more efficient user interactions with notifications. Because of better availability, reduced interaction time, and more efficient user input, example computing devices may generally receive fewer false inputs or fewer inputs than other computing devices that do not manage and output notifications in this manner. Accordingly, the example computing device may perform fewer operations and may consume less power and/or result in a savings in battery power. Additionally, example computing devices may provide a less frustrating and more pleasant user experience.
In one example, a method is described that includes: receiving, by the computing device, a notification generated by the notification source; determining, by the computing device, a set of channels defined by the notification source, each channel having one or more parameters defined by the notification source; and determining, by the computing device, a particular channel from the set of channels assigned to the notification. The method further comprises the steps of: determining, by the computing device, one or more parameters of the particular channel; and outputting, by the computing device, an indication of the notification based on the one or more parameters of the particular channel.
In another example, a computing device is described that includes at least one processor configured to: receiving a notification generated by a notification source; determining a set of channels defined by the notification source, each channel having one or more parameters defined by the notification source; and determining a particular channel from the set of channels assigned to the notification. The at least one processor is further configured to: determining one or more parameters of a particular channel; and outputting an indication of the notification based on one or more parameters of the particular channel.
In another example, a computer program product and/or computer-readable storage medium is described that includes instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor of a computing device to: receiving a notification generated by a notification source; determining a set of channels defined by the notification source, each channel having one or more parameters defined by the notification source; determining a particular channel from a set of channels assigned to the notification; and determining one or more parameters of the particular channel. The instructions, when executed, further cause at least one processor of the computing device to output an indication of the notification in accordance with one or more parameters of the particular channel.
In another example, a system is described that includes means for receiving a notification generated by a notification source; means for determining a set of channels defined by the notification source, each channel having one or more parameters defined by the notification source; and means for determining a particular channel from the set of channels assigned to the notification. The system further comprises: means for determining one or more parameters of the particular channel and means for outputting an indication of the notification based on the one or more parameters of the particular channel.

Detailed Description
FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example computing device configured to group notifications and output an indication of the notifications as part of a graphical user interface, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. In the example of fig. 1, computing device 110 represents an individual mobile or non-mobile computing device. Examples of computing device 110 include a mobile phone, tablet computer, laptop computer, desktop computer, server, mainframe, set-top box, television, wearable device (e.g., computerized watch, computerized glasses, computerized glove, etc.), home automation device or system (e.g., smart thermostat or home assistant device), personal Digital Assistant (PDA), gaming system, media player, electronic book reader, mobile television platform, car navigation or infotainment system, or any other type of mobile, non-mobile, wearable, and non-wearable computing device configured to receive notification data and output an indication of the notification data (e.g., an audible alert, visual alert, tactile alert, voice alert, or other type of indication).
Computing device 110 includes a user interface component ("UIC") 112, a user interface ("UI") module 120, and a notification module 122. Modules 120 and 122 may perform the operations described herein using software, hardware, firmware, or a combination of hardware, software, and firmware resident in computing device 110 and/or executing at computing device 110. Computing device 110 may execute modules 120 and 122 with multiple processors or multiple devices, as virtual machines executing on underlying hardware, as one or more services of an operating system or computing platform, and/or as one or more executable programs at an application layer of a computing platform of computing device 110.
UIC 112 of computing device 110 may serve as an input and/or output device for computing device 110. UIC 112 may be implemented using a variety of techniques. For example, UIC 112 may act as an input device using a presence-sensitive input screen, microphone technology, infrared sensor technology, or other input device technology for receiving user input. UIC 112 may act as an output device configured to use any one or more of a display device, speaker technology, haptic feedback technology, or other output device technology for outputting information to a user.
UIC 112 may detect inputs (e.g., touch and non-touch inputs) from a user of computing device 110. The UIC 112 may detect the indication of the input by detecting one or more gestures performed by the user (e.g., a user touching, pointing and/or swipe with a finger or stylus at or near one or more locations of the UIC 112). UIC 112 may output information to a user in the form of a user interface (e.g., user interface 113) that may be associated with functionality provided by computing device 110.
The notification module 122 may perform functions associated with: at least a portion of notification data generated and/or received by platforms, applications, and services executing at computing device 110 or in communication with computing device 110 is received, managed, and otherwise handled. As used throughout this disclosure, the terms "notification" and "notification data" are used to describe various types of information that may indicate the occurrence of events within the execution environment of computing device 110 (e.g., execution environments including platforms, applications, and services executing at computing device 110 or in communication with computing device 110). For example, the notification may include, but is not limited to, information indicating an event, such as: receiving a communication message (e.g., email, instant message, text message, etc.) through a messaging account associated with computing device 110, receiving information through a social network account associated with computing device 110, a reminder of a calendar event (meeting, appointment) associated with a calendar account of computing device 110, information generated and/or received by a third party application executing at computing device 110 or in communication with computing device 110, transmission and receipt of inter-component communications between two or more components of a platform, application, and/or service executing at computing device 110, or any other information that may be of interest to a user.
The notification module 122 may process the notification when the computing device 110 receives a notification from any device, server, or service executing at the computing device 110 or in communication with the computing device 110 and may distribute portions of the notification to other modules, applications, and/or services executing at the computing device 110 or in communication with the computing device 110. For example, notification module 122 may receive notification data from a mobile phone or computerized watch paired with a network connection of computing device 110. The notification data may include information about events from a calendar application executing at the mobile phone or computerized watch (e.g., reminders about movies that show that the user of the computing device 110 has purchased tickets). In response to receiving the notification data, notification module 122 may send at least a portion of the notification data to UI module 120 along with other information that UI module 120 uses to determine how to cause UIC 112 to display a graphical indication or alert indicating the notification data.
In some examples, notification module 122 may implement a notification queue for processing notifications. Notification module 122 can place the received notification data into a notification queue in a particular order (e.g., first-in first-out, last-in first-out, etc.). Notification module 122 may give access to the notification queue to other applications, services, modules, or platforms executing at computing device 110. In this manner, notification module 122 need only provide the location in memory to the notification queue and other applications, services, platforms, or modules executing at computing device 110 may directly access the incoming notification data. For example, UI module 120 may receive a pointer from notification client module 122 indicating the location of the notification queue in memory of computing device 110. UI module 120 may retrieve and analyze notification data in the notification queue to create aspects of user interface 113.
The notification module 122 can categorize the notifications and rank the notifications in a ranking order of categorization importance. For example, notification module 122 may analyze metadata indicative of notifications of one or more of: title, content, photo, avatar, notification icon, notification source (e.g., application or service generating the notification), sender, time of receipt, expiration time, priority level, type, etc. The notification module 122 can input at least a portion of the metadata of the notification into a model (e.g., a rule-based, machine-learning, or other type of model) to classify the notification as one of: important and ongoing type notifications (e.g., media, ongoing phone or video calls, navigational instructions, screen sharing, timers, alerts, meeting reminders, etc.), interpersonal type notifications (e.g., text messages, email messages, chat messages, missed phone or video calls, voice mail, etc.), "incidentally" type notifications (e.g., promotions, content suggestions, etc.), system informative notifications (e.g., network connection status, battery status, peripheral connection status, indications of whether an application is executing in the background, messages received from an integrated messaging platform configured to display incoming messages and enable interactions with incoming messages regardless of the application currently executing in the foreground of user interface 113, or other system alerts), or general type notifications (e.g., any other type of notification that does not conform to the classification in the other classifications mentioned earlier).
Where notification module 122 or any other portion of computing device 110 stores or uses personal information associated with a user of computing device 110, notification module 122 or any other portion of computing device 110 may only store or use personal information after explicit consent to do so is received from the user (e.g., through a menu setting or obtaining other forms of consent). Computing device 110 may encrypt or otherwise process any personal information being analyzed and/or stored to remove the actual identity of the user before the personal information is stored or used. For example, the information may be processed by notification module 122 such that any personally identifiable information is removed when received from the notification source and stored for later processing.
Some notification sources may generate notifications for various reasons. To enable a notification source to define its own categorizations, prioritization, and settings for its different types of notifications, notification module 122 may enable the notification source to define one or more "channels" associated with the notification source. Each channel is unique to the notification source and may have corresponding tags, alert settings (e.g., sound, vibration, banner, etc.), prioritization levels, channel graphics, and other parameters. Upon generating a notification, the notification source may assign the notification to a particular one of its channels. Notification module 122 can handle notifications according to parameters associated with the notification channel.
Notification module 122 can implement user control and customization of some or all notification parameters (e.g., prioritization, alert settings, etc.) of notifications based on the source of the notification. Notification module 122 may further enable user control and customization of some or all of the notification parameters of the notification based on the channel of the notification.
In general, UI module 120 may manage interactions with and control the display of a user interface (e.g., user interface 113) being presented at UIC 112. For example, UI module 120 may receive information (e.g., notification data) and/or instructions for generating user interface 113 and its elements from various sources (e.g., one or more system platforms, operating systems, applications, modules, and/or services executing at computing device 110 or in communication with computing device 110). In response, UI module 120 may output instructions and information to UIC 112 to cause UIC 112 to display user interface 113. In addition, UI module 120 may receive information from UIC 112 in response to input detected by UIC 112 at the location where the elements of user interface 113 are displayed and propagate information about the input to various destinations (e.g., one or more system platforms, operating systems, applications, modules, and/or services executing at computing device 110 or in communication with computing device 110) for interpreting the input and for causing computing device 110 to perform one or more functions. In some examples, UI module 120 may receive explicit instructions from a source for generating a user interface displayed by UIC 112. However, in other cases, UI module 120 may receive other information (e.g., notification data) and automatically generate a user interface displayed by UIC 112 based on the other information. UI module 120 may automatically generate elements of user interface 113 from notification data obtained by notification module 122.
User interface 113 represents a graphical user interface through which a user of computing device 110 may interact with computing device 110, for example to launch an application executing at computing device 110 or access a service accessible to computing device 110, adjust settings associated with computing device 110, or view a graphical indication of notifications generated by computing device 110 and/or an application executing at computing device 110 or a service accessible to computing device 110. The user interface 113 includes a status bar 114A, an application screen 114B, a favorites region (favorites region) 114C, and a notification region 115. The user interface 113 of fig. 1 is only one example of a graphical user interface, and many other examples of user interfaces 113 that include additional or fewer features than those shown in fig. 1 are present.
Status bar 114A (also sometimes referred to as "energy bar") is a graphical element of user interface 113 that includes time and date information as well as status icons and other icons from which a user may view the current status of various system-level features of computing device 110. For example, status bar 114A includes various network connectivity icons, battery power icons, and the like.
The application screen 114B is such a page or screen of the user interface 113: from the page or the screen, the user may launch or otherwise interact with an application executing at the computing device 110 or a service accessible to the computing device 110. The application screen 114B may be a home screen that includes widgets, launch icons, background images, or other features. The application screen 114B may include a plurality of pages or screens. Application screen 114B may be any type of user interface screen associated with an application or service executing at computing device 110. In the example of fig. 1, application screen 114B is the home screen of the operating platform of computing device 110 and includes various launch icons, such as launch icon 118, which launch icon 118, if selected (e.g., detected by UIC 112 at the location of UID 112 where the particular launch icon is displayed in response to user input), may cause computing device 110 to execute a particular application or service associated with the particular launch icon.
The favorites region 114C is another region of the user interface 113 from which a user can launch an application executing at the computing device 110 or a service accessible to the computing device 110. The favorites region 114C can include a subset of launch icons accessible from the application screen 114B of FIG. 1. The favorites region 114C can be customizable by a user and can include one or more launch icons of applications executing at the computing device 110 or services accessible to the computing device 110 that are most commonly accessed.
Regardless of whether the startup icon is displayed on application screen 114B or in favorites area 114C, the startup icon may include a notification logo, such as notification logo 119. Although this logocon 119 is shown at a different location that partially overlaps with application icons 118, it may all be positioned in the same relative location with respect to each application icon 118. Notification module 122 can receive notifications generated by applications executing at computing device 110 or services accessible to computing device 110 and, after processing the notifications, send notification data and other information to UI module 120 that cause UI module 120 to display a graphical indication of the notifications at UIC 112 as notification logocons displayed adjacent to or as part of the launch icon of the application or service generating the notifications. For example, notification module 122 may receive a notification generated by an application or service associated with startup icon 118 and cause UI module 120 to update the display of user interface 113 at UIC 112 to include notification logo 119 adjacent to startup icon 118 to alert the user of computing device 110 of the notification generated by the application or service associated with startup icon 118.
Notification area 115 is such an area of user interface 113: which is configured to display a graphical indication of the notification as a notification message, such as notification message 116, and a notification graphical element (e.g., a channel graphic, notification icon, logocon, or other graphic or image), such as notification icon 117. Notification area 115 may be a solid, opaque or translucent notification pane, notification window, or notification curtain that shows notification messages and/or notification graphical elements for each notification received by notification module 122 that has not been viewed, read, listened to, or otherwise cleared. For example, if notification module 122 receives a notification, notification module 122 and UI module 120 may cause notification area 115 to include notification message 116, which notification message 116 may include one or more graphical elements (e.g., icons, actionable elements, avatars, etc.), text (e.g., notification source, title, content, or other information), and/or other content displayed within the message preview.
A user may interact with a particular notification message from notification area 115 by providing input at or near the location where UIC 112 displays the notification message. For example, in response to UIC 112 detecting a gesture input at or near the location of UIC 112 where notification message 116 is displayed, UI module 120 may cause notification message 116 to appear to expand from a collapsed state to an expanded state to show a greater amount of information when displayed by UIC 112.
In the example of fig. 1, notification area 115 is a notification curtain that appears to fold behind the status bar area of the GUI when notification area 115 is hidden from view and to expand in front of application screen 114B when pulled into and expanded into view. For example, in response to detecting the user input 106 (shown in fig. 1 as a downward drag gesture being performed by a stylus or finger at or near the location of the UIC 112 where the user interface 113 is displayed), the UI module 120 may cause the display of the notification area 115 at the UIC 112 to appear to expand from behind the status bar 114A and increase in size by an amount proportional to the length of the user input 106. As UI module 120 causes notification area 115 to appear expanded while being displayed by UIC 112, notification messages contained within notification area 115 may become visible from behind status bar 114A.
In some examples, when UI module 120 causes notification area 115 to appear hidden or folded behind status bar 114A, UI module 120 may cause UIC 112 to include a notification graphical element, such as notification graphical element 117, within status bar 114A for each pending notification received by notification module 122. As UI module 120 causes notification area 115A to appear to be expanded from under status bar 114A, UI module 120 may cause UIC 112 to animate the notification graphical element previously displayed within status bar 114A by: such that the notification graphical element moves with the leading edge of the notification area 115 as the notification area 115 enters the view from behind the status bar 114. As each notification message within notification area 115 enters a view at UIC 112, UI module 120 may cause UIC 112 to display a notification graphical element, such as graphical element 117, that is displayed within and corresponds to the leading edge region of notification area 115 to be displayed as animated moving from the leading edge region of notification area 115 and entering the notification message. In this way, when notification area 115 is collapsed, UI module 120 causes UIC 112 to display notification graphical elements in status bar area 114A as an indication of the number and type of notifications pending. As notification area 115 is expanded, UI module 120 provides an indication of the number and type of pending notifications associated with notification messages in notification area 115 that have not been displayed (or that remain collapsed behind status bar 114A) by displaying a notification graphical element, such as element 117, in the leading edge region of notification area 115.
Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example computing device configured to handle notifications and output indications of notifications as part of a graphical user interface in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. As an example of computing device 110 of fig. 1, computing device 210 of fig. 2 is described below. Fig. 2 illustrates only one particular example of computing device 210, and many other examples of computing device 210 may be used under other instances and may include a subset of the components included in example computing device 210 or may include additional components not shown in fig. 2.
As shown in the example of fig. 2, computing device 210 includes a User Interface Component (UIC) 212, one or more processors 240, one or more communication units 242, one or more input components 244, one or more output components 246, and one or more storage components 248.UIC 212 includes an output component 202 and an input component 204. Storage component 248 of computing device 210 includes notification queue 232, application modules 230A-230N (collectively, "application modules 230") and operating platform 228 including notification module 222 and UI module 120. The notification module 222 includes a classification module 224 and a channel module 226.
Communication channel 250 may interconnect each of components 212, 240, 242, 244, 246, and 248 for inter-component communication (physically, communicatively, and/or operatively). In some examples, communication channel 250 may include a system bus, a network connection, an interprocess communication data structure, or any other method for communicating data.
The one or more communication units 242 of the computing device 210 may communicate with external devices via one or more wired and/or wireless networks by transmitting and/or receiving network signals over one or more networks. Examples of communication unit 242 include a network interface card (e.g., such as an ethernet card), an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, a GPS receiver, or any other type of device that can send and/or receive information. Other examples of communication unit 242 may include a short wave radio, a cellular data radio, a wireless network radio, and a Universal Serial Bus (USB) controller.
One or more input components 244 of computing device 210 may receive input. Examples of inputs are tactile inputs, audio inputs, and video inputs. In one example, the input component 242 of the computing device 210 includes a presence-sensitive input device (e.g., touch-sensitive screen, PSD), a mouse, a voice response system, a video camera, a microphone, or any other type of device for detecting input from a person or machine. In some examples, the input component 242 may include one or more sensor components, one or more position sensors (GPS component, wi-Fi component, cellular component), one or more temperature sensors, one or more motion sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope), one or more pressure sensors (e.g., barometer), one or more ambient light sensors, and one or more other sensors (e.g., microphone, camera, infrared proximity sensor, hygrometer, etc.). Other sensors may include heart rate sensors, magnetometers, glucose sensors, hygrometer sensors, olfactory sensors, compass sensors, step counter sensors, to name a few other non-limiting examples.
One or more output components 246 of computing device 110 may generate output. Examples of outputs are haptic outputs, audio outputs and video outputs. In one example, output component 246 of computing device 210 includes a PSD, a sound card, a video graphics adapter card, speakers, a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), or any other type of device for generating output for a person or machine.
The UIC 212 of the computing device 210 may be similar to the UIC 112 of the computing device 110 and includes an output component 202 and an input component 204. The output component 202 may be a display component, such as a screen on which the UIC 212 displays information, and the input component 204 may be a touch sensitive input component, such as a capacitive sensor, that detects objects at and/or near the output component 202. The output component 202 and the input component 204 may be a speaker and microphone pair or any other combination of one or more input and output components, such as the input component 244 and the output component 244. In the example of fig. 2, UIC 212 may present a user interface (such as user interface 113 of fig. 1).
As one example range, presence-sensitive input component 204 may detect an object, such as one or more fingers, a stylus, or one or more other input units within two inches or less of output component 202. The input component 204 may determine the location (e.g., [ x, y ] coordinates) of the detected object of the output component 202. In another example range, the input component 204 may detect objects that are 6 inches or less than 6 inches from the output component 202, although other ranges are possible. The input component 204 may use capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques to determine the position of the output component 202 selected by the user's finger. In some examples, the input component 204 also provides output to the user using the haptic, auditory, or visual stimuli described with respect to the output component 202.
UIC 212 of computing device 210 may detect as input a two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional gesture from a user of computing device 210. For example, the sensor of the UIC 212 may detect movement of the user (e.g., moving one or more hands, arms, fingers, other body parts, pens, styluses, etc.) within a threshold distance of the UIC 212. UIC 212 may determine a two-dimensional or three-dimensional vector representation of motion and correlate the vector representation with gesture inputs having multiple dimensions (e.g., hand-wave), pinch, tap (clip), stroke, etc.). In other words, UIC 212 may detect multi-dimensional gestures without requiring the user to gesture at or near a screen or surface where UIC 212 outputs information for display. Instead, UIC 212 is able to detect multi-dimensional gestures performed at or near a sensor that may or may not be near a screen or surface where UIC 212 outputs information for display.
While shown as an internal component of computing device 210, UIC 212 may also represent an external component that shares a data path with computing device 210 to transmit and/or receive inputs and outputs. For example, in one example, UIC 212 represents a built-in component of computing device 210 that is located within and physically connected to an external enclosure of computing device 210 (e.g., a screen on a mobile phone). In another example, UIC 212 represents an external component of computing device 210 that is located outside of and physically separate from an enclosure or housing of computing device 210 (e.g., a monitor, projector, etc. that shares a wired and/or wireless data path with computing device 210).
One or more storage components 248 within computing device 210 may store information for processing during operation of computing device 210 (e.g., computing device 210 may store notification queue 232 and data accessed by modules 220, 222, 224, 226, and 230 and operating platform 228 during execution at computing device 210). In some examples, the storage component 248 is temporary storage, meaning that the primary purpose of the storage component 248 is not long-term storage. The storage component 248 on the computing device 210 may be configured to: as volatile memory for short-term storage of information, stored content cannot be saved if powered off. Examples of volatile memory include Random Access Memory (RAM), dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), static Random Access Memory (SRAM), and other forms of volatile memory known in the art.
In some examples, storage component 248 further includes one or more computer-readable storage media. In some examples, storage component 248 includes one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media. The storage component 248 may be configured to store larger amounts of information than is typically stored by volatile memory. The storage component 248 may be further configured to store information as a non-volatile memory space for long periods of time and to retain information after power on/off cycles. Examples of non-volatile memory include magnetic hard disks, optical disks, floppy disks, flash memory, or the form of electrically programmable memory (EPROM) or Electrically Erasable Programmable (EEPROM) memory. Storage component 248 can store program instructions and/or information (e.g., data) associated with notification queue 232, modules 220, 222, 224, 226, and 230, and operating platform 228. Storage component 248 may include memory configured to store data or other information associated with notification queue 232, modules 220, 222, 224, 226, and 230, and operating platform 228.
The one or more processors 240 may implement functionality associated with the computing device 210 and/or execute instructions associated with the computing device 210. Examples of processor 240 include an application processor, a display controller, an auxiliary processor, one or more sensor hubs, and any other hardware configured to act as a processor, a processing unit, or a processing device. The modules 220, 222, 224, 226, and 230, and the operating platform 228 are operable by the processor 240 to perform various actions, operations, or functions of the computing device 210. For example, the processor 240 of the computing device 210 may retrieve and execute instructions stored by the storage component 248 that cause the processor 240 to perform operations described herein as being attributed to the modules 220, 222, 224, 226, and 230, and the operating platform 228. The instructions, when executed by the processor 240, may cause the computing device 210 to store information within the storage component 248, for example, at the notification queue 232.
Application module 230 represents any source of notifications that execute at computing device 210 or that are accessible from computing device 210. For example, the application module 230 may include a messaging application, a social media application, a calendar application, a gaming application, a digital assistant application, a keyboard application, an application extension, or any other type of application configured to execute at the computing device 210. The application module 230 may be a cloud-based application accessible from the computing device 210 but executing at a remote server in a cloud network environment. The application module 230 may generate notification data that is received by the notification module 222 and stored as notifications at the notification queue 233.
Notification queue 232 represents any suitable storage medium for storing and buffering notification data. For example, notification queue 232 may be a queue, stack, or type of data structure for buffering that organizes notification data as time passes when notification data is received by notification module 222. UI module 220 may access notification queue 232 and generate elements of a user interface, such as user interface 113, based on notification data stored at notification queue 232. The notification module 222 may perform read/write operations to add information to the notification queue 232 (e.g., when notification data is received) or remove information from the notification queue 232 (e.g., when a user provides input to dismiss a notification alert, etc.).
The operating platform 228 manages computing resources of the computing device 212. The operating platform 228, also referred to as an operating system, the operating platform 228 manages interactions between the modules 220, 222, 224, 226, and 230, the notification queue 232, and the components 202, 204, 212, 240, 242, 244, 246, and 248. For example, the operating platform 228 may perform time sharing or scheduling tasks to ensure that each of the modules 220, 222, 224, 226, and 230 is allocated a percentage of the processing time of the processor 240 or may efficiently access information stored at the storage component 248 or any other of the components 202, 204, 212, 242, 244, and 246. In other words, the operating platform 228 may act as an intermediary between software, hardware, and firmware executing at the computing device 210 or accessible by the computing device 210. In some examples, the operating platform 228 is the only executable application of the computing device 210 that generates, receives, manages, or otherwise handles notification data and its presentation. For example, rather than by means of multiple specialized programs or applications, the operating platform 228 of the computing device 210 may control all operations and functions related to the notification and presentation of information associated with the notification data at the UIC 212 through the use of the UI module 220 and the notification module 222.
Notification module 222 may include all of the functionality of notification module 122 of computing device 110 of fig. 1 and may perform operations similar to notification module 222 for receiving, managing, and otherwise handling at least a portion of notification data generated and/or received by platforms, applications, and services executing at computing device 210 or in communication with computing device 210. As shown in FIG. 2, the notification module 222 may be part of the operating platform 228 or associated with the operating platform 228. For example, notification module 222 may be a sub-module, service, or activity of operating platform 228, as opposed to a separate module or application of computing device 210.
The notification module 222 may receive notification data (e.g., as information obtained by the communication unit 242 from a different computing device, as information obtained from one of the application modules 230, etc.) and store the notification data at the notification queue 232. Notification module 222 may output portions of the notification data it receives to UI module 220 and/or provide UI module 220 with access to notification queue 232. For example, notification module 222 can share a memory pointer with UI module 220 that points to the location of notification queue 232 within storage component 248 and allow UI module 220 to access data stored at the location (e.g., to automatically generate a graphical element, UI module 220 causes UIC 212 to display the graphical element as user interface 113).
The classification module 224 of the notification module 222 may classify the notifications and rank the notifications in a ranking order of classification importance. For example, notification module 222 can analyze notification data to determine a title, content, avatar, notification icon, notification source (e.g., application or service generating the notification), sender, time of receipt, expiration time, priority level, type, and other information about the notification.
The classification module 224 may execute a rule-based, machine-learning, or other type of model for classifying notification data into one of several different importance categories. The model may be any type of machine learning or artificial intelligence based model that is trained (e.g., based on heuristics and/or past user interaction data associated with computing device 210 and other computing devices) to classify notifications. The model may use heuristics to determine the importance and category of notifications. For example, the notification source may be a factor by which the classification module 224 quantifies the category importance of the notification (e.g., navigation application notifications may be considered more important than application updates or new feature notifications). Whether the application source is running as a foreground process may be a factor for determining the importance of the notification. That is, the application module 230 running in the foreground may be rated higher or more important than the application module 230 executing as a background process.
The classification module 224 may determine that the most important or highest ranked importance category of notifications is an "important and in progress" type of notification, which is typically time sensitive or applicable to the user's current context (e.g., location, time of day, user's current task, etc.). "important and ongoing" type notifications include notifications about: regarding the media (e.g., games, videos, music, etc.) currently being output by computing device 210, phone or video calls currently in progress via computing device 210, navigation instructions currently being output by computing device 210, screen sharing functions of computing device 210, timers or alerts set by computing device 210, calendar or meeting reminders output by computing device 210, and the like.
The classification module 224 may determine that the second most important or next to the highest ranked importance category of notifications is an "interpersonal" type notification that involves some form of back and forth messaging communication between two people or groups of people in addition to a telephone or video call. For example, classification module 224 may determine that notifications related to text messages, email messages, chat messages, missed telephone or video calls, voice mails, etc. are all types of inter-person type notifications.
The classification module 224 may determine that the second least significant or least significant category of notifications is a "mention-by-mention" type notification that is informative, but not necessarily related to any ongoing communications or current tasks. For example, the classification module 224 may determine that notifications related to promotions, advertisements, and content suggestions are all of the type of the incidentally mentioned type of notification.
The classification module 224 may determine that the second least significant or least significant category of notifications is a system informative notification. Examples of system informative notifications include information about: software updates (e.g., operating system updates, application updates, etc.), network connection status, battery status, peripheral connection status, currently executing application status, messages received from an integrated messaging platform configured to display and enable interaction with incoming messages regardless of the application currently executing in the foreground of user interface 113, and other system alerts.
The classification module 224 may determine that the middle ranked importance category of the notification is a "normal" type notification. The classification module 224 may determine that any notification that is not any of an important and ongoing type notification, an interpersonal type notification, an incidentally mentioned type notification, or a system informative notification is a normal type notification that should be ranked neither high nor low relative to other types of notifications.
Some notification sources may generate notifications for various reasons. To enable a notification source to define its own categorization, prioritization, and settings for its different types of notifications, the channel module 226 of the notification module 222 may enable any of the application modules 230 to define one or more "channels" associated with that application module 230. Each channel is unique to a particular application module 230 and may have corresponding tags, alert settings (e.g., sound, vibration, banner, etc.), prioritization levels, channel graphics, and other parameters. In generating the notification, one of the application modules 230 that generated the notification (e.g., application module 230A) may assign the notification to a particular one of the channels associated with that application module 230A. Channel module 226 can interpret the channel parameters and cause notification module 222 to handle notifications according to parameters associated with the channels of application module 230A.
While notification module 222 may enable user control and customization of some or all of the notification parameters (e.g., prioritization, alert settings, etc.) of the notifications based on the source of the notifications, channel module 226 may further enable user control and customization of some or all of the notification parameters of the notifications based on the channels of the notifications. For example, channel module 226 may manage user inputs detected at a settings page of a user interface, such as user interface 113, to determine values associated with parameters of the channel.
Where notification module 222 or any other portion of computing device 210 stores or uses personal information (e.g., notification information, communications, contacts, context information, etc.) associated with a user of computing device 210, notification module 222 or any other portion of computing device 210 may only store or use the personal information after receiving explicit consent to do so from the user (e.g., through a menu setting or obtaining other forms of consent). Computing device 210 may encrypt or otherwise handle any personal information being analyzed and/or stored to remove the actual identity of the user before storing or using the personal information. For example, the information may be handled by the notification module 222 such that any personally identifiable information is removed when received from the notification source and stored for later processing.
Channel module 226 of notification module 222 can provide an Application Programming Interface (API) through which any of application modules 230 can define one or more corresponding notification channels specific to the application or notification source. That is, the channel module 226 may provide a mechanism (e.g., an API) by which a developer of one of the application modules 230 may provide an indication of various types of notifications that may be generated by that application module 230. The channel module 226 may enable the application module 230 to define channels during compilation or dynamically (e.g., at runtime).
For example, the social media application may generate a promotional notification (e.g., to alert the user of new features of the social media service), a profile update notification, an incoming message notification, an exchange request notification, or various other types of notifications associated with the social media service. The social media application may define channels via the APIs provided by the channel module 226 for each type of notification it generates, thereby enabling user control of categorizing, prioritizing, and setting each different type of social media notification.
UI module 220 may include all of the functionality of UI module 120 of computing device 110 of fig. 1 and may perform operations similar to UI module 120 for managing a user interface (e.g., user interface 113) provided by computing device 210 at UIC 212 for handling inputs from and outputs to a user. For example, UI module 220 may generate instructions or commands to cause UIC 212 to display user interface 113 and its elements based on notification data and other information obtained by notification module 222. Similar to the case of notification module 222, UI module 220 may be part of operating platform 228 or associated with operating platform 228. For example, UI module 220 may be a sub-module, service, or activity of operating platform 228, as opposed to a separate module or application of computing device 210.
UI module 220 may analyze the notification data as it is received and store the notification data at notification queue 232 and update (in response to receiving a command from notification module 222) the elements of user interface 113 such that UIC 212 displays a graphical indication of the notification (e.g., as a notification logo, notification message, or other type of graphical indication) immediately after the notification is generated and/or received.
FIG. 3A is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example graphical user interface presented by an example computing device configured to display notification logos and notification previews, according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 3A is described below in the context of computing device 210 of fig. 2.
FIG. 3A illustrates user interface 313 as an example user interface that may be displayed by computing device 210. UI module 220 and notification module 222 of computing device 210 may cause UIC 212 to output user interface 313 for display. The user interface 313 includes a status bar 314A, an application screen 314B, and a favorites area 314C. Displayed within application screen 314B, user interface 313 includes a launch icon 318 that represents a graphical element associated with the notification source. Displayed at or near the start icon 318 is a notification logo 319. Although shown in the example of fig. 3A as being displayed within application screen 314B, startup icon 318 and notification logo 319 may be displayed in favorites area 314C or some other portion of user interface 313.
The user may provide a first type of user input (e.g., a tap gesture) at or near the location of UIC 212 where launch icon 318 is displayed. UI module 220 may interpret the first type of user input as selection of launch icon 318 to cause computing device 210 to execute an input of an application or service associated with launch icon 318. The user may provide a second type of user input 306 (e.g., a long press gesture) at or near the location of the UIC 212 where the start icon 318 is displayed. UI module 220 may interpret the second type of user input 306 as selection of launch icon 318 to cause computing device 210 to display input of notification area 315, which notification area 315 is a notification preview window that includes notification messages 316A-316D (collectively, "notification messages 316") in the example of fig. 3A. Each of the notification messages 316 corresponds to a different pending notification received by the notification module 222 from the notification source associated with the start icon 318.
Through notification area 315, a user of computing device 220 may interact with notification message 316 in the same manner that the user interacted with the notification message if the notification message was displayed in a notification curtain, such as notification area 115 of FIG. 1. For example, the user may provide gesture input at or near the location of UIC 212 where notification message 316D is displayed to cause notification message 316D to expand and show more content than notification messages 316A-316C shown in the collapsed view. Computing device 210 may implement an in-line action from notification area 315. Computing device 210 may interpret the input detected at notification area 315 as corresponding to a user command that causes computing device 210 to perform an action on the notification corresponding to any of notification messages 316. In some examples, computing device 210 may clear the corresponding notification in response to detecting one or more inputs, reply to the corresponding notification (e.g., if the notification is a messaging notification), flag or save the corresponding notification such that the notification remains pending, forward the notification, block the notification, adjust settings of the notification, or any other action that may be performed on the notification from the notification area or notification curtain.
In some examples, notification logo 319 can be animated to move into notification area 315. That is, UI module 220 may cause notification area 315 to appear to grow or expand from notification logo 319 in response to detecting a long press gesture at or near the location where start icon 318 is displayed. For example, notification area 315 may appear to grow outward from launch icon 318 to show notification message 316 in response to a long press.
Fig. 3B is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example notification logo from the example graphical user interface of fig. 3A, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 3A is described below in the context of computing device 210 of fig. 2.
Fig. 3B includes notification logos 319A-319F as example notification logos displayed adjacent to initiating icon 318 or as part of initiating icon 318. However, unlike typical notification logos that may be displayed by other computing devices that merely indicate the total amount of currently pending notifications for applications or services associated with the launch icon, notification logos 319A-319F include information (e.g., graphical information, text, images, graphics, icons, avatars, etc.) reflecting the content of the pending notifications represented by the notification logos, the categories to which the notifications are assigned, and/or the channels associated with the notifications.
For example, notification logo 319A includes a messaging icon to indicate: the pending notification associated with the launch icon 318 is associated with a new message channel of the application or service that generated the pending notification. Notification logo 319B includes a persona icon to indicate: the pending notification associated with the launch icon 318 is an interpersonal type notification (e.g., classified by the notification module 222). Notification logo 319C includes a like icon to indicate: the pending notification associated with the start icon 318 is an approval feedback notification. Notification logo 319D includes a birthday cake icon to indicate: the pending notification associated with the start icon 318 is associated with an important and ongoing event reminder notification (e.g., a birthday for a friend or family member). Notification logos 319E and 319F include graphical elements associated with a person or user to indicate: the pending notification associated with the launch icon 318 is associated with a particular person or user (e.g., a particular person or user from an address book of the computing device 210) that is the sender of the communication (e.g., an email, chat message, instant message, text message, video message, voice mail, or any other type of communication from the sender). For example, the logos 319E and 319F may be photographs, avatars, or other graphical elements (e.g., images, graphics, emoticons, pictograms, etc.) indicating the person and user associated with the pending notification.
As shown in fig. 3B, even though the initiator icon 318 is associated with a single application or service, the computing device 210 may cause the initiator icon 318 to have different types of notification logos, such as notification logos 319A-319D, that reflect the content, category, or channel of the pending notification. Displaying notification logos that reflect the content of pending notifications may minimize anxiety and/or confusion for some users because other types of notification logos are seen.
Fig. 4 is a flowchart illustrating example operations performed by an example computing device configured to display notification logos and notification previews, according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. FIG. 4 is described below in the context of computing device 210 of FIG. 2.
Computing device 210 may receive a notification (402). Computing device 210 may determine the content of the notification (404). For example, notification module 222 may receive a notification from application 230A and store the notification at notification queue 233.
Computing device 210 may determine a logo reflecting the content of the notification (406). For example, the classification module 224 may determine that the notification is a message from a family member about a birthday party and in response, classify the notification as an interpersonal type notification and the notification module 222 may assign the notification a notification logo that appears as the notification logo 319B of fig. 3B to the notification.
Computing device 210 may determine any other pending notifications associated with the source of the notification (408). If other notifications associated with the source of the notification are not currently pending (408, no branch), computing device 210 may display a logo at or near the graphical element used to initiate the source of the notification (412). However, if other notifications associated with the source of the notification are currently pending (408, yes branch), computing device 210 may update the logo to reflect the content of the notification and other notifications that are currently pending (410).
For example, notification module 222 may search notification queue 232 for other notifications associated with search application module 230A. In response to identifying the second pending notification associated with application module 230A, notification module 222 can determine a notification logo that reflects the content of the two pending notifications. The second notification may be an event reminder or calendar appointment for a birthday party mentioned in the message from the family member. The notification module 222 may determine that the two notifications are related to a party or birthday and thus assign a notification logo to the notification that appears as the notification logo 319D of fig. 3B. In the event that two or more notifications are irrelevant, notification module 222 can determine a notification logo that is generic to the notification source and/or the different notifications. For example, if the notification is associated with two unrelated messages, the notification module 222 can determine that the notification logo is a generic message logo, rather than a message related to only one or both of the notifications.
Computing device 210 may display a logo at or near the graphical element used to initiate the source of the notification (412). For example, notification module 222 may send instructions to UI module 220 that cause UI module 220 to display notification logo 319D at or near the location of UIC 212 within user interface 313 where start icon 318 is displayed.
Computing device 210 may detect a long press gesture of a graphical element that selects a source for initiating the notification (414). For example, UI module 220 may receive information from UIC 212 indicating that long press gesture 306 was detected at the location of UIC 212 where launch icon 318 is displayed.
Computing device 210 may display a notification preview that includes a notification and a respective notification message for each of the other pending notifications (416). For example, rather than launching an application or service associated with launch icon 318 in response to gesture 306 (e.g., as UI module 220 may do when gesture 306 is a short press gesture), UI module 220 may cause UIC 212 to display notification area 315 that includes notification messages 316A and 316B corresponding to two pending notifications generated by application module 230A.
FIG. 5 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example graphical user interface presented by an example computing device configured to classify and display notification messages according to a classification order, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. FIG. 5 is described below in the context of computing device 210 of FIG. 2.
FIG. 5 illustrates a user interface 513 as an example user interface that may be displayed by the computing device 210. UI module 220 and notification module 222 of computing device 210 may cause UIC 212 to output user interface 513 for display. The user interface 513 includes a status bar 514A, an application screen 514B, and a favorites area 514C. The user interface 513 includes a notification area 515 (e.g., a notification pane) that overlays the front or top of the application screen 514B and extends from below the status bar 514A. Within notification area 515 are notification messages 516A through 516E. Notification message 516A represents one or more notification messages of an "important and in progress" notification. Notification message 516B represents one or more notification messages for an "interpersonal" notification. Notification message 516C represents one or more notification messages of a "normal" notification. Notification message 516D represents one or more notification messages that "mention" the notification. Notification message 516E represents one or more notification messages for a "system informative" notification.
Notification module 222 and UI module 220 may cause UIC 212 to display notification messages 516 in the order shown in fig. 5, provided that not all notifications are equally important to the user and therefore should not be presented equally (e.g., in chronological order, etc.). Conversely, notification area 515 may allow users to more easily identify what is important to and act on notification area 515 at the moment they view it. Notification area 515 relies on consistent spatial and visual cues separating different categories of notifications to create a better hierarchy within notification area 515.
Computing device 210 displays notification message 516A of importance and in-progress notification more prominently than other notification messages. That is, notification message 516A is displayed at the top of notification area 515 such that notification message 516A is first displayed when notification area 515 is expanded into view. This allows the user to identify what is important at that time and take action on it. A developer may enable his application to get the appropriate prominence for a notification that is worth noting (serving) without requiring a custom pay-out. The notification module 222 may enable an application to self-designate notifications as "important and in progress" notifications.
Computing device 210 may display notification message 516B of the interpersonal notification less prominently than the important and ongoing notifications, but more prominently than other notifications. That is, notification message 516B is displayed second from the top of notification area 515 such that notification message 516B is displayed second when notification area 515 is expanded into view. This may allow the user to identify open conversations with other users and provide a faster way of replying.
The computing device 210 displays the notification message 516D of the incidentally-mentioned notification less prominently than important and in-progress notifications and less prominently than interpersonal and general notifications but more prominently than the system informative notifications. That is, notification message 516B is displayed second from the bottom of notification area 515. This may weaken the emphasis on these less important notifications so that the user may focus on other more important notifications that are more likely to be of interest.
Fig. 6 is a flowchart illustrating example operations performed by an example computing device configured to classify and display messages in a classification order, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 6 is described below in the context of computing device 210 of fig. 2.
Computing device 210 may receive one or more notifications (602). For example, notification module 222 may receive one or more notifications generated by application module 230.
Computing device 210 may classify each of the one or more notifications as one of: importance and ongoing, personal, general, incidentally, or system informativeness (604). For example, the classification module 224 may classify each of the one or more notifications using a heuristic-based model, a machine learning model, or other type of model.
Computing device 210 may group one or more notifications according to category (606). For example, notification module 222 can tag or otherwise designate each notification stored at notification queue 232 with its corresponding category.
Computing device 210 may receive user input for displaying a notification area of a graphical user interface (608). For example, UI module 220 may receive information from UIC 212 that instructs a user of computing device 210 to provide input to display notification area 515 of user interface 513.
The computing device 210 may display the notification area such that the notification messages of the system informative notifications are most unobtrusively displayed, the notification messages of the mentioning notifications are more prominently displayed as compared to the notification messages of the system informative notifications, the notification messages of the ordinary notifications are more prominently displayed as compared to the notification messages of the mentioning notifications, the notification messages of the interpersonal notifications are more prominently displayed as compared to the notification messages of the ordinary notifications, and the notification messages of the important and ongoing notifications are more prominently displayed as compared to the notification messages of the interpersonal notifications (610). For example, UI module 220 may retrieve pending notifications stored at notification queue 232 and cause UIC 212 to display the notifications within a particular region of notification area 515 defined by the category labels of the notifications. UI module 220 may cause notifications labeled with "important and in progress" names to be more prominently displayed, and so on for each other category of notifications.
FIG. 7 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example graphical user interface presented by an example computing device configured to enable a notification source to define one or more notification channels, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 7 is described below in the context of computing device 210 of fig. 2.
FIG. 7 illustrates a user interface 713 as an example user interface that may be displayed by computing device 210. UI module 220 and notification module 222 of computing device 210 may cause UIC 212 to output user interface 713 for display. User interface 713 is a generic settings menu provided by computing device 210 to each notification source. Rather than enabling notification sources to have their own uniquely defined notification settings screens, notification module 222 may cause computing device 210 to present a standardized settings screen similar to user interface 713 for each notification source. The standardized setting screen can enable user control of notification settings of the notification source as a whole or finer level control of individual channels. That is, the user may provide input at the user interface 713 to enable or disable notification of the entire application source or notification of each individual channel defined by the application source. In this way, notifications from a single notification source can have different properties or parameters defined by the parameters assigned to the channel to which each notification belongs. Examples of parameters include: color, ringing tone, vibration pattern, vibration intensity, sound attribute, importance level or priority level, icon, graphic element, font size, or any other parameter defining how to output an audible, graphical, and/or tactile indication of the notification. The notification source no longer has to set up common notifications for all of its notifications.
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating example operations performed by an example computing device configured to enable a notification source to define one or more notification channels, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 8 is described below in the context of computing device 210 of fig. 2.
Computing device 210 may receive a notification generated by a notification source (802). For example, notification module 222 may receive notifications from application module 230B.
Computing device 210 may determine a set of channels defined by the notification source, each channel having one or more parameters defined by the notification source (804). For example, before generating the notification, application module 230B may interact with channel module 226 via an API to define one or more channels of its notification. The application module 230B may assign values to the parameters of each channel through the API and send the values and parameters to the channel module 226. Channel module 226 may store channel values and parameters.
Computing device 210 may determine a particular channel from a set of channels to assign to the notification (806). For example, notification module 222 may analyze metadata associated with the notification from application module 230B to determine the particular channel to which it is assigned.
Computing device 210 may determine one or more parameters for the particular channel (808). For example, channel module 226 may look up one or more parameters of the channel determined from the metadata of the notification.
Computing device 210 may output an indication of the notification based on one or more parameters of the particular channel (810). For example, notification module 222 may store notification data at notification queue 232 along with one or more parameters of a particular channel such that when UI module 220 retrieves a notification for subsequent output as an indication as part of a user interface, UI module 220 may cause the indication of the notification to be output and to have characteristics defined by the one or more parameters of the particular channel.
Fig. 9A-9F are conceptual diagrams illustrating an example graphical user interface presented by an example computing device configured to display notification graphical elements within a notification area of the graphical user interface, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 9A-9F are described below in the context of computing device 210 of fig. 2.
Fig. 9A-9F illustrate user interface 913 as an example user interface that may be displayed by computing device 210. UI module 220 and notification module 222 of computing device 210 may cause UIC 212 to output user interface 913 for display. User interface 913 includes status bar 914A, application screen 914B, and favorites region 914C.
Fig. 9A shows notification graphic elements 917A through 917D (collectively, "notification graphic elements 917") that are displayed as a set of graphic elements within the status bar 914A. Each notification graphic element 917 within the set of graphic elements corresponds to a pending notification or a group of pending notifications. The user may provide a swipe gesture 906 to cause the computing device 210 to display a notification area 915.
FIG. 9B illustrates the manner in which notification area 915 (e.g., notification pane) extends downward from underneath status bar 914A in response to swipe gesture 906. Fig. 9B further shows: upon notification area 915A entering the view, UI module 220 may cause UIC 212 to no longer display the set of graphical elements 917 within status bar 914A, but instead within notification area 915 near the leading edge of notification area 915A.
As also shown in fig. 9B, as notification message 916A enters the view, graphical elements 917A corresponding to notifications associated with notification message 916A, among a set of graphical elements 917 displayed near the leading edge of notification region 915, are removed from the set of graphical elements 917 and animated to move into position within notification message 916A. In this way, the user is prompted for the fact that: graphic element 917A corresponds to notification message 916A. Also, by counting the remaining graphic elements in the set of graphic elements 917, the user can obtain visual confirmation as to the number of remaining (undeployed) notification messages left within the notification area 91A.
Also shown in fig. 9C, as the size (e.g., length) of gesture 906 increases, UI module 220 may cause the size (e.g., length) of notification area 915 to increase proportionally. When notification message 916B enters the view, graphical element 917B, corresponding to the notification associated with notification message 916B, of a set of graphical elements 917 displayed near the leading edge of notification region 915 is removed from the set of graphical elements 917 and animated to move into position within notification message 916B.
Also shown in fig. 9D and 9E, as the size of gesture 906 further increases, UI module 220 may further increase the size of notification area 915. When notification message 916C is brought into view in fig. 9D, graphical elements 917C of the set of graphical elements 917 displayed near the leading edge of notification area 915 that correspond to notifications associated with notification message 916C are removed from the set of graphical elements 917 and animated to move into position within notification message 916C. When notification message 916D enters the view of fig. 9E, the graphical element 917D of the set of graphical elements 917 displayed near the leading edge of notification area 915 that corresponds to the notification associated with notification message 916D is removed from the set of graphical elements 917 and animated to move into position within notification message 916D.
Finally, as shown in FIG. 9F, as the notification area 915 expands to its maximum size, each graphical element in the set of graphical elements 917 has been removed and positioned within the corresponding notification message 916. It should be appreciated that the examples of fig. 9A-9F may be performed by computing device 210 in the reverse order. That is, as notification area 915 folds, the folds away from view and notification messages associated with pending notifications may cause their own respective graphical elements 917 to be added back to the set of graphical elements 917 displayed at the leading edge of notification area 915 until notification area 915 is fully folded, at which point computing device 210 may cause the set of graphical elements 917 to be displayed again in status bar 914A.
Fig. 10A-10B are flowcharts illustrating example operations performed by an example computing device configured to display notification graphical elements within a notification area of a graphical user interface, according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 10A and 10B are described below in the context of computing device 210 of fig. 2.
As shown in fig. 10A, computing device 210 may display a status bar of a graphical user interface including a set of graphical elements, each graphical element of the set of graphical elements corresponding to a different notification of a set of pending notifications (1002). For example, the computing device 210 may display a user interface 913 including a set of graphical elements 917 at the UIC 212.
Computing device 210 may receive a gesture to expand a notification curtain from a status bar (1004). For example, UI module 220 may receive an indication of gesture 906 being detected at status bar 914A from UIC 212. UI module 220 may determine that gesture 906 is a user command to expand notification area 915.
Computing device 210 may expand the notification curtain from the status bar such that the size of the notification pane is based on the length of the gesture and the set of graphical elements is displayed within the notification pane near the leading edge of the notification pane (1006). For example, UI module 220 may cause UID 212 to increase the length of notification area 915 in proportion to the increase in the length of gesture 906. In this way, UI module 20 may cause the leading edge of notification area 915 to follow the input unit that gesture 906 is being made.
Computing device 210 may determine whether a notification message associated with a particular notification in the set of pending notifications is most recently visible in the notification pane (1008). For example, UI module 220 may determine whether any notification messages 916 associated with any graphical elements in a set of graphical elements 917 are visible.
In response to determining that no notification message is most recently visible (1008, no branch), computing device 210 may proceed to operation 1014. However, in response to determining that the notification message is most recently visible (1008, yes branch), computing device 210 may remove a particular graphical element associated with the particular notification from the set of graphical elements and stop displaying the particular graphical element near the leading edge of the notification pane (1010). Computing device 210 may display a particular graphical element of the set of graphical elements associated with a particular notification within the notification message (1012). For example, as notification message 916A enters the view as the size of gesture 906 increases, UI module 220 may cause graphical element 917A to move from near the leading edge of notification area 915 into a position within notification message 916A.
Computing device 210 may determine whether the length of the gesture increases (1014). In response to determining that the length of the gesture increases (1014, yes branch), computing device 210 may repeat operations (1006) through (1004). For example, UI module 220 may cause each of graphical elements 917 to move from being located near the leading edge of notification area 915 to being located within respective notification message 916.
In response to determining that the length of the gesture does not increase (1014, no branch), computing device 210 may proceed to step "a" which continues the operation shown in fig. 10B.
As shown in fig. 10A, computing device 210 may determine whether the length of the gesture is reduced (1016). In response to determining that the length of the gesture has not decreased (1016, no branch), computing device 210 may proceed to step "B" which continues with operation 1014 of fig. 10A.
In response to determining that the length of the gesture decreases (1016, yes branch), computing device 210 may fold the notification curtain from the status bar such that the size of the notification pane is based on the length of the gesture (1018). For example, the user may provide a gesture similar to gesture 906 but in the opposite direction. Thus, as notification area 915 expands, gesture 906 may back from the leading edge of notification area 915A toward status bar 914A to collapse notification area 915.
Computing device 210 may determine whether any previously visible notification messages for any pending notifications are no longer visible (1020). In response to determining that no previously visible notification messages for any pending notifications are no longer visible (1020, no branch), computing device 210 may proceed to step "B" which continues with operation 1014 of fig. 10A. For example, if there are no more pending notifications, UI module 220 need not determine whether any graphical elements of the notification are displayed at the leading edge of notification area 915 and ultimately at status bar 914A.
In response to determining that at least one previously visible notification message of the still pending notifications is no longer visible (1020, yes branch), computing device 210 may add any graphical elements associated with the still pending notifications associated with the previously visible notification message that is no longer visible to the set of graphical elements (1022). Computing device 210 may display the set of graphical elements within a notification pane near a leading edge of the notification pane (1024).
For example, when the notification area is collapsed, UI module 220 repositions any graphical elements 917 associated with the pending notifications to move the position from being displayed within the corresponding notification message 916 to being displayed at the leading edge of notification area 915. When gesture 906 reaches status bar 914A, UI module 220 may cause any graphical elements 917 displayed in the leading edge of notification area 915 to be displayed within status bar 914A.
