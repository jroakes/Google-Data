Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to proximity sensors in a mobile communication device and more particularly to using a proximity sensor to detect opaque objects in a mobile communication device having a touchscreen for user interaction.
- Detecting objects with a proximity sensor sometimes is less than reliable because of inability of light to be received by a proximity sensor receiver under certain conditions. For example, an object placed in very close proximity or in actual contact with a glass interface might not allow light to pass to the receiver side of the proximity sensor. There are two main paths for light to reach the receiver without an object present, either by reflecting below the glass surface or alternatively through the glass itself. This unintended coupling between the transmitter and receiver side is referred to as local coupling; and is detrimental to the operation of the proximity sensor. The local coupling causes some of the transmitted light rays or optical signal to reach the receiver in the absence of an object in front of the proximity sensor.
- the light rays reflecting below the glass are typically eliminated by placing an isolator barrier between the transmitting and receiving sides of the proximity sensor.
- the light rays propagating through the glass can be controlled by the thickness of the glass or the extension of the isolating barrier through the glass. That substantially eliminates local coupling, but could create what is known in the industry as a blind spot.
- a blind spot is a situation where reflected light from an object does not find a path to reach the proximity sensor receiver especially when the object is in very close proximity to the glass or is actually touching the glass. This is made even worse when the object is opaque, for example an object can dark clothing or hair associated with a user.
- dark clothing or hair has low light reflectivity thereby further reduces the possibility of a substantial number of light rays from reaching the receiver side of the optical apparatus.
- Opaque materials causes light to reflect at the surface or be absorbed by the material. Dark opaque material causes light reflection to be minimal.
- a human body part such as a face or lips, on the other hand, allows light to pass through and reflects inside the skin surface off of human bones, blood vessels, tissue, etc; thereby causing light to travel a greater distance above the glass to reach the receiver.
- the light in the opaque case is forced to reflect much closer to the glass surface when an opaque object is present than would otherwise be the case when light reflects from a greater distance such as the case when a body is in contact with the glass from inside human skin.
- This opaqueness scenario makes the blind spot problem much worse, especially if the opaque object is dark or has low reflectivity for the transmitted light from the proximity sensor.

Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to proximity sensors in a mobile communication device and more particularly to using a proximity sensor to detect opaque objects in a mobile communication device having a touchscreen for user interaction.
- Detecting objects with a proximity sensor sometimes is less than reliable because of inability of light to be received by a proximity sensor receiver under certain conditions. For example, an object placed in very close proximity or in actual contact with a glass interface might not allow light to pass to the receiver side of the proximity sensor. There are two main paths for light to reach the receiver without an object present, either by reflecting below the glass surface or alternatively through the glass itself. This unintended coupling between the transmitter and receiver side is referred to as local coupling; and is detrimental to the operation of the proximity sensor. The local coupling causes some of the transmitted light rays or optical signal to reach the receiver in the absence of an object in front of the proximity sensor. The light rays reflecting below the glass are typically eliminated by placing an isolator barrier between the transmitting and receiving sides of the proximity sensor. The light rays propagating through the glass can be controlled by the thickness of the glass or the extension of the isolating barrier through the glass. That substantially eliminates local coupling, but could create what is known in the industry as a blind spot. A blind spot is a situation where reflected light from an object does not find a path to reach the proximity sensor receiver especially when the object is in very close proximity to the glass or is actually touching the glass. This is made even worse when the object is opaque, for example an object can dark clothing or hair associated with a user. Specifically, dark clothing or hair has low light reflectivity thereby further reduces the possibility of a substantial number of light rays from reaching the receiver side of the optical apparatus. Opaque materials causes light to reflect at the surface or be absorbed by the material. Dark opaque material causes light reflection to be minimal. A human body part such as a face or lips, on the other hand, allows light to pass through and reflects inside the skin surface off of human bones, blood vessels, tissue, etc; thereby causing light to travel a greater distance above the glass to reach the receiver.
- As such, the light in the opaque case is forced to reflect much closer to the glass surface when an opaque object is present than would otherwise be the case when light reflects from a greater distance such as the case when a body is in contact with the glass from inside human skin. This opaqueness scenario makes the blind spot problem much worse, especially if the opaque object is dark or has low reflectivity for the transmitted light from the proximity sensor.
- Accordingly, there is a need for a method for resolving blind spots associated with proximity sensors.

- In this regard,
FIG. 1 is a pictorial diagram that illustrates an exemplary embodiment of anoptical apparatus 100 for use in a mobile communication device.Optical apparatus 100 may be employed in a tablet, a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, a gaming device, audio device (such as an MP3 device) or a device that combines any of the aforementioned or a device that is useful for displaying information, data, and images. Theoptical apparatus 100 may include aglass interface 110 that may be whole or partioned or comprise of one or more apertures. The glass interface has an external side 112 and an internal side 114. Residing below theglass interface 110 are areceiver 120 andtransmitter 130 for a proximity sensor (not shown). The proximity sensor is capable of sensing the nearness, closeness, or proximity of an object to theglass interface 110. The proximity sensor operates in a conventional fashion once an object's presence has been detected.Receiver 120 andtransmitter 130 of the proximity sensor are isolated or separated by anisolator 140.Isolator 140 can be a barrier, a wall, or material that isolates or eliminates coupling between the transmitter and receiver side of the proximity sensor caused by internal reflections. Anoptical guide 150 operates cooperatively with theisolator 140. Theoptical guide 150 may be embedded withinisolator 150 or may be abutted against theisolator 140. The cross-sectional area ofoptical guide 150 can include a configuration that may be circular, rectangular, or in a narrow slit form, or any odd shape in between. Emittedlight rays 155 are transmitted from thetransmitter 130 of the proximity sensor and exit theglass interface 110. The light rays 155 travel substantially uninterrupted throughglass interface 110 when there is no object present on the other side of theglass interface 110 to bounce or reflect the light rays 155. A minimal amount oflight rays 155 does reflect from theglass interface 110 itself. Small reflected rays from the glass interface itself reach theoptical guide 150 and can still reach thereceiver 120 through theoptical guide 150, because of the orientation ofoptical guide 150; however, larger emitted rays that strike theoptical guide 150 will mostly be rejected byoptical guide 150 because of the orientation ofoptical guide 150 with respect to the LED location. - Referring to
FIG. 2 , the same components are included foroptical apparatus 100. One major difference is that anobject 200 now either is in contact withglass interface 110 or is in near proximity toglass interface 110. Object 200 can be part of a mobile communication device user's body, such as a head, ear, eye, or mouth. In addition,object 200 can be hair or clothing. Notably, whenobject 200 is hair or clothing, for example, object 200 becomes opaque to light rays. That is light rays may not pass throughobject 200 and are reflected offobject 200 back through theglass interface 110, alternatively the light rays may be absorbed by theopaque object 200. Once the reflectedlight rays 157 reach the underside of glass interface some with favorable directionality are passed through theoptical guide 150 which funnels the reflectedlight rays 157 towardsreceiver 120.Optical guide 150 is sometimes referred to as a light pipe, light guide, light medium. - The various tasks performed in connection with an illustrated and described process may be performed by software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the following description of certain processes may refer to elements mentioned above in connection with
FIG. 1 andFIG. 2 . In practice, portions of a described process may be performed by different elements of the described system. It should be appreciated that a described process may include any number of additional or alternative tasks, the tasks shown in the figures need not be performed in the illustrated order, and a described process may be incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or process having additional functionality not described in detail herein. Moreover, one or more of the tasks shown in a figure could be omitted from an embodiment of the respective process as long as the intended overall functionality remains intact. - A closer look at the
optical guide 150 is shown inFIG. 3 . The orientation of theoptical guide 150 is such thatoptical guide 150 passes some light rays that originate on or above the glass interface 110 (reflected light rays); andoptical guide 150 rejects light rays originating below the glass interface 110 (excluding reflected rays from the internal side 114 of glass interface 110). - The optical guide orientation going from the transmitter side toward the receiver side of the proximity sensor is within a hemisphere opposite in direction to the hemisphere of emitted light by the source. Each hemisphere forms 180 degrees.
- For example, emitted
light ray 155 has an angle that falls within a hemisphere encompassing the transmitter's pointing direction angle and wherein the orientation of theoptical guide 150 is directed from the transmitter side toward the receiver side to form an angle that lies with the opposite hemisphere as seen inFIG. 3 . Hence, the two hemispheres shown point in opposite directions. - Referring to
FIG. 4 ,optical guide 150 withinisolator 140 couples a small amount of local light reflection otherwise known as local coupling that reflects off the internal side 114 or underside of theglass interface 110. The amount of unintended local coupling can be controlled by the structure of theoptical guide 150. Thetransmitter 130 can include a light emitting diode (LED) as a light source, but other light sources are contemplated as well. - In addition to the illustrated straight
optical guide 150 shown inFIGS. 1 and 2 , another exemplary embodiment includes a curvedoptical guide 150. The curvedoptical guide 150 is illustrated inFIGS. 5 & 6 . Curvedoptical guide 150 could be designed to further minimize local coupling. Accordingly, the curved formfactor ofoptical guide 150, as shown inFIGS. 5 & 6 , causes some locally coupled light rays that enteroptical guide 150 and substantially dissipate or eventually exitoptical guide 150 subsequent to a number of reflections off the optical guide's internal walls.FIG. 5 shows a substantial amount oflight rays 155 emitted from thetransmitter 130 having an LED that pass through theglass interface 110, because no object is present near theglass interface 110.FIG. 6 shows the reflections from anobject 200 that is present near theglass interface 110 after having been emitted from thetransmitter 130 having an LED. The curvedoptical guide 150 provides a means for the light rays to reach thereceiver 120, isolated from the LED byisolator 140, when anobject 200 is present near theglass interface 110. A curvedoptical guide 150 can be considered as having curved pipe coupling. - Another exemplary embodiment is shown in
FIG. 7 .Optical guide 150 is a funnel optical guide. The width and shape of the funneloptical guide 150, inFIG. 7 , controls the amount of coupling between thetransmitter 130 and thereceiver 120 for locally coupled light relative to the amount of reflected light off ofobject 200. A funneloptical guide 150 can be considered as having funnel pipe coupling. Alternative embodiments may employ other guide shapes such as a tapered shape or theoptical guide 150 may include lens apparatus that provide light focusing characteristics. - Referring to
FIG. 8 , theoptical guide 150 may not necessarily be embedded in isolator wall orisolator barrier 140, because of the likely thinness ofisolator wall 140. Instead,isolator wall 140 may include an aperture or opening and be abutted adjacent to aseparate structure 145 that includesoptical guide 150. Reflected light that passes through the opening inisolator wall 140 continues to travel intooptical guide 150 embedded instructure 145. The light rays that enteroptical guide 150 bounce off the interior walls ofoptical guide 150 and exit towardsreceiver 120. - In another embodiment, shown in
FIG. 9 , anoptical guide 150 may include a lensing structure 147 that directs or diverges light toward or away from thereceiver 120 based on incoming light ray direction and/or an originating position (hence, a directional filtering lensing scheme is described that will cover rejecting or passing light rays with certain angles; in addition, a filter that passes certain wavelengths is contemplated as well for lensing structure 147) to minimize local coupling while resolving blind spots associated with a proximity sensor. Therefore, reflected light rays from anobject 200 are enhanced for greater reception atreceiver 120. The optical filtering in lensing structure 147 is to differentiate between undesirable internally reflected light and desirable reflected light wavelengths or optical spectrums. That optical filtering material can be designed in conjunction with the optical guide filtering characteristics. In the same vein, the glass interface can include different optical filtering characteristics in one portion of the glass interface than a second portion of the glass interface. Specifically, the glass interface covering the transmitting section can include optical filtering characteristics different than the portion of the glass interface covering the receiving section. The glass interface materials can also have a shutter feature embedded in it that passes or blocks optical signals from reaching the receiver at specific times. The optical guide itself can include the same shutter feature. Shutter feature can be thought of as controlling transparency with an electrical control signal. In other words, by applying an electrical signal an object can be transparent at one time and opaque at another time upon application of a different electrical signal. - Referring to
FIG. 10 ,isolator barrier 140 once again has an embedded straightoptical guide 150, sometimes referred to as straight pipe coupling. However, theglass interface 110 is either completely removed or contains an aperture or opening that enables an air interface to form between anobject 200 and thetransmitter 130. As shown inFIG. 10 , emitted light fromtransmitter 130 reflects off of anear object 200 and travels withinoptical guide 150 to be received byreceiver 120. Aglass interface 110 may have openings in it abovetransmitter 130 orreceiver 120 or over bothtransmitter 130 andreceiver 120. In addition to air and glass interfaces, the interfaces can be comprised of plastic and semi-permeable material. - Referring to
FIG. 11A , a simulated model is shown that depicts the isolator barrier as embedded within a glass interface. The isolator barrier extends through the glass thickness for best elimination of local coupling. The glass interface can be thick, hence making local coupling high. Extending the isolator barrier through the glass eliminates local coupling. Otherwise, the isolator barrier can stop at the underside or internal side of the glass barrier, if the glass is too thin. In doing so, unwanted local coupling is substantially eliminated by the thinness of the glass and by the presence of the isolator barrier. - Referring to
FIG. 11B , the figure shows a blind spot scenario where an object that is in very close proximity to the glass interface is not detectable and the received signal falls below detection threshold in a sharp dropoff. As the object distance increases, the proximity sensor is able to detect the presence of the object (normal operation range). When the object distance increases beyond range the proximity sensor is unable to detect the presence of the object (Object out of range). - Referring to
FIG. 12A , a simulated model is shown depicting an isolator barrier within the glass interface. However, this isolator barrier has an optical guide included. Specifically, the optical guide is embedded within the isolator barrier. - Referring to
FIG. 12B , the figure shows a resolution to the blind spot scenario where an object that is in very close proximity to the glass interface is detectable and the received signal falls above the detection threshold. As the object distance increases, the proximity sensor continues to detect the presence of the object (normal operation range). When the object distance increases beyond range the proximity sensor is unable to detect the presence of the object (Object out of range). - A close up of the detected signal is shown in
FIG. 13 . Clearly, there is no sharp dropoff of signal when an optical guide is used in cooperation with the isolator barrier. Where the solid line inFIG. 13 corresponds to a structure without an optical guide depicting a sharp dropoff below the detection threshold, while the dashed line corresponds to the structure with an optical guide showing a received signal above the detection threshold when the object is at zero distance or in contact with the glass interface. - Referring to
FIG. 14 , unwanted local coupling is substantially reduced by controlling the width of the optical guide. In addition, other parameters, such as location, shape, refractive index of optical guide material, and tilt angle of the optical guide can also be controlled to manage any local coupling while keeping the reflected signal by the object above the proximity sensor's detection threshold. Local coupling can sometimes be referred to as crosstalk. - Referring to
FIG. 15 , aflowchart 1500 illustrates light propagation between a transmitting section and a receiving section. Step 1505 a light source, for example, an LED transmits an optical signal. The optical signal in the form of light strikes the glass interface instep 1510 and partially reflects internally, but the light largely transverses the glass interface in step 1515.Step 1520 determines if there is an object present. If there is no object present, the partially reflected signal is below the detection threshold and the system keeps transmitting optical signals to keep looking for an object (The optical signal is preferably a pulsed signal). If there is the presence of an object that is in proximity of the glass, but not necessarily touching, covering, or blocking glass surface, instep 1525 the reflected light off the object travels to the receiver of the proximity sensor using at least two main paths instep 1530, including the path through the optical guide and a second path directly to the receiver through the glass interface (i.e., the object covers both the transmitter area and receiver area above the glass interface). - When there is an object in near proximity to the glass interface or actually touching, blocking, or covering the glass interface,
step 1535 directs a substantial portion of the reflected light off of the object towards the receiver via a tilted optical guide (tilted in such a direction to favor rays traveling in the general direction of reflected light, and disfavor rays traveling in the general direction of emitted light). - Referring to
FIG. 16 , several areas are shown that include independent filters or shutter features (1605, 1610, 1615, 1620, and 1625) in either the glass interface or the optical guide. Each filter or shutter feature could cover a fraction of the area shown, rather than the entire portion over the transmitting or receiving section. - While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.
