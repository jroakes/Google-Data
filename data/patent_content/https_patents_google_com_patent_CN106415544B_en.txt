Description
Background
A user may submit a mapping request indicating a geographic location. The user may be provided with a map that responds to the request and may include one or more indications of points of interest in the geographic location. For example, a user may submit a mapping request for a geographic area and may be provided with a map that includes one or more businesses and/or attractions for the geographic area.
Disclosure of Invention
The present disclosure is generally directed to technical features for determining points of interest private to a user. More specifically, the present disclosure is directed to methods and apparatus for determining points of interest of a user based on content from one or more electronic sources associated with the user (e.g., the user's email, the user's calendar entries) and determining relevance scores for the points of interest based on additional information associated with the user. The additional information may be identified from the same source used to determine the point of interest and/or may be identified using an alternative source. In some implementations, points of interest and associated relevance scores are utilized in determining when and/or how to provide point of interest information for presentation to a user via a mapping application and/or other application that displays or provides one or more points of interest. For example, in some implementations, the relevance scores of the points of interest can be utilized to determine the prominence of the provided point of interest information.
Providing private point of interest information for presentation to a user results from a technical feature that may enable determining that the point of interest information is private to the user and may further enable the determined private point of interest information to allow the user to efficiently identify that the point of interest information is private to the user. For example, private point of interest information may be displayed more prominently to the user than other non-private point of interest information, thereby making it more efficient for the user to identify those points of interest that are private to the user. Such presentation more prominently displays the user's private point-of-interest information to the user when other private points-of-interest determined not to be private to the user are concurrently removed and/or degraded, which brings technical and cognitive advantages. In some implementations, points of interest that are private to the user can include those points of interest that are identified from the user's electronic source and are considered private to the user based on a relevance score determined based on additional information associated with the user.
In some embodiments, a computer-implemented method is provided and includes the steps of: identifying content from one or more electron sources created by, electronically accessible by, or electronically transmitted to a user; determining a point of interest based on the content, the point of interest identifying a physical location; identifying additional information associated with the user and associated with the content, wherein the identified additional information is from a source other than the one or more sources used to determine the point of interest; determining a relevance score for the point of interest based on the additional information; determining a display prominence of a visual indication of the point of interest based on the relevance score; and providing the visual indication with the determined display prominence for presentation to the user via a mapping application, the visual indication provided for presentation with the display prominence at a location on a map rendered via the mapping application that corresponds to the physical location.
In some embodiments, a computer-implemented method is provided and includes the steps of: identifying content from one or more electron sources associated with a user; determining a point of interest based on the content; identifying additional information associated with the user and associated with the content; determining a relevance score for the point of interest based on the additional information; and providing point of interest information related to the point of interest based on the relevance score.

Detailed Description
One or more points of interest of the user may be determined from the content of the electron source associated with the user. Additional information may also be identified from the content of one or more electron sources associated with the user and used to determine a relevance score for the determined point of interest. For example, the user may be associated with an email that includes flight information for inbound flights, such as flights at an arrival airport and/or a departure airport. Also, for example, the email is associated with one or more times that may be used to determine the relevance score for the point of interest, such as the time the user received the email and/or the time the user last visited the email. The content of the email may be used to determine arrival and/or departure airports as points of interest. The additional information may be identified from the content of the email, such as the sender of the email and/or the prominence of the airport indication in the email. Also, for example, additional information may be identified from one or more additional sources associated with the user, such as a calendar entry of the user and/or location information of the user.
Based on the identified additional information associated with the user, a relevance score for the point of interest is determined. The relevance score indicates a likelihood that the point of interest is relevant to the user and/or that the user is interested in being provided information related to the point of interest. For example, a relevance score for an arrival airport that may be determined to be a point of interest may be determined based on identifying an email including content about the airport sent from a trusted source, such as an airline reservation and/or from an online travel reservation agent. Meanwhile, for example, a relevance score for an arriving airport point of interest may be determined based on identifying that a user has created a calendar entry for a flight that includes the same airport code as the determined arriving airport point of interest. Also, for example, a relevance score for an arrival airport point of interest may be determined using prior location information of the user and based on identifying the frequency with which the user appears at the arrival airport. For example, in some implementations, a relevance score for an arrival airport point of interest that the user has gone more often may be determined to indicate lower relevance than a relevance score for another point of interest that the user has gone less often. Such a relevance score may reflect that the airport where the user is more frequent is more familiar to the user and less interesting to the user. Also, for example, in some instances, a relevance score may be determined for a first point of interest that is more relevant than a relevance score for a second point of interest, the second point of interest being less frequently visited by the user relative to the first point of interest.
The user may be provided with one or more points of interest via one or more applications, such as mapping applications. In some implementations, one or more determined points of interest are provided based on a relevance score of the determined points of interest. In some implementations, the prominence of the provided point of interest information for a point of interest may be determined based on the relevance score of the point of interest. For example, the relevance scores of the points of interest may be utilized to determine the indicated size of the points of interest on the map and/or the ranking of the points of interest in the list of points of interest. In some implementations, the determination of when to provide point of interest information for a point of interest to a user may be based on a relevance score for the point of interest. For example, points of interest may be provided to a user only when the relevance score satisfies a threshold.
FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example environment in which a user's points of interest may be determined and/or provided to the user. The example environment includes a communication network 101 that facilitates communication between various components in the environment. In some embodiments, the communication network 101 may include the internet, one or more intranets, and/or one or more bus subsystems. The communication network 101 may optionally utilize one or more standard communication techniques, protocols, and/or interprocess communication techniques. The example environment also includes a point of interest engine 105, a content database 110, a relevance engine 115, an entity database 120, and a user device 125. The user device 125 may execute one or more applications, such as a Web browser and/or a mapping application.
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can identify an electron source associated with the user. The electronic source may include, for example, email, instant messages, documents, Web history, calendar entries, current location data of the user, previous location data of the user, addresses of contacts from the user's set of contacts (e.g., email contacts, phone contacts), and so forth. Where the system described herein collects personal information about a user, or personal information may be utilized, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or functional components collect user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, user preferences, or the user's current geographic location) or whether and/or how to receive content from content servers that may be more relevant to the user. Also, certain data may be processed in one or more ways before being stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personally identifiable information about the user cannot be determined, or the geographic location of the user for which geographic location information is obtained may be summarized (e.g., to a city, zip code, or state level) such that a geographically specific location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user has control over how information about the user is collected and/or used. In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can identify sources having certain data that has been processed in one or more ways that remove personally identifying information and/or other information.
The point of interest engine 105 may identify content from one or more sources and determine whether the identified content is associated with a point of interest. Content from a source may include, for example, one or more terms from the source, a format of the one or more terms from the source, a location of the one or more terms in the source, an author and/or sender of the source, and/or metadata that may be included in the source. The point of interest engine 105 may identify the entire content of the source in some implementations. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may identify the entire content of the user's email. In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can identify only the portions of content from the source that are potentially relevant to the point of interest.
In some implementations, the content database 110 may include one or more storage media and may be used to store and/or access one or more aspects of the information described herein. For example, content database 110 may be utilized by one or more components to store, modify, and/or access content associated with a user from one or more sources. In some implementations, the content database 110 may store content and/or sources for multiple users and, for each entry, may only allow the user and/or one or more other users or components authorized by the user (such as the point of interest engine 105) to access the source and/or content. In some other implementations, the content database 110 may store only a single user's content and/or source.
In this specification, the term "database" is used broadly to refer to any collection of data. The data in the database need not be structured in any particular way, or structured at all, and can be stored on storage devices in one or more locations. Thus, for example, a database may include multiple data sets, each of which may be organized and accessed differently. Also, in this specification, the term "item" will be used broadly to refer to any mapping of a plurality of related information items. A single entry need not appear in a single storage device and may include pointers or other indications of information items that may appear on other storage devices. For example, an entry may include multiple nodes mapped to one another, each node including an identifier of an entity or other item of information that may be present in another data structure and/or another storage medium.
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can identify content associated with the user via the content database 110. For example, the content database 110 may include content from one or more sources that have been previously identified as potentially including content related to one or more points of interest. Also, for example, the content database 110 may include content from one or more sources that have not been previously identified by the point of interest engine 105 or other component as including content related to a point of interest.
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can identify all of the user's content from the content database 110. In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can identify a subset of sources and/or content that may be relevant to the point of interest using rules-based and/or other methods. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine that all sources that include an address may include content related to a point of interest. Also, for example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine that all content originating from an airline may be associated with a point of interest. Also, for example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine that a source that includes one or more key terms is likely to be related to a point of interest, such as a source that includes "flight," hotel, "and/or" reservations.
The point of interest engine 105 may determine points of interest based on the identified content. A point of interest is an identifier of a physical location that can be used to present information about the physical location to a user. Examples of points of interest include unique identifiers of physical locations, such as one or more street addresses of the location, an entity identifier of the location, and/or one or more longitude and latitude coordinates, and so forth. Also, a point of interest may define a physical location with an arbitrary level of granularity. For example, a point of interest may define a particular coordinate, a particular building, a particular portion of a building, a particular geographic area (vicinity, park, entire city), and/or a portion of a particular topographical feature (street, high speed, body of water, bridge, etc.).
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can utilize one or more rules to determine points of interest from the identified content. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine the point of interest based on identifying one or more terms that conform to the address (e.g., "123 Airport Road 123" that conforms to the rule [ number ] [ street name ]). Meanwhile, for example, the point of interest engine 105 may identify an airport code based on identifying three capital letters (e.g., "LAX" and/or "SFO") near one or more terms indicative of an airport, such as "airport", "departs", and/"arrives".
Referring to fig. 2, an example is provided that includes sample sources that may be used to determine the content of a point of interest. The source is an email 200 that may be provided to the user in response to the user booking a flight via an airline and/or online travel company. The email includes departure information including the airport name 210 and arrival information. Further, the email 200 includes sender information 205.
The point of interest engine 105 may receive the email 200 via the content database 110 and/or an email service. In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can determine the points of interest based on one or more terms in the email 200 using a rule-based approach. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may identify the airport name 210 "LAX" as conforming to one or more rules identifying airport codes, and use "LAX" as a point of interest and/or determine a point of interest based on "LAX" (e.g., an address mapped to LAX, a latitude/longitude mapped to LAX, and/or an entity identifier mapped to LAX). In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can utilize a rule-based approach to determine additional information associated with the determined point of interest. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may identify "April 30,2014 (30/4/2014)" as meeting one or more rules identifying dates, and further identify "April 30, 2014" as being associated with the LAX based on the one or more rules, such as considering the proximity of "April 30,2014" to "LAX".
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can determine the points of interest based on one or more terms in the email 200 using a classifier-based approach. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may include a classifier trained to identify whether one or more segments of a source indicate a point of interest based on one or more segments of the source and/or additional signals. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may classify terms in an email as indicating points of interest based on one or more signals from the content of the email, such as a signal related to the term itself, a signal related to one or more terms before and after the term, a signal related to the location of the term in the email, and/or a signal related to metadata of the source. The one or more signals may optionally include a signal based on processing of the source by one or more additional components. For example, the signals may include signals related to parts of speech of one or more terms, grammatical relations of one or more terms, etc., and the signals may be based on the output of the parser. The classifiers of the point of interest engine 105 may be trained to divide segments into points of interest based on prior training using supervised or semi-supervised training techniques. Additional or alternative rule-based and/or classifier-based techniques may be used to determine points of interest of content from the source.
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can determine points of interest based directly on content from the source. For example, referring to FIG. 3, another example source is provided that includes content that may be used to determine points of interest. The source is an email 300 that includes sender information 305, a rental car location address 310, and a hotel address 315. The point of interest engine 105 may determine "123 Airport Road" and/or "200 s. main Street 200" as points of interest based on terminology conforming to the address format. Also, for example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine "123 Airport Road" as a point of interest using other terms besides "123 Airport Road," such as by identifying that "123 Airport Road" is near a hotel address 315, determining that the sender of the email 300 is related to a rental car location, and/or based on other terms in the email 300.
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can indirectly determine the point of interest based on one or more terms of the identified content. For example, referring again to FIG. 2, the email 200 includes an airport name 210 "LAX" as content. The point of interest engine 105 may identify "LAX" as an airport code based on, for example, one or more additional terms ("Flight", "parts", "arcs", etc.) in the message and/or a comparison to a list of airport codes. The point of interest engine 105 may utilize the entity database 120 to identify entities that map to "LAX" and further identify addresses, such as "500 Airport Road," that map to the same entity. The point of interest engine 105 may determine a relevant address as a point of interest based on the association between the identified Airport name 210 and the address "500 Airport Road" in the entity database 120.
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can identify a location from the content of the source and determine a point of interest associated with the identified location. For example, referring to fig. 3, the point of interest engine 105 may identify "123 Airport Road" as the address and further identify "123 Airport Road" as the address of the rental car location based on, for example, one or more terms in the email 300 and/or based on identifying a "car rentalization location" entity in the entity database 120 that maps to "123 Airport Road". The point of interest engine 105 may determine gas stations (gasstation) near the rental car location as points of interest related to the rental car location. The point of interest engine 105 can determine points of interest that are gas stations near the rental car location. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may identify "123 Airport Road" as content in the email 300, identify a "real car location" entity that maps to "123 Airport Road", and further identify a "gas station" associated with the "real car location" entity. The point of interest engine 105 may determine an address or other identifier of a "gas station" entity as a point of interest based on the identified association.
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can identify two or more locations from the content of the source and determine a point of interest that includes a path between the two or more locations. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may identify hotel locations and airport locations from one or more sources. The point of interest engine 105 may determine points of interest that are paths between the identified locations. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may identify one or more roads, bus routes, and/or other routes that may be used by the user to travel from one of the identified locations to one or more other locations.
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can determine the point of interest from the relevant locations identified from the content based on the determined relationship between the category of the identified location and the category associated with the point of interest. The relationship between the location and the point of interest identified in the content of the source may be determined from the entity database 120. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine that "123 Airport Road" is a location with an entity category of "real car location" and determine from one or more databases (such as entity database 120) that the entity category of "real car location" and the entity category of "gap" are associated with each other. In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can identify a gas station that is near the rental car location based on identifying a relationship between "real location" and "gas station. In some implementations, rules can be utilized to determine relationships between locations identified from the content of the source and points of interest. For example, the point of interest engine 105 can identify a rental car location in the content of the source and determine a gas station as a point of interest based on identifying a rental car location identification rule.
In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can determine multiple points of interest based on the same segment of the content of the source. Referring to FIG. 4, an exemplary diagram is provided that may be used to determine the source of multiple points of interest. Message thread 400 includes a reference to "chain restaurant," which may have multiple locations. The point of interest engine 105 may determine multiple locations for "Chain reserve" from one or more databases and determine that each location may be a point of interest for the user. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may identify a "Chain reserve" entity in the entity database 120 that maps to multiple addresses. In some implementations, multiple points of interest may be provided to the relevance engine 115 to determine whether one or more of the locations are more relevant to the user based on additional information from one or more sources, as described herein. For example, the point of interest engine 105 can determine a plurality of gas stations as points of interest and the relevance engine 115 can determine a relevance score for the points of interest based on distances between the gas stations and one or more locations, such as a distance between each gas station and a rental car location.
The point of interest engine 105 may store the one or more determined points of interest in the content database 110 for later use by one or more components. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may store "123 Airport Road" as a location in the content database 110 and later provide "123 Airport Road" to the relevance engine 115 to determine the relevance score for the point of interest. In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 may store all or a portion of the content used to determine the point of interest in the content database 110 along with the point of interest. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine the point of interest "123 Airport Road" from the email 300 and store the email 300 in the content database 110 along with the determined point of interest. Meanwhile, for example, the point of interest engine 105 may store "123 AirportRoad" only along with the sender information 305.
The relevance engine 115 identifies additional information from one or more sources associated with the user and uses the additional information to determine a relevance score for the point of interest based on the additional information. In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 can be a component of the point of interest engine 105. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may identify content, determine a point of interest from the content, and determine a relevance score for the point of interest based on additional information. In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 identifies additional information from the content of the same source that is used to determine the points of interest. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine a point of interest based on the user's email, and the relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score based on additional information included in the email, such as the sender of the email, the format of one or more terms in the email, and/or a reference location of the point of interest in the email. In some implementations, the content of the source may not include identification information. For example, the correlation engine 115 may be provided with a classification of the sender of the message (the user's private contacts, advertisers, online services, etc.) without providing identifying information for the sender. In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 can identify additional information from one or more sources separate from the source used by the point of interest engine 105 to determine the point of interest. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine a point of interest from the user's email, while the relevance engine 115 may identify a second email as additional information and/or identify additional information from a different type of source (such as the user's GPS data and/or the user's Web history).
In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 can identify additional information from one or more sources previously used to determine points of interest. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine a point of interest from email 1 and provide the point of interest to the relevance engine 115 to determine an initial relevance score for the point of interest. The relevance engine 115 may store the points of interest, the determined relevance scores, and/or the content from the source in the content database 110. Next, the point of interest engine 105 may determine the same point of interest from the email 2 and provide the point of interest to the relevance engine 115. The relevance engine 115 may identify email 1 as additional information to use to determine a relevance score for the point of interest. For example, the relevance engine 115 may identify the number of occurrences of the reference to the point of interest in email 1 as additional information to determine a relevance score. Meanwhile, for example, the relevance engine 115 may utilize previously determined relevance scores for points of interest to determine new relevance scores. The relevance engine 115 may store the points of interest, the new relevance scores, and/or the content of email 1 and/or email 2 in the content database 110 for subsequent determination of the relevance scores.
The relevance engine 115 can identify additional information from sources based on identifying one or more sources that include content related to the determined points of interest. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may provide the point of interest to the relevance engine 115 and the relevance engine 115 may identify content that includes the point of interest. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine "123 Airport Road" as a point of interest based on the email 300 and store the point of interest and the content of the email 300 in the content database 110. Subsequently, the point of interest engine 105 may determine "123 Airport Road" from another source and provide the "123 Airport Road" as the point of interest to the relevance engine 115. The correlation engine 115 can identify the email 300 as additional information from the content database 110 based on identifying that the email 300 was previously determined to include content associated with "123 Airport Road". In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can determine a point of interest as an entity identifier. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine the point of interest as a "Los Angeles International Airport" entity. The correlation engine 115 may identify additional information in sources that include content mapped to the point-of-interest entity, such as sources that include aliases of entities (e.g., "LAXs") and/or other attributes of entities (e.g., addresses of airports).
In some implementations, the additional information can include prominence of content associated with the determined points of interest in the one or more sources. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may provide the relevance engine 115 with a point of interest "Chain Restaurant" based on the content of the email 400. The relevance engine 115 can identify the term "Chain detail" in the header 415 of the email 400 as additional information that can be used to determine a relevance score for "Chain detail". Also, for example, the relevance engine 115 can identify a particular format of a reference to a point of interest in the content of one or more sources as additional information that can be used to determine a relevance score for the point of interest.
In some implementations, the additional information may include information related to the sender and/or author of the content source containing the determined point of interest. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may provide the relevance engine 115 with the determined point of interest "LAX" and "clicking @ examplerline.com" as the sender of the email 200. Alternatively, the point of interest engine 105 may provide all or a portion of the email 200 to the correlation engine 115 and the correlation engine 115 may identify the sender of the email 200. Also, for example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine points of interest from calendar entries of the user and provide the relevance engine 115 with an indication that the points of interest and the user are creators of the content.
In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 can identify additional information that includes location information of the user. For example, the correlation engine 115 may identify a user's previous location as indicated by GPS, triangulation of cellular telephone signals, user check-in registration, and the like. Also, for example, the correlation engine 115 can identify online check-in registrations for users at one or more locations. In some implementations, the user's previous location information may be identified from the content database 110. In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 may provide the relevance engine 115 with points of interest and additional information including location information, which may be used by the relevance engine 115 to determine a relevance score.
For example, referring to fig. 4, the point of interest engine 105 may determine multiple points of interest for "ChainRestaurant" based on the content of the email 400. The point of interest engine 105 can provide the relevance engine 115 with addresses of one or more locations of the points of interest "chaninreserve" and/or "chaninreserve". In some implementations, the correlation engine 115 can identify an indication of one or more instances of the user that are located at and/or near one or more of the determined locations of "Chain reserve". The relevance engine 115 can utilize the identified instances of presence of users at and/or near the location of "Chain Restaurant" to determine a relevance score for one or more determined points of interest.
The relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score for the determined point of interest based on the identified additional information. In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 can determine the relevance score as a binary value. For example, the relevance engine 115 can determine that a point of interest is of interest to a user or not of interest to the user. In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 can determine the relevance score as a numerical value, such as a value from 0 to 1 or a value from 0 to 100. For example, the relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score for a point of interest, where a value of 0 indicates that the user is not interested in providing the point of interest, and 100 indicates that the user is very interested in the point of interest (the value between indicates relative interest).
In some implementations, the relevance score can be determined based on references to points of interest identified in the content of one or more sources associated with the user. In some implementations, the relevance score for a point of interest can be based on a count of sources associated with the user that include references to the point of interest. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine points of interest and provide the points of interest to the relevance engine 115. In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 can identify sources that include references to points of interest and determine a relevance score based on a count of sources that include at least one reference to a point of interest. For example, the relevance engine 115 can determine the relevance score based on determining that a threshold number of sources include references to points of interest and/or a count of sources that include references to points of interest during a time period. Also, for example, the relevance engine 115 can determine a relevance score based on determining a frequency of sources that include references to points of interest (among all sources associated with the user, among sources that include points of interest, etc., a frequency of sources that include references over a period of time). In some implementations, the relevance score for a point of interest can be based on a count of references to determined points of interest in the content of one or more sources. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may provide the relevance engine 115 with the determined points of interest and the content from the source used to determine the points of interest. The relevance engine 115 can identify a reference count for the point of interest in the source and/or the relevance engine 115 can identify other sources that include references to the point of interest and determine a frequency of the number of references to the point of interest in the plurality of sources. The relevance engine 115 may utilize the reference counts to the points of interest to determine a relevance score for the points of interest. Also, for example, the relevance engine 115 can determine a frequency of reference to the points of interest. For example, the relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score based on a frequency of reference to a point of interest in all references to the point of interest, a frequency of reference to the point of interest in all references to the point of interest in a source, a frequency of references over a period of time, and so forth.
In some implementations, the relevance score can be based on a time associated with one or more sources that include content related to the point of interest. In some implementations, the relevance score can be based on recency of references to the determined points of interest in the one or more sources. For example, the relevance engine 115 may determine that a relevance score for a point of interest mentioned in a source 24 hours ago indicates that the user is more interested in the point of interest than the point of interest mentioned in the source for the past week. Also, for example, the relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score for a point of interest based on times referenced in one or more sources that include references to the point of interest. For example, based on references in sources that include more recent times being likely to be more relevant to the user than points of interest mentioned at earlier times, relevance engine 115 may determine relevance scores that indicate more relevance for points of interest referenced in sources that include "Weate ther last year" than points of interest referenced in sources that include "Weate ther last year".
In some implementations, the relevance score for a point of interest may be based on an indication of regularity of the user's interactions with the point of interest. For example, the relevance score may be based on identifying that the user interacted with the point of interest on a regular basis, such as on a monthly basis, at least one morning per week, and/or at least one time per week, month, year, and so forth. An indication of the regularity of the interaction with the point of interest may be determined based on, for example, location information indicating that the user has appeared multiple times at and/or near the point of interest over a period of time, recurring calendar events of the user related to the point of interest, multiple views of one or more documents associated with the point of interest over a period of time, multiple search queries of the user related to the point of interest over a period of time, and/or the like.
In some implementations, one or more additional times associated with a source may be used to determine a relevance score for a point of interest related to the content of the source. For example, the message may include content related to the point of interest. The message may be associated with a receive time indicating when the message was received by the user and/or a view time indicating when the message was accessed by the user. For example, the relevance engine 115 can determine a relevance score that indicates when a more relevant user first received the message as compared to a later time after the time of receipt. Also, for example, the relevance engine 115 can determine a relevance score at a first time shortly after the user first accessed the message that indicates more relevance than a relevance score determined at a later time after the first time.
In some implementations, the relevance score for a point of interest can be determined based on a current time associated with content related to the point of interest. For example, referring to fig. 3, a hotel address 315 may be a determined point of interest. In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 can identify check-in and check-out dates as additional information to determine the relevance score for the point of interest. The relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score for a point of interest indicating a more relevant relevance between the check-in date and the check-out date compared to the determined relevance score for the point of interest after the check-out date. Also, for example, the correlation engine 115 may determine that the check-in time is close, indicating a correlation score that is more correlated for the point of interest, reaches a peak correlation score at the check-in date, and decreases after the retirement date.
In some implementations, the relevance score can be determined based on additional information including location information for the user. In some implementations, the relevance score for a point of interest can be based on the frequency of users in the vicinity of the point of interest. For example, the relevance score may be based on a number of times the user visited the point of interest, a frequency with which the user visited the first point of interest and the second determined point of interest, a recency of the user's visit of the point of interest, and/or a length of time the user visited the point of interest in the past. For example, based on the content of email 400, point of interest engine 105 can determine that "Chain resource" is a point of interest and that "Chain resource" has two locations, such as by identifying two addresses that map to entities in entity database 120 that are associated with "Chain resource". The point of interest engine 105 may provide the relevance engine 115 with two addresses and the relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score for each of the locations based on the identified user presence at each of the locations. The relevance score for each of the locations may be determined using a count of the users at each of the locations (or a frequency with which the users are at one of the locations as compared to another location), a recency of the users at each of the locations, and/or a length of stay of the users at each of the locations.
In some implementations, the relevance score may be determined based on identifying a distance between the one or more determined points of interest and another location identified from one or more sources of the user. For example, as previously described, the point of interest engine 105 can determine a plurality of gas station locations as points of interest based on the content of the email 300. The correlation engine 115 may identify the email 300 as additional information and further identify both "123 Airport Road" and "200 s. main Street" as locations included in the content of the email 300. The relevance engine 115 can determine a relevance score for a given gas station for a determined point of interest (i.e., gas station location) based on determining a distance between the given gas station and one or both of the identified addresses.
In some implementations, a personal map may be provided to the user with one or more characteristics determined based on the relevance scores of the points of interest. The personal map may have one or more different visual indications that may be adjusted based on the relevance score. For example, a user may be provided with a personal map having one or more points of interest displayed in varying illustrations (e.g., special symbols based on the type of point of interest), in various colors, in various sizes, and/or in various arrangements (e.g., font, bolding, italics). Also, for example, additional information about points of interest may be provided via a customized point of interest display, such as airport points of interest that are provided with identified flight boarding times and/or flight numbers that have been identified from content of one or more sources related to the point of interest.
For example, referring to FIG. 6, an example illustration of determined points of interest and additional locations is provided. The illustration includes two Gas stations, "Gas Station 1" and "Gas Station2," which may be determined by the point of interest engine 105 as points of interest using the content of the email 300, as described herein. As described herein, the correlation engine 115 may identify the rental car address 310 and the hotel address 315 as additional information. On the illustration of fig. 8, a hotel location and a rental car location are provided. In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 can determine the relevance scores for the "Gas Station 1" and the "Gas Station 2" based on the distance between the point of interest and both the identified rental car address 310 and hotel address 315. For example, the relevance score of "GasStation 1" may be determined based on the distance between "Gas Station 1" and the hotel address 315 and/or the distance between "Gas Station 1" and the rental car address 310. Meanwhile, for example, the correlation engine 115 may determine the correlation score of the "Gas Station 2" based on the distance between the "Gas Station 2" and the hotel address 315 and/or the distance between the "Gas Station 2" and the rental car address 310.
In some implementations, the distance between the point of interest and the additionally identified location may be weighted when used to determine the relevance score. For example, the correlation engine 115 can determine that the distance between the determined gas station point of interest and the identified rental car location can be weighted more than the distance between the gas station point of interest and the identified hotel location. The relevance engine 115 can determine weights for assigning to one or more distances between the additionally identified locations and the determined points of interest based on, for example, the identified trends of the previous location data, weights associated with the one or more entities, and/or relationships between entities in the entity database 120, and/or one or more factors identified from the content of the source (prominence of the additionally identified locations in the content, format of the content, metadata, etc.). Based on determining that "Gas Station 2" is closer to "recent CarLocation", a relevance score of "Gas Station 2" indicating more relevant to the user than the relevance score of "Gas Station 1" may be determined. In some implementations, when determining the relevance score, the distance between the determined point of interest and the further location may be weighted equally. In some implementations, the relevance score can be determined using possible paths between the additionally identified locations. For example, a relevance score for one or more of the gas station points of interest may be determined based on a deviation distance from a path between "Hotel" and "remote Carlocation".
In some implementations, the relevance score can be based on the trustworthiness of the source of the additional information. For example, the relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score that indicates points of interest determined from user-created calendar entries that are more relevant than points of interest determined from emails from unsolicited advertisers.
The relevance score may be utilized to provide an indication of a point of interest on a map that is responsive to a mapping request. For example, in some implementations, a user may submit a mapping request for a geographic area. The user may be provided with a map responsive to the mapping request via the user device 125. In some implementations, a map including an indication of one or more points of interest contained in a geographic area may be provided to a user. For example, a map including restaurants, hotels, sightseeing resorts, and/or other points of interest provided on the map may be provided to the user via the graphical indication.
In some implementations, the one or more points of interest that are provided points of interest may be points of interest provided by the points of interest engine 105. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine a point of interest based on content in a source associated with the user, and may provide another indication, such as an asterisk, an indication of an information box, and/or a location of the point of interest, to the user on a map responsive to a mapping request, wherein the mapped geographic area includes the point of interest. In some implementations, the determined points of interest may be provided to the user in addition to other points of interest not determined by the point of interest engine 105. In some implementations, the indication of points of interest determined by the points of interest engine 105 may have different indications than other points of interest determined by other than the points of interest engine 105. For example, the points of interest determined by the point of interest engine 105 are provided in a color that is different from one or more colors used for other indications of points of interest.
Referring to FIG. 5A, an exemplary graphical user interface for providing an indication including a point of interest to a user is presented. Map 500A includes indications of two points of interest, a restaurant indication 505A and a restaurant indication 510A. In some implementations, one or both of restaurant indications 505A and 510A may be determined by point of interest engine 105. For example, the point of interest engine 105 can determine points of interest corresponding to the restaurant indications 505A and 510A based on content from the email 400.
In some implementations, an indication of one or more points of interest is provided with the map based on the determined relevance scores for the points of interest. For example, an indication of a point of interest is provided with the map only if the determined relevance score satisfies a threshold value. In some implementations, the points of interest are provided with prominence based on their relevance scores. For example, if a relevance score for a first point of interest indicates more relevance than a second point of interest, the point of interest may be provided with higher prominence than the second point of interest. The prominence may include, for example, a font size of the point of interest indication, a color of the point of interest indication, and/or a size of a marking of the point of interest indication.
For example, referring to fig. 5B, an example graphical user interface is provided for a user with a map of points of interest based on the determined relevance scores of the points of interest. Map 500B may respond to the same mapping request as map 500A of fig. 5A. Map 500B includes a restaurant indication 505B. Restaurant indication 505B may be the same indication as restaurant indication 505A. In some implementations, the restaurant indication 505B may be provided with a map based on the determined relevance score for the corresponding point of interest that satisfies the threshold. Additional point of interest indications for the restaurant indication 510A of the map 500A are not provided with the map 500B. In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can determine a point of interest for a restaurant corresponding to the restaurant indication 510A and the relevance engine 115 can determine a relevance score for the point of interest. Based on determining that the relevance score for the point of interest does not satisfy the threshold value, as illustrated in fig. 5B, an indication of a restaurant corresponding to the restaurant indication 510A may not be provided.
Referring to FIG. 5C, an exemplary graphical user interface is presented for providing a user with a map having points of interest with prominence based on a determined relevance score for the points of interest. Map 500C may respond to the same mapping request as map 500A of fig. 5A and map 500B of fig. 5B. In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can determine points of interest that correspond to restaurant indication 505C and restaurant indication 510C. In some implementations, the relevance engine 115 can determine a relevance score for a point of interest, as described herein. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may determine points of interest based on the content of the email 400 of FIG. 4. The relevance engine 115 may determine the relevance score for a point of interest based on additional information from the email 400 and/or from additional sources, such as the user's previous location history, an indicated number of each of the points of interest in the additional sources, and/or content from one or more additional sources. Restaurant indication 505C is provided with a higher prominence than restaurant indication 510C based on the relevance scores corresponding to the points of interest of each of the indications. For example, relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score for a restaurant represented by restaurant designation 505C that indicates a greater relevance than the determined relevance score for the point of interest represented by restaurant designation 510C. For example, based on the user's previous location information and/or additional content including one or more of the points of interest, the relevance engine 115 can determine that the user is likely to be more interested in the point of interest corresponding to the restaurant indication 505C than the point of interest represented by the restaurant indication 510C. In the illustrated interface, restaurant indication 510C has a larger font than restaurant indication 510C. Further, a restaurant offer instruction 505C is bolded. In some embodiments, additional or alternative saliency indications may be utilized, such as different colors and/or different markings.
In some implementations, the relevance scores of the points of interest can be utilized to provide a list of points of interest to the user, where the order of the points of interest is determined based on the relevance scores. For example, the user may be provided with a list of nearby points of interest via an application executing on the user device 125. Points of interest with relevance scores indicating more relevance may be provided higher in the list than points of interest with relevance scores indicating less relevance. Meanwhile, for example, only when the relevance score satisfies a threshold value, the point of interest is provided in the list.
Referring to FIG. 7, a flow diagram of an example method of determining points of interest of a user based on content of one or more sources associated with the user is illustrated. Other embodiments may perform the steps in a different order, omit certain steps, and/or perform different and/or additional steps than those shown in fig. 7. For convenience, the aspects of fig. 7 will be described with reference to one or more components of fig. 1, such as the point of interest engine 105, that may perform the method.
At step 700, content is identified from one or more sources. In some implementations, the content is identified by a component that shares one or more characteristics with the point of interest engine 105. In some implementations, sources that may include content associated with a point of interest may be identified by components that share one or more characteristics with the point of interest engine 105. For example, the point of interest engine 105 may identify emails, instant messages, Web histories, previous location information of the user, calendar entries, and/or other documents associated with the user as sources that may include content related to the point of interest.
In step 705, points of interest are determined based on the content of the identified sources. In some implementations, the point of interest may be determined based on an indication of the point of interest in the source. For example, "123 Airport Road" may be determined as a point of interest based on the term "123 Airport Road" identified into the content of the source. In some implementations, points of interest related to locations indicated in the message may be determined. For example, the email may include information related to renting a car and the point of interest engine 105 may determine one or more gas stations as points of interest. The point of interest engine 105 may determine one or more points of interest related to locations in the content based on, for example, identifying relationships between entities indicated in the content and related entities identified via the entities database 120 and/or other databases. In some implementations, the point of interest engine 105 can determine multiple points of interest from the content of the source. For example, the point of interest engine 105 can determine multiple locations of restaurants as points of interest based on identifying a single reference to a name of the restaurant in the content.
At step 710, additional information associated with the user is identified. In some implementations, the additional information may be from the same source as the content used to determine the point of interest. For example, an email may be utilized to determine the points of interest and additional information from the email may be identified as additional information, such as the sender of the message, the format of terms in the message, and/or metadata associated with the message. In some implementations, additional information may be identified from one or more sources that are not used to determine points of interest. For example, the content of the email may be utilized to determine the point of interest, and the additional information may be identified from other emails, previous location information of the user, the Web history of the user, and/or one or more additional content sources.
Based on this additional information, a relevance score for the point of interest is determined, step 715. The relevance score may be determined by a component that shares one or more characteristics with the relevance engine 115. In some implementations, the relevance score can be a binary value. For example, the relevance score for a point of interest may be "relevant" or "irrelevant", or another binary value. In some implementations, the relevance score can be a relevance index, such as a value between 0 and 100.
In some implementations, the relevance score can be based on a measure of trustworthiness of the source of the additional information. For example, the relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score that indicates points of interest determined from calendar entries created by the user that are more relevant than points of interest determined from emails from unsolicited advertisers. In some implementations, the relevance score can be determined based on past location information of the user. For example, the relevance engine 115 may determine the relevance score for a point of interest based on the frequency with which the user visited the point of interest, the recency with which the user last visited the location, and/or the length with which the user visited the point of interest one or more times. In some implementations, the relevance score can be determined based on the prominence of one or more terms related to the point of interest in the source. For example, the relevance engine 115 may determine a relevance score that indicates more relevant points of interest mentioned in the header of the email than those included in the body of the email. Also, for example, a relevance score may be determined based on the format of the terms in the source.
In some implementations, the relevance score for a point of interest can be determined using the current time. For example, a time may be identified as being related to the point of interest, and a relevance score may be determined based on the time between the current time and the identified relevant time. When a time associated with a point of interest is approached, it may be determined that the relevance score becomes indicative of more relevance. In some implementations, as previously described, one or more additional factors may be utilized to determine the relevance score.
In step 720, point of interest information is provided based on the relevance scores. In some implementations, the point of interest information may be provided via a mapping application. For example, a map including an indication of one or more determined points of interest may be provided to the user. In some implementations, the points of interest may be provided via the mapping application only when the associated relevance score satisfies a threshold. For example, the relevance engine 115 may determine a binary relevance score for a point of interest and provide an indication of the point of interest only if the point of interest is determined to be "relevant". In some implementations, points of interest with prominence relative to the determined relevance score may be provided on a map. For example, the indicated size of a point of interest on a map may be related to the determined relevance score of the point of interest, where the point of interest may appear larger than a point of interest having a relevance score that indicates less relevance.
In some implementations, the point of interest information can be provided to the user via a list of one or more points of interest. For example, the user may be provided with a list of a plurality of points of interest within a threshold distance from the user. In some implementations, the ranking of one or more points of interest in the list can be based on the determined relevance scores of the points of interest. For example, a point of interest appears higher in the list of points of interest than a point of interest having a determined relevance score indicating less relevance. Meanwhile, for example, a point of interest is provided in the list only when the determined relevance score of the point of interest satisfies a threshold value.
