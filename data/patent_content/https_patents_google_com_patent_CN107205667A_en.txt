Background technology
Angiocardiopathy is the main cause of the worldwide incidence of disease, the death rate and cost.Meanwhile, this chronic disease
Disease is largely preventable.Medical science knows how main by eliminating smoking, diabetes and hypertension etc.
Risk factors save these most of life.Also, many people are told, and they only need to what does and just can reduce these
Risk factors：Stop smoking, reduce sugar intake, more health diet, reduce drink, increase cardiovascular exercise, lose weight, with
And if it is necessary, take blood pressure medication.But, many people will not defer to this good suggestion.Therefore, millions of people is unnecessarily dead
In angiocardiopathy.
The reason that people do not defer to this good medical science suggestion thinks it oneself is different because of them, and they are not
Want that changing it is causing the behavior of disease, or they do not know what to change under its particular case.For example, working as doctor
Inform them because it is overweight they when having the risk for suffering from heart disease, many people know that this judgement is not necessarily directed to them
, but based on average level and Demographic.Therefore, reach that specified weight may not be produced to specific human heart
Negative effect.Even if they believe that this judgement is that they are not known that generally also in its particular case for theirs really
Under how to lose weight.For example, individual is made a response to food in a different manner.
Not deferring to this reason advised can look at whether their heart is good for by testing each human heart
Health is solved.Using hard data, if its heart shows that many people of heart disease sign will conscientiously receive this suggestion.It is unfortunate
, measurement health of heart is probably costly and hazardous.For example, can be by placing the conduit to the left side of some human heart
Cardiac pressure-volume ring is determined in ventricle.Although this invasive test can by determine the cardiac pressure-volume ring into
Work(measures this human heart health, but so does the dead probability that this people can be caused to have about 1% at present.This method is also very
It is expensive and can be artificial into serious wound and pressure to this.Therefore, only shown the talent with heart disease according to
This mode is tested, but this generally has little time to save them.
People do not follow this good suggestion or can not follow this good suggestion long-time enough to prevent heart disease
Another reason is because they can't see benefit.When people receive its diet of change and the suggestion being accustomed to, (most people is not desired to this
Sample is done) when, they are usually not visible improvement.They may see the blood pressure for having lost weight themselves and perhaps having seen them
Reduction, but these are not the precisive of health of heart.Therefore, many people return to their old habit, simply later but
Die from heart disease.
The content of the invention
This document describes functional state of the associated blood dynamics understood by pressure-volume loop to Human Physiology system
Noninvasive determination is carried out with trend (such as health of heart).Various Noninvasive health monitors can be used to sense some
The health of people.Although these Noninvasive health monitors may be accurate not as the interior test of invasive heart, for example, it
Need (if any) risk seldom to this people, it is and easy to use for this people.Further, this paper institutes
The technology of description can determine the trend of the cardiovascular health of someone.Using these trend, someone is known that they spend
Whether actually have an impact in the effort for improving its health of heart.It is possible to further find negative trend, this can encourage people
Improve its health or see a doctor.By doing so it is possible, these technologies can save many people, it is to avoid die from heart disease.
The content of the invention is provided to introduce the simplification concept on this technology, it will be entered in a specific embodiment below
Row further description.Present invention is neither intended to the essential characteristic of the theme required by identification, is intended to be used to determine
The scope of required theme.

Other devices can be it is completely passive, such as, pass through closestool 106-4 sense people 102 blood pressure.
In more detail, pressure and electrical sensing mat 106-1 are configured to sense the pulse wave velocity of the blood of people 102.The arteries and veins
Wave velocity of fighting is determined for pressure-volume loop, this will be described later herein.The pulse wave velocity is someone
The measurement of arterial health.In the artery of health, pulse wave velocity is because artery is flexible and relatively low, still, when artery becomes
Hard and when narrowing, pulse wave velocity is improved.Although may or may be forbidden as the specific pulse wave velocity of timely snapshot
Really indicate cardiovascular health (for example, the once test carried out in doctor's office), but the change of the pulse wave velocity
(that is, trend) can be the accurate measurement of the cardiovascular health change of people 102.If positive trends, then it can strengthen people
102 health custom, and if negative, then excitation makes a change.
Mat 106-1 can also measure the electricity of heart by the electric pulse of the polarization by heart tissue and depolarising generation
Conducting system, and this is then converted into waveform (by oneself or by another entity).Only measure or produced with the time
Raw trend can indicate hypercalcinemia, hypocalcemia, potassemia, hypopotassaemia, coronary ischemia or miocardial infarction
(that is, having a heart attack).It is also to be noted that functional state or trend that the data sensed by device 106 are found are (as later
By discussion) can than find otherwise negative heart or other system situations quickly determine negative heart or
Other system situations, so as to keep out decline in health fast enough.
Color detection mirror 106-2 is configured to record the color of the skin for the someone for being enough to determine photo-plethysmographic figure.
Plethysmogram is according to being present in organ, limbs or other human bodies or in organ, limbs or other human body portions
The change of the amount for the blood that bit stream is crossed, to measure the change of organ, the size of limbs or other human bodies or color.Certain
These colors and color change of personal skin can show heart rate and efficiency.Further, color detection mirror 106-2

And skeleton motion, only list three examples.Radar field device 106-5 includes microwave wireless electric device, the Microwave Radio
Element provides radar area, and the radar area is configured to reflect from tissue and penetrates non-human material, such as, by continuously adjusting
Radiation, ultra-wide band radiation or the radiation of submillimeter frequency of system.These reflections can be received by antenna element and then can be with
By signal processor processes to provide sensing data 108.The radar area can from tissue (such as skin, bone or
Cardiac muscle) reflection.For example, it is assumed that people 102 falls asleep and radar field device 106-5 becomes one with the lamp on its bedside cupboard.
Generally, people constantly move, therefore sensing data is probably insecure or noisy.However, in sleeping feelings
Under condition, the chest deflection of radar field device 106-5 measurement people 102 is with recording respiration rate.These chest deflections are included by people's 102
Swing or shake that heartbeat is caused, therefore heart rate can also be calculated.
These examples show some modes, according to these modes, and this technology can be provided than clinic or institute of hospital
The healthy data of the someone of offer generally more valuable (or at least different) data.As described above, tradition is strong
Health monitoring is typically to be carried out in hospital or the office of medical worker.However, the health monitoring in hospital or office
Someone can not be monitored during daily life process.This can be a kind of serious limitation, because in hospital or office
In the snapshot that captures possibly can not reflect the health of this people exactly.This be probably because test be short-term or
Because test is carried out in artificial environment.
Noninvasive health monitoring device 106 is returned to, generally, device 106 there can be various computing capabilitys, although substituting
Ground its can be low energy power apparatus with seldom computing capability or without computing capability.Herein, device 106 includes one

The side that these and other ability and Fig. 1 to Fig. 3 entity are acted and interacted is elaborated in more detail below
Formula.Further these entities can be separated, combined etc..Fig. 1 environment 100 and Fig. 2 and diagrammatically show in detail for Fig. 3 can
Using some in many possible environment of above-mentioned technology.
Exemplary method
The method that Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 depict the Noninvasive determination realized or using cardiac pressure-volume ring.These sides
Method is shown as multigroup frame, and multigroup frame specifies performed operation, but being used for shown by might not being limited to performs
The order of the operation of respective block or combination.In the part of following discussion, Fig. 1 environment 100 and Fig. 2 and figure may be referred to
The entity being illustrated in detail in 3, is merely exemplary to their reference.This technology is not limited to operate on a device
An entity or multiple entities performance.
In 402, from the sensing data of multiple Noninvasive health monitor recipients.Described such as upper part
, these Noninvasive health monitors can include the Noninvasive health monitoring with two or more different forms
Instrument, physiological system is measured by the Noninvasive health monitor, such as, passes through reflected light, sound wave, electromagnetism sensing, radar
With hydrodynamics (for example, pressure-wave velocity measurement).Noninvasive health monitor is to be not required to someone to be sensed clear and definite
Ground operates monitoring device or the health of this people is sensed in the case of actively interacting.Therefore, someone need not be by body temperature
Meter is put into its mouth, wired heart rate sensor is attached into its chest, or interrupt its daily life to monitor its health.
Sensing data from these one or more Noninvasive health monitors can be while or be almost recorded simultaneously
And can passively it be sensed or actively sensed, as described above.
In 404, the functional state of a physiological system in the physiological system of the people is determined based on sensing data.
Health monitoring device can have the different degrees of accuracy, and some health monitoring devices perhaps can sense specific physiology side exactly
Face, in addition it is suitable with invasive sensing, and other health monitoring devices can measure physiological system, but it is not accurate enough, it is not enough
To enable medical personnel to the health that someone is informed based on single or short sensor data acquisition system.However, this imperfect
Sensing can be used for the health for preferably determining someone at least two ways.First way is, to from multiple
The sensing data of device carries out interrelated, polymerization etc., preferably to determine functional state on the whole, it is thus determined that physiology
The current health of system.The second way is that functional state possibly can not indicate current health, but the functional state is with the time
Change can indicate trend, the trend indicate health change.For example, it is contemplated that following simple situation：When someone is in depth
During sleep, breathing, heart rate and the skin temperature of this people is measured and by its interrelated (based on the time sensed).It is based on
One kind in these functional states or both functional state, medical worker possibly can not determine the health of this people, this be because
Behaviour is different.Statistics and demographic statistics, it may be enough even about data of general health of this people etc.
Determine the health of this people.The machine for the breathing of this people, heart rate and skin temperature within several weeks, several months or several years is shown
The trend of the change of energy state can show that this human heart has to work harder than in the past or heart less has
Effect etc..Determining the functional state of the physiological system of this people can be incited somebody to action by the submicrosecond class precision relevant with the element of physiological system
The sensing data of a Noninvasive health monitor in multiple Noninvasive health monitors is multiple non-with coming from
The sensing data of another Noninvasive health monitor in invasive health monitor is interrelated.
By using Fig. 1 to Fig. 3 example, Fig. 3 and Fig. 1 Noninvasive health monitoring device 106 pass through health monitoring
Sensor 308 senses each sensing data 108.Then the sensing data 108 is passed by wire/wireless transceiver 308
Transport to computing device 110.At the transceiver 204 of computing device 110, from ultrasonic bathtub 106-3, mat 106-1 and color sense
Survey the sensing data 108 that mirror 106-2 receives the transmission.Manager 210 and then usually used each sensing data of measurement
108 time 212 sensing data 108 is carried out it is interrelated, polymerization and analyze, with determine functional state 214 and
Store the state.
In 406, the functional state is recorded.The functional state can be recorded in the people it is local or it is remote with the people
Computing device (such as computing device 110) in.Generally, to functional state sensing and the determination repetition with timed transition,
402,404 and 406 are repeated after operation 406.However, in some cases, it is determined that the functional state determined in 404 is full
Sufficient danger threshold.In this case, method 400 enters operation 408.
In 408, exceed secure threshold in response to functional state, warn the people or the medical matters people associated with the people
Member.The threshold value can be simple too high maximal blood pressure, too fast or irregular heart rate or low blood oxygen level.The threshold
Value can also be complicated or more doubt, and such as, some human heart is shown during shrinking from relaxing that ventricle sprays
Latter stage volume is less than 0.55 (this is that the measurement and low fraction of LVEF (EF) can indicate that heart disease will break out).
In 410, the functional state of functional state and other precedence records based on physiological system determines physiological system
Healthy trend.As described by operation 408, in some cases, this technology as described above warns the people or medical matters
Personnel's functional state has exceeded secure threshold.The healthy trend of determination may also exceed secure threshold.In this case, method
400 entrance operations 408, and not operation 412.For example, it is assumed that being 200lbs in the body weight that some point measures this people.This is in itself
Perhaps any problem can not be illustrated.If the body weight of this people is raised to 205 from 200 in one week process and is raised again to 210, this
People has been likely to occur heart failure.The trend (body weight quickly increases) can indicate the heart of exhaustion.Warn the medical matters of this people
Personnel can save his life, because doctor perhaps can be intervened before serious heart attack.
In 412, the trend or functional state of the determination of the people are provided to the people or its associated medical matters people
Member.Can there is provided these trend after a number of measurement, past multiple periods (for example, 30 days) etc. has been carried out
And functional state.In some cases, these trend and functional state are provided to the manager 210 of computing device 110, the pipe
Then reason device 210 is such as directly presented these trend and functional state by the user interface on computing device 110 to this people.
It can so help to encourage this people, so as to help this people to proceed the change process of health or supervise them to change life
Mode living.
(still can be detailed to this progress in method 600 although describing the above method 400 under the background of cardiovascular system
Thin description), but this technology is not limited to cardiovascular system.For example, it is contemplated that the skeletal system of old women.The physiological system,
Although the reason for not being the death of big percentage, but the reason for be many dead and reduction health in the elderly.It is right
In the example, it is assumed that use multiple radar field device 106-5, the camera associated with game device and ultrasonic bathtub
106-3 non-invasively monitors the skeletal system of the women.Fig. 5 illustrates the room for being placed with two radar field device 106-5
The principal plane figure of son 502, a radar field device is placed in parlor 504, and another radar field device is placed on kitchen 506
In.Camera 508 is in media room 510.Radar field device 106-5 can sense height, skeletal shape and the body of woman 512
Motion.Camera 508 can sense the body kinematics and height of woman 512, and sense in lesser degree skeletal shape.It is super
Sound bathtub 106-3 can measure the bone density (not shown herein, referring to Fig. 3) of woman 512.Using from each device this four
Individual measurement result, manager 210 determines the functional state of the skeletal system of woman 512.It is then possible to determination trend, the trend
Osteoporosis or problematic knee or hip joint can be indicated, thus indicates that this woman can carry out medicine and life
The risk factors for changing to slow down the negative trend or avoid these problems of mode living.
Fig. 6 depicts method 600, and this method 600 describes non-invasively true by the difference of cardiac pressure-volume ring
Determine the mode of trend.
In 602, someone is determined based on the first non-invasive sensor data sensed in first time period
The first cardiac pressure-volume ring.The non-invasive sensor data include sensor described above data, such as pass through figure
The pressure-wave velocity of 1 or Fig. 3 mat 106-1 and closestool 106-4 description.For example, the sensing data can include reflection
The ballistocardiogram of pressure pulse or the ballistocardiogram for being determined for reflecting pressure pulse.
For context, it is considered to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, it respectively illustrates out-of-phase diagram 700 and pressure-volume loop 800.Pressure
Power-time diagram 700 shows the measurement twice for same time：LVP (left ventricular pressure) and LVV (left ventricular volume).Though
It is so Utopian, out-of-phase diagram 700 shows cardiac cycle of the heart under various actions, mitral valve closure 702, main
Arterial valve opens 704, aortic valve closing 706 and mitral valve open 708.EDV 710 shows end-diastolic volume, and ESV
712 show end-systolic volume, and stroke volume (SV) is (as shown in Figure 8) to subtract ESV equal to EDV.
Pressure-volume loop 800 is shown for single cardiac cycle graphic LVP and LVV relative to each other.These show
Go out available for the hemodynamic parameter for determining health of heart, including stroke volume 802, diastolic filling 804, isovolumic contraction period
806th, blood 808 and isovolumic relaxation period 810 are penetrated.Pressure-volume loop is cardiac function and is therefore also this human heart health
Useful visable representation, similarly the change of the pressure-volume loop of heart be also in this way, later will below to this progress
Description and explanation.
In 604, determine the people's based on the second non-invasive sensor data sensed in second time period
Second cardiac pressure-volume ring.This is to be based on above-mentioned second data.For the accurate pressure in heart or volume unit,
Similar to above-mentioned first ring, the second cardiac pressure-volume ring is probably or may not be accurate.However, according to similar
Two rings measuring of mode between trend the change of health of heart can be sufficiently accurately shown.
In 606, by by the first ring and the second ring be compared to determine the people the first cardiac pressure-volume ring and
Change between second cardiac pressure-volume ring.One in many changes that can measure is described after operation 608 below
The many examples and corresponding healthy trend changed a bit.
In 608, the trend for the cardiovascular health that patient is determined based on the change between the first ring and the second ring.This becomes
Gesture can indicate health improvement, decline or without change, as described below.
Fig. 9 illustrates pressure volume diagram 900, the figure shows two rings, the change between them and it is corresponding become
Gesture.Trend herein indicated at increased convergent force, the second end-systolic pressure PRESSURE-VOLUME RELATION (ESPVR) 906 of the second ring 904 with
The increased steepness that first end-systolic pressure PRESSURE-VOLUME RELATION (ESVPR) 908 of the first ring 902 is compared shows the increased receipts
Contracting power.As can easily be seen, the accurate measurement without the pressure and volume of the first ring 902 and the second ring 904 can be shown
Go out the trend (being shown at trend arrow 910) of this increased steepness, therefore the health represented by this trend can be showed
Situation.
Figure 10 illustrates Figure 100 0 of increased afterload.The Figure 100 0 illustrates the first cardiac pressure-volume ring (first
Ring) 1002 together with the second cardiac pressure-volume ring (the second ring) 1004, wherein, the difference between the first ring and the second ring is shown
From the arterial elasticity of the reduction of the second arterial elasticity 1010 of the ring of arterial elasticity 1008 to the second 1004 of the first ring 1002 (or
Increased hardness) trend 1006.The arterial elasticity of reduction is typically the index of health of heart decline.
Figure 11 illustrates Figure 110 0 of dilated cardiomyopathy.The Figure 110 0 illustrates the first cardiac pressure-volume ring (first
Ring) 1102 together with the second cardiac pressure-volume ring (the second ring) 1104, wherein, the trend 1106 between the first ring and the second ring
The EDPVR 1110 of rings of EDPVR 1108 to the second 1104 from the first ring 1102 skew to the right is shown and from the first ring
The skew to the right of the slope of the ESPVR 1114 of 1102 rings of ESPVR 1112 to the second 1104 decline.The trend is (described
Skew) indicate ventricular dilatation, but ventricle wall thickens in the absence of compensation.Therefore, left ventricle can not pump out enough blood, and this can
Can be fatal.However, if it find that obtaining early, then the trend is probably reversible.
In addition to these three trend shown in heart pressure rings, there is also many other trend, such as, in fig. 12
1200 at at the left ventricular hypertrophy shown in trend 1202 and 1300 in fig. 13 with the restricted type shown in trend 1302
Cardiomyopathy.There is also can be schemed by the valve disease shown in the trend of pressure-volume loop, including at Figure 140 0 in Figure 14
Show aortic stenosis (the second ring 1404 for showing the first ring 1402 of healthy valve and suffering from aortic stenosis, with instruction
The trend 1406 shown in arrow that ring-shaped changes) and Figure 15 in Figure 150 0 at the mitral stenosis that is illustrated (show to be good for
First ring 1502 of health valve shows trend with the second ring 1504 for suffering from mitral stenosis, with the arrow of indicating ring alteration of form
1506)。
The reflux of two kinds of forms can also be shown by the change of cardiac pressure-volume ring：At Figure 16 Figure 160 0
The aortic regurgitation shown is (as the first ring 1602 and the second ring for suffering from aortic regurgitation of the pressure-volume loop of health
1604, with the trend 1606 shown in the arrow of the alteration of form of indicating ring) and the bicuspid valve that is shown at Figure 17 Figure 170 0
Reflux is (as the first ring 1702 and the second ring 1704 for suffering from mitral regurgitation of the pressure-volume loop of health, with the shape of indicating ring
The trend 1706 shown in arrow that shape changes).Some in many trend that can be detected the figures illustrate this technology become
Gesture.
