Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to semiconductor chip fabrication, and more particularly to a method for generating an optical proximity correction (OPC) model for printing a circuit pattern on a photoresist layer of a semiconductor wafer.
- OPC optical proximity correction
- the invention is also an optical lithography system which generates an OPC model of this type.
- Model-based and hybrid rules/model-based optical proximity correction schemes are becoming the standard in the industry. In many situations, and especially when applying assist features, it makes the most sense to use a rules-based approach to apply some corrections followed by a model-based correction to clean up any problem spots. In order for this scheme to work, the rules and model must be compatible, so that the model-based correction does not find errors with the desired rules-based corrections.
- OPC models are typically broken into two sections. One section describes the aerial image that is expected from a given wafer pattern and the other section describes the effects of the mask making and lithography/etch processes. OPC models of this type are calibrated by measuring the dimensions of known test structures exposed on a wafer. The aerial images of the test structures are then computed and the difference between these and the measured structures is used to determine the process model.
- One advantage of the approach taken by the invention derives from the use of sophisticated rules generation methods which determine correction rules that account for variations in mask and wafer processes. Conventional methods used to generate OPC models do not account for such process variations.
- a method which generates an optical proximity correction (OPC) model in accordance with steps that include generating a set of correction rules for a wafer design containing a multitude of lines separated from each other by various spacings, determining a set of corrections that need to be made over a range of sizes and spaces of said lines based on the set of correction rules, and then creating an optical proximity correction model for correcting the wafer design based on the set of corrections.
- OPC optical proximity correction
- the correction rules are generated using a process window analysis, although a line-width analysis may also be used.
- FIG. 1 is a flow diagram showing steps included in preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention
- FIG. 2 shows example test structures (or patterns) that may be used to generate OPC and assist feature rules
- FIGS. 3A and 3B show a methodology of determining OPC and assist feature rules using a process window analysis
- FIG. 4A shows an example of conventional correction rules for the main feature size
- FIG. 4B shows the assist feature size as a function of spacing between main features
- FIGS. 5A and 5B show the methodology for generating model calibration data
- FIGS. 6A and 6B show, respectively, two tables containing model calibration data for the industry standard method and the rules-based method.
- FIG. 7 is a sample design layout and corresponding wafer image showing the need for model-based OPC on an assist feature layout.
- a preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention for generating an optical proximity model may be performed in four steps.
- the method begins by exposing test patterns, transferring these patterns onto a silicon wafer and then measuring their size. (Block 1 ).
- a second step is to analyze the measurement data to create an OPC rules table. (Block 2 ).
- this table could define the placement and size of sub-resolution assist features.
- correction rules in the OPC table may be generated using a process window analysis such as disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/754,910 the contents of which arc incorporated by reference herein.
- a third step involves further analyzing the measurement data to create entries for a model calibration table. (Block 3 ).
- This table preferably contains entries that relate printed wafer dimensions with design dimensions.
- a fourth step includes using this table to calibrate an imaging model that may then be used to apply optical proximity corrections to a photomask design. (Block 4 ).
- test patterns or test structures exposed in the first step are shown in FIG. 2 .
- various line-space patterns 201 - 206 are shown with the spacing between lines generally increasing from the top of the figure to the bottom.
- some spacings have been drawn including sub-resolution assist features. These features are sub-resolution shapes that do not print on the wafer, but rather help to improve the process window to print the main features.
- An integrated circuit design would only include main features and it is the function of the OPC software of the present invention to add assist features as required.
- shapes 210 and 211 represent main features that exist in the IC design and which are separated by spacing 214 . They will typically be patterned onto a photomask as opaque lines on a clear background. If the IC design is modified by OPC software, sub-resolution assist features such as 212 and 213 may be added to the design. These assist features will be subsequently patterned onto the photomask as opaque lines, along with the main features. However, since the assist features are sub-resolution, their image will not be transferred onto the wafer during the ensuing wafer processing step. The presence of assists, however, will affect the aerial image which is projected onto the wafer, so as to make the image of an isolated line behave more like a nested line when process variables such as focus and dose are adjusted. In this way, the process window to print lines at various spacings can be made to better coincide.
- the OPC software will analyze the spacing between two designed main features and add the proper number of assist shapes into this space. As the spacing between the main features changes, not only can the number of assist features placed in this space change, but the size and location of these assists can also change. Likewise, the sizes of the main features can also be adjusted as the spacing between these features changes. All of the edges that can be varied are marked with a double-headed arrow.
- the test patterns used in the first step should consist of various combinations of main and assist features, with the main feature spacing covering a range from essentially the minimum allowed in a design out to optically isolated.
- the combinations shown in FIG. 2 are examples.
- the test patterns are described in the following discussion and, unless stated otherwise, it will be assumed that all required patterns will be available to analyze.
- FIG. 2 shows one-dimensional line-space patterns, those skilled in the art can appreciate that two-dimensional patterns such as line ends and corners could also be analyzed in accordance with the present invention.
- test patterns should be exposed into photoresist and transferred onto one or more silicon wafers using a focus-expose-matrix (FEM). Exposing an FEM allows the process window to print features to be computed, as the response of the wafer dimension to changes in focus and dose can be measured.
- FEM focus-expose-matrix
- the second step of the method involves the generation of OPC and assist feature rules. Having exposed and measured an FEM for test patterns in the first step, the measurement data may then be used to generate a rules table for optical proximity corrections (i.e., correction rules) as shown in FIG. 3 . These rules are typically created at the minimum allowed line width in a design. Initially, a reference line space pattern 30 is analyzed (FIG. 3 A). This pattern could consist of a nested pattern of lines where the line size equals the minimum allowed line size and the spacing between the lines equals the minimum allowed spacing.
- the minimum allowable pitch (pitch equals line size plus space size) could be used, but the line:space ratio adjusted to maximize the process window to print features at a desired wafer dimension.
- Other patterns could also be chosen as the reference pattern and for this discussion, and it will be assumed that the reference pattern consists of a line size L T separated from other lines by a spacing S r .
- This line is printed on the wafer, at 31 , at a dimension of R r with a corresponding process window, at 32 .
- the process window is defined as the process conditions, namely focus and exposure dose, where a pattern prints within some tolerance of its desired size on the wafer, in this case R r .
- the size of the pattern on the wafer should be measured as the exposure dose and focus are varied, as in an FEM.
- functional forms can be fit to this data which specify the printed wafer dimension as a function of focus and exposure dose. From these functions, the process conditions can be determined at which the wafer dimension equals its desired, or target, dimension plus or minus its wafer size tolerance.
- Curve 36 represent the focus and dose combinations that result in the wafer dimension equaling the target dimension plus the wafer size tolerance.
- curve 37 represent the process conditions where the wafer dimension equals the target dimension minus the size tolerance. This tolerance is typically set at ⁇ 10% of the desired dimension.
- the process conditions (combinations of focus and dose) contained within the size tolerance curves represent the process window in which the feature prints within tolerance on the wafer.
- the process window to print the reference pattern (L r , S r ) at the reference target dimension R r is referred to as the reference process conditions.
- FIG. 3B illustrates a method to use this process window to determine a set of correction rules in accordance with the present invention.
- the process conditions must shift from those corresponding to a smaller line printed at the same dimension. So, for a given spacing S i , the best overlapping process window with the reference pattern, at 35 , is found by adjusting the line width, L ir at 33 , until the process conditions to print the feature on size, at 34 , overlap the reference process conditions.
- the process conditions to print the feature within its wafer size tolerance are bounded by curves 38 and 39 .
- a set of line sizes (L ir ), and, where appropriate, assist feature sizes and placements, can be found for a set of spacings S i that span a range from the minimum allowable spacing out to optically isolated.
- the subscripts i and j represent indices for sets of variables.
- the subscript r is used to specify a single index value corresponding to the reference values.
- a variable with multiple indices, such as L ij can take on N i times N j values, where N i and N j are the number of values in the sets indexed by i and j, respectively.
- this variable can only take on N i values, since r is fixed.
- All of these values make up a set of correction rules that are a function of spacing between main features.
- FIGS. 4A and 4B A graphical example of these rules is shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, where main feature size and assist feature size are respectively plotted as a function of spacing.
- the breaks in the curves represent points where the number of assist features used in the given space changes.
- the rules have also been snapped to a discrete grid that is related to the product design grid, which typically is an integer fraction of the design grid, e.g., one-fourth.
- correction rules are determined, once they are determined, they can be used to generate a model calibration table. The method to do this is described in FIG. 5 .
- a set of lines, at 50 of various sizes on the photomask, L rj , are imaged onto the wafer, at 51 .
- a resist size R j can be found so that the process conditions bounded by the target plus tolerance and the target minus tolerance curves, 53 and 54 , provide the best overlap with the reference process conditions.
- a set of resist dimensions, R j are determined that correspond to a set of lines, L rj , at the reference spacing, S r .
- the resist dimensions, R j are then used in FIG. 5B to find the optimum line width, L ij , at an arbitrary spacing, S i .
- the line width, at 55 is varied so that the process conditions to print the feature at the resist dimensions, R j at 56 , overlap the reference process conditions, at 57 .
- curve fitting to the process window as a function of line width can be used to find the optimum line width, even if this condition does not exist in the set of exposed test patterns.
- the method used to determine the assist sizes and placements, along with the main feature line widths, for the resist sizes, R j may deviate slightly from the method used to generate the correction rules.
- the assist feature sizes and placements for a given space S i are constrained to the values found in the correction rules.
- the benefit of this method is that it fits well with current OPC models and software, which work best when the assist features are placed by only examining the space between critical lines, not the lines themselves.
- various assist sizes and placements can be examined for each spacing, S i , and a response surface (curve fit) be found for each of the assist feature parameters (sizes and locations), along with the line sizes under examination.
- One approach to this would be to find the response surface for the size of the process window as a function of line width and assist parameters.
- the optimum line size, L ij can then be found by determining the maximum of this surface, while constraining the assist sizes and placements to those determined by the correction rules for the given spacing, S i .
- assist parameter optimization may be accomplished through a straightforward generalization of the response surface approach, where instead of constraining the assist parameters to those found for the correction rules, these values are left unconstrained and all values are found by finding the maximum of the response surface.
- the output of the steps described to this point can be entered into a table of values that is used to calibrate an imaging model, as described in the fourth step.
- Example tables for both the industry standard method and the rules-based method are shown in FIG. 6 .
- the wafer dimensions R ij for a set of line-space combinations (L j , S i ) are measured at a fixed focus and dose condition.
- the line and space sizes therefore, fall on the test mask design grid and the measured wafer dimensions are not constrained to any grid.
- These patterns are then simulated, using aerial image simulation and a simple resist model, and a size determined for each of the aerial image patterns, A ij .
- the delta from the aerial image size to the measured wafer size, Dij can then be determined by subtracting the measured wafer size, R j , from the aerial image size, A ij .
- This delta value is then fit to a functional form and this function is used as a process model to account for the wafer processing effects that are not captured in the aerial image computation.
- the combination of the aerial image computation and the process model make up an imaging model that can accurately predict how a designed pattern will be transferred onto a wafer at the given focus and dose conditions.
- FIG. 7 An example of the need for this is shown in FIG. 7 .
- assist features have been added to a design using a rules-based OPC routine. Due to the two-dimensional aspect of the design, the correction close to the fan-out region, 72 , is insufficient and necking of the wafer image is observed, 74 . Following the rules-based correction with a model-based correction would improve the performance of the fan-out region, but it is important that it not “re-correct” the primarily one-dimensional line space regions, 71 and 73 .
- FIG. 6B shows a model calibration table that ensures this compatibility.
- R j measured wafer dimensions
- the resist values are constrained to a small set, while the line widths are allowed to vary freely without being constrained to a design grid.
- the model calibration can then proceed as in the industry standard method.
- the line-space combinations (L ij , S i ) are again simulated and a size determined from the aerial image A ij .
- the delta from the aerial image to the wafer image D ij is then fit to a function to create the process model.
