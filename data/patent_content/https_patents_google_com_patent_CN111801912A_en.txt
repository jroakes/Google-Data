When accessed, the appliance may announce itself to the smart home network, for example by indicating what type of appliance it is, and it may automatically integrate with the smart home's controls. Such communication of appliances to smart homes may be facilitated by any wired or wireless communication protocol now known or later developed. The smart home may also include one or more of a variety of non-communicating conventional appliances 140, such as old conventional washer/dryers, refrigerators, etc., which may be controlled, albeit roughly (on/off), by one or more smart wall plugs 110. The smart home environment 100 may also include one or more of a variety of at least partially communicating conventional appliances 142, such as infrared ("IR") controlled wall air conditioners or other IR control devices, which may be controlled by IR signals provided by one or more smart hazard detectors 104 or one or more smart wall switches 108.
The smart-home environment 100 of fig. 1 may also include one or more smart, multi-sensing, network-connected door handle electronics or components 122 (hereinafter "smart door handles 122"). For example, as shown in fig. 1, the illustrated smart door handle 122 may be disposed at or provided by an exterior surface of the exterior door 120 of the smart home environment 100. However, it should be understood that the smart door handle 122 may be disposed on either or both sides of one, some, or all of the doors of the smart-home environment 100. The smart-home environment 100 of fig. 1 may also include one or more smart, multi-sensing, network-connected lamp electronics or components 170 (hereinafter "smart lamps 170") that may house light sources having variable intensity. Further, according to an embodiment, the color of the light emitted from the lamp 170 may be variable. In addition to housing light sources, the smart light 170 may also house occupancy sensors, such as ultrasonic or passive IR sensors, and ambient light sensors, such as photo-resistors or single pixel sensors that measure light in a room. The smart light 170 may be configured to activate the light source when its ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark and/or when its occupancy sensor detects the presence or movement of a person. The smart light 170 may be configured to adjust the color and intensity of the light source (e.g., the smart light 170 may be configured to adjust the intensity of the light source in a manner that the intensity is inversely proportional to the amount of natural light detected in the environment). The smart lamp 170 may include a low power wireless communication chip (e.g., a Zigbee chip) that periodically emits messages regarding occupancy of the room and the amount of light in the room, including instant messages consistent with the occupancy sensor detecting the presence of a person in the room.
The smart thermostat 102, smart hazard detector 104, smart doorbell 106, smart wall switch 108, smart wall plug 110, smart entry detector 112, smart appliance 113, smart door 120, smart door handle 122, keypad, and other devices of the smart-home environment 100 (collectively referred to herein as "network-connected smart devices") may be communicatively coupled to each other and to a central server or cloud computing system 164 to achieve home security and/or smart-home goals for the smart-home environment. In addition to containing processing and sensing capabilities, each network-connected smart device may be capable of data communication and information sharing with any other network-connected smart device as well as any central server or cloud computing system 164 or any other device networked anywhere in the world to achieve home security and/or smart home goals. The required data communication may be performed using any of a variety of custom or standard wireless protocols (Wi-Fi, Zigbee, 6LoWPAN, 3G/4G/5G, etc.) and/or any of a variety of custom or standard wired protocols (CAT6 ethernet, HomePlug, etc.). In some cases, if a primary communication mechanism (e.g., Wi-Fi) becomes disabled, for example, due to a power outage, a backup wireless communication mechanism (e.g., 3G/4G/5G) may be provided.
All or some of the network-connected intelligent devices may act as wireless or wired repeaters. For example, a first one of the network-connected smart devices may communicate with a second one of the network-connected smart devices via the wireless router 160. Network-connected smart devices may also communicate with each other via a connection to a network, such as the internet 162. Through the internet 162, the network-connected smart devices may communicate with a central server or cloud computing system 164. The central server or cloud computing system 164 may be associated with a manufacturer, support entity, or service provider (e.g., a home security provider) associated with the network-connected smart device. For one embodiment, the user may be able to use one of the network-connected smart devices itself to contact local law enforcement and other emergency or security personnel, as well as contact customer support, without using other communication mechanisms, such as a telephone or an internet-connected computer. Further, software updates and security alerts may be automatically sent from the central server or cloud computing system 164 to the network-connected smart device (e.g., when available, when purchased, at regular intervals, when emergency news needs to be broadcast throughout the home, when security systems need to be armed, and when smart home environments need to be locked). In some embodiments, certain functions and capabilities of environment 100 may be enabled without active access to the internet or remote servers or data sources. Rather, in some embodiments, various smart devices of environment 100 (e.g., devices 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 113, 114, 116, 120, 122, 166, 168, 170, etc.) may be enabled to communicate with one another without actively communicating with internet 162 and system 164, and the data of these devices may be analyzed locally to environment 100 (e.g., at a dedicated central processing unit device or computing system of environment 100, or at one or more processors of the various smart devices of environment 100) by any suitable computing system to determine the functionality of environment 100, for example, in conjunction with a rule-based inference engine and/or artificial intelligence and/or any suitable intelligent environment data and/or any suitable rule or setting or inference or schema that may be associated with environment 100.
According to an embodiment, network-connected smart devices, some of which may be "speaker (spokesman)" nodes and others of which may be "low-power" nodes, may combine to create a mesh of speaker nodes and low-power nodes in the smart-home environment 100. The speaker node is sometimes referred to herein as a "smart" node. It should be appreciated that non-smart devices may be implemented as low power nodes. The speaker node and the low power node may be communicatively interconnected and may be operable to achieve a common goal or achieve a common goal in a smart home environment. In some embodiments, some or all of the speaker node and the low power node may perform one or more functions in a coordinated manner to achieve a common goal. Example functions and goals may include, but are not limited to, triggering an alarm to achieve a goal of protecting a home, adjusting thermostat settings to achieve a goal of comfort of the home, at least partially opening and/or closing an entryway using a smart door to achieve a goal of comfort of the home and/or protection of the home, and turning lights on and off to achieve a goal of protecting the home or for use by occupants. Other example goals and functions are also provided herein. Some network-connected smart devices in the smart-home environment 100 may be battery-powered, while others may have a conventional and reliable power source, such as by being connected to wiring behind the wall 154 of the smart-home environment 100 (e.g., to 120V line voltage wiring). Network-connected smart devices with a conventional reliable power supply may be referred to as "talker" nodes. These nodes may be equipped with the ability to facilitate bi-directional communication with various other devices in the smart-home environment 100 and the central server or cloud computing system 164 using any wireless protocol or means. On the other hand, network-connected smart devices that are powered by batteries may be referred to as "low-power" nodes. These nodes may tend to be smaller than speaker nodes and may communicate using wireless protocols that may require very little power (e.g., Zigbee, 6LoWPAN, etc.). Furthermore, some, but not all, of the low power nodes may not be able to communicate bi-directionally. These low power nodes may send messages, but they may not be able to "listen". Thus, other network-connected smart devices (e.g., speaker nodes) in the smart-home environment 100 may not send information to these low-power nodes.
As described above, the network-connected smart devices may function as low-power nodes and speaker nodes to create a mesh network in the smart-home environment 100. The various low-power nodes in the smart-home environment may periodically send out messages about what they sense, and other low-power nodes in the smart-home environment, in addition to sending out their own messages, may repeat the messages, which may cause messages to travel from one node to another throughout the smart-home environment 100 (e.g., from one network-connected smart device to another network-connected smart device). The speaker nodes in the smart-home environment 100 may be able to "drop" to a low power communication protocol to receive these messages, translate the messages to other communication protocols, and/or send the translated messages to other speaker nodes and/or to a central server or cloud computing system 164. Thus, low power nodes using low power communication protocols may be able to send messages across the entire smart-home environment 100 and through the internet 162 to a central server or cloud computing system 164. The mesh network may enable the central server or cloud computing system 164 to periodically receive data from all of the network-connected smart devices in the smart home environment, make inferences based on the data, and/or send commands back to individual ones of the network-connected smart devices to achieve some of the home security goals described herein. For example, if a home security system is armed and one of the low-power or high-power nodes detects movement, the node may send a corresponding message through the mesh network to the central server or cloud computing system 164, which the central server or cloud computing system 164 may process and determine an appropriate response, such as contacting an authority and/or home owner and instructing a network-connected smart device to enter an alarm mode, which may involve activating a light, sounding an audible alarm, and so forth.
As described above, the speaker node and some low power nodes may be able to "listen". Thus, the user, other devices, and the central server or cloud computing system 164 may communicate control to the low power nodes. For example, a user may use a portable electronic device (e.g., a smartphone) 166 to send commands to the central server or cloud computing system 164 over the internet, and the central server or cloud computing system 164 may then relay the commands to the speaker node in the smart-home environment 100. The speaker node may drop to a low power protocol to transmit commands to low power nodes throughout the smart home environment, as well as other speaker nodes that do not receive commands directly from the central server or cloud computing system 164. In some embodiments, the low power node and the speaker node may be the same type of device (e.g., hazard detector, thermostat, wall plug, etc.). In some embodiments, the low power node and the speaker node may be the same. For example, in some embodiments, all low power nodes and speaker nodes may have the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) and/or be capable of performing any role, such as playing the role of a low power node and/or speaker node.
Examples of speaker nodes may include a smart doorbell 106, a smart thermostat 102, a smart wall switch 108, a smart wall plug 110, a keypad, a door 120, a doorknob 122, and so forth. These devices 102, 106, 108, 110, 120, and 122 may often be located near and connected to a reliable power source and thus may include more power consuming components, such as one or more communication chips capable of bi-directional communication in any protocol.
One example of a low power node may be a smart light 170. According to an embodiment, the lamp 170 may accommodate a light source having a variable intensity. Further, according to an embodiment, the color of the light emitted from the lamp 170 may be variable. In addition to housing light sources, the smart light 170 may also house occupancy sensors, such as ultrasonic or passive IR sensors, and ambient light sensors, such as photo-resistors or single pixel sensors that measure light in a room. In some embodiments, the smart light 170 may be configured to activate the light source when its ambient light sensor detects darkness in a room and/or when its occupancy sensor detects the presence or movement of a person. The smart light 170 may be configured to adjust the color and intensity of the light source. The smart lamp 170 may include a low power wireless communication chip (e.g., a Zigbee chip) that periodically emits messages regarding occupancy of the room and the amount of light in the room, including instant messages consistent with the occupancy sensor detecting the presence of a person in the room. As described above, these messages may be sent wirelessly from one node to another within the smart-home environment 100 (i.e., from one network-connected smart device to another network-connected smart device) using a mesh network and to a central server or cloud computing system 164 over the internet 162.
Another example of a low power node is a battery-powered version of the smart hazard detector 104. These smart hazard detectors 104 may generally be located in areas where constant and reliable power is not available, and may include any number and type of sensors, such as smoke/fire/heat sensors, carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide sensors, occupancy/motion sensors, ambient light sensors, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and the like. Further, the smart hazard detector 104 may include a low power wireless communication chip (e.g., a ZigBee chip) that periodically sends messages corresponding to each of the respective sensors to other network connected smart devices and a central server or cloud computing system 164, for example, by using a mesh network as described above.
According to an embodiment, the network-connected devices (also referred to as low-power nodes and high-power nodes) of the smart-home environment 100 may be capable of enhancing home security. For example, all or some of the network-connected smart devices may be equipped with motion sensing, thermal sensing, pressure sensing, noise sensing, or other types of sensing capabilities that are combined with rule-based inference engines and/or artificial intelligence of the central server or cloud computing system 164 to detect the presence, movement, and/or identity of people, animals, and objects and to trigger various alerts if people, animals, or objects are in the wrong location at the wrong time inside or anywhere within the residence of the smart-home environment 100.
Through the network connection, the user may interact remotely with one or more of the network-connected smart devices. For example, a user may communicate with one or more of the network-connected smart devices using a computer (e.g., desktop, laptop, or tablet) or other portable or any other suitable type of consumer electronic device (e.g., smartphone) 166. The web page or application may be configured to receive communications from the user and control one or more of the network-connected smart devices based on the communications and/or present information to the user regarding the operation of the devices. For example, a user may view, arm, or disarm a home's security system. The user may be inside the structure or outside the structure during telecommunications.
The user may use the network connected computer or portable electronic device 166 to control one or more of the network connected smart devices in the smart home environment 100. In some examples, some or all occupants (e.g., individuals residing in a living home) may register their devices 166 with the smart-home environment 100. Such registration may occur at a central server to authenticate occupants and/or devices 166 as being associated with the smart-home environment 100 and to allow occupants to use the devices 166 to control the network-connected smart devices and security systems of the smart-home environment 100. Occupants can use their registered devices 166 to remotely control the network-connected smart devices and security systems of the smart-home environment 100, such as when the occupants are at work or on vacation. Occupants may also use their registered devices 166 to control network-connected smart devices when they are actually located inside the smart-home environment 100, such as when the occupants are sitting on a sofa at home or are preparing to sleep in a bedroom.
It should be understood that, instead of or in addition to registering the device 166, the smart-home environment 100 may be configured to infer which individuals live in the home and are therefore occupants, and which devices 166 may be associated with those individuals. In this way, the smart-home environment may "learn" who the occupants are, and may allow devices 166 associated with those individuals to control the network-connected smart devices of the smart-home environment 100. Various types of notifications and other information may be provided to occupants via messages sent to the occupants' devices 166 and other electronic devices. It should be appreciated that these messages may be sent via email, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), as well as any other type of messaging service and/or communication protocol now known or later developed, including any type of push notification service.
In some cases, the guest may wish to control the smart device. For example, a smart home environment may receive communications of an unregistered device of an individual within a home, where the individual is not identified as a resident of the home. Further, for example, the smart home environment may receive communications from a mobile device of an individual determined to be a guest or registered as a guest.
According to an embodiment, guest-level control may be provided to guests of the smart home environment 100. The guest-level control may allow guests to access basic controls (e.g., a fairly selected subset of features of the smart device), such as temperature adjustment or ingress and egress through a smart door, but it may lock other functions. The control at the guest level may be viewed as a "secure sandbox" (a "safe sandbox") in which guests have limited control but they do not have access to higher level controls that may fundamentally alter, destroy, damage or otherwise compromise the occupant's desired operation of the smart device. For example, guest-level controls do not allow guests to adjust heat pump lock temperatures.
An example of its use is when a guest is at a smart home, the guest may walk in front of the thermostat and manually turn the dial, but the guest may not want to walk around in the house to "look for" the thermostat, especially at night when the home is dark and others are sleeping. Furthermore, guests may not want to go through the cumbersome process of downloading the necessary applications to their devices for remotely controlling the thermostat. In fact, the guest may not be able to obtain login credentials of the home owner, etc., and thus may not be able to remotely control the thermostat via the application. Thus, guests may open a mobile browser on their mobile device, type a keyword, such as "NEST" in the URL field, and click "go" or "search" or the like. In response, the device presents the guest with a user interface, such as a Thermozilla UI, that may allow the guest to move the target temperature within a limited range (e.g., 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit). The user interface provides guest-level control limited to basic functionality. Guests cannot change target humidity, mode, or view energy history.
According to an embodiment, a local web-server accessible in a Local Area Network (LAN) is provided for enabling guests to access a user interface that may provide control at the guest level. It may not require a password because the physical presence inside the home can be established with sufficient reliability by the presence of the guest on the LAN. In some embodiments, during installation of a smart device (e.g., a smart thermostat), a home owner may be asked whether it wants to enable a Local Web Application (LWA) on the smart device. The business owner may not; the owner of the home may agree. When the LWA option is selected, the smart device may broadcast to the LAN that the above-referenced keyword (e.g., "NEST") is now the host alias for its local Web server. Thus, the same keyword (e.g., "NEST") may always be the URL that you use to access LWA regardless of the guest's home, as long as the smart device is purchased from the same manufacturer. Further, according to an embodiment, if there is more than one smart device on the LAN, a second and subsequent smart devices may not be provided to establish another LWA. Instead, they may register themselves as a service of the primary LWA and/or a candidate of choice. In this case, the LWA user may be asked which smart device they want to turn on to change temperature before obtaining a simplified user interface (e.g., Thermozilla UI) for the particular smart device they choose.
According to embodiments, guest-level control may also be provided to the user through mechanisms other than the device 166. For example, smart devices (e.g., smart doors) may be equipped with walk-through identification technology (e.g., facial recognition, RFID, ultrasonic sensors) that "fingerprints" or creates a "signature" for the occupants of a home. In operation, when a person who does not live at home or is not registered at the smart home or whose fingerprint or signature is not recognized by the smart home "walks up" to the smart device, the smart device may provide guest-level control to the guest, rather than full control.
Intelligent thermostats and intelligent doors and other intelligent devices can "learn" by observing the behavior of occupants. For example, the intelligent thermostat may learn preferred temperature set points for the occupant in the morning and evening, and it may learn when the occupant is asleep or awake, and when the occupant is typically away or at home. In some embodiments, when a guest controls a smart device, such as a smart thermostat, the smart device may not "learn" from the guest. This may prevent guest adjustments and controls from affecting learned preferences of occupants.
A smart tv remote control may be provided. The smart remote may identify the occupant by fingerprint, visual identification, RFID, etc., and it identifies the user as a guest or as a person (e.g., child) belonging to a particular category with limited control and access rights. Upon identifying the user as a guest or as belonging to a limited category of people, the smart remote control may allow the user to view only a subset of the channels and make limited adjustments to the settings of the television and other equipment. For example, a guest cannot adjust the settings of a Digital Video Recorder (DVR), and a child may be restricted to watching programs that are suitable for the child. According to some embodiments, similar control may be provided for other instruments, utilities and equipment in the premises. For example, sinks, bathtubs and showers may be controlled by smart faucets that identify the user as a guest or child, and thus may prevent the water from exceeding a specified temperature that is considered safe.
According to an embodiment, the network-connected smart devices of the smart-home environment 100 may be modular and may be incorporated into new and old premises. For example, a device may be designed around a modular platform that includes two basic components: a head unit and a back plate, which may also be referred to as a docking station. Various configurations of docking stations may be provided for compatibility with any home (e.g., old and new homes). However, all docking stations may comprise a standard head connection arrangement, such that any head unit may be removably attached to any docking station. Thus, in some embodiments, the docking station may be an interface (e.g., a door hinge or other interface between the door body 124 and the door frame 130) that serves as a physical connection to the structure and voltage lines of the home, and the interchangeable head unit (e.g., the door body 124) may contain all of the sensors, processors, user interface, batteries, and other functional components of the device.
There are many different business and functional possibilities for provisioning, maintenance and upgrading. For example, after many years of use of any particular head unit, a user may be able to purchase a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the old docking station. Many different versions of head units are possible, such as a low cost version with a small number of features, followed by increasingly more powerful versions, up to extremely fancy head units with a large number of features. Thus, it should be understood that the various versions of the head unit may be interchanged, any of which may operate when placed in any docking station. This may advantageously encourage sharing and redeployment of old head units — for example, when an important high performance head unit (e.g., hazard detector) is replaced with a new version of the head unit, the old head unit may be redeployed to a backroom or basement, or the like. According to an embodiment, when first plugged into the docking station, the head unit may ask the user (via 2D liquid crystal display, 2D/3D holographic projection, voice interaction, etc.) some simple questions, such as "Where am I (I am), the user may indicate" livingwom "," kitchen ", etc.
Some of these modular smart devices may have security enhancement features that may trigger a notification or alarm if the head is removed from the docking station. For example, as discussed, some smart devices may be able to detect motion and act as a "tripwire" in a security system. Other devices may provide live video feeds and act as security cameras. An alarm or alarm notification may be triggered if an intruder attempts to disable a network-connected smart device, thereby avoiding detection by removing the smart device's head unit from its docking station. For example, the smart device may send a message to the central server or cloud computing system 164 indicating the removal of the head unit. According to an embodiment, in response to receiving a message indicating a head unit removal, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may send a message to the device 166 of the home owner or other occupant indicating the removal and asking whether the removal is authorized. The central server or cloud computing system 164 may trigger an alarm if there is no response after a timeout or if the response indicates that removal is not authorized. In other embodiments, the alarm may be triggered immediately upon removal of the head unit, for example when the alarm is armed (i.e., in a secure mode). The alarm may be located on the head unit itself, so the alarm sound is broadcast from the head unit, or may be centralized and controlled by a central server or cloud computing system 164, and other network connected smart devices are instructed to broadcast the alarm sound. In other embodiments, upon removal, the head unit may require the person to identify themselves verbally, and if the sound is not identified, an alarm may be triggered.
The smart-home environment 100 may also include communications with devices outside the smart-home environment 100 but within the vicinity of the home (e.g., within the home of the home). For example, the smart-home environment 100 may include an outdoor lighting system 114 that transmits information about detected movement and/or presence of people, animals, and any other objects over a mesh network or directly to a central server or cloud computing system 164 and receives return commands for controlling lighting accordingly. The central server or cloud computing system 164 may control the outdoor lighting system 114 based on information received from other network-connected smart devices in the smart home environment. For example, if any network-connected smart device (e.g., smart wall plug 110 located outdoors) detects movement at night, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may "turn on" the outdoor lighting system 114 and other lights in the smart home environment 100. This may be advantageous because the motion detection capability may not be limited to motion sensors attached only to the lights themselves, but rather extend to all network-connected smart devices in the smart home environment 100.
The smart-home environment 100 may include a gated portal 116, which is a type of smart door, that may transmit information about detected movement and/or presence of people, animals, and any other objects, over a mesh network or directly to a central server or cloud computing system 164, and receive return instructions for controlling the gated portal, such as opening, closing, locking, and/or unlocking a gate. According to an embodiment, an algorithm may be provided to take into account the geographic location of the smart-home environment 100, such as based on a regional improvement plan ("ZIP") code or geographic coordinates of the home. The geographic information may then be used to obtain data that facilitates determining an optimal time to open/close or otherwise adjust lighting and open, close, lock, unlock a gate or other type of smart door or otherwise protect the smart home environment 100.
In some embodiments, the low power nodes and speaker nodes (e.g., devices 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 113, 120, and 170) may act as a "tripwire" for the alarm system in a smart home environment. For example, if a perpetrator bypasses the detection of alarm sensors located at windows, doors, and other entry points of the smart home environment 100, an alarm may be triggered upon receiving a message from one or more low power nodes and speaker nodes in the mesh network, such as occupancy, motion, heat, sound, and the like. For example, upon receiving a message from the smart light 170 indicating the presence of a person, the central server or cloud computing system 164 or some other device may trigger an alarm as long as the alarm is armed at the time of detection. Thus, the alarm system may be enhanced by various low power nodes and speaker nodes located throughout the smart-home environment 100. In this example, a user may enhance the security of the smart home environment 100 by purchasing and installing additional smart lights 170.
In some embodiments, a mesh network may be used to automatically turn lights on and off as a person moves from one room to another. For example, the low power nodes and speaker nodes (e.g., devices 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 113, 120, and 170) detect movement of a person in a smart home environment and transmit corresponding messages over the mesh network. Using a message indicating which rooms are occupied, the central server or cloud computing system 164 or some other device may activate and deactivate the smart wall switch 108 to automatically provide light as a person moves from one room to another in the smart home environment 100. Additionally, the user may provide pre-configuration information that indicates which smart wall plugs 110 provide power to the lights and other light sources (e.g., smart night lights 170). Alternatively, such mapping of light sources to wall plugs 110 may be done automatically (e.g., smart wall plugs 110 detect when a light source is inserted therein and send a corresponding message to a central server or cloud computing system 164). Using this mapping information in conjunction with a message indicating which rooms are occupied, the central server or cloud computing system 164 or some other device may activate and deactivate the smart wall plug 110 that provides power to lights and other light sources in order to record the movement of the person and provide light as the person moves from one room to another. Additionally or alternatively, such record keeping may be operable to notify the smart door user of the access to the door to operate the door in one or more ways (e.g., unsealing the door in anticipation of the user's potential use of access through the door frame).
In some embodiments, a mesh network of low power nodes and speaker nodes may be used to provide exit lighting in emergency situations such as earthquakes, fires, detection of home intrusion, dangerous carbon monoxide levels, etc. In some cases, to facilitate this, a user may provide preconfigured information indicating exit routes in the smart-home environment 100. For example, for each room in a house, a user may provide a map of an effective and/or efficient exit route. It should be appreciated that instead of the user providing this information, the central server or cloud computing system 164 or some other device may use an uploaded map of the smart home environment, a schematic, a construction drawing, and automatically determine a route using a map generated based on location information obtained from nodes of the mesh network (e.g., location information from the device is used to construct a house map). In operation, when an alarm is activated (e.g., when one or more of the smart hazard detectors 104 detect smoke and activate an alarm), the central server or cloud computing system 164 or some other device uses occupancy information obtained from the low power nodes and speaker nodes to determine which rooms are occupied and then turns on lights (e.g., night lights 170, wall switches 108, wall plugs 110 to power the lights, etc.) along an exit route from the occupied rooms in order to provide emergency exit lighting. It should also be understood that all or some of the network-connected intelligent devices, including the intelligent hazard detector 104 and the intelligent thermostat 102, include lights that are activated to assist the occupants in evacuating the home. In addition, in case of emergency such as earthquake or fire, an acoustic alarm may be issued at home to provide information about the event. Additionally, a message, such as a text message or a multimedia message, may be sent to the occupants' mobile devices. Further, the smart door may be configured to provide appropriate access to a user or appropriate element (e.g., smoke, etc.) based on occupancy information and/or alarm type (e.g., to operate the door in one or more ways (e.g., to unseal the door in anticipation of a potential use of the user to expel smoke through the door frame access or through any suitable ventilation feature of the door) for example).
The technologies that the local constant temperature service robot 168 (and/or the larger smart home system of fig. 1) may use to identify and locate occupants whose personal area space is to be maintained at a comfortable temperature may include, but are not limited to, RFID sensing (e.g., a person has an RFID bracelet, an RFID necklace, or an RFID key fob), synthetic vision technologies (e.g., a camera and a facial recognition processor), audio technologies (e.g., voice, sound patterns, vibration pattern recognition), ultrasonic sensing/imaging technologies, and infrared or Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies (e.g., a person carries an infrared or NFC-enabled smartphone), and rule-based inference engines or artificial intelligence technologies that draw useful conclusions from the sensed information (e.g., if there is only one occupant in the home, the occupant's immediate space should be maintained at a comfortable temperature, and it is expected that the selection of comfort temperature should correspond to that occupant's particular storage profile). The robot 168 or device 166 or otherwise may communicate with the smart door 120 or HVAC 103 or the like to adjust the amount of air or other material entering or exiting the occupant's space.
Fig. 2 illustrates a network-level view of an extensible device and services platform 200 with which multiple smart home environments (e.g., the smart home environment 100 of fig. 1) may be integrated. The extensible device and service platform 200 may include a remote server or cloud computing architecture 164. One, some, or each of the network-connected smart devices of fig. 1 may communicate with a remote server or cloud computing architecture 164. For example, a connection to the Internet 162 may be established directly (e.g., using a 3G/4G/5G connection to a wireless carrier), through the hub-based network 212 (e.g., using a scheme ranging from simple wireless routers up to and including intelligent, dedicated, whole-home control nodes), or through any combination thereof.
Although in some examples provided herein, the devices and services platform 200 may communicate with and collect data from network-connected smart devices of the smart-home environment 100 of fig. 1, it should be understood that the devices and services platform 200 may communicate with and collect data from a plurality of smart-home environments around the world. For example, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may collect home data 202 from one or more network connected devices of the smart home environment, where the network connected devices may routinely send home data or may send home data under certain circumstances (e.g., when the devices query the home data 202). Thus, the equipment and services platform 200 may routinely collect data from households around the world. As described above, the collected home data 202 may include, for example, security data such as a map of the home and corresponding network-connected smart devices and their capabilities in each room, alarm setting information, contact information for registered occupants of the home, and so forth. The collected home data 202 may also include, for example, power consumption data, occupancy data, HVAC settings and usage data, carbon monoxide level data, carbon dioxide level data, volatile organic compound level data, sleep schedule data, cooking schedule data, internal and external temperature humidity data, television audience data, internal and external noise level data, and the like.
The central server or cloud computing architecture 164 may further provide one or more services 204, such as security-related services described herein. The services 204 may include software updates, customer support, remote access, remote or distributed control, usage recommendations (e.g., based on the collected home data 202 to improve performance, reduce utility costs, etc.), and/or sensor data collection/logging, where sensor data and other data from network-connected smart devices of the smart home environment 100 may be collected and logged. For example, the data collected and recorded may include a map of homes, a map of the movement of the user from room to room in the home as determined by a network-connected smart device equipped with motion and/or identification technology, the time spent in each room, a map indicating which rooms are occupied at different times (e.g., including real-time) and the occupancy within the home by whom, fire detection events, false alarms, carbon monoxide data, temperature data, humidity data, and so forth. According to an embodiment, if the data collected from the network-connected smart devices of the smart home environment 100 indicates that an alarm threshold for a particular home is being approached, the service 204 may increase the frequency at which data is collected and recorded from the network-connected devices in that home. For example, if the data collected from the network-connected devices indicates activity in the kitchen of the smart-home environment 100 while the occupants are sleeping, the service 204 may collect data at ten second intervals instead of thirty second intervals from the network-connected smart devices of the home. According to embodiments, the collected and recorded data may be provided to investigators after a crime, fire, etc. has occurred, such that the data may be used to resolve a crime, determine the cause of the fire, etc.
The services 204 may also include, for example, remote access, remote or distributed control, security improvement recommendations (e.g., recommendations to provide enhanced home security based on the collected home data 202, etc.), software updates, customer support, and the like. Data associated with the service 204 may be stored and/or recorded at the central server or cloud computing system 164, and the central server or cloud computing system 164 may retrieve and send the data at an appropriate time (e.g., at regular intervals, upon receiving a request from a user, etc.).
As shown in FIG. 2, embodiments of the extensible device and service platform 200 may include a processing engine 206, and the processing engine 206 may be centralized on a single server or distributed across several different computing entities without limitation. The processing engines 206 may include engines that may be configured to receive data from network-connected smart devices of a smart-home environment (e.g., via the internet or a hub network), index the data, analyze the data, and/or generate statistical data based on or as part of the analysis. The analyzed data may be stored as derived home data 208.
The results of the analysis or statistics may thereafter be transmitted back to a network-connected smart device, other network-connected smart devices, the user device 166, a server providing web pages to the user's device 166, or other non-device entities that provide the home data used to derive the results. For example, patterns and statistics summarizing data received from network connected smart devices may be generated and transmitted by the processing engine 206. The results or statistics may be provided via the internet 162. In this manner, the processing engine 206 may be configured and programmed to derive a variety of useful information from the home data 202. A single server may include one or more engines.
The derived data can be very useful for a variety of useful purposes at a variety of different granularities, ranging from explicit programming control of network-connected smart devices on a home-by-home, community-by-community, or region-by-region basis (e.g., utility company's demand response programs, security-related statistics specific to a particular community of smart devices available to control a particular network connection, etc.), to generation of inference abstractions that can assist on a home-by-home basis (e.g., it can be inferred that a homeowner has left vacation, and thus a security detection device can be placed at a higher sensitivity), to generation of statistics and related inference abstractions that can be used for government or charity purposes. For example, the processing engine 206 may generate statistics regarding intelligent device usage across a network connection of a population of devices and send the statistics to device users, service providers, or other entities (e.g., entities that have requested statistics or may have provided monetary compensation for the statistics).
To encourage security-related innovations and research, and to increase the availability of security-related and other products and services to users, the device and service platform 200 may expose a series of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) 210 to third parties, such as law enforcement 222 (e.g., police or public and/or private security entities), government 224 (e.g., health and security agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), etc.), academic 226 (e.g., university researchers), enterprise 228 (e.g., a private security agency or charity or utility company or such a company that may provide equipment warranty or service to associated equipment, repair and/or select advertisers, etc., based on home data), emergency response provider 230 (e.g., fire and ambulance), and other third parties. The API 210 can be coupled to and allow third party systems to communicate with the central server or cloud computing system 164 (including the service 204, the processing engine 206, the home data 202, and the derived home data 208). For example, the API 210 may allow an application executed by a third party to initiate specific data processing tasks performed by the central server or cloud computing system 164 and receive dynamic updates to the home data 202 and the derived home data 208.
For example, a third party may develop programs and/or applications, such as Web or mobile applications, integrated with the central server or cloud computing system 164 to provide services and information to the user. Such programs and applications may be designed, for example, to help users reduce energy consumption, preemptively repair malfunctioning equipment, prepare for high service demands, record past service performance, etc., or to protect their homes by performing any of a variety of beneficial functions or tasks now known or later developed. Examples include providing the user with local crime news, information and statistics, security alerts and checklists, such as alerts for installing security lights, door and window locks, etc.
The third party application may make inferences from the home data 202 and/or the derived home data 208, where such inferences may include when the occupant is at home, when sleeping, when watching television in a study, when bathing, etc. Answers to these questions may help third parties benefit consumers by providing consumers with interesting security-related information, products and services, and providing them with advertisements for services and/or choices. In one example, a private security company may create an application that can infer when people are not at home. The application may use inference to schedule private security personnel to visit or drive through their home when people are likely not at home, may place the user's network-connected smart device in an alert mode, notify trusted neighbors that the user is not at home, and so on.
In one example, the enterprise 228 may be a carrier, which may create an application that makes inferences about when people are at home. The application may use these inferences to schedule deliveries at times when people are most likely to be at home. The application may also build delivery routes around the scheduled times. This may reduce the number of times the carrier has to attempt to deliver the package, and may reduce the number of times the consumer has to retrieve the package from the carrier.
The device and services platform 200 may expose the API 210 to third parties, such as the enterprise 228, in exchange for revenue, e.g., monthly fees, similar to subscription services. In one example, the enterprise 228 may be a retail store that sells consumer goods and building and construction supplies and materials, including the network-connected intelligent devices described above with reference to fig. 1. In one example, retail store 228 may agree to discount the sale of network-connected smart devices in exchange for free or discounted access to API 210. Retail stores 228 can use information from API 210 to better serve and/or select their customers and increase sales, while providers of devices and services platform 200 can benefit from the growth of discounted network-connected smart devices.
FIG. 3 illustrates an abstract functional view of the extensible device and service platform 200 of FIG. 2, with particular reference to the processing engine 206 and devices, such as the network-connected smart devices of the smart-home environment 100 of FIG. 1. Even though network-connected smart devices located in a smart-home environment may have an infinite variety of different individual capabilities and limitations, they may all be considered to share common features, as each of them may be a data consumer 302(DC), a data source 304(DS), a service consumer 306(SC), and a service source 308 (SS). Advantageously, in addition to providing the basic control information needed by devices to achieve their local and immediate goals, the extensible device and services platform 200 may also be configured to take advantage of the large amounts of data that may be streamed from these devices. In addition to enhancing or improving or optimizing the actual operation of the appliance itself in terms of its immediate functionality, the extensible appliance and services platform 200 can be instructed to "reuse" this data in various automated, extensible, flexible and/or scalable ways to achieve various useful home security/smart home goals. These goals may be predefined or adaptively identified based on any suitable characteristics, such as usage patterns, device efficiency, and/or user input (e.g., request-specific functionality, manual entry of specific data, etc.).
For example, fig. 3 shows a processing engine 206 that includes multiple instantiations 310. The processing engine 206 may include a management service paradigm 310a that may record and manage primary or secondary device functions. Device functions may include ensuring proper operation of the network-connected smart device given user input, detecting (e.g., and responding to) an intruder that has entered or attempted to enter the home (e.g., security), implementing or otherwise responding to an energy demand response event, detecting a failure of a device coupled to the network-connected smart device (e.g., a light bulb has burned out, a passive IR sensor has broken out, etc.), or alerting the user of a current event or a predicted future event.
The processing engine 206 may also include an advertising/communication paradigm 310b that can estimate features (e.g., demographic information, time spent on a particular activity such as cooking or watching television, etc.), desires, and/or products of interest to a user based on device usage and/or data received from network-connected smart devices. The service, promotion, product, or upgrade may then be offered or automatically offered to the user. The processing engine 206 may also include a social paradigm 310c that may use information from a social network to provide information to the social network (e.g., based on device usage), and/or process data associated with user and/or device interactions with the social network platform. For example, the user status reported to their trusted contacts on the social network may be updated to indicate when they are at home or not based on light detection, security system deactivation, or device usage detectors. As another example, a user may be able to share device usage statistics with other users. As yet another example, users may share HVAC settings that result in low electricity bills, and other users may download the HVAC settings to their smart thermostat 102 to reduce their electricity bills.
The processing engine 206 may integrate or otherwise utilize external information 316 from external sources (e.g., via the internet, such as weather forecasts, prices for certain goods/services, neighborhood/home information, etc.) to improve the functionality of one or more processing paradigms. The external information 316 may be used to interpret data received from network-connected smart devices, determine characteristics of an environment in the vicinity of the device (e.g., outside of a structure in which the device is enclosed), determine services or products available to a user, identify social networks or social network information, determine contact information for entities in the vicinity of the device (e.g., public service entities such as emergency response teams, police or hospitals), and so forth, identify statistical or environmental conditions, trends or other information associated with a home or neighborhood, and so forth.
The extensible device and service platform 200 may bring a wide variety of benefits ranging from just-in-the-home (oridinary) to deep-in-the-future (funded), and fits within its scope. Thus, in one "common" example, each bedroom of the smart home environment 100 may be provided with a smart wall switch 108, a smart wall plug 110, one or more doors 120, and/or a smart hazard detector 104, all or some of which include occupancy sensors, where the occupancy sensors are also capable of inferring (e.g., via motion detection, facial recognition, audible sound patterns (e.g., voice detection), etc.) whether the occupant is asleep or awake. If a home intruder is detected, the remote security service or police department may be notified of how many occupants are in each bedroom, whether those occupants are still sleeping (or immobile), and the real-time location of the intruder in the home. In addition, video from the home may be broadcast to the nearest security personnel and police's video-capable devices so that the police may record and/or measure and/or analyze activities at home en route to home. As another example, the same data that may be used for home security may also be "reused" by the processing engine 206 in the context of a social paradigm of community security. Thus, for example, the same data discussed in the above examples may be collected and made available for processing (e.g., when properly reviewed for privacy purposes), where crime patterns and home security in a particular zip code may be recorded and/or measured and/or analyzed. If a serious fire event is sensed, the remote security service or fire department may be informed of how many occupants are in each bedroom, and whether the occupants are still sleeping (or immobile), or whether they have been adequately evacuated from the bedroom, and these devices may operate automatically in a particular manner to help address the emergency and/or to allow the remote security department to manually adjust such functions (e.g., adjust the ventilation function of one or more smart doors). Of course, while this is a very advantageous capability provided by the described extensible devices and service platforms, there may be substantially more "profound" examples that truly illustrate the potential for a higher "intelligence quotient" that may be exploited. As a perhaps more "profound" example, the same bedroom occupancy data that could be used for fire safety could also be "reused" by the processing engine 206 in the context of a social paradigm of neighborhood child development and education. Thus, for example, the same bedroom occupancy and movement data discussed in the "normal" example may be collected and made available for processing (e.g., when properly reviewed for privacy purposes), where the sleep patterns of certain types of people in a particular zip code may be determined and recorded. Local changes in sleep patterns of certain types of people may be determined and associated with different nutrition plans, for example, of local schools.
The device and service platform 200 may provide a home security service 205 into which users may register their smart home environment 100. The security service 205 may be provided on a monthly basis without commitment. It should also be understood that the security service 205 may be provided year-by-year or lifetime. For example, the security service 205 may provide multiple layers of services, including providing basic services, enhanced services, and advanced services. For example, basic services may include basic intrusion detection and emergency personnel notification. For example, the basic security service 205 may record and/or measure and/or analyze input data from a network-connected smart device of the home to determine when a possible intrusion has occurred, as indicated by motion detection outside the home, information from a smart entry detector indicating that any of the home's doors 120 or windows 182 have been opened, and so forth. Upon detection, the basic security service 205 may contact the occupants of the home and/or local law enforcement. For example, the enhanced security service 205 may record and/or measure and/or analyze hazardous conditions in the home, including smoke, carbon monoxide, in addition to home intrusion. Advanced services 205 may include, for example, enabling a home to take advantage of the many benefits of a "neighbor security network," detecting when individuals in the home are in distress, mimicking a user pattern of turning lights and appliances on when the user is vacating, providing users with a security score and corresponding skills for improving the security of their home, providing users with a live video stream of the activities in the home when the user is not present and local law enforcement agencies, and so forth.
In some embodiments, pricing for security services or any suitable type of home insurance may vary depending on the security score of the home. The security score may be based on information such as a percentage of smart devices with WiFi (e.g., rather than a low power communication protocol), a percentage of smart devices wired (e.g., rather than battery powered), a number of strangers visiting a home, etc. with a sufficient number and sufficient coverage of network connections (e.g., hazard detectors, entry detectors, etc.). The higher the security score of the home, the more secure the home, and the cheaper the security services and/or insurance can be. According to an embodiment, the device and service platform 200 may provide suggestions on how to increase the security score, and in order to incentivize users to increase their home score, the platform 200 may also indicate what discount the user may get if the user's home reaches a particular score.
Upon receiving a registration request from a user, the device and service platform 200 may determine the capabilities of the network-connected smart device in the user's home and may determine whether the requested service is appropriate for the user. For example, if a user requests advanced services, such as the ability to broadcast a live video stream to law enforcement agencies, but the user has only a few video-enabled smart devices and/or limited WiFi networks, the device and service platform 200 may suggest to the user to upgrade smart devices in the home or select more basic services.
In one security-related example, some or all network-connected smart devices may act as a "tripwire" in a security system. In this example, if one of the network-connected smart devices detects motion, heat, sound, etc., it sends a corresponding message over the mesh network (e.g., from one network-connected smart device to another network-connected smart device) and in some cases over the internet to the central server or cloud computing system 164, which central server or cloud computing system 164 may trigger an alarm if the security system is armed (e.g., the occupant is not present or asleep). In this example, a user may enhance the security of the smart-home environment 100 by purchasing and installing additional network-connected smart devices, such as the smart door 120.
In another security-related example, some or all network-connected smart devices may be equipped with identification technologies (e.g., facial recognition, RFID, ultrasound sensors) that can "fingerprint" or create "signatures" for people, animals, and objects. Based on information received from the network-connected smart devices, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may store a list of registered occupants and/or guests of the home. When a person whose fingerprint or signature is not recognized by the central server or cloud computing system 164 as registering an occupant or guest enters "within range" of or otherwise interacts with one of the network-connected smart devices of the home (e.g., smart door 120), the central server or cloud computing system 164 may record the presence of the person and activate an alarm indicating the presence of an intruder if the security system has been armed. Further, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may reference maps and schedules of the smart home environment to determine whether detected people, animals, or objects are allowed in a particular area (e.g., a room of a house) at a particular time and trigger an alarm accordingly.
In yet another safety-related example, occupant location data (e.g., GPS data, IPS data, etc.) may be used to achieve home safety goals. According to an embodiment, occupants of a home (e.g., individuals who live in the home or frequently visit the home) may register their respective devices 166 as being associated with the home, and the central server or cloud computing system 164 may record the movement of the occupants inside and outside the home based on the occupant location data received from the devices 166. The central server or cloud computing system 164 may use the record keeping information to infer current and future occupancy of the home and/or room and control network connected smart devices within the home in a corresponding manner. For example, the outdoor lights 114 may be turned on when it is determined that the occupant is returning home, or the smart door handle 122 or any other portion of the one or more doors 120 may be locked when the occupant is leaving home, and the security system may be armed. Further, for example, the threshold for notifying authorities of emergency situations may be adjusted depending on whether the occupant with the registered device 166 is at home. For example, if a registered occupant is at home when an alarm condition (e.g., fire, distress, intrusion into the home, etc.) is detected, a message may be sent to the occupant's device 166 requesting confirmation that everything is ok. The authorities may be notified only if the registered occupants respond to confirm an emergency or if the registered occupants do not respond within a timeout period. On the other hand, if an alarm condition is detected and there are no registered occupants in the home, the authorities may be immediately notified and a concurrent message sent to the registered occupants' mobile devices 166.
It should also be understood that passive RFID tags (e.g., instead of device 166 or in addition to device 166) may be used to determine the room location of a user (e.g., occupants, pets, etc.). For example, an RFID may be associated with each occupant of the premises, such as by including the tag in a purse, bracelet, wristband, mobile device, collar, or the like. Network connected smart devices in the various rooms may detect the RFID tags and send this information to a central server or cloud computing system 164.
According to some embodiments, users may use their registered devices 166 to access the smart-home environment 100. For example, the smart door handle 122 or any other portion of the smart door 120 or its associated devices and the device 166 may be capable of communicating via Near Field Communication (NFC), bluetooth, or some other short-range wireless protocol. To enter the home (e.g., unlock the smart door handle 122 or door 120), the user's device 166 may send an access code to the smart door handle 122 or door 120, and the smart door handle 122 or door 120 may then verify with the server 164 that the person is a registered occupant.
Turning to another security-related example, a mesh network may be used to record a person's movements when transferring the person from one room to another. As such, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may be operable to determine which rooms in the smart home environment are occupied and who (e.g., using identification technology) is always occupied. For example, low power nodes and speaker nodes (e.g., network-connected smart devices 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 120, 122, and 170) may detect movement of a person in the smart-home environment 100 and communicate corresponding messages over a mesh network. Using the message indicating which rooms are occupied, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may record this information for later use and/or instruct various smart devices in the home to perform certain operations as people enter and exit the rooms, such as turning lights on and off, closing and/or locking one or more particular smart doors 120, sounding alarms, notifying public safety agencies and the owner of the house, and so forth.
According to an embodiment, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may view recorded information about the occupants' movements in the home to detect signature patterns of movements specific to individual occupants. These signature patterns may help the central server or cloud computing system 164 detect strangers at home. For example, if an individual is moving quickly from one room to another when occupants are not normally at home and in a pattern not associated with any occupants, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may infer that the individual is a thief moving from one room to another looking for valuables, and may automatically close and lock certain doors 120 that were previously opened, for example, to better protect any occupants at home.
According to an embodiment, the smart-home environment may include small-cell base stations, such as picocells or microcells. Such cellular base stations may provide higher data rates for LTE, 3G, 4G, 5G, etc. in the home, and may replace or supplement WiFi in some cases. The base station may provide cellular backup to call emergency personnel such as fire/police in an emergency.
According to one embodiment, at times of distress, the network-connected smart device may broadcast a live video stream to registered users and/or nearby emergency personnel (e.g., police and fire departments). For example, upon detecting an intruder or some other emergency occurring in a home, or upon someone pressing an emergency button in the home, live video may be broadcast to nearby emergency personnel (e.g., police, fire, medical, and other first responders). For example, video may be transmitted from the most active room or where a button is pressed. In some cases, the video may be transmitted directly to the police car (e.g., the nearest police car) responding to the call. It should be understood that video may be provided through a secure stream using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) rather than broadcast. It should also be understood that the security score of a home may be adjusted based on whether the home has the necessary SSL certificates to support secure video streaming to emergency personnel.
According to an embodiment, some or all of the network connection devices are equipped with pressure sensors, such as digital air pressure sensors, digital atmospheric pressure sensors, and the like. These pressure sensors may be, for example, of the resonant type that measures changes in air density, the thermal type that measures changes in air thermal conductivity, the ionization type that measures changes in ion flow in air, and/or the force collector type (e.g., bellows, diaphragm, piston, etc.) that measures deflection. One exemplary safety-related application of these pressure sensors may be to detect the opening and closing of doors 120 and occupant movement in a house by sensing pressure change patterns associated with these activities. For example, when the door 120 is opened or closed, a pressure sensor of a network-connected smart device may record an associated pressure change. The central server and cloud computing system 164, when viewing the recorded pressure changes, may determine the activity associated with the pressure changes. For example, a pressure change in a first range may indicate that an adult occupant is walking through a doorway when transitioning from one room to another, while a pressure in a second range may indicate that a particular door (internal or external) is opened or closed. The smart door 120 may have any other suitable sensors or techniques to detect whether and how much the door is open or closed or any other suitable information associated therewith.
According to embodiments, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may process artificial intelligence algorithms that can make rule-based or learning-based inferences based on sensed user control patterns of network-connected smart devices, optionally in conjunction with sensed household conditions or other sensed user behavior. For example, for one embodiment, one or more of the smart wall switches 108 may be configured to process information collected by the home occupancy sensing devices in conjunction with information from the user's light switch control behavior to produce results in which the smart wall switches 108 may be automatically self-programmed according to a preferred schedule to assist the user in turning lights off and on, and to mimic the user's pattern when the user is not present. Such automatic self-programming may also be applied to the smart wall plug 110, where the smart wall plug 110 may learn when to turn on and off the lights 118 and appliances such as television and stereo. Further, it should be understood that all network-connected smart devices may be automatically self-programming.
In one example, the artificial intelligence algorithm may be configured to sense whether there has been a threshold number of days in the past month (or other evaluation period) for which the user has locked the same or substantially the same set of doors 120 at substantially the same time of day ("X o' clock") to protect the same or substantially the same room in the home. If such a pattern is detected, a message may be sent to the user on the user's device 166, allowing them to agree or select a setting in which one or more associated doors 120 may be automatically locked to protect the associated room at about X o' clock. It should be understood that the smart-home environment may learn and mimic other patterns. For example, it can learn when a dog barks, such as when a person is within 100 feet of home, or when the occupant goes home at about X o' clock, and then record and play back the barking sounds at the appropriate time. It should also learn when to open and close the garage door to provide the appearance that the occupant is returning home and leaving home, etc.
The set of smart-home sensors may be configured to automatically learn selected user behaviors, assist the user in completing a particular task when the selected qualifying behaviors are observed, and automatically cease providing such assistance when the user takes one or more direct undo actions. Additionally or alternatively, if such a pattern has been detected, the central server and cloud computing system 164 may infer that the user intends to leave home soon. In response to this inference, the sensitivity of the network-connected smart device may be increased in anticipation of the user being away from home. For example, the threshold for triggering an alarm indicating intrusion into the home may be lowered and/or the threshold for detecting a user approaching the door 120 to leave the home may be lowered.
"mapping" the smart-home environment 100 may provide a number of advantages. For example, as notified by the map of the smart home environment 100, the central server and cloud computing system 164 may determine the location of the occupants or intruders in distress in the home and notify emergency personnel of the situation associated therewith. This enables emergency personnel to quickly find a person in distress or an intruder upon entering the home. In other examples, the central server and cloud computing system 164 may determine an emergency exit route for each room of the home. If an alarm is activated (e.g., when one or more of the smart hazard detectors 104 detect smoke and activate the alarm), the central server or cloud computing system 164 may use occupancy information obtained from network-connected smart devices in the home to determine which rooms are occupied, and then turn on lights (e.g., lights 170, wall switches 108, wall plugs 110 to power the lights, etc.) and/or automatically open the doors 120 along an exit route from the occupied rooms to provide emergency exit lighting and exit capabilities. These are just a few example advantages of drawing a home, and it should be understood that there are an infinite number of advantages.
According to an embodiment, drawing a home may be done automatically. For example, a map may be generated based on location information obtained from nodes of the mesh network (e.g., location information from network-connected smart devices is used to construct a map of a house). According to this example, individual network smart devices obtain or determine their location at installation time or at some other time and send the location information to a central server or mapping application on the cloud computing system 164 or the user's device 166. For example, when installed, a network-connected smart device may ask the user (via 2D liquid crystal display, 2D/3D holographic projection, voice interaction, etc.) several simple questions, such as "Where am I (I am), the user may select" bedroom "or" living room ", etc. In other examples, the smart device may provide instructions to the user, such as "Press button once if I am in the kitchen, Press wi if I am in the den (if I are in the kitchen, Press the button once, if I are in the study, Press the button twice)," and so on. Additionally, for example, smart devices may be able to determine their GPS coordinates and/or send WiFi location or cell tower location information. This information may be used by a central server or mapping application on cloud computing system 164 or device 166 to automatically construct a map of the home. In some examples, the robot 168 may be free "roam" in the house and send mapping information to an application on the device 166 or to the central server or cloud computing system 164, which the application on the device 166 or the central server or cloud computing system 164 may use to construct a map of the home. For example, the robot 168 may be placed in a "mapping" mode in which it obtains location data as it moves along the walls of each room in the house and then sends the location data to an application or central server on the device 166 or the cloud computing system 164, which application or central server on the device 166 or the cloud computing system 164 may use the mapping information to construct a map of the home.
According to other embodiments, an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) may be used to map the smart-home environment 100. For example, a user may launch a map application on device 166 that uses an IPS to create a map of a home. In this case, the user may walk along the wall of the home, and the mobile device will use the IPS and/or other indoor positioning techniques to collect location information and use that information to build a map of the home, or send the collected information to a central server or cloud computing system 164, which central server or cloud computing system 164 may create the map. It should be understood that applications on device 166 may use the device's gyroscope, magnetometer, accelerometer, and altimeter to obtain location information instead of or in addition to using IPS and/or other indoor positioning techniques.
According to other embodiments, RFID tags may be used to map the smart-home environment 100. For example, the RFID tag may be placed throughout a residence. When placing the label, the user may scan the label using the device 166, and the device 166 may launch an application indicating to the user to enter the position information. Further, for example, instead of indicating to the user to enter location information, the device may determine its own location (e.g., using any suitable technique such as GPS in scanning) and associate the location information with the tag.
According to an embodiment, the central server or cloud computing system 164 may obtain and store identification information, such as facial recognition data, for occupants of the smart-home environment 100. In this case, when an "identified" individual that is an occupant of one of the smart home environments 100 is approaching an exterior door (e.g., front door) of another smart home environment, the smart doorbell 106 and/or the smart door 120 of the other smart home environment may be able to identify the approaching individual and announce his presence via the processing capabilities of the central server or the cloud computing system 164. For example, the name and/or status of the person in proximity may be announced, a video of his proximity may be displayed, and/or an image of him (e.g., a photograph taken from his social networking account) may be displayed within the smart-home environment 100. The security notification may involve a home intrusion in one of the nearby homes, where the central server and cloud computing system 164 may increase the sensitivity of the smart entry detector 112, turn on the lighting system 114, and close and/or lock the doors 120 of the other premises in the vicinity.
Turning now to fig. 4A-4D, illustrations of example embodiments of the smart door 120 are provided. According to an embodiment, an important underlying functionality of the smart door 120 is to act as a home entryway interface unit, such as by providing various functions including, but not limited to, a doorbell function or other visitor arrival function, an audio/video visitor announcement function, an entry enabling/limiting function of any suitable entity (e.g., user entity, fluid entity, etc.) through a door frame channel, and the like. Like the intelligent thermostat 102, the intelligent hazard detector 104, the intelligent doorbell 106, the intelligent wall switch 108, the intelligent wall plug 110, etc., the intelligent door 120 may be further enhanced by network connectivity and/or a wide variety of multi-sensing capabilities to accommodate additional functionality, and there may be significant overlap/integration between the various intelligent devices that may utilize their combined processing, sensing, and communication capabilities and their access to cloud-based control and intelligence.
As described above, one, some, or each smart door 120 may include a door body 124, the door body 124 may be coupled to the door frame 130 or otherwise positioned relative to the door frame 130, the door frame 130 defining a door frame passage 135, the door frame passage 135 may be at least partially blocked by the door body 124 at a time to selectively prevent or allow how, when, and what types of elements (e.g., user entities, water, air, etc.) may pass through and/or around the door body 124, and thus through its associated door frame passage 135, between any two suitable spaces that may be on opposite sides of the door 120's door frame passage 135. Due to installation in the location of a conventional door (e.g., through the wall 154 or floor 156 or ceiling 158, etc.), the smart door 120 may obtain sufficient electrical operating power, such as by connecting to wiring (e.g., to 120V "hot" line voltage lines) that may be within the wall 154 or floor 156 or ceiling 158, etc. of the smart home environment 100 and that may be present at or near almost all standard home entryways. This substantially unlimited power budget, excellent mounting locations that are nearly ubiquitous throughout the smart environment, and reasonably sufficient physical space on and/or within its door body and/or its frame to fit the necessary components, combine to enable the smart door 120 to accommodate the rich and wide variety of sensing, interfacing, and communication capabilities of the smart home environment 100, as well as a common platform for providing even newer sensing, interfacing, and communication hardware as it becomes available for decades in the future. While the smart door 120 may be connected to stable and reliable power from the smart-home environment 100, it should be understood that the smart door 120 may include a battery to replace or supplement the power obtained from the home wiring. In some embodiments, the battery may be a rechargeable battery, such as a rechargeable lithium ion battery, for drawing power from the house wiring as needed. For example, the smart door 120 may charge the battery during time intervals when the power usage of the door is less than the amount that the lines of the smart home environment can safely provide, and during time intervals when the hardware power usage is greater than the amount that the lines of the smart home environment can safely provide, the battery will discharge to provide the additional power needed. Thus, the rechargeable battery can be used as a conventional backup power source or storage to supply excess DC power in a short time when needed.
Further, it should be understood that any of the intelligent devices described herein, such as intelligent hazard detectors, intelligent thermostats, intelligent wall switches, intelligent doors, etc., may have a mechanism for generating electricity and/or optionally storing the generated electricity in a local battery. For example, in some embodiments, the smart device may include a peltier junction for generating electricity. In these embodiments, for example, the peltier junction may generate power from a thermal differential created between the smart device and its mounting location, such as when the smart device heats up from use. In other embodiments, the smart device may be equipped with a generator, such as a piezoelectric device, that may generate power when the device is used physically, such as when a user opens a loop on the smart thermostat or when a user manually opens or closes the smart door (e.g., when a hinged mechanical coupling (e.g., coupling 403) is used to guide the path of the door body relative to the door frame). While piezoelectric devices may be used in this example, it should be understood that any suitable generator device now known or later developed may be used.
A variety of new interactions between the smart door 120 and other devices of the smart-home environment 100 may become possible. For example, occupancy sensing may be significantly enhanced due to the superior location of most doors (e.g., at room entrances), predictive occupancy algorithms, etc., which allows occupants or other entities or elements to be easily recorded as they may be transferred between rooms or spaces of the smart-home environment 100.
Fig. 4A-6B illustrate example user interfaces and hardware features of the door 120. At the core of the door 120 may be a power supply circuit, including a rechargeable battery, for drawing power from any suitable remote power source as needed, for example, from a 120V "hot" line voltage line of the smart environment 100 (e.g., disposed within the wall 154), according to an embodiment. The rechargeable battery may be used as a conventional backup power source or storage to supply excess power (e.g., DC power) for a short period of time when needed.
As shown in fig. 4A, according to some embodiments, the smart door 120 may be divided into two parts: a head unit 404 or door body 124 and a back plate 408 or door frame 130. This division into two can increase the success and commercial life of the smart door 120 by making the smart door 120 a modular platform that includes two basic components. The back panel 408 or door frame 130 may be a permanent interface box (e.g., sometimes referred to herein as a "docking station 408") that may serve as a physical connection into the smart environment 100 (e.g., 120V line voltage or other lines into a conventional door frame and/or through the wall 154 and/or into the smart home environment 100) and may include ac to dc or any other suitable power supply circuitry 410. When installed, the docking station 408 may be similar to a conventional one or two sets of wallboxes, except that no hazardous high voltage lines may be exposed to the user. According to some embodiments, docking station 408 may also include a cellular wireless interface 411 for communicating with any other suitable component (e.g., head unit 404 and/or any other intelligent device or server of intelligent system 199).
The power supply circuit 410 may be electrically coupled to any suitable remote power source (e.g., 120V or any other suitable magnitude line of the environment 100 (e.g., from within the wall 154 (e.g., via the door bus 120B), which door bus 120B may extend from the switch 108 or any other power access point within the wall 154 adjacent the door 120 (e.g., as shown in fig. 4C)))). Further, such power circuitry 410 may be electrically coupled to any suitable power circuitry (e.g., power converter 440) of head unit 404, either directly or via any suitable coupling mechanism of door 120 (e.g., electrical coupling component 405), which electrical coupling component 405 may be by any suitable mechanism (e.g., a wire, a wireless medium, any suitable mechanical coupling (e.g., one or more mechanical couplings 403 of door 120 (e.g., a hinge (e.g., a respective hinge mechanism of door body 124 and door frame 130 that may move relative to one another), and/or one or more mechanical couplings of door handle 122 (e.g., between latch 486 and plate 490 (e.g., charged via magnetic induction when latch 486 is held by plate 490 or proximate plate 490)), etc.))). Accordingly, power may flow from a power source remote from the door 120 (e.g., from the wall 154) through any suitable portion of the door frame 130 (e.g., the strike plate 490 and/or the hinge mechanical coupling 403 of the door handle 122) and then to any suitable portion of the door body 120 (e.g., to the power converter 440 or the battery 432 via the latch 486 and/or via the hinge mechanical coupling 403 when held by the strike plate 490). Alternatively, power may flow directly from a power source remote from the door 120 (e.g., from the wall 154) to the door body 124, not via the door frame 130, but via a retractable power cord 440i (e.g., see fig. 4C), which power cord 440i may be provided by the door body 124 and may extend from the door body 124 to any standard power outlet provided by the environment 100 (e.g., at a portion of the wall 154) for providing power directly to the door body 124 (e.g., to the converter 440 and/or the battery 432). In such embodiments, a portion of such a power cord may be configured to provide or pass through at least a portion of the door hinge mechanism (e.g., through a spillover opening of the door hinge mechanism).
One or more mechanical couplers 403 may be provided to mechanically couple the head unit 404 or the door body 124 to the back plate 408 or the door frame 130 and/or to at least partially define one or more possible paths along which the door body 124 may move relative to the door frame 130 to expose or block the door frame channel 135. For example, as shown in fig. 4A-6B, the door 120 may be provided with at least one hinge mechanical coupler, such as an upper hinge mechanical coupler 403u and a lower hinge mechanical coupler 403l, which may be configured to allow the door body 124 to be unscrewed from the door-frame channel 135 and screwed into the door-frame channel 135 about an axis R, which may extend along a side edge of the door frame 130, and each of which may be positioned along the axis R. In other embodiments, the axis of rotation of the door body 124 relative to the door frame 130 may be any other suitable axis, such as an axis extending along a top edge of the door frame 130. Alternatively, in some other embodiments, the mechanical coupler 403 may not be provided as a hinge, but may be provided as a track along which the door body 124 may move in and out of the wall 154, and thus the door frame 130 (e.g., a concealed door that may slide laterally into a wall portion beside the door frame 130 and/or a door that may slide upward into a wall portion above the door frame 130, etc.). Such movement of the door body 124 relative to the door frame 130 may be manually controlled by a user, who may physically push or pull the door body 124 or otherwise interact with the door body 124 to move the door body 124 relative to the door frame 130 along a path defined at least in part by the one or more mechanical couplings 403. Additionally or alternatively, the door 120 may include one or more actuators 407, which actuators 407 may be operable to physically move the door body 124 relative to the door frame 130 along a path defined at least in part by one or more mechanical couplings to expose or block the door frame channel 135, wherein such actuators 407 may be powered by any power provided to the door 120 by a remote source (e.g., power lines of the environment 120) and/or a battery of the door 120 (e.g., battery 432), and may be controlled by any suitable control signal (e.g., may be determined by a processor of the door 120 (e.g., processor 414) and/or a central server or cloud computing system 164). The actuator 407 may be disposed within the door body 124 and operable to interact with one or more mechanical couplers 403, or within the door frame 130 and operable to interact with one or more mechanical couplers 403, or at least partially within each of the door body 124 and the door frame 130, or at least partially external to the door 120 (e.g., within and/or adjacent to a wall 154 through which the door frame channel 135 may extend). The one or more actuators 407 may be used to provide a locking mechanism by selectively preventing the one or more mechanical couplers 403 from enabling the door body 124 to move relative to the door frame 130.
The door 120 may include one or more sealing mechanisms 409 of any suitable type, which sealing mechanisms 409 may provide for selectively sealing any, some, or each body-frame gap that may exist between the door body 124 and the door frame 130 (e.g., as part of the door-frame passage 135) when the door 120 attempts to block the door-frame passage 135 with the door body 124. Each sealing mechanism may be provided by any suitable structure of any suitable material that may be selectively activated (e.g., by any suitable actuator 407 (e.g., which may be controlled by processor 414 and/or server 164)) in any suitable manner to block one or more body-frame gaps of any suitable size and shape between door body 124 and door frame 130, and that may be selectively deactivated in any suitable manner to unblock the one or more body-frame gaps (e.g., when door body 124 is to be removed from door-frame channel 110). The sealing mechanism 409 may be disposed within or along one or more edges of the door body 124 and be operable to interact with one or more edges or other suitable portions of the door frame 130, or within or along one or more edges of the door frame 130 and be operable to interact with one or more edges or other suitable portions of the door body 124, or at least partially within or along each of the door body 124 and the door frame 130, or at least partially external to the door 120 (e.g., within and/or adjacent to the wall 154 through which the door frame 130 may be disposed). For example, as shown in fig. 4A-6B, the door 120 may be provided with at least one sealing mechanism, such as a first sealing mechanism 409u and/or a second sealing mechanism 409l, the first sealing mechanism 409u may be operable to selectively seal one or more body-frame gaps (e.g., upper body-frame gap 135gu (e.g., as shown in fig. 5B)) that may exist between the door frame 130 and any suitable portion of the door body 124 along an upper edge or top surface of the door body 124 and/or at one or more top corners of the door body 124 and/or at one or more upper portions of one or more side surfaces of the door body 124, the second sealing mechanism 409l may be operable to selectively seal along a lower edge or bottom surface of the door body 124 and/or at one or more bottom corners of the door body 124 and/or at one or more lower portions of one or more side surfaces of the door body 124 A seal may exist between the door frame 130 and any suitable portion of the door body 124 in one or more body-frame gaps (e.g., lower body-frame gap 135gl (e.g., as shown in fig. 5B)). Additionally or alternatively, although not shown, the door 120 may be provided with one or more sealing mechanisms that may be operable to selectively seal one or more body-frame gaps that may exist between the door frame 130 and any suitable portion of the door body 124 along a portion or all of one or both side surfaces of the door body 124, and/or any suitable sealing mechanism that may be operable to selectively seal any body-frame gap that may exist between the door frame 130 and any or all of the periphery of the door body 124.
The door 120 may include one or more sub-doors 452 of any suitable size, shape, and placement, and the sub-doors 452 may be door channels operable to selectively open to expose through the door 120 (e.g., to enable a package or pet to pass through the door). Each sub-door 452 may be provided by any suitable structure of any suitable material that may be selectively activated in any suitable manner (e.g., by any suitable actuator 407 (e.g., which may be controlled by processor 414 and/or server 164)) for rebounding or folding or lifting or lowering or sliding or otherwise moving at least a portion of the sub-door to expose a door passage (e.g., an electromechanical accordion door) through door 120. Additionally or alternatively, the door 120 may include one or more door HVAC systems 456 that may provide heating or cooling or other thermal control to the door 120 and/or the environment 100. One or more sub-doors 452 and/or one or more vents 457 of any suitable size, shape, and placement may be disposed through the door, and may be operable to selectively open to expose a door passage through the door 120 (e.g., to enable passage of any suitable element (e.g., air or water or smoke, etc.) through the door (e.g., under control of the door HVAC system 456 (e.g., one or more filters and/or one or more fans, etc. of the door HVAC system 456 may direct the elements through the vents or sub-doors in one or more particular directions or speeds, etc.)). each sub-door 452 and/or each vent 457 may be provided by any suitable structure of any suitable material that may be selectively activated in any suitable manner (e.g., by any suitable actuator 407 (e.g., controllable by processor 414 and/or server 164)), for rebounding or folding or lifting or lowering or sliding or rotating or otherwise moving at least a portion of the sub-door or vent to expose a door passage through the door 120.
The head unit 404 or door body 124 (e.g., sometimes referred to herein as a "replacement module 404") may actually contain some or all of the sensors, processors, user interfaces, rechargeable batteries, etc. of the smart door 120. The user can plug the unit 404 into and out of the docking station 408. There are many different business and functional possibilities for provisioning, maintenance and upgrading. For example, after many years of use of any particular head unit 404, a user will be able to purchase a new version of head unit 404 and simply plug it into docking station 408. There are many different versions of head unit 404, such as a low cost version with a small number of features, followed by increasingly more powerful versions, up to and including extremely fancy head units 404 with a large number of features, and/or versions made of different materials and/or sizes and/or shapes. Thus, it should be understood that the various versions of head unit 404 may be interchanged, any of which may operate when placed in any of docking stations 408. This may advantageously encourage sharing and redeployment of old head units 404 (e.g., when an important high performance head unit 404 (e.g., for the front door) may be replaced with a larger new version of head unit 404, then the old head unit 404 may be redeployed to the back door or basement door, etc.). When first plugged into docking station 408, head unit 404 may ask the user (e.g., via a 2D liquid crystal display, 2D/3D holographic projection, voice interaction, etc.) some simple questions, such as "Where am I", the user may select "front door" or "back door" or "door" or "swimming pool door" or "front door" or "master follower door" or "nurseries door" or "attic door" or "sun roof" or "window near kitchen range" or the like. In other examples, the head unit 404 may provide instructions such as "Press button once if I am at the front door, Press button twice if I am at the back door", and so on.
Sensor devices such as temperature, humidity, occupancy, ambient light, fire, smoke, carbon monoxide, active proximity, passive infrared motion, any other suitable motion sensing component, ultrasound, radar, CCD/camera, barcode scanner, etc., and input/output (I/O) devices such as speakers, user interfaces, 2D/3D projectors, etc., may be provided in head unit 404. Sensors and I/O devices may be represented generally at a subassembly or component set or sensor 428. Any one or more of the sensors 428 may include or be provided as a tamper-resistant sensor and/or a multi-sensor that may be operable to determine when the door 120 is closed or open (e.g., fully open or open a particular amount and/or open in a particular direction), and/or whether there is a knock (e.g., on the door body or door frame), and/or whether there is motion within any suitable threshold distance of the door (e.g., to one or both sides of the door). For example, one such sensor may be a pico sensor, which may be embedded in an invisible or nearly invisible form factor, and/or may be at least partially incorporated into any suitable structural element of a door, including but not limited to a stile, a door rail, an in-opening hinge door form factor (e.g., in a hinge or in place of a hinge), and the like. As one particular example, any one or more of the sensors 428 may include or be provided, at least in part, as a sensor utilizing any suitable radar-based gesture recognition technology (e.g., Project Soli by google, inc.).
A central server, such as server 164, may use the barcode to obtain information about the package, such as the sender, the recipient, a description of the items in the package, whether a signature is needed, etc. Based on this information, a rule-based inference engine or artificial intelligence can make inferences about what actions to take next. For example, if the occupant, or more specifically, if a designated recipient or recipients, are at home and the package is from a sender or contains an item of particular interest to the occupant or occupants, a notification may be issued at home indicating that the package is currently being delivered and providing details about the package. On the other hand, if one of the occupants is not particularly interested in the sender or item, as determined from the occupant's past response to receiving such delivery, no notification is sent, and the occupant can find the package at the appropriate time. Similarly, if no occupant is at home, but it is inferred that the package is of particular interest to one of the occupants or users, a text message, email, phone call, etc. may be sent (e.g., by server 164) to the interested occupant or users indicating that the package is being delivered.
If the package requires a signature, but no occupants are at home, it can be inferred that the occupants are not disturbed, and the smart door can provide authorization to drop the package. For example, the door 120 may present an authorization code (e.g., in plain text, barcode, or encrypted form) on its user interface, and may prompt the delivery user to record, scan, photograph, or otherwise obtain the authorization code using his or her handheld device. Once the authorization code has been obtained by the deliverer, the smart door 120 may then indicate to the deliverer where to place the package, e.g., at the front door, around a discrete location behind the house, etc.
Techniques including sensors 428 (e.g., noise, motion, and/or facial recognition detection), in combination with a rule-based inference engine or artificial intelligence provided at a central server, such as server 164, may be used to detect when one or more unrecognized individuals approach the door. In such a case, a number of learned inferences can be made. For example, during late night, an alarm may sound inside the house to notify approaching people, and/or the smart door 120 may audibly notify the individual that he or she is being analyzed by the home security system. In addition, if the person attempts to enter a home door, window, or other entry point, a message will be sent to the local law enforcement. However, during the daytime hours when one or more occupants are at home, learned inferences may be made to take no action, such as when meter readers, mail carriers, garbage collectors, etc. approach the premises on a reasonably predictable and learned schedule.
The smart gate 120 may provide a context-based input keypad. In some examples, the input keypad may be projected, for example, by 2D/3D holographic projection. In other examples, the input keypad may be presented on a display such as a 2D LCD display. A person standing near the smart door 120 may enter a code in the keypad to gain access to the smart-home environment 100 through the doorway 135 of the smart door 120. A context-based keypad and/or access code may be available to the occupants of the home. For example, parents may get a more complex keypad that provides various controls, while children may get a simple keypad where they can enter their access codes. Further, a context-based keypad may also be available to non-occupants. For example, the deliverer gets one keypad and the unclassified person gets another keypad. The keypad may vary depending on factors such as time of day, current news (e.g., is there a recent crime nearby. For example, if there is security in the vicinity, the keypad may require a three digit access code or no access code at all, rather than the usual ten digit access code. In another example, a ten digit code may be needed if no one is at home or if only children or the elderly are at home. However, if the parent of the child or the adult child of the elderly are at home, then the access code may not be needed, or only a three digit code may be needed. If the approaching person is determined to be a guest, the keypad may prompt the guest to enter a guest access code assigned to him or her. It should also be understood that individuals may also be prompted to enter their access code when they are away from home. In this way, the codes of guests, occupants, and identified stranger categories (e.g., deliverers) may be used to record the arrival and departure of those people. It should be understood that the keypad may be provided on any smart device in the home, such as smart door 120, wall switch 108, thermostat 102, hazard detector 104, and wall plug 110.
When a central server (e.g., server 164) determines that streets adjacent to a home have a threshold level of traffic based on information (e.g., noise and motion data) received from the smart door 120, inferences can be made regarding the safety of children living at home. For example, if occupancy sensing detects that one or more children are not at home, an alarm may be triggered at home. This warning enables parents or other caregivers to quickly take steps to protect children from traffic. In addition, for example, audio equipment in a home is automatically adjusted to address the problem of increased traffic noise, such as by increasing the volume by a proportional amount.
The sensors 428 may include temperature and humidity sensors, and data from these sensors may be used for many useful services. For example, the thermostat 102 may take into account external humidity and temperature data when controlling the HVAC 103 to achieve a comfort preference desired by the occupant. Further, for example, the information may be presented to the occupants through a number of user interfaces (e.g., a user interface associated with another device located in the home (e.g., an interior surface of the smart door 120), a television, a mobile device, and other computing devices) or audibly. In some cases, a central server, such as server 164, may collect this information from multiple smart doors 120 from a single smart home and/or one or more smart doors 120 from multiple smart homes across multiple geographic locations. These aggregated data may be sold to weather service entities or may be used to provide weather data to smart home occupants.
The smart door 120 may include a button or sensor or any other suitable user interface 412, which button or sensor or user interface 412, when touched, pressed, or otherwise activated, may cause an audible, visual, or otherwise detectable notification to be broadcast at home, or a message to a user interface of a device in the home or a mobile device associated with an occupant of the home. Learned inferences can be made regarding appropriate responses to activation of the user interface 412. For example, an audible notification may be broadcast only in an occupied room, or in a room occupied by one or more occupants having a relationship with a person at the doorway, or an alarm may not be sounded in a room in which an occupant such as a child is determined to be sleeping. Also, for example, a song selected by an occupant, such as an uploaded MP3, may be broadcast at home, where different songs may be broadcast for different occupants of the home at the time or based on the identity of the person at the doorway. Further, for example, the technology and sensors at the smart door 120 may identify the person based on facial recognition or based on other features (e.g., the manner in which the person approaches the door). For example, over time, based on input received from the smart door 120, the central server may establish an address book of profile data (e.g., some identifying biometric data) about people approaching the door. For example, an address book may be created over time using low resolution data (e.g., ultrasound, passive IR, etc.) to create a unique signature for an individual. Such combined data from different domains may become almost fingerprint-like with respect to how the person approaches a house or room or any other space defined or divided by the smart door 120. In some cases, when a "familiar" person approaches the gate, the smart gate 120 may "ask" whether the person is "John Doe," to which the person may respond verbally or physically. After obtaining this information, John Doe's name or image may be announced or projected on a device at home, and/or John Doe will be given certain access to the home, e.g., the door may be automatically unsealed and/or unlocked and/or unlatched when he is in proximity. Further, in addition to or instead of identification based on these unique "signatures," individuals may enable their mobile devices to communicate with the smart door 120, such as via bluetooth, NFC, or other wireless protocols. Further, for example, an individual may "swipe" their smartphone in front of the smart door's RFID scanner. Once the individual is identified, the smart door may give the individual certain access rights to the home, such as by automatically unlocking and/or unlatching the door. According to an embodiment, the technique including the sensor 428 in combination with a rule-based inference engine or artificial intelligence provided at a central server (e.g., server 164) may also make the learned determination.
According to an embodiment, a home analysis and control system may be provided that may include one or more hazard detectors or other audio and/or video enabled devices having wireless capabilities and occupancy detectors and audio speakers, and a smart door 120 having a processor and wireless capabilities. A door approach or door interaction event may trigger the processor to cause the door to wirelessly communicate with one or more hazard detectors to cause its audio speaker to alert the guest outside the door of the corresponding occupant. Each hazard detector may be configured with a do-not-disturb setting such that it will remain silent under one or more predetermined conditions. The predetermined conditions may include one or more of the following: the occupant is determined to sleep in the vicinity of the hazard detector; the room location of the hazard detector is unoccupied; the hazard detector is located in an occupied bedroom; and the hazard detector is located in the child's bedroom.
The various capabilities of the smart doors 120 may provide an intelligent and at least partially automated interface between occupants of the smart home environment 100 and any potential guests or other suitable entities or elements outside of the smart home environment 100, including delivery services, friends, attorneys, strangers and thieves, as well as pets, ambient weather conditions, and the like. The smart door 120 may be used with one or more other network-connected smart devices of the environment 100 (e.g., one or more of the devices 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 113, 114, 116, 122, 166, 168, and/or 170) and/or with the service platform 200 such that the smart door 120 may act as a trusted and valid contact between system users associated with the environment 100 (e.g., residents, owners, residents, etc.) and guests that may be proximate to the entry point of the environment 100 where the smart door 120 may be located, whether or not the system users are currently in the environment 100. For example, the smart door 120 may be a guest interface or entryway interface device operable to detect and respond to the approach and/or departure of a person or any other suitable guest entity to a location (e.g., the outer door 120 of the structure 150 of the environment 100), announce such approach or departure, enhance conventional doorbell functionality and/or enhance conventional doorknob functionality and/or enhance conventional door seal functionality and/or enhance conventional door latch functionality for both system users and guests, control settings on a security system, improve convenience and efficiency of package delivery, improve traceability of package delivery, enable secure package delivery, detect environmental data and other useful data of the environment 100 and system 164, and so forth.
Due to potential installation at locations of traditional doors or other conventional entryway interfaces (e.g., at the exterior structural door 120, at the gated entrance 116, at a lobby of a shared dwelling (e.g., a condominium or apartment building), at a front door of a personal dwelling of such a building, at a door of an enclosed private room, at a door of an outdoor area of the environment (e.g., an outdoor swimming pool), etc.), the smart door 120 may obtain sufficient electrical operating power, for example, by being coupled to wires that may be behind the walls 154 of the smart-home environment 100 and that may exist in virtually all standard wired areas (e.g., coupled to a 120V "hot" line voltage wire).
Fig. 1 and 4A-6B illustrate example user interfaces and hardware features of a smart door 120 that may incorporate or otherwise access a wide variety of sensing, interface and communication capabilities to enhance user comfort, convenience and security. The head unit 404/door body 124 of the smart door 120 may include one or more of a main processor 414, storage 416, buttons and/or a touch screen display and/or any other suitable user interface 412 (e.g., a keyboard, trackball, switch, slider, three-dimensional user input device/user interface, user sensor (e.g., biometric sensor or motion sensor or touch sensor, etc.), audio speaker 436, microphone 444, power converter 440, Global Positioning System (GPS) component 450 (e.g., GPS receiver), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) locator 454, and universal physical module receiver 458.
The head unit 404/door body 124 of the smart door 120 may additionally or alternatively include one or more types of wireless and/or wired network components 462. Given sufficient power availability, the network component 462 may provide the smart door 120 with a variety of suitable communication capabilities, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, 3G/4G/5G, etc., wireless, CAT6 wired Ethernet, and even curbside optical fiber. Further, because the smart door 120 may be coupled to a home 120V system or any other suitable wired or wireless power system, HomePlug or other power line communication capability may be provided by the network component 462. Such communication capabilities may enable the smart door 120 to communicate with any other smart devices of the environment 100 and/or any suitable elements of the platform 200.
Typically, the door body may be provided by a material or combination of materials selected to provide a door that is structurally sound or that may provide some insulation against noise and/or weather, etc. However, such structures may generally prevent certain wireless communication signals from passing through such door bodies without significant degradation. Thus, by providing the smart door 120 with one or more network components 462 that are at least partially integrated within the door body 124 and/or the door frame 130, the smart door 120 may be operable to increase, rather than suppress, the strength of wireless communication signals transmitted throughout the environment 100. For example, one or more network components 462 (e.g., Wi-Fi, braid/wire bridge, etc.) at least partially integrated within the smart door 120 may be operable to facilitate communicatively coupling communication devices (e.g., a first communication device located within the ambient environment AE (e.g., outdoor lighting 114) and a second communication device located within the room 152 (e.g., wireless router 160)) that may be located on opposite sides of the smart door. Since the size (e.g., height and/or width and/or thickness) of the door body 124 may be quite large, one or more large smart antenna arrays (e.g., with power amplification for cellular backup) may be operable to be provided by one or more network components 462 at least partially integrated within the door body 124 of the smart door 120 in order to provide a large and powerful communication range.
The head unit 404/door body 124 of the smart door 120 may additionally or alternatively include any number of any suitable sensor components 428, such as any suitable temperature sensor, any suitable humidity sensor, any suitable motion sensor (e.g., occupancy sensor), any suitable Ambient Light Sensor (ALS), any suitable fire sensor, any suitable smoke sensor, any suitable carbon monoxide (CO) sensor, any suitable proximity sensor, any suitable Passive Infrared (PIR) or other motion sensor, any suitable ultrasonic sensor, any suitable still or video camera or scanner (e.g., a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera, a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) camera, or any suitable scanner (e.g., a bar code scanner or any other suitable scanner, which may obtain identification information from a code such as a linear barcode, a two-dimensional or matrix barcode (e.g., a quick response ("QR") code), a three-dimensional barcode, etc.), any suitable Near Field Communication (NFC) technology sensor (e.g., for sensing an entity wearing an infrared-or NFC-enabled smartphone or other suitable element), any suitable RFID technology sensor (e.g., for sensing an entity wearing an RFID bracelet, an RFID necklace, an RFID fob, or other suitable element (e.g., a pet or child), any suitable audio sensor (e.g., a microphone that may operate in conjunction with an audio processing application accessible by door 120 (e.g., at environment 100, system 164, or other accessible component of platform 200) that may recognize particular voice or other particular audio data to authenticate a user or for any other suitable purpose)) Any suitable biometric sensor (e.g., a fingerprint reader or a heart rate sensor or a facial recognition sensor or an eye tracker or a retinal scan sensor or a voice analyzer or a skin temperature sensor or a heart rate/pulse sensor or any other feature recognition sensor that may operate in conjunction with a feature processing application accessible by the gate 120 (e.g., at the environment 100, the system 164, or other accessible components of the platform 200), for authenticating a user or for any other suitable purpose), and so forth. The head unit 404/door body 124 of the smart door 120 may also provide a rechargeable battery 432 or any equivalent capability on-board power storage medium. For example, battery 432 may be a rechargeable lithium ion battery. In operation, the smart door 120 may charge the battery 432 during time intervals when the hardware power usage may be less than the amount of power that electricity theft can safely provide, and may discharge to provide any additional power needed during time intervals when the hardware power usage may be greater than the amount of power that electricity theft can safely provide, so that power may be drawn as needed (e.g., from 120V "hot" line voltage or other suitable power source). The battery 432 may be used as a conventional backup power source or storage to supply excess power (e.g., DC power) for a short period of time when needed.
Since the dimensions (e.g., height and/or width and/or thickness) of the door body 124 and/or the door frame 130 may be quite large, one or more large, high-capacity batteries 432 may be readily disposed within the structure of the smart door 120 and used to power not only any function of the smart door 120, but also any function of any other smart device that may be electrically coupled to the system 199 of the smart door 120. Some of the functions of the smart door 120 may be functions that should always work even when remote power is not available to the smart door 120 (e.g., due to a loss of mains power from the environment 100), such as locking/unlocking, latching/unlatching, sealing/unsealing, and/or closing/opening the door 120. Additionally or alternatively, the door 120 may be configured to enable manual control of such functionality when certain power cannot be provided for such functionality (e.g., a mechanical door lock accessible by a user's physical key may be enabled for locking or unlocking the smart door 120 when electronic powered control of such functionality is not possible (e.g., due to lack of power).
The head unit 404/door body 124 of the smart door 120 may include one or more User Interfaces (UIs) 412 of any suitable type, such as one or more visual displays (e.g., Thin Film Transistors (TFTs), Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), or any other suitable display), a touch screen or any suitable display 431 and/or button input capabilities, an audio speaker 436, a microphone 444, and/or the like. The head unit 404/door body 124 of the smart door 120 may provide part or all of the smart doorbell 106 and/or part or all of the smart door handle 122, wherein at least part of the user interface 412 may provide a user interface portion of such a smart doorbell 106 and/or a user interface portion of such a smart door handle 122. In some embodiments, (e.g., as may be shown in fig. 4B), a particular head unit 404/door body 124 of the smart door 120 may include a user interface 412 with a ring-shaped circle input button that clicks and rotates. According to such an embodiment, a ring input button that clicks and rotates may be used by a guest to simply "ring" the doorbell 106 (e.g., for the guest to attempt to announce himself). Further, in some embodiments, such a click and rotate annular ring input button may be operable to provide a menu-driven interface for a user to manage some or all of the various capabilities of the door 120. The user interface 412 may additionally or alternatively be configured to take a variety of forms, including but not limited to a touch pad, a dial, a click wheel, a scroll wheel, a touch screen, a three-dimensional input and/or output interface, one or more buttons (e.g., a single conventional doorbell-like button or multiple buttons of a keyboard), a mouse, a joystick, a trackball, or the like. Further, one or more of the sensor components 428 may also serve, at least in part, as input components and/or may be at least partially integrated into the user interface 412 (e.g., by sensing data from the user (e.g., as a microphone, camera, scanner, motion sensor, biometric sensor, etc. (e.g., the user interface 412 may include a biometric fingerprint scanner to detect a fingerprint of an entity that may touch the user interface 412))). A 2D image and/or 3D holographic image projector 430 may also be provided such that the effective size of the display is not limited to only the physical size of the surface of display 431 of head unit 404. For example, if a package is to be deposited by a visitor, the smart door 120 may utilize the projector 430 to project a defined delivery area (e.g., area AL of fig. 1) of the package. When a button 412 (e.g., of the doorbell 106 of the smart door 120) is pressed, touched, or otherwise selectively interacted with and/or used by a guest, the door 120 may be operable to generate and send a signal to a user communication component (e.g., via any suitable wired or wireless communication path) to alert the user of the guest at the door 120, where such user communication component may be any suitable smart component of the smart environment 100 (e.g., an output component of the hazard device 104 or a communication mechanism available to the user device 166) or any conventional component of the user environment (e.g., a chime of a conventional doorbell and/or an emergency light in a home).
The smart door handle 122 may be configured to selectively unlock and/or selectively unlatch the door body 124 relative to the door frame 130. While the latch may be any suitable device that can hold the door or window in a particular position relative to the frame until the user manually unlocks the latch to release the door for movement relative to the frame (e.g., the metal hook passes through the loop or the freely rotatable shaft pulls the latch of the door out of the receptacle in the door frame), the lock may be any suitable device for preventing the door from moving relative to the frame unless unlocking is accomplished using a separate key or authentication process (e.g., any suitable locking mechanism that can be unlocked by any suitable key or process, including but not limited to a physical key lock, an RFID key lock, a biometric key lock, a combination key lock, etc.). In some embodiments, the latching and locking features may be provided by different latching and locking mechanisms that may interact with the door in different ways and/or at different locations. Alternatively, the latching and locking features may be provided by a combined latching/locking mechanism (e.g., the mechanism of a smart door handle). For example, as shown in FIG. 4D, the smart door handle 122 may include a remote electronic lock that may lock the spindle 484. This may lock the door 120 because it may prevent the spindle 484 from disengaging a latching feature 486f (e.g., a retractable nub) of a latch 486 of the door handle 122 (e.g., which may be provided by or otherwise retained by the door body 124 (e.g., extending from or otherwise exposed through a side surface 124s of the door body 124)) from a latching feature 490f (e.g., a recess) of a striker plate 490 of a door stop 494 of the door handle 122 (e.g., which may be provided by or otherwise retained by the door frame 130 (e.g., extending from or otherwise exposed by a side surface 130s of the door frame 130)). Thus, the smart door handle 122 may be able to automatically unlock the door 120 without requiring the user to touch the door handle 122. For example, the smart doorbell 106 or the smart doorknob 122 or the door 120 or any other suitable device of the environment 100 may generally be configured to detect or otherwise identify a registered occupant that is approaching the door 120 and instruct the smart doorknob 122 to unlock automatically. It should also be understood that a user (e.g., an occupant or other person) may use the registered mobile device 166 to remotely unlock the door. For example, if the occupant receives a notification from the smart doorbell 106 that a trusted neighbor is approaching a door while at home, the occupant may unlock the door using the mobile device 166 so that the neighbor may bring in his or her own. Alternatively, the occupant may speak an audible command instructing the smart doorknob 122 to unlock. When locked, the spindle 484 may not be able to move (e.g., rotate) to disengage the latch 486 from the striker plate 490. However, when unlocked, the spindle 484 may be able to move (e.g., rotate) to disengage the latch 486 from the strike plate 490. For example, when unlocked, a user may manually interact with a handle portion of door handle 122 to rotate spindle 484 to unlatch door body 124 from door frame 130. According to some embodiments, smart door handle 122 may include a remote-controlled electronic motor that may be configured to rotate spindle 484 to disengage latch 486 of door handle 122 from striker plate 490 of door stop 494 to unlatch door body 124 from door frame 130. Thus, the smart door handle 122 may be able to automatically unlock and/or automatically unlatch the door 120 without requiring the user to touch the door handle 122. Similarly, the smart doorknob may be capable of automatically latching and/or automatically locking the door 120 without requiring the user to touch the doorknob 122.
Certain guest behaviors may be detected as suspicious and used to increase the security of the environment 100 in one or more ways. For example, platform 200 may be a door or other entry point operable to detect whether/when a guest attempts to open a portion of environment 100 before platform 200 has granted the guest access to such entry point, and in response, platform 200 may be some security mechanism operable to use the detection of such suspicious guest behavior to adjust environment 100. For example, one or more sensing components of the doorbell 106 (e.g., a camera) or of other portions of the entry detector 112 or the door 120 may be operable to detect when a visitor touches the door handle 122 and/or attempts to enter the structure 150 through the door 120. As another example, as shown in fig. 4D, the smart door handle 122 may include one or more sensing components 498 that may include any suitable sensing component similar to that described above with respect to sensing component 428, etc., and that may be operable to detect when a visitor twists, grasps, pulls, or at least touches the door handle 122 and/or otherwise attempts to enter through the door 120. For example, one or more of the sensing members 498 may be positioned within a handle portion 481 of the door handle 122 that is accessible to a visitor outside of an exterior side 124e of the door body 124, where the interior side 124i of the door body 124 may face the interior of the structure 150 (e.g., the room 152) when the door 120 is closed to prevent the visitor from entering the structure 150, and at least one of the sensing members 498 may be operable to detect the visitor's touch, rotation, pull, grab, or any other suitable visitor interaction with the door handle 491 or any other suitable portion of the door handle 122. Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the sensing members 498 may be positioned within a handle portion 489 of the door handle 122, which handle portion 489 may be reached by an occupant or other user outside of the interior side 124i of the door body 124, and at least one such sensing member 498 may be operable to detect any user touching, rotating, pulling, grabbing, or any other suitable portion of the door handle 489 or the door handle 122. For example, one door handle sensing component 498 may include an accelerometer or any other suitable motion sensing component for detecting certain visitor interactions with the door handle 122. Additionally or alternatively, the door handle sensing component 498 may include a biometric sensing component, such as a facial recognition detector or a fingerprint detector or a user device identification detector, which may be a specific identification information operable to detect a visitor interacting with the door handle 122 (e.g., for determining visitor trustworthiness and/or unlocking the door handle 122). Any other suitable guest activity may be detected by platform 200 and considered suspicious for initiating enhanced security features in addition to guest interaction with door handle 122 before being granted access through closed door 120. For example, platform 200 may be operable to analyze detected information to consider any one of the following or any combination of the following guest interactions as suspect: any suitable unauthorized interaction with the door handle 122 (e.g., physical touching, grabbing, twisting, pulling, etc.); any suitable unauthorized interaction with the structure 150 (e.g., a visitor physically strikes the door 120 or opens a mail slot or other feature of the door 120); one or more failed attempts by the guest to provide the correct access code or other suitable authentication to gain access through the closed door 120; interaction with the user interface/button 412 of the doorbell 106 or other portion of the door 120 in an unauthorized manner (e.g., the visitor presses the button 412 when the button 412 is rendered disabled); any improper guest interaction with one or more components of the smart device (e.g., a guest blocking the doorbell 412 or the camera sensing component 428 of other portions of the door 120); prevent or prohibit any guest activity recognized by the guest (e.g., detecting that the guest is wearing the mask); and so on.
Alone or in combination with other intelligent devices and/or rule-based reasoning engines and/or artificial intelligence and/or any other processing capabilities provided at the environment 100 and/or otherwise by the service platform 200, the one or more sensors 428 of the door 120 may be operable to detect when a package is attempted to be delivered to the smart-home environment 100, and the door 120 may then be operable to take one or more of a variety of automated actions in response to such detection. For example, as shown in fig. 1, if a guest entity or deliverer DL (e.g., a human courier or drone or otherwise) is attempting to deliver a package PL to a portion of the environment 100, such as to a structure 150 at the door 120, the door 120 may be operable to access certain package identification information associated with the package PL. Door 120 may be operable to receive certain package identification information from deliverer DL, such as by deliverer DL1 actively physically communicating such package identification information to door 120 (e.g., audibly communicating to any suitable sensing component 428 of door 120), and/or by deliverer DL electronically communicating such package identification information to network communication component 462 of door 120 using any suitable communication protocol (e.g., via communication path 107) (e.g., by communicating digital data from deliverer's mobile device 266, mobile device 266 may be similar to user device 166). The gate 120 may be operable to access certain package identification information directly from the package PL, for example, through a scanner sensing component 428 of the gate 120, which scanner sensing component 428 may be operable to scan information (e.g., code information) from a label ID (e.g., a shipping label or a delivery label) coupled to or otherwise associated with the package PL (e.g., through the communication path 105). In response to detecting such package identifying information for a package PL, the platform 200 (e.g., the gate 120, alone or in combination with other intelligent devices and/or rule-based inference engines and/or artificial intelligence provided at the environment 100 and/or service platform 200) may be operable to access additional information based on the detected package identifying information (e.g., a description of the sender, the recipient, the content of the package PL, whether a signature is needed to complete delivery, etc.) and/or to take one or more of various automated actions based on the detected package identifying information and/or the otherwise accessed information.
Such package identifying information that may be associated with a package (e.g., package PL) may be generated by any suitable entity or combination of entities using any suitable data. In some embodiments, certain package identification information that may be associated with a package PL may uniquely identify a particular smart home environment 100 and/or a system user (e.g., a resident of the environment 100) registered with or otherwise associated with the environment 100 and/or a mode setting thereof such that an entity having access to such package identification information may be able to access additional information associated with the environment 100 or a user of the environment 100. For example, a delivery entity (e.g., courier service) that may be in the process of delivering a package PL to the environment 100 may use certain package identification information to access any suitable smart environment data (e.g., dynamic data) about the environment 100 or its users that may be identified by the package identification information to improve the convenience and efficiency of package delivery. Such smart environment data may indicate the status of the environment 100 and/or the status of a particular user of the environment 100 (e.g., whether a package PL may be received by someone at the environment 100), such that a delivery entity may be able to utilize such smart environment data to more efficiently attempt to deliver the package PL.
By providing an accessory device that can be coupled to the package PL to enable the system 164 (e.g., via the door 120) to effect secure record keeping and/or measurement and/or analysis of the package PL, the system 164 can effect proper delivery of the package PL. For example, instead of instructing the deliverer DL to face a safe or lobby that may be temporarily accessed by the deliverer DL to deposit the package PL (e.g., by temporarily unsealing and/or unlocking and/or unlatching at least a portion of the door 120 (e.g., a top portion (e.g., the upper door body portion 124u of the door body of the two-way door 120, rather than the lower door body portion 124l))), the system 164 may instruct the deliverer DL to couple the accessory component 470 to the package PL using the door 120 or any other suitable smart device of the environment 100 and then leave the package PL with the accessory component 470 near the door 120 for safe handling. As shown in fig. 1, the accessory component 470 of the door 120 may be coupled to the package PL (e.g., fastened, adhered, attached, snapped, tied, rested, or otherwise attached), wherein the accessory component 470 may be any other component operable to communicate with or be detected by any other component of the door 120 (e.g., any suitable communication component 462 (e.g., bluetooth) and/or sensor component 428) or environment 100 or platform 200 when coupled to the package PL, such that the platform 200 may record and/or measure and/or analyze the location and/or any other suitable characteristic of the package PL (e.g., based on the measured and/or analyzed location and/or any other suitable characteristic of the accessory component 470). For example, accessory component 470 may be configured to include any suitable sensing component (e.g., a motion sensing component or any other suitable sensing component as described above with respect to sensing component 428) that may detect movement or any other suitable characteristic of accessory component 470 and, thus, package PL (when coupled to accessory component 470), and such sensed characteristic may be communicated to or detected by any other component of door 120 and/or any other suitable smart device of environment 100 and, thus, system 164. Alternatively or additionally, any other suitable smart device of the door 120 and/or environment 100 may be operable to detect the position of the accessory component 470 such that if the package PL is moved (e.g. by animals or wind or otherwise) after the deliverer DL leaves the package PL, the door 120 and/or any other suitable smart device of the environment 100 may be operable to record such movement for finding the package PL to be retrieved. Such physical coupling of the package PL with components of the environment 100 (e.g., the attachments 470 of the doors 120) may increase the ability and/or effectiveness of the system 164 to securely record and/or measure and/or analyze and/or process the package during and after the unattended delivery. The accessory component 470 may be reused whenever a new package is deposited for secure handling by the door 120 and/or any other suitable smart device of the environment 100. As just one example, the accessory component 470 may be an RFID tag that may be communicatively coupled to or identified by another component of the door 120. Any movement of the package PL that meets or exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., as may be detected through use of the accessory component 470) may trigger one or more additional sensing components of the door 120 or other components of the environment 100 to record and/or measure and/or analyze and/or process the package PL/component 470, thereby improving security administration of the package PL. Accessory component 470 may be any other suitable smart device operable to wirelessly communicate with other components of door 120 and/or environment 100, and/or may communicate via a wire 472 that may extend between accessory component 470 and any other suitable components of door 120 (e.g., head unit 404/door body 124). If line 472 is severed or otherwise interrupted, the system 164 may implement additional increased security to record the package PL. In some embodiments, the retainer 471 of the door 120 and/or any other suitable smart device of the environment 100 may be selectively opened and closed (e.g., by electronic control of the system 164) for selectively enabling the accessory component 470 to be removed from the remainder of the door 120 and/or any other suitable smart device of the environment 100 for attachment to the package PL.
Once the package PL has been placed in a secure area of the environment 100 or otherwise placed for secure processing by the deliverer DL (e.g., using the accessory component 470), the system 164 may continue to intermittently or continuously oversee the package PL and/or the secure area (e.g., area AL) to maintain the security of the delivered package. As one example, the environment 100 may be configured to continuously or intermittently record and/or measure and/or analyze and/or oversee the location of a delivered package PL, such as by detecting status data from accessory components 470 coupled to the package PL, or by sensing the package PL within the area AL, or by confirming that the self-package PL is placed therein so that the secure area (e.g., lobby or safe) remains inaccessible at all times. After any suitable regulatory period of any suitable length for which the security of the package PL has been confirmed by the environment 100, the system 164 may be configured to communicate such security status with any suitable entity, such as the delivery entity enterprise 228 and/or any suitable user of the environment 100 (e.g., the intended recipient of the package PL). However, if at any time after secure placement of the package PL by the deliverer DL, the environment 100 detects any type of change in the state of the package PL or the secure area or component that the environment 100 may use to protect the package PL, any suitable sensing function of the environment 100 may be activated or enhanced and/or any suitable alarm or notification function may be activated. For example, if the environment 100 (e.g., the motion sensing component 428 of the door 120) detects any movement of the package PL, additional sensing components of the environment 100 (e.g., the camera sensor 428 of the door 120) and/or other useful components of the environment 100 (e.g., the outdoor lighting 114) may be activated to sense additional information about the state of the package PL and/or its surroundings (e.g., whether an animal or other entity may be moving the package PL). Alternatively or additionally, in such instances, the alert may be activated and transmitted within the structure 150 (e.g., if there is currently any occupancy within the structure 150) and/or outside the environment 100 (e.g., at the door 120 and/or at any suitable law enforcement entity 222 or delivery entity enterprise 228 or user of the environment 100 to help protect the package PL). When a package PL has been deposited by the deliverer DL for secure processing by the environment 100, any suitable event may be monitored to enhance protection of the package PL, including, for example, detecting when any unidentified or unregistered user or visitor may come within a certain distance of a secure area in which the package PL has been deposited. For example, the door 120 or any other suitable portion of the smart environment 100 capable of handling the package PL may be equipped with pass-through identification technology (e.g., facial recognition, RFID, ultrasonic sensors) that may "fingerprint" or create or otherwise access a "signature" for an identified or registered user of the environment 100, such that in operation, when a person who does not live at home or is not registered at a smart home or whose fingerprint or signature is not identified by the smart home "walks" to the package PL, the environment 100 may provide an alert and/or may increase protection of the package PL by activating a new form of package administration/protection (e.g., a mobile sensor that is more sensitive relative to the package PL).
When a package PL has been left in the environment 100 by the deliverer DL, the system 164 may be configured to communicate information indicative of the package deposit to any suitable entity (e.g., a system user of the environment 100 and/or the delivery entity enterprise 228, etc.). Additionally or alternatively, the system 164 may be configured to send any suitable alert to a system user or a delivery entity or other suitable entity at any suitable time, such alert may cause such entity to attend to the status of packages that have been left in the environment 100 but have not yet been claimed by the system user. Such alerts may be implemented by any suitable communication technique, such as email, telephone, text message, alerts via any suitable smart device (e.g., via a user interface of the hazard device 104 within the structure 150 or via a user interface 412 of the door 120, which may be readily detected by a user of the environment 100 when walking inside the structure 150 to an inside 124i of the door body 124 of the door 120 (e.g., via an internal display user interface 431i) or when approaching the outside of the structure 150 to an outside 124e of the door body 124 of the door 120 (e.g., via an external display user interface 431 e)). As just one example, when an identified or registered system user of environment 100 arrives at structure 150 (e.g., at gate 120), gate 120 may be operable to detect such arrival, and in response thereto, communicate to the user that the package PL has recently been left for retrieval by the deliverer DL for the user (e.g., a voice or text message via an output component of gate 120 that may state or otherwise present a message indicating something like "welcome user X, a package PL waited delivered by delivered by DL at time Y, and is currently protected at location Z, waiting for your retrieval)"). Alternatively, a simple flashing light may be provided by the door 120 (e.g., by the projector 430) while the package is waiting for the user to retrieve.
The components of the door 120 may be arranged in any suitable manner with respect to the door body 124 and the door frame 130. For example, as shown in fig. 4B, when door 120 is closed (e.g., when door body 124 is positioned to block door-frame passage 135), if door 120 separates interior room 152 of enclosure 150 from ambient environment AE, a first side of door 120 (e.g., an exterior side of door 120 relative to enclosure 150) may include exterior side 124e of door body 124 and exterior side 130e of door frame 130. The exterior side 124e of the door body 124 may at least partially expose or otherwise functionally provide an external display user interface 431e, an external projector 430e, one or more external audio speakers 436e, one or more external microphones 444e, one or more external sensors 428e (e.g., one or more external cameras, external temperature sensors, external humidity sensors, external occupancy sensors, external ambient light sensors, external fire sensors, external smoke sensors, external carbon monoxide sensors, external active proximity sensors, external passive infrared motion sensors, external ultrasonic sensors, external scanner sensors, external biometric sensors, external NFC sensors, etc.), an external handle portion 481 of the smart door handle 122, and/or any other suitable user interface for smart door locks and/or smart door latches, Any suitable user interface portion of the smart doorbell 106, any other suitable external user interface 412e, a retainer 471 for selectively enabling removal of the accessory component 470 from the remainder of the door 120, one or more external vent openings 457e of the vent 457 (e.g., any suitable vent panel (e.g., any suitable electromechanical vent panel), which may each be controlled by any suitable actuator 207 and/or any controller of the system 199 to open and/or close in any suitable direction and/or amount and/or with any suitable filter)), a sub-door outer surface 452e of the sub-door 452, and/or any other suitable feature of the door 120. Further, as shown in fig. 4B, at least a portion of sealing mechanism 409u may extend over any suitable portion of exterior side 130e of door frame 130 and any suitable portion of exterior side 124e of door body 124 (e.g., for sealing one or more body-frame gaps of door-frame channel 135 that may exist between door frame 130 and any suitable portion of door body 124 along an upper edge or top surface of door body 124 and/or at one or more top corners of door body 124 and/or at one or more upper portions of one or more side surfaces of door body 124) and/or at least a portion of sealing mechanism 409l may extend over any suitable portion of exterior side 130e of door frame 130 and any suitable portion of exterior side 124e of door body 124 (e.g., for extending along a lower edge or bottom surface of door body 124 and/or at one or more bottom corners of door body 124 and/or at any suitable portion of exterior side 124e of door body 124) To seal one or more body-frame gaps of a door-frame channel 135 that may exist between the door frame 130 and any suitable portion of the door body 124).
Further, as shown in fig. 4C, when door 120 is closed (e.g., when door body 124 is positioned to block door-frame passage 135), if door 120 separates interior space 152 of enclosure 150 from ambient environment AE, a second side of door 120 (e.g., an interior side of door 120 relative to enclosure 150) may include interior side 124i of door body 124 and interior side 130i of door frame 130. The interior side 124i of the door body 124 may at least partially expose or otherwise functionally provide an interior display user interface 431i, an interior projector 430i, one or more interior audio speakers 436i, one or more interior microphones 444i, one or more interior sensors 428i (e.g., one or more interior cameras, interior temperature sensors, interior humidity sensors, interior occupancy sensors, interior ambient light sensors, interior fire sensors, interior smoke sensors, interior carbon monoxide sensors, interior active proximity sensors, interior passive infrared motion sensors, interior ultrasonic sensors, interior scanner sensors, interior biometric sensors, interior NFC sensors, etc.), an interior 489 of the smart door handle 122 and/or any other suitable user interface of a smart door lock and/or latch, an interior display user interface 431i, an interior projector 430i, one or more interior audio speakers 436i, one or more interior microphones 444i, one or more interior sensors 428i (e.e., one or more interior cameras, interior temperature sensors, interior humidity, Any other suitable internal user interface 412i, one or more internal vent openings 457i of the vent 457, a sub-door inner surface 452i of the sub-door 452, and/or any other suitable feature of the door 120. Further, as shown in fig. 4C, at least a portion of sealing mechanism 409u may extend over any suitable portion of interior side 130i of door frame 130 and any suitable portion of interior side 124i of door body 124 (e.g., for sealing one or more body-frame gaps of door-frame channel 135 that may exist between door body 124 and any suitable portion of door frame 130 along an upper edge or top surface of door body 124 and/or at one or more top corners of door body 124 and/or at one or more upper portions of one or more side surfaces of door body 124) and/or at least a portion of sealing mechanism 409l may extend over any suitable portion of interior side 130i of door frame 130 and any suitable portion of interior side 124i of door body 124 (e.g., for extending along a lower edge or bottom surface of door body 124 and/or at one or more bottom corners of door body 124 and/or at any suitable portion of door body 124) To seal one or more body-frame gaps of a door-frame channel 135 that may exist between the door frame 130 and any suitable portion of the door body 124). Although possibly exposed by an exterior side of the door 120 or not exposed by an interior or exterior side of the door 120, but rather hidden between a side surface of the door body 124 and the door frame 130, the interior side of the door 120 as shown in fig. 4C may include at least a portion of the upper hinge mechanical coupling 403u and/or the lower hinge mechanical coupling 403l (e.g., for controlling movement (e.g., rotation) of one or more portions of the door body 124 relative to the door frame 130 about the axis R (e.g., the shared axis of the hinge coupling mechanisms 403u and 403 l) to move such portions out of the door frame channel 135), the upper hinge mechanical coupling u may include and/or be controlled by the upper hinge actuator 407u, and the lower hinge mechanical coupling 403l may include or be controlled by the lower hinge actuator 407 l. Additionally or alternatively, as shown in fig. 4C and 6B, the arm actuator 407a may be physically coupled to the door body 124 and the door frame 130, and may be operable to selectively push the door body 124 away from the door frame 130 or to selectively pull the door body 124 toward the door frame 130 (e.g., an actuatable arm may extend between the door body 124 and the door frame 130 at a variable length (e.g., expand in the direction of arrow D of fig. 6B or contract in the direction of arrow R of fig. 6B) for controlling an angle at which the door body 124 may rotate about the axis R to selectively expose or block the door frame passage 135).
When a first type of service function should be executed before a second type of service function should be executed to achieve a particular end result of the door (e.g., when a decapsulation service function should be executed before an opening service function should be executed to position the door body in an open position relative to the door frame), then a different trigger event may be detected and used to initiate such a different service function in order to provide an efficient and secure process for achieving the end result. As described above, the smart door 120 is generally used to move the door body 124 relative to the door frame 130 such that one or more user entities are enabled or prevented from passing through the door frame passage 135. However, even when the door body 124 is in a closed position relative to the door frame 130, the door 120 may still enable certain elements (e.g., air, smoke, water, etc.) to pass through the body-frame gap of the door-frame channel 135 unless an effective sealing mechanism 409 engages to form a strong seal (e.g., prevent undesired transfer of air or water through the gap). However, activation of such sealing mechanisms for forming such strong seals (i.e., sealing process) and/or deactivation of such sealing mechanisms for breaking such strong seals (i.e., unsealing process) may take at least a certain amount of time, which may delay the ability of the door to move from the closed position to the open position (i.e., opening process), such that a user wishing to open the closed door may first be forced to wait until the unsealing process is complete. Thus, it may be helpful, faster, improved, and/or better to initiate the unsealing process at a time before it may be desirable to initiate the opening process. The smart gate may be configured to initiate a decapsulation process in response to detecting any suitable decapsulation trigger event and to initiate an opening process in response to detecting any suitable opening trigger event that may be different from the decapsulation trigger event. Similarly, other service functions of the smart door may be triggered in response to detecting a corresponding trigger event (e.g., the smart door may be configured to initiate an unlocking process in response to detecting any suitable unlocking trigger event, and initiate an unlatching process in response to detecting any suitable unlatching trigger event, which may be different from the unlocking trigger event). The different trigger events may be defined in such a way as to maintain the security of the intelligent environment in which the intelligent door is set, and also to effectively implement a certain sequence of different processes respectively associated with the different trigger events.
As shown in fig. 5A-5E, the smart environment 100 may be configured such that the detection of different triggering events may be used to automatically initiate different respective processes for changing the state of the smart door 120, which smart door 120 may be separating the ambient environment AE from the room 152 or any other suitable space. Such processes for changing the state of the smart door may include, but are not limited to, unsealing or sealing the door, unlocking or locking the door, unlatching or latching the door, opening or closing the door, and the like. Such trigger events that may be detected to automatically initiate such a process may include, but are not limited to, characteristics of a user of the smart environment (e.g., user position, user gesture or user action, user-entered device instructions, etc.), characteristics of any portion of the smart environment (e.g., temperature, humidity, any other suitable weather characteristic, time of day, day of week, day of month, day of year, any other suitable time characteristic, etc.), and/or the like. For example, any suitable sensor of door 120 or system 199 may detect or determine or identify or calculate or measure or fine tune any suitable data that may indicate a potential triggering event. Such potential trigger event data may then be processed by any suitable processing component of system 199 (e.g., processor 414 of smart door 120 itself, a processor of any other smart device that may be communicatively coupled to smart door 120, a processor of system 164, etc. (e.g., any suitable processor, controller, central processing unit, microcontroller unit, etc.)) to determine whether the detected potential trigger event data (e.g., alone or in combination with any other data that may be available to the processing component) meets the requirements of any particular trigger event (e.g., may be defined in any suitable manner (e.g., by software, inference (e.g., rule-based or learning-based inference), preferences, other system characteristic data (e.g., location, time of day, current environmental occupancy, etc.)), for transitioning the smart door 120 from its current door state to a new door state. Then, when it is determined that the detected potential triggering event data does satisfy the particular triggering event for transitioning the intelligent door 120 from its current door state to a new door state, the appropriate processing component may communicate any appropriate door state transition instruction data to any appropriate component of the intelligent door 120 that may be received and utilized by the intelligent door 120 to transition the intelligent door 120 to such new door state.
The smart door may be configured to be in any suitable default door state given the particular default environment state of the smart environment. As just one example, when the smart environment is determined to be in a default or safe and sealed or first environmental state, such as when a space protected by the smart door (e.g., room 152 of fig. 5A-5E) is unoccupied and a temperature difference between two spaces separated by the smart door (e.g., ambient environment AE of fig. 5A-5E and room 152) is greater than a certain threshold (e.g., 20 °), etc., then the system 199 may be configured to control the smart door such that the smart door is in a particular default or safe and sealed or first door state in which the door is closed, latched, locked, and sealed. Such a state may be illustrated by the first door state 500A of fig. 5A, where the smart door 120 of the smart environment 100 may be in a closed state, a latched state, a locked state, and a sealed state. Such a closed state of the first door state 500A may be a state in which the door body 124 may be positioned entirely or substantially entirely within the door-frame channel 135. Such a latched state of the first door state 500A may be a state in which the closed position of the door body 124 within the door-frame channel 135 may be maintained without any manual interaction by the user (e.g., the actuator 407 controlling the mechanical coupling 403 may retain the door body 124 within the door-frame channel 135 without the user manually pushing or pulling the door body 124 from the closed position, or without the user approaching the door to within a particular threshold, the latch 486 may engage the plate 490 of the doorknob 122 to retain the door body 124 within the door-frame channel 135 without the user manually engaging the doorknob 122 to disengage the latch 486 from the plate 490, or without the user approaching the door to within a particular threshold, etc.). Such a locked state of the first door state 500A may be a state in which the closed position of the door body 124 within the door-frame channel 135 may be maintained without the user successfully being authenticated as an entity having the authority to unlock the door 120 (e.g., the actuator 407 controlling the mechanical coupling 403 may retain the door body 124 within the door-frame channel 135 without the user being authenticated as an entity having the authority to unlock the door 120 (e.g., via any suitable authentication process and apparatus of the system 199), the spindle 484 may engage or otherwise lock the latch 486 to prevent the latch 486 from being able to disengage from the plate 490 of the door handle 122 to thereby retain the door body 124 within the door-frame channel 135 without the user being authenticated as an entity having the authority to unlock the door 120, etc.). Such a sealed state of the first door state 500A may be a state in which one, some, or each body-frame gap that may exist between the door body 124 and the door frame 130 may be sealed by any suitable sealing mechanism 409 (e.g., an actuator 407 controlling the sealing mechanism 409 may maintain such a sealing mechanism 409 in an activated state for blocking or otherwise sealing one, some, or each body-frame gap that may exist between the door body 124 and the door frame 130 (e.g., as part of the door-frame passage 135)).
The smart door may be configured to transition from a first door state in which the door may be closed, latched, locked, and sealed to a second door state in which the door may remain closed, latched, and locked, but may be unsealed. Such a transition from the sealed state to the unsealed state may be performed automatically by the intelligent system in response to detecting any suitable unseal or first triggering event (e.g., detecting any suitable user action that may indicate a potential intent of the user to pass through the intelligent door). As just one example, when the smart environment detects that any suitable user (e.g., pet, visitor, occupant, etc.) is within a threshold distance of the smart door (e.g., within a threshold distance TDE from an outer side 124e of the door position PD of the door 120 and/or within a threshold distance TDI from an inner side 124i of the door position PD of the door 120, which may be the same or different distances) in a default or secure and sealed environment state, and/or otherwise detects that any suitable user is approaching the smart door, system 199 may be configured to transition to a secure but unsealed or second environment state, and system 199 may be configured to control the smart door such that the smart door may transition to a secure but unsealed or second door state in which the door is closed, latched, and locked but unsealed. For example, any suitable sensor of the door 120 or system 199 (e.g., radar sensor 428 of the smart door 120, camera sensor 428 of the smart door 120, a motion sensor or infrared sensor (e.g., passive or active), or other suitable sensor 428 of the smart door 120) may detect any suitable data that may indicate the proximity of such a user as a potential trigger event (e.g., any suitable pass-through recognition technology (e.g., facial recognition, RFID, ultrasonic sensors) may be used to detect such potential trigger event data). As another example, the transition may occur in response to detecting any user action that may indicate any likelihood that the door is opened in the near future (e.g., detecting that the user interacts with a user interface button of the doorbell 106 that may be different from the door 120 (e.g., presses, attempts to ring to contact an occupant, etc.) and/or interacts with a user interface button of the doorbell 106 of the door 120 or any other user interface 412 of the door 120 or system 199). As another example, the conversion may occur in response to detecting any user action that may indicate any likelihood that the user will approach the door in the near future (e.g., detecting that the user enters the space protected by the door (e.g., the user enters the room 152 via another door of the room 152 (e.g., a garage door for an automobile opening where the smart door to be converted is a door leading from the garage to the user's kitchen))). Such a state may be illustrated by the second door state 500B of fig. 5B, where the smart door 120 of the smart environment 100 may be in a closed state, a latched state, and a locked state, but in an unsealed state (e.g., a state that may be transitioned to when a user UE in an ambient environment AE is detected to be within a threshold distance TDE of an outer side 124E of the door position PD of the door 120 (e.g., in response to the user UE moving in the direction of arrow E1 from the user position P1 of fig. 5A to the user position P2 of fig. 5B)). This closed state of the second door state 500B may be the same as the closed state of the first door state 500A, this latched state of the second door state 500B may be the same as the latched state of the first door state 500A, and this locked state of the second door state 500B may be the same as the locked state of the first door state 500A. However, as shown, such an unsealed state of second door state 500B may be different than the sealed state of first door state 500A, as such an unsealed state of second door state 500B may be a state in which one, some, or each body-frame gap that may exist between door body 124 and door frame 130 may be unsealed by any suitable sealing mechanism 409 (e.g., an actuator 407 controlling sealing mechanism 409 may hold such sealing mechanism 409 in a deactivated state for unblocking or otherwise unsealing one, some, or each body-frame gap that may exist between door body 124 and door frame 130 (e.g., as part of door frame channel 135)). Specifically, as shown in fig. 5B, the first sealing mechanism 409u may be selectively controlled to unseal the upper body-frame gap 135gu, while the second sealing mechanism 409l may be selectively controlled to unseal the lower body-frame gap 135 gl. Thus, when the system detects any suitable trigger event data determined to satisfy any suitably defined trigger event requirements, the system 199 may be operable to predictively disengage or unlock or open or loosen or unseal or release any suitable sealing mechanism (e.g., predictive actuated unsealing of the front door in response to user access detected by the sensor may be enabled).
As can be seen from the differences between fig. 5A and 5B, any suitable mechanical and/or electrical and/or structural and/or other suitable portions of any suitable sealing mechanisms 409u and 409l or actuators thereof may be configured such that when such sealing mechanisms 409u and 409l are in the sealed state of fig. 5A, they may impede or prevent the removal of the door body 124 from the door-frame passage 135, but such that when such sealing mechanisms 409u and 409l are in the unsealed state of fig. 5B, they may not impede or not prevent, or at least less impede, the removal of the door body 124 from the door-frame passage 135. Thus, transitioning door 120 from a sealed state to an unsealed state may be a requirement or at least a preference or at least a faster and/or improved and/or better sub-process to enable door 120 to transition from a closed state to an open state. However, such unsealing alone may not enable the door 120 to transition from the closed state to the open state, as unlocking and/or unlatching may also be necessary for such closing to opening transitions in some embodiments. Thus, while the transition from the closed, latched, locked and sealed first door state 500A to the closed, latched, locked and unsealed second door state 500B may configure the door 120 in a closed state that may more easily transition to the open door state (e.g., which may require any suitable length of time or noise emissions, etc., since the unsealing transition has occurred), such a transition from the closed, latched, locked and sealed first door state 500A to the closed, latched, locked and unsealed second door state 500B may still maintain the security of the door, as the door may not be opened without first being unlocked and/or unlatched. Thus, the system 199 may be configured to transition between the first door state 500A and the second door state 500B in response to detecting any suitable triggering event (e.g., a decapsulation or first triggering event) that may be used by the system 199 to predict a potential need to open the door, but that may not itself be used by the system 199 to authenticate authorization of the user to unlock the door. Such triggering events may enable system 199 to safely adjust the state of a door through preemptive unsealing so that the door may open sooner in the future while still maintaining the security of the door.
The smart door may be configured to transition from a second door state in which the door may be closed, latched, locked, and unlatched to a third door state in which the door may remain unlatched and closed, and optionally latched, but may be unlocked. Such a transition from the locked state to the unlocked state may be performed automatically by the intelligent system in response to detecting any suitable unlocking or second triggering event (e.g., detecting any suitable user action that may indicate the user's authority to pass through the intelligent door). As just one example, when a smart environment in a secure and unsealed but closed environment state detects an authorized user (e.g., a pet, visitor, occupant, etc.) who has permission to pass through the smart door (e.g., by authenticating the user with any suitable relationship to the door (e.g., within any suitable distance of the door) in any suitable manner), then the system 199 may be configured to transition to an unprotected and unsealed but closed state or a third environment state, and the system 199 may be configured to control the smart door such that the smart door may transition to an unprotected and unsealed but closed state or a third door state in which the door is closed but unlocked and unsealed (and optionally unlatched or still latched). Various different types of sensors may be used to determine a user's authority to pass through a door frame channel (e.g., authority to authenticate a user to unlock a locked door), such as a camera with artificial intelligence trained facial recognition functionality, an RFID detection sensor, an NFC detection sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a voice recognition sensor, any suitable user biometric recognition sensor, and the like, for authenticating the authorization of a particular user or authenticating the authorization of a particular type of user, and the like. This unprotected and unsealed but closed state or third environmental state may be illustrated by the third door state 500C of fig. 5C, where the smart door 120 of the smart environment 100 may be in a closed state, a latched state or unlatched state, an unsealed state, but unlocked state (e.g., a state to which a user UE in an ambient environment AE may transition when detected as a user authorized to enter the room 152 from the ambient environment AE through the door 120). This closed state of third gate state 500C may be the same as the closed state of first gate state 500A and second gate state 500B, and this unsealed state of third gate state 500C may be the same as the unsealed state of second gate state 500B. However, as shown, such an unlocked state of the third door state 500C may be different than the locked state of the second door state 500B, as such an unlocked state of the third door state 500C may be a state in which the latch feature 490f of the latch 486 may be disengaged from the door frame 130 (e.g., the actuator 407 controlling the door handle 122 may retract the feature 490f into the door body 124 for unlocking the door body 124 from the frame 130). Alternatively, this unlocked state of the third door state 500C may differ from the locked state of the second door state 500B in any other suitable manner such that the door body 124 may be unlocked from the door frame 130 (e.g., the actuator 407 controlling the mechanical coupler 403 may not move the door body 124 out of the door frame channel 135, but may switch from requiring the door body 124 to remain within the door frame channel 135 to holding the door body 124 such that any manual user interaction with the door body 124 may move the door body 124 out of the door frame channel 135 (e.g., the locking or latching feature of the door body may not be disengaged from the door frame to mechanically disengage the door body and door frame in any manner, but the mechanical coupler 403 and/or its actuator 407 may be adjusted to enable a user to manually move the door body relative to the door frame, rather than preventing a user from manually moving the door body relative to the door frame)).
As can be seen from the differences between fig. 5B and 5C, the locking feature (e.g., feature 529f of the door handle 122 or mechanical coupler 403 or actuator thereof, or other feature) may be configured to lock the door body 124 in its locked state of fig. 5B, but may be configured to unlock the door body 124 to transition the door 120 to its unlocked state of fig. 5C while still maintaining the door body 124 in its closed state. Thus, transitioning door 120 from an unsealed but locked and closed state to an unsealed but unlocked but still closed state may be a requirement or at least a preference or at least a faster and/or improved and/or better sub-process for enabling door 120 to transition from a closed state to an open state. However, such unlocking in conjunction with a separate unsealing state may not enable the door 120 to transition from the closed state to the open state, as unlatching and/or otherwise actively opening the door may also be necessary for such closing to opening transition. Thus, while a transition from the unsealed but locked closed second door state 500B to the unsealed but unlocked but still closed third door state 500C may configure the door 120 in a closed state that may more easily transition to the open door state (e.g., which may require any suitable length of time or noise emission, etc., since an unlocked transition has occurred), such a transition from the unsealed but locked closed second door state 500B to the unsealed but unlocked but still closed third door state 500C may still keep the door somewhat secure or unobtrusive because it has not yet been opened. Accordingly, the system 199 may be configured to transition between the second door state 500B and the third door state 500C in response to detecting any suitable triggering event (e.g., an unlock or second triggering event) that may be used by the system 199 to further predict a potential need to open the door, but the system 199 itself may not be used to actually open the door. Such a triggering event may enable the system to safely adjust the state of the door by preemptive unlocking (e.g., with or without any preemptive unlatching, which may also occur in any suitable manner during this or a subsequent transition) so that the door may open sooner in the future while still maintaining some security or unobtrusiveness of the door.
The system may be configured to automatically transition from the second door state 500B to the third door state 500C in response to detecting any suitable triggering event (e.g., any suitable unlocking or second triggering event). Although fig. 5C shows that the user UE has moved in the direction of arrow E1 from position P2 to position P3 closer to the door 120, the detection of such movement may or may not be a triggering event for a transition from the second door state 500B to the third door state 500C. Rather, any suitable event that may be capable of operating a UE for authenticating a user's authority to pass through the door 120 may be used to initiate such a transition (e.g., the user or the user's device transmitting any suitable password to any suitable other device of the system 199, any suitable device of the system 199 detecting any suitable authentication biometric of the user, any suitable key fob or touch unlock interaction, etc.), which may be more convenient and/or less cumbersome than requiring the user to remove a set of keys and manually insert the keys into a key hole to unlock the door. Alternatively, system 199 may be configured to automatically transition from the second door state 500B of fig. 5B back to the first door state 500A of fig. 5A in response to detecting any suitable reseal trigger event (e.g., by resealing door 120) including, but not limited to, detecting that the user UE moved from door 120 beyond a threshold distance TDE (e.g., when the user UE moved from location P2 back to location P1 in the direction of arrow EX); any other suitable detection of the user's intent not to pass the door 120 (e.g., detecting the user UE sitting at location P2); any suitable threshold duration of time that has elapsed after the transition to the second gate state 500B is detected without first detecting any suitable unlock or second triggering events that might otherwise cause a transition from the second gate state 500B of fig. 5B to the third gate state 500C of fig. 5C.
The smart door may be configured to transition from a third door state in which the door may be closed but unlocked and unsealed to a fourth door state in which the door may remain unsealed and unlocked but may be opened. Such a transition from the closed state to the open state may be performed automatically by the intelligent system in response to detecting any suitable opening or third triggering event (e.g., detecting any suitable user action that may indicate the user's intent to pass through the intelligent door soon or immediately). As just one example, when the smart environment in the unlocked and unsealed but closed environmental state detects that a previously authorized user (e.g., a pet, visitor, occupant, etc.) has made any suitable action that may be interpreted as an immediate intent to pass through the smart door (e.g., by detecting in any suitable manner that the previously authorized user has moved closer to the door or taking any other gesture associated with opening the door (e.g., nodding or shouting "open", etc.)), then the system 199 may be configured to transition to the unprotected, unsealed and open state or the fourth environmental state, and the system 199 may be configured to control the smart door such that the smart door may transition to the unprotected and unsealed and open state or the fourth door state in which the door is unsealed and unlocked and open (e.g., open to any suitable degree with respect to the door frame 130 and in any suitable direction with respect to the user (e.g., open in any suitable direction with respect to the smart door frame 130) Open towards the user or open away from the user)). Such a state may be illustrated by the fourth door state 500D of fig. 5D, where the smart door 120 of the smart environment 100 may be in an unsealed state, an unlocked state, an unlatched state, and an opened state (e.g., a state to which a user UE in the ambient environment AE may transition when detected as not only being authorized to pass through the door 120, but is now also intended to be about to enter the room 152 from the ambient environment AE through the door 120). This unlocked state of the fourth door state 500D may be the same as the unlocked state of the third door state 500C, this unlocked state of the fourth door state 500D may be the same as the first and second door states 500A and 500B and the unlocked state of the third door state 500C, and this unlocked state of the fourth door state 500D may be the same as the unlocked state of the third door state 500C (if applicable), or may be a new unlocked state that occurs simultaneously with the transition to the open state. However, as shown, such an open state of the fourth door state 500D may be different than the closed state of the third door state 500C, as such an open state of the fourth door state 500D may be a state in which at least a portion of the door body 124 previously within the door-frame channel 135 may be removed from the door-frame channel 135 (e.g., the actuator 407 controlling the door handle 122 may disengage the latching feature 490f to unlatch the door body 124 from the frame 130, and the door 120 may be configured such that the mechanical coupling 403 may automatically allow the door body 124 to be removed from the door-frame channel 135 (e.g., due to gravity or other natural forces that may automatically affect the door body 124 moving in this manner), and/or the actuator 407 controlling the mechanical coupling 403 may automatically remove the door body 124 from within the door-frame channel 135). The system 199 may be configured to move the door body 124 out of the door frame channel in any suitable direction (e.g., toward the user or away from the user (e.g., toward the user UE in the ambient environment AE when the system 199 detects that an occupant is standing near the inner surface 124i of the door 120, or detects that the system user prefers or prefers the door to open outward (e.g., in response to detecting a gesture of the user UE leaving the room 152), or toward the user UE in too close proximity to the outer surface 124e of the door 120, or detects that the system user prefers or prefers the door to open inward (e.g., in response to detecting a gesture of the user UE toward the room 152), or away from the user UE and into the room 152)))). Additionally or alternatively, the system 199 may be configured to move the door body 124 out of the door-frame channel by any suitable amount (e.g., a limited first amount (e.g., 15% or any other suitable amount (e.g., angle θ 1 of fig. 6A)), based on detected authorization limitations of the user (e.g., if the user is only granted limited access through the door-frame channel 135 (e.g., only the amount that the user may pass packages being delivered from the ambient environment AE to the room 152 through the channel 135)) and/or based on any other suitable condition that the system 199 may detect (e.g., the user may be detected as having full access, but also having the ability to further manually open the door as he or she deems appropriate, such that the door may be automatically opened only minimally to reduce unnecessary airflow through the channel, until the user manually opens the door further (if desired)); or a second, greater or full amount (e.g., 100% or any other suitable amount (e.g., angle θ 2 of fig. 6A)) based on a detected full authorization of the user (e.g., if the user is allowed unfettered access through the door-frame doorway 135) and/or based on any other suitable condition that may be detected by the system 199 (e.g., the user may be detected as having full access, but also not having the ability to further manually open the door when he or she deems appropriate (e.g., due to holding an infant) so that the door may be fully opened or fully automatically opened so that the user can easily access through the doorway without any manual user interaction)). In some embodiments, the system 199 may be configured to automatically adjust the amount that any component of the door 120 extends from the surface of the door body 124 when the door body 124 is moved a particular amount from the door-frame passage 135. For example, as shown in fig. 6A, as the door body 124 is moved further out of the passage 135 (e.g., from angle θ 1 to angle θ 2 (e.g., as may be detected by any suitable sensor of the system)), at least a portion or all of the handle portion 481 and/or the handle portion 489 of the door handle 120 may be automatically retracted into the door body 124 (e.g., in the direction of respective arrows I and N), for example, to prevent the handle portion 481 from striking the user UE or damaging another portion of the environment (e.g., striking and forming a hole or indentation in an adjacent wall of the environment (e.g., as may be detected by any suitable sensor of the system)) and/or to prevent the handle portion 489 from hooking an accessory of the user UE when the user passes through the door body 124 (e.g., to prevent the user's clothing or jewelry or the like from hooking the handle portion 489 (e.g., as may be detected by any suitable sensor of the, and when the door body 124 moves back toward the passage 135 (e.g., from angle θ 2 to angle θ 1 or back to a closed position (e.g., as may be detected by any suitable sensor of the system)), at least a portion or all of the handle portion 481 and/or the handle portion 489 of the door handle 120 may automatically extend out from the door body 124 (e.g., in the direction of the respective arrows O and X), e.g., to enable the handle portion 481 and/or the handle portion 489 to be manually interacted with by a user. Additionally or alternatively, the hook or other suitable structural attachment 487 can be configured to automatically extend from a surface of the smart door (e.g., from the inner side 124i of the door body 124 (e.g., in the direction of arrow H)), such as when the door has been closed or nearly closed, so as to enable the extended hook 487 to be used by a user to hang a handbag or jacket or other item thereon (e.g., when such item can be detected as being held or worn by a user passing through the closing or closed door). In some embodiments, handles 481 and 489 may be positioned at different heights along their respective sides of the door, which may account for curves on the outside and no curves on the inside, which may affect the relationship of the user's height to the height of the handle, depending on the side of the door where the user is positioned, and if the curves are only on one side of the door, positioning the handles at different heights at different sides of the door may allow for a more constant user-handle relationship.
As can be seen from the differences between fig. 5C and 5D, any suitable door body position adjustment feature (e.g., mechanical coupling 403 and/or actuator 407 or otherwise) may be configured to not allow the door body 124 to be manually moved by a user from the closed state of fig. 5C to any selected open position, but may be configured to move the door body 124 in any suitable direction and in any suitable amount to transition the door 120 to its open state of fig. 5D while still maintaining some security on the door 120 (e.g., by preventing the door body 124 from moving too far apart or moving back toward closed to prevent any injury or other undesirable conditions (e.g., by preventing the door from closing unless a user or other foreign object is not detected in the path of the door, and/or by preventing the door from opening further to limit the ingress of certain users (e.g., package deliverers) and/or to limit certain other elements (e.g., cold air) Noise, etc.). Thus, transitioning door 120 from the unsealed and unlocked but closed state to the unsealed and unlocked and open state may be a requirement or at least a preference or at least a faster and/or improved and/or better process for enabling door 120 to allow passage of certain channels therethrough. However, while the transition from the unsealed and unlocked but closed third gate state 500C to the unsealed and unlocked and opened fourth gate state 500D may configure the gate 120 in an open state for enabling certain passages therethrough, such transition from the unsealed and unlocked but closed third gate state 500C to the unsealed and unlocked and opened fourth gate state 500D may still keep the gate somewhat secure or unobtrusive, even in the open state. Thus, the system 199 may be configured to transition between the third door state 500C and the fourth door state 500D in response to detecting any suitable triggering event (e.g., any suitable opening or third triggering event) that may be used by the system 199 to further address the need to explicitly open the door, but which itself is not entirely determined by how much and for how long the door may remain open. Such a triggering event may enable the system to safely adjust the state of the door by opening automatically, at least to some extent (e.g., full or limited opening or minimal springing open (e.g., by a mechanical spring coupled to a mechanical coupling)), so that the door may be more easily manipulated by a user while still maintaining some security or unobtrusiveness of the door. In some embodiments, any suitable electromagnetic mechanism may be used to purposefully move the door hinges out of alignment just enough to allow the door to open or close itself (e.g., using gravity). Once completed, the hinge may automatically realign. Alternatively, unlatching without opening may be performed such that a user need only manually contact (e.g., lean or kick or pull or tap, etc.) or otherwise interact with any suitable component of door body 124 (e.g., user interface 412) or any other suitable user interface of the system for unlatching or unlatching the unlatched door body from the door-frame channel (e.g., any suitable user interface 412 may be provided by door 120 for detecting any suitable user gesture that may be detected and analyzed by system 199 to automatically control door 120 unlatching and/or opening by any suitable amount). For example, the external user interface 412e may be provided along the bottom of the door body 124 or frame 130 or along any other suitable portion of the system as a kickboard that may detect any suitable kicking gesture (or hand or foot waving gesture, etc.) of the user that may be analyzed by the system for automatically controlling the unlatching of the door body 124 from the door frame 130 and/or the removal of at least a portion of the unlatched or unlatched door body 124 from the door frame channel 135.
The system may be configured to automatically transition from the third door state 500C to the fourth door state 500D in response to detecting any suitable triggering event. Although fig. 5D shows that the user UE has moved in the direction of arrow E1 from position P3 to position P4 closer to the door 120 (e.g., moved within a shorter distance from the smart door than from TDE), the detection of such movement may or may not be a triggering event for transitioning from the third door state 500C to the fourth door state 500D. Rather, any suitable event that may be operable to determine the user UE's imminent intent to pass through the door 120 may be used to initiate such a transition (e.g., the user communicating any suitable intent, by sound or by any suitable gesture or other means that may be detected by any suitable device of the system, etc.). Alternatively, system 199 may be configured to: automatically transitioning from the third door state 500C back to the second door state 500B (e.g., by re-locking the door 120) in response to detecting any suitable triggering event (e.g., detecting that the user UE is moving away from the door 120 (e.g., when the user UE is moving back from the position P3 to the position P2 in the direction of arrow EX) and/or any other suitable detection of the user's intent not to pass through the door 120 (e.g., detecting that the user UE is sitting at position 3)); and/or return to the first door state 500A (e.g., by re-locking and re-sealing the door 120) in response to detecting any suitable triggering event (e.g., detecting that the user UE is moving from the door 120 beyond the threshold distance TDE (e.g., when the user UE is moving from the position P3 back to the position P1 in the direction of arrow EX) and/or any other suitable detection for the user UE that the user UE does not want to pass through the door 120 (e.g., detecting that the user UE is sitting at the position P2 or other location). Alternatively, the system 199 may be configured to automatically transition from the fourth door state 500D (e.g., a state in which the door may be opened in any suitable amount in any suitable direction, or a state in which the door may be closed but unlatched) to the fifth door state 500E of fig. 5E in response to detecting any suitable triggering event, which may be similar to the third door state 500C (e.g., by closing (and possibly also latching) the door 120), or may be similar to the second door state 500B (e.g., by closing (and possibly also latching) and locking the door 120), or may be similar to the first door state 500A (e.g., by closing (and possibly also latching) and locking and sealing the door 120). For example, detection of any suitable triggering event may be used by system 199 to automatically transition door 120 from fourth door state 500D to fifth door state 500E, such as detection of user UE moving through door-frame passage 135 into room 152, and exceeding any suitable threshold TDI from position PD of door 120 (e.g., when user UE moves from position P4 to position P5 in the direction of arrow E1) and/or any other suitable detection of a user's intent not to return through door 120 (e.g., detection of user UE conveying such intent verbally or by any suitable gesture) and/or detection of any safe closing condition (e.g., detection of no user's finger or other portion within or near passage 135 or within any portion of the closing path of door body 124), and/or the like. It should be noted that the system 199 may be configured to prevent the door body 124 from moving toward the aisle 135 in order to at least partially or fully close the door 120 when any or at least certain types of elements are detected within the aisle 135 or within a certain threshold distance of the aisle 135 to protect those elements (e.g., children, pets, etc.) from being potentially damaged by the closing of the door 120 (e.g., using any suitable detection capabilities of the system 199 (e.g., door 120 or otherwise)). The system may be configured to automatically present any suitable feedback to the user in response to any suitable door state transition action, so as to alert the user to such a transition. For example, instead of the user turning around and interacting with the door to confirm whether the door has been fully closed and/or re-latched and/or re-locked (e.g., by attempting to turn the handle portion 489 of the door handle 122 and/or by pushing the door body 124 to attempt to re-open the door), the system 199 may automatically present a close confirmation in response to closing the door 120 (e.g., a first audible and/or visual and/or tactile output generated via the door 120 or any output component of the system 199, which may be easily detected by the user, such that the user does not have to worry that the door is not closed), and/or the system 199 may automatically present a latch confirmation in response to latching the door 120 (e.g., a second audible and/or visual and/or tactile output generated via the door 120 or any output component of the system 199, which may be easily detected by the user, so that the user does not have to worry about the door not being latched), and/or system 199 may automatically present a lock confirmation in response to locking door 120 (e.g., a third audible and/or visual and/or tactile output generated via door 120 or any output component of system 199, which may be easily detected by the user so that the user does not have to worry about the door not being locked), so that the user may continue in the direction of arrow E1 without worrying about whether the door has been re-secured in one or more ways.
The smart door may be provided with any suitable mechanical coupling and any suitable actuator thereof such that the system may intelligently and automatically control the direction and/or amount that the door body may move relative to the door frame channel in response to any suitable detection of any suitable triggering event. For example, once the door body 124 is initially opened in any suitable direction by any suitable amount (e.g., once the door 120 transitions to the initial open door state 500D), the manner in which a user may manually interact with the door body 124 to further open or close the door 120 may be limited by any suitable mechanical and/or electrical controller of the system 199. As just one example, the system 199 may be configured to prevent the door body 124 from being manually (or wind or otherwise) moved by a user toward the aisle 135 to at least partially or fully close the door 120 when any or at least certain types of elements are detected within the aisle 135 or within a certain threshold distance of the aisle 135 to protect such elements from being potentially damaged by the closing of the door 120 (e.g., using any suitable detection capabilities of the system 199 (e.g., door 120 or otherwise)). As another example, the system 199 may be configured to prevent the door body 124 from being manually (or by wind or otherwise) removed from the channel 135 by the user to at least further or fully open the door 120 when any or at least certain types of elements are detected within the path of such potential movement and/or when certain restrictions may be defined for any user being authenticated during the transition of the door from the locked state to the unlocked state (e.g., restricting the opening range of the door so that the user may pass packages through the door rather than entering through the door himself or herself) to protect such elements from potential damage by such movement of the door 120. Thus, regardless of how far (e.g., angle θ 1) and in what direction the door may be initially opened automatically, the system 199 may achieve a maximum opening (e.g., angle θ 2) at which the user may manually further open the door (e.g., using the mechanical coupling 403 and/or any suitable one-way movement enabling mechanism of its actuator 407).
The smart door may include two or more different door body portions, such as an upper door body portion 124u and a lower door body portion 124l, which may be operable to move independently of each other to open the door through different configurations. For example, as shown in fig. 6B, only the upper door body portion 124u may be opened (e.g., by the upper mechanical coupling 403u and/or an actuator thereof), while the lower door body portion 124l may remain closed, if not also locked and/or latched and/or sealed (e.g., by the lower door handle 122l having a lower latch and/or locking feature 486fl for engaging a lower portion of the door frame 130), wherein an intermediate locking mechanism 122m may be provided for selective control by the system 199 to latch/lock and unlatch/unlock the different door body portions from one another. In such a configuration, which may be referred to herein as a two-way valve embodiment, each door body portion may be independently controlled by the system for selectively sealing, latching, locking, and opening each door body portion independently of the other door body portions (e.g., at least a first actuator 407u and at least a first mechanical coupling 403u may control movement of a first door body portion 124u, while at least a second actuator 407l and at least a second mechanical coupling 403l may independently control movement of a second door body portion 124 l). As just one example, if the user determined to be about to pass is a pet, only the second (e.g., lower) door body portion may be opened. As another example only, if the user determined to be about to pass is a pet, only the second (e.g., lower) door body portion may be opened, while if the user determined to be about to pass is a package of the deliverer and not the deliverer himself, only the first (e.g., upper) door body portion may be opened (e.g., as shown in fig. 6B) (e.g., to prevent the deliverer and/or any pet (e.g., dog) from passing through the door frame access, while still allowing the deliverer to drop the package into the room 52 through the door frame access). As another example only, different portions may open simultaneously in different directions and/or in different amounts for various reasons, such as controlling airflow through the door frame channel in one or more particular ways.
Any suitable threshold (e.g., threshold TDE or threshold TDI, etc.) that may be used to define any suitable triggering event for transitioning between any two suitable door states and/or any other suitable defined characteristic (e.g., amount, direction, and/or speed of door opening) of one or more such triggering events and/or one or more such door state transition actions may vary based on the detection of activity or characteristics occurring in the environment. More specifically, sensors including network-enabled smart devices and rule-based reasoning engines or artificial intelligence techniques provided by the central server and cloud computer system 164 or otherwise (e.g., by the smart door itself) may be used to change thresholds and/or trigger event definitions and/or door state transition actions based on any suitable detected activity. Inferences about occupant activity or other aspects can be learned based on data received over time and used to adjust how the system 199 can define or detect triggering events and/or define and/or perform door state transition actions. For example, if any suitable smart device located in the kitchen (e.g., smart hazard detector 104 or smart door 120) observes an increase in temperature, humidity, and motion in the kitchen, it may be inferred that one or more occupants are cooking (e.g., "cook inference"). These data inputs may be considered on a sliding scale based on the time of day and day of the week. For example, at 5:00 pm on a weekday (which history may show that this is the time that occupants are cooking normally), only a slight increase in temperature and humidity may trigger a cooking inference. However, at 10:00 a.m. on weekdays (where occupants are not typically at home), a greater increase may be needed to trigger a cooking inference. In some embodiments, the smoke alarm threshold (e.g., a threshold at which the door body portion may open to increase air flow) may change when a cooking inference is made. For example, when one of the occupants is cooking (e.g., when a cooking inference has been made), the smart doors 120 in the kitchen may become less sensitive while the smart doors in the other rooms may remain operating normally. As another example, the amount the door can be opened and/or the direction the door can be opened and/or the speed at which the door can be opened can be determined, at least in part, by one or more inferences made by system 199 (e.g., regarding a particular user approaching the door, regarding weather or other environmental characteristics of one or both spaces protected by the door, etc.). For example, the smart door 120 may automatically open a smaller amount when the difference between the respective temperatures of the two spaces protected by the door is larger. As another example, the smart door 120 may automatically open to an initial amount that has previously been observed as an average or maximum or minimum amount previously needed or previously used by a user currently approaching the door.
Thus, the system may utilize any suitable sensor in the smart door or other sensor available to the smart environment in order to predictively disengage the sealing mechanism used to maintain a relatively air-tight seal or a water-tight seal or air-tight seal or the like between the door body and the door frame. Various different types of sensors may be used to detect the proximity or initial potential intent of the user, such as radar, cameras with artificial intelligence trained face recognition functionality, passive/active infrared sensors, and the like. Due to the predictive disengagement of the sealing mechanism, the user may not have to wait for the sealing mechanism to complete its unlocking cycle to open the door once it is about to pass through the door, and may open the door at will and unimpeded by the mechanical limitations of the sealing mechanism. In an exemplary use case, when one or more sensors (e.g., integrated within or otherwise associated with the door) sense the presence of a user wishing to open the door, the door and/or one or more processors of the system may more generally instruct the sealing mechanism to unseal, such that when the user later attempts to open the door or pass through the door, he or she does not have to wait for the sealing mechanism to complete its unseal cycle. In another embodiment, the door may preemptively unseal the mechanical seal in response to a doorbell or garage door opening event. Advantageously, because any "accidental" unsealing of a door may not be a security threat (e.g., because the door itself remains locked until unlocked by a suitable security mechanism), a high degree of scrutiny in determining predictive unsealing of the door may not be required. Thus, even a relatively limited sensor (e.g. a passive infrared sensor) may be used to detect an approaching user and trigger the unsealing process, and if later proved to be a lawyer without authorization to pass through the door in any way, the system may be configured to reseal the door only after a short time without any possible security breach. Thus, the system may be configured to enable any suitable stage-related functionality of the smart door upon detecting the user's approach or initial potential intent to pass through the door. Various stages of user proximity detection and/or various stages of user detection via door intent and/or various stages of user detection via door authorization and/or various stages of user system interaction detection may be used to trigger different state transitions of the smart door (e.g., unseal after detecting a first stage, unlock after detecting a different second stage, unlatch and/or open after detecting a third stage, etc.). For example, a relatively slow-acting service function (e.g., decapsulation) may be triggered in response to a first detection phase, while an additional service function (e.g., unlocking) may be triggered in response to a second detection phase following the first detection phase, and an additional service function (e.g., open) may be triggered in response to a third detection phase following the second detection phase. Thus, predictive decapsulation or prediction of any other suitable service function may address certain speed or latency issues that may exist when attempting to transition directly from a first gate state to a fourth gate state in response to a particular triggering event.
The system may detect and address certain emergency situations with various sensors provided by the smart door and/or various actuators and couplings operable to automatically control the opening and closing of the smart door. For example, when an occupant must deal with a potential intruder attempting to pass through a door, the occupant often has little time to call the authorities for help or to catch an object that may be helpful in defending against the threat. Rather, system 199 may be configured to utilize detection of one or more suitable emergency trigger events in order to automatically initiate one or more suitable emergency response actions. Any suitable emergency trigger event may be detected by the smart door 120 or any suitable sensor of the system 199 so that the system 199 determines that an emergency situation exists and that one or more emergency response actions should be automatically performed. Such emergency triggering events may include, but are not limited to, any violent door action that may be detected by any suitable sensor (e.g., a detected violent movement of the door body 124 relative to the frame 130 and/or a detected violent movement of the door 120 relative to the wall 154 through which the door 120 passes (e.g., a door opening versus door closing fight or a large vibration of the door 120 (e.g., may be detected by any suitable motion sensor or other sensor of the sensors 428))), any suitable violent user action that may be detected by any suitable sensor (e.g., a violent screaming sound (e.g., may be detected by any suitable audio sensor or other sensor of the sensors 428)), any suitable safe user action that may be detected by any suitable sensor (e.g., the user uttering one or more predefined "safe words" (e.g., detected by any suitable audio sensor or other sensor of sensor 428 of door 120) and/or a user pressing an emergency button (e.g., any suitable button or UI 412 of door 120 or other portion), etc. The system may be configured to automatically perform any suitable emergency response actions in response to detecting one or more particular emergency trigger events. Such emergency response actions may include, but are not limited to, automatically closing a currently open door (e.g., using any suitable actuator 407 and/or mechanical coupler 403 of door 120 that may be operable to overcome any object or force that may attempt or otherwise operate to hold the door open), automatically opening a currently closed door (e.g., using any suitable actuator 407 and/or mechanical coupler 403 of door 120 that may be operable to overcome any object or force that may attempt or otherwise operate to hold the door closed), automatically locking a currently unlocked door (e.g., using any suitable actuator 407 and/or locking mechanism of door 120 (e.g., door handle 122), automatically unlocking a currently locked door (e.g., any suitable actuator 407 and/or locking mechanism (e.g., door handle 122) of the door 120 is used, which may be operable to overcome any object or force that may attempt or otherwise operate to keep the door locked, etc.
The smart door 120 may include one or more sensing components that may be operable to measure one or more characteristics to determine the quality of the air or any other similar detectable entity of one or both spaces (e.g., of the ambient environment AE and/or the room 152) protected by the smart door. For example, the one or more external sensors 428e that may be at least partially exposed by the exterior side 124e of the door body 124 of the smart door 120 may be similar to any suitable sensing component of the hazard detector device 104 positioned within the structure 150 (e.g., within the room 152) or elsewhere, but used to measure air quality and/or detect harmful Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and/or strong harmful gases, particles, dust, pollen, mold, etc. of the ambient environment AE (e.g., at least when the door 120 is closed). Such outside environment data sensed by smart door 120 or any other suitable smart device or by any other data source of platform 200 (e.g., third party air quality enterprise 228) may be used by system 199 (e.g., by platform 200) in conjunction with any other suitable data to adjust platform functionality (e.g., functionality of smart devices of environment 100 or for reporting to any suitable entity for analysis). For example, the system 199 (e.g., the system 164 or any suitable processing component local to the environment 100) may compare the air purity detected within a particular region or entirety of the structure 150 (e.g., the air purity that may be detected by one or more hazard detector devices 104 and/or one or more internal sensors 428i that may be at least partially exposed by the interior side 124i of the door body 124 of the smart door 120 (e.g., at least when the door 120 is closed)) with the air purity detected outside of the structure 150 (e.g., the air purity that may be sensed by the smart door 120 or other portions) to control the functionality of the smart devices of the system. As a particular example, if the outside air is determined to be cleaner than the inside air, the system 199 may be operable to instruct the smart door 120 and/or one or more smart thermostat devices 102 to open one or more vents 457 and/or one or more sub-doors 452 (e.g., of the door HVAC system 456) and/or one or more sealing mechanisms 409 of the smart door 120 to allow fresh air to enter the structure 150 through the door passage 135 and/or to open one or more vents of the HVAC system 103 to allow fresh air to otherwise enter the structure 150, otherwise the system 199 may be operable to instruct the smart door 120 and/or one or more smart thermostat devices 102 to recirculate air within the structure 150 and not draw in outside air. Additionally or alternatively, as another particular example, the system 199 may be a smart device operable to send detailed information about the air quality inside and outside the structure 150 to the personal device user device 166 or other suitable smart device of the user, which may help the user identify which pollen or other air impurities may be the chief culprit for any allergies the user may experience. As one other example, the system 199 may be operable to send a warning to a system user (e.g., to catch a child attempting to steal smoking outside the front door 120) when cigarette smoke is detected by any suitable external sensor. As another example, system 199 may be operable to aggregate air quality data received from multiple environments in different geographic locations or other suitable groupings, and provide, for example, smoke alerts, pollen alerts, etc. of these groupings to any suitable entity (e.g., weather reporting business entity 228). As another example, the system 199 may be operable to compare detected external and/or internal air quality of different areas of the environment 100 (e.g., different rooms and/or spaces protected by the same door or different doors) to one another at a particular time or historically (e.g., by time of day, day of week, season of year, etc.) to identify certain areas where there may be problems to be solved (e.g., corner rooms of the structure 150 that are exposed to significantly more pollen during the spring than other portions of the environment 100 and that may benefit from additional filtering or inspection of animals and plants near the area at the time). As another example, system 199 may be operable to compare detected external and/or internal air quality of environment 100 to other smart environments. Any one or more such comparisons or aggregations of data regarding the air quality of one or more interior or exterior regions of environment 100 may be stored for and/or shared with certain entities, such as potential purchasers of environment 100 (e.g., at real estate business entity 228), for determining whether such quality of environment 100 is appropriate. Additionally or alternatively, any other weather phenomena or characteristics of air quality (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind level (e.g., intensity/speed of air movement), wind direction (e.g., direction of air movement), etc.) may be detected and utilized in any other suitable manner at (e.g., by any sensing component of one or more smart doors 120) environment 100 (e.g., inside and/or around structure 150). For example, the outside humidity and temperature data of the ambient environment and/or one or more particular rooms may be compared or considered by the system 199 when controlling any suitable HVAC functions (e.g., of the one or more smart doors 120 and/or the one or more HVAC systems 103) to best achieve the comfort preferences of the occupant. Further, for example, the information may be presented to the occupants through a number of user interfaces (e.g., a user interface associated with another device located in the home, a television, a mobile device, and other computing devices) or audibly. In some cases, platform 200 (e.g., system 164) may collect such weather data from multiple smart environments across multiple geographic locations or other suitable groupings, and such aggregated weather data may be sold or otherwise provided to a weather service (e.g., any suitable business entity 228), or may be used to provide weather data to smart home occupants or potential purchasers.
The smart door 120 may include one or more sensing components that may be operable to measure one or more characteristics to determine noise of one or both spaces protected by the smart door (e.g., of the ambient environment AE and/or the room 152). For example, one or more external sensors 428e (e.g., microphones 444) that may be at least partially exposed by the exterior side 124e of the door body 124 of the smart door 120 may be located outside of the structure 150 for sensing any suitable noise outside of the structure 150 in the ambient environment AE (e.g., at least when the door 120 is closed). Such ambient noise data sensed by the smart gate 120 or any other suitable smart device or by any other data source of the platform 200 (e.g., third party noise detection enterprise 228) may be used by the platform 200 in conjunction with any other suitable data to adjust platform functionality (e.g., functionality of the smart devices of the environment 100 or for reporting to any suitable entity for analysis). For example, platform 200 (e.g., system 164 or any suitable processing component local to environment 100) may compare the noise level detected within a particular space of environment 100 protected by a smart door (e.g., as may be sensed by one or more sensors of the smart door) to the noise level of any other space of structure 150 (e.g., as may be sensed by the same or a different smart door of the system or any other smart device) to control the functionality of the smart devices of environment 100. As a particular example, if the noise level outside of the structure 150 in the ambient environment AE spikes significantly (e.g., due to a helicopter hovering overhead), the platform 200 may be operable to instruct the smart appliance 113 (e.g., a television) or the smart hazard detector device 104 or the smart door 120 or any other suitable smart device to increase its volume output level to overcome or otherwise compensate for additional ambient noise pollution (e.g., so that the system user may still hear important warnings or other messages from these smart devices). As another example, the platform 200 may be operable to analyze environmental noise detected at the ambient environment AE (e.g., by the smart door 120) to determine that streets adjacent to the structure 150 may satisfy a threshold level of traffic, wherein such determination may cause the platform 200 to make one or more inferences regarding the safety of any children currently occupying the environment 100 (e.g., children playing outside the structure 150 in the ambient environment AE). For example, where one or more child occupancy sensors detect that they are outside of the home during such a detected traffic event, platform 200 may be any suitable output component (e.g., speaker 436) operable to trigger any suitable alarm (e.g., at environment 100, such as with hazard detector 104 within structure 150 or interior surface 124i of smart door 120). Such an alert may enable a parent or other caretaker (e.g., a user within structure 150) at environment 100 to quickly take action to protect the child from detected traffic (of course, other suitable environment detectors, such as cameras and/or motion detectors, alone or in combination with such noise sensors may also enable platform 200 to facilitate such a safety feature). Additionally or alternatively, as another particular example, the platform 200 may be a smart device operable to send detailed information about noise levels inside and outside of the structure 150 to the personal device user device 166 or other suitable smart device of the user, which may help the user identify which areas of the environment may be experiencing more serious noise problems. As another example, platform 200 may be operable to aggregate noise data received from one or more spaces from each of a plurality of environments in different geographic locations or other suitable groupings, and provide noise pollution reports of these groupings, for example, to any suitable entity (e.g., law enforcement entity 222). As another example, the platform 200 may be operable to compare detected external and/or internal noise levels of different areas of the environment 100 (e.g., different rooms and/or spaces protected by the same door or different doors) to one another at particular times or historically (e.g., by time of day, day of week, season of year, etc.) to identify certain areas where there may be problems to be resolved (e.g., corner rooms of the structure 150 that are exposed to significantly more noise at certain times of day than other portions of the environment 100 and may benefit from additional sound insulation or noise filtering or other adjustments). As another example, platform 200 may be operable to compare detected external and/or noise levels of environment 100 with other intelligent environments. Any one or more such comparisons or aggregations of data regarding noise levels of one or more interior or exterior regions of the environment 100 may be stored for and/or shared with certain entities, such as potential purchasers of the environment 100 (e.g., at the real estate brokerage enterprise 228), for determining whether such qualities of the environment 100 are appropriate. Additionally or alternatively, any level of motion or other suitable activity may be detected at the environment 100 (e.g., inside and around the structure 150) (e.g., by any sensing component of the one or more smart doors 120) and used similarly to any of the noise levels described above (e.g., a combination of detected motion and noise levels may be used to detect traffic thresholds to enable the platform 200 to activate alerts for any children protecting the environment 100, or a level of motion may be detected to indicate strangers stepped on in the environment 100 to effect a potential theft or animals wandering in the backyard, etc.). Additionally or alternatively, any ambient light level or other suitable environmental condition may be detected at environment 100 (e.g., inside and around structure 150) (e.g., by any sensing component of one or more smart gates 120) and used similar to any noise level described above.
As described above (e.g., with respect to detected air quality), any suitable data indicative of any suitable characteristic or phenomenon inside and/or outside of the structure 150 (e.g., noise level, activity level, ambient light level, weather, etc.) that may be detected by any sensing component of the smart door 120 or any other suitable data source of the platform 200 may be analyzed in any suitable manner (e.g., with respect to any other suitable data) for utilization by the system in any suitable manner. As one particular example, any suitable detected environmental data of the structure 150 may be compared to any suitable internal data of the environment 100, or analyzed separately or with respect to any other suitable data for adjusting platform functionality, e.g., for adjusting the functionality of a smart device and/or for adjusting an enabled or to-be-enabled mode or mode setting (e.g., via the microphone sensing component 444 of the door 120) noise detected by the environment may be used to adjust a volume level of audio output by a smart device (e.g., from the smart hazard detector device 104 or any suitable controllable device, such as a stereo system) within the structure 150 for dynamically tuning such internal volume to overcome any environmental noise sources. Additionally or alternatively, as another particular example, the platform 200 may be a smart device operable to send detailed information regarding detected values of particular environmental conditions of the environment 100 to the personal device user device 166 or other suitable smart device of the user, which may help the user identify when and where certain noises emanate. As another example, platform 200 may be operable to aggregate environmental data received from multiple environments in different geographic locations or other suitable groupings, and provide air pollution reports of these groupings, for example, to any suitable entity (e.g., law enforcement entity 222). As another example, the platform 200 may be operable to compare detected external and/or internal phenomena of different areas of the environment 100 (e.g., different rooms and/or spaces protected by the same door or different doors) to one another at particular times or historically (e.g., by time of day, day of week, season of year, etc.) to identify certain areas where there may be problems to address (e.g., corners of the structure 150 that are exposed to significantly more noise pollution than other portions of the environment 100 at particular times of day and may benefit from additional sound insulation). This may be operable to enable detection of a reduction in the thermal insulation performance of one or more spaces (e.g. a self-sealing smart door may be operable to detect whether any air gaps or leaks have occurred over time, in order to inform the system of increased energy usage and/or inefficient protection, which may enable more efficient use in the future and/or enable certain subsidies to be provided to users of systems having such capabilities). As another example, platform 200 may be operable to compare detected external and/or internal phenomena of environment 100 with other intelligent environments. Any one or more such comparisons or aggregations of data regarding detected phenomena (e.g., air quality, noise level, activity (e.g., movement) level, ambient light level, weather, etc.) of one or more interior or exterior regions of environment 100 may be stored for and/or shared with certain entities (e.g., potential purchasers of environment 100) for determining whether such quality of environment 100 is appropriate. Thus, the smart doors can equip the environment 100 with environment sensing capabilities that can configure the system 199 as a weather station.
By sensing air quality, temperature, noise level, and/or any other suitable elemental characteristic within different spaces (e.g., spaces on opposite sides of a single smart door or spaces protected by different smart doors), one or more smart doors may be operable to detect information that may be used to intelligently and/or effectively and/or efficiently automatically control various functional components of any smart device, such as the ventilation capability of the one or more smart doors themselves. For example, one or more sub-doors 452 and/or one or more vents 457 and/or one or more door body portions (e.g., portions 124l and/or 124u) and/or one or more sealing mechanisms 409 and/or any filters thereof, etc. of one or more smart doors 120 may be independently or collectively controlled by system 199 to open or close in any suitable amount and/or in any suitable direction and/or at any suitable speed to automatically provide intelligent and/or efficient and/or effective heating and/or cooling and/or ventilation and/or sound insulation, etc. to one or more particular spaces proximate to either side of each smart door. In some embodiments, the door HVAC system 456 of the smart door 120 may include at least a portion of any suitable heat pump assembly (e.g., a furnace), wherein such heat pump assembly may be vented on one side or the other of the smart door (e.g., effectively using cooler air on one side of the door and hotter air on the other side of the door) as the smart door 120 opens into each of the two spaces it protects. In some particular embodiments, such heat pump components of the smart door 120 may be used to achieve operational compliance of the smart door under extreme conditions (e.g., even when the temperature of at least one side of the door is extremely cold, such as by controlling the heat pump components to de-ice or otherwise provide anti-freeze measures (e.g., to prevent the door from freezing closed and prevent door opening and closing transitions)). In some embodiments, the door vent 457 of the smart door 120 may comprise at least a portion of any suitable thermal and/or noise insulation, wherein such insulation may be controlled to dynamically adjust the manner in which heat and/or noise and/or any other suitable element (e.g., pollen, smoke, etc.) may be transferred from one space to another through the smart door's door frame channel 135 and/or may be prevented from being transferred from one space to another through the smart door's door frame channel 135 as the smart door 120 is vented to each of the two spaces it protects. For example, when a child is playing in the ambient environment AE, but a parent is working in the room 152, on opposite sides of the closed smart door 120, one or more door vents 457 or other ventilation features of the smart door 120 (one or more sub-doors 452 and/or one or more door body portions (e.g., portions 124l and/or 124u) and/or one or more sealing mechanisms 409 and/or any filters and/or the like thereof of the one or more smart doors 120 may be independently or collectively controlled by the system 199 to open or close and/or adjust in any suitable manner, in any suitable amount and/or in any suitable direction and/or at any suitable speed, so as to automatically enhance the ability of the room 152 to hear any noise emitted by the child in the ambient environment AE via the door frame channel 135, while limiting or preventing any hot air or pollen or other desired elements from also passing through the door frame passage 135. Accordingly, one or more adjustable mechanisms of the smart door 120 may be automatically controlled to selectively pass certain desired elements through the door-frame passage 135 in one or more particular directions (e.g., noise of the space occupied by the child, etc.), and also to selectively prevent certain other elements from passing through the door-frame passage 135 in one or more particular directions (e.g., pollen entering the interior of the structure from outside the structure). Additionally or alternatively, one or more sub-doors 452 and/or one or more vents 457 and/or one or more door body portions (e.g., portions 124l and/or 124u) and/or one or more sealing mechanisms 409 and/or any filters and/or the like thereof of the smart door 120 may be independently or collectively controlled by the system 199 to open or close in any suitable amount and/or in any suitable direction and/or at any suitable speed to automatically provide intelligent and/or efficient cooling and/or venting for any heat generating component (e.g., any suitable battery and/or other electronics of the door) that may be partially located within the door body 124 of the smart door. Thus, a screen door may no longer be needed because the smart door may be configured to automatically circulate fresh air from the outside based on thermostat settings and/or sensor conditions of the system or as directed by the user.
Any suitable sensor 428 may be disposed at least partially within the door body 124 of the smart door in any suitable manner for detecting any direct user interaction with the door body. For example, one or more motion sensors and/or ambient light sensors and/or radar sensors and/or cameras and/or the like that may be at least partially disposed within the door body 124 may be any suitable portion or entirety of a surface of the door body 124 (e.g., the exterior side 124e of the door body 124) that is operable to detect various types of direct user interaction (e.g., physical tapping, rubbing, scraping, etc.) with or on the suitable portion or entirety. Thus, one or more sensors 428 may be operable to provide a smart knocker, which may be operable to detect any suitable user interaction (e.g., a knock of various intensities and/or lengths and/or locations on a door surface).
The platform 200 may be a function of the user interface or input component 412 operable to disable the smart door 120 for any suitable reason (e.g., based on any suitable settings or inferences, etc.). For example, a message may be communicated to the visitor that the smart door input component has been disabled, thereby preventing the visitor from even attempting to functionally interact with the smart door input component (e.g., by the visitor tapping the smart door or pressing any smart doorbell button of the smart door). Alternatively or additionally, whether or not the functionality of the input component of the smart door 120 is disabled as communicated to the guest, the platform 200 may be operable to prevent contact of the system user in some manner or not at all in response to any guest interaction with the smart door input component in a certain system environment (e.g., if the guest interacts with the smart door input component prior to providing any requested guest identification information and/or guest intent information to the smart environment). This may be considered a "white list" because platform 200 may be operable to require certain requirements to be met before the functionality of the smart door input assembly is generally enabled for the guest (e.g., before platform 200 may be operable to generate any system user notifications in response to any guest's interaction with the smart door input assembly), such as determining a specific identity of the guest and/or at least determining whether the guest is trusted or untrusted.
Alternatively or additionally, the platform 200 may be operable to prevent a system user from being contacted in a particular manner or not at all in response to a particular visitor's interaction with the smart door input component (e.g., if a particular visitor has been determined to interact with the environment 100 (e.g., the doorbell 106 or any sensor of the smart door 120) in a manner not intended by the system user). This may be considered a "blacklist" because platform 200 may be operable to prevent certain guest interactions of a certain guest from being transmitted as system user notifications, whether the particular guest is determined to be trusted or untrusted. Thus, platform 200 may be operable to enable a system user to easily "blacklist" a particular guest during a particular mode of smart environment 100 (e.g., by defining a mode setting) such that some or all interactions of the particular guest with environment 100 (e.g., with any smart door button 412) do not result in a system user notification that would otherwise be generated by platform 200 for a non-blacklisted guest interacting in the same manner. The visitor on the blacklist may be detected like other suitable visitors. For example, any suitable fingerprint or signature of the visitor may be identified (e.g., by facial recognition, accepting a positively provided visitor identification, detecting an NFC or RFID tag of the particular visitor, Wi-Fi pairing signal, or any other suitable signal that may be detected from the visitor personal device 266 and analyzed by the platform 200, etc.).
As just one real-world example, there may be an overly enthusiastic mail deliverer DL that he or she always presses the smart gate button 412e when he or she delivers mail each day, even though the requests of the system user are reversed (e.g., because the user notification provided in response to such a press inevitably wakes up sleeping children in the environment 100). After 2-3 days of this same activity, the platform 200 may be operable to determine or otherwise identify that the same Wi-Fi paired signal was sensed when the smart door button 412e was pressed every day, and the platform 200 may be operable to store this data in an appropriate log by identifying different interactions on different dates as being provided by the same visitor. Later, after about the third day, an angry homeowner system user may be allowed by the platform 200 to view the log and realize that the same visitor is a button press at these unpleasant times, and then "blacklist" the visitor. It is noted that in one embodiment, the actual identity of the "blacklisted person" may not be explicitly determined or revealed in the log by platform 200, and such a visitor may simply be identified in the log as "visitor a" or "visitor whose Wi-Fi beacon is XYZ. However, in other embodiments, the actual identity of one or more guests may be provided in such logs (e.g., by any suitable technique described herein, such as comparing any detected guest signature data to one or more databases available to platform 200).
Such logs may be used by platform 200 for any suitable purpose. For example, platform 200 may be operable to assign a particular type of system user notification to a particular guest or a particular guest interaction identified via a log or otherwise, such that platform 200 may utilize such particular type of system user notification in the future to blacklist the guest or interaction in response to detecting such particular guest or guest interaction, rather than identifying the particular guest or guest interaction in the log, thereby preventing future system user notifications in response thereto. For example, platform 200 may be operable to enable a certain audible message type (e.g., a particular "ring tone") to be provided by platform 200 as at least part of a system user notification in response to a particular visitor or future detection of a particular visitor interaction (e.g., to associate a melodic version of a "shave and haircut-2 bit" segment with a particular rhythmic interaction of the same "shave and haircut-2 bit" segment between the visitor and any sensor of the smart door (e.g., any suitable sensitive surface)). Further, any suitable sensor of the smart door may be any tangible item operable to detect that a user is left on the smart door (e.g., a note attached to a surface of the door, or a note that the user drafts with a finger on a touch-sensitive surface of the door, etc.), and an indication of the detection of that item may be communicated by the system to any suitable other system user or device in any suitable manner.
The smart doors may be configured to be used by the system to provide any suitable smart home entry door differentiator and/or affective feature. For example, the intelligent door 120 may be operable to provide an intelligent door assistant. More specific doorbell buttons and/or knockers may not be needed, but various internal sensors may be used to implement the functionality of such components in a more simplified manner. The smart gate may be configured to pass "Hello, can I help you (do you need I help)? "or other suitable greeting is actively summoned to the person detected as approaching the door. Any suitable video and/or audio feed captured at and/or by the smart gate may be communicated to any other suitable smart device of the system and/or returned through any suitable interface of the smart gate (e.g., to deter thieves, etc.). For example, if it is detected that an identified family friend of the environment owner is asking for a particular potential occupant, the smart door may be configured to present friendly responses, such as "Hello, Mark-Lawrence is not available right not-woould you like to send him a textmessage, leave a voice message, or request a video chat? ", each of the presented options may be enabled by the smart door. As another example, if an identified deliverer is detected with a package that does not require active user signing, the smart door may be configured to present a friendly response, such as "Thank you, Please leave the package at the door" or "plug slide the package through the door," and the delivery door may automatically open an appropriate amount to securely receive the package. As another example, if an identified occupant or registered user/owner is detected at the smart gate, the smart gate may be configured to present a friendly response, such as "Good eventing, Lawrence," and/or to present a simulated greeting if the owner has come in and gone out, and/or a notification of any messages and reminders and/or personalized incoming music (e.g., with different volume settings for the greeting (e.g., depending on the time of day, etc.)). The display of the smart door or any other suitable user interface component may be configured to provide any suitable message to any suitable user when the user may pass through the door in any suitable direction. For example, when detecting (e.g., via a front smart door leading to a home) that an occupant user is leaving The environment, The smart door may be configured to present any suitable data of interest to The user, including, but not limited to, weather forecasts, traffic reports, queuing direction requests for The user's personal device 166 or car navigation, advance phone reservations, reminders or notes (e.g., "is reminded that christins to pick up children today" or "is you have a your car keys" or "is you want to turn off The lights" or "is being defended" and The like). As another example, when an occupant user is detected (e.g., via a front smart door leading to a home) as entering the environment, the smart door may be configured to disarm (e.g., automatically) any or all alerts and/or to present any suitable data of interest to the user, including but not limited to, "the alarm has been disarmed" or "the basketball game is on in the living room" game, etc.
Any suitable camera may be provided by the camera sensor of the smart door in any suitable manner. In some embodiments, the camera sensor 428c of the sensor 428 of the door body 124 may be provided as both an exterior sensor 428e that may be at least partially exposed through the exterior side 124e of the door body 124 and an interior sensor 428i that may be at least partially exposed through the interior side 124i of the door body 124, such that the camera sensor may be operable to detect movement of all users relative to the door. For example, as shown in FIG. 6A, camera sensor 428c may include a single camera module 428cm that may be communicatively coupled not only to an outwardly facing lens 428cle (e.g., a lens as may be at least partially exposed through an exterior side 124e of door body 124), but also to an inwardly facing lens 428cli (e.g., a lens as may be at least partially exposed through an interior side 124i of door body 124), which may enable a single camera with multiple lenses to capture multiple views of the environment of the door (e.g., a 360 camera may be able to detect all movement of each side of door body 124 regardless of where door body 124 is located relative to door frame 130. additionally or alternatively, as shown in FIG. 5A, for example, an upper camera 428mu may be disposed on an upper portion of door frame 130 for capturing images between upper and lower portions of door frame 130 through door frame passage 135, and/or a lower camera 428ml may be provided on a lower portion of the door frame 130 for capturing images through the door frame passage 135 between the upper and lower portions of the door frame 130, which may be operable to capture images useful to the system to determine the degree to which the door is openable and/or the speed of its movement, etc. The positioning of the camera at the door body surface may be much more effective for capturing the user's behavior relative to the door than when the camera is positioned adjacent to the door (e.g., in a corner of a room facing the door), as the user may be more likely to look directly at the camera provided by the door rather than the camera adjacent to the door (e.g., a door camera, which may be located at the center surface of the door, at eye level of an average user). Such positioning may also be useful for any creative effort or other aspect of the user, such as the system being configured to capture images of the user's face at least once each day the user passes through a door (e.g., the user's front door) in order to create an album that shows how the user's appearance changes over time.
In general, the door body may be provided from a material or combination of materials selected to provide a door that is structurally sound or that may provide suitable insulation against noise and/or weather, etc. However, such a construction is often insufficient to address all of the potential functional features of the door. Thus, two or more specific material layers may be combined to provide a door body for the smart door 120, so as to provide a door that is constructed in a manner that not only saves energy, but is also structurally sound, and aesthetically appealing and operable to provide some sort of user interface. For example, the outer layers 125a and 125e may provide respective sides 124e and 124i of the door body 124, while the intermediate layers 125b and 125d may separate the outer layers 125a and 125e from the intermediate or core layer 125c, respectively. The core 125c may be provided at least in part by a wood or steel frame, which may provide strength to the door body 124. Each or both of the intermediate layers 125b and 125d may be at least partially provided by a fiberglass structure, which may be of any suitable shape and size (e.g., molded in a particular design) and/or may be filled with any suitable insulator, as fiberglass may be lightweight and operable to effectively contain the insulator. Each or both of the outer layers 125a and 125e may be provided at least in part by a decorative wood structure (e.g., having a design for exterior decoration). At least some of the wood components may be operable for decorative functions and/or resistance to rutting. In some embodiments, one or more of the outer layers 125a and 125e may be provided by wood or glass or plastic or any other suitable material (e.g., wood with one or more small or near perforations) for providing a dead-front display (e.g., for providing one or more of the display user interfaces 431e and 431i and/or one or more of the user interfaces 412e and 412 i). It should be understood that any or all of the features of the door 120 may be optional and/or customized by the end user, such as decoration, style, size, color, sensing capabilities, battery storage size, etc.

Fig. 9 is a flow diagram of an illustrative process 900 for adjusting a door assembly of a computing system (e.g., smart door 120 of computing system 199), where the door assembly may include a door frame defining a door-frame passage between two spaces of an environment and a door body movable relative to the door frame between a closed door state and a plurality of open door states (e.g., door frame 130 defining door-frame passage 135 between ambient environment AE and room 152 of environment 100 and door body 124 movable relative to door frame 130 between a closed door state (e.g., of fig. 5A) and an open door state (e.g., of fig. 5D and/or 6A and/or 6B)). At operation 902, the process 900 may include a first stage in which the computing system detects user interaction with the environment when the door assembly is in a first door state. In response to detecting the first stage of interaction at operation 902, the process 900 may include the computing system transitioning the door assembly from the first door state to the second door state at operation 904. After transitioning the door assembly from the first door state to the second door state at operation 904, the process 900 may include a second phase of the computing system detecting user interaction with the environment while the door assembly is in the second door state at operation 906. In response to detecting the second phase of the interaction at operation 906, the process 900 may include the computing system transitioning the door assembly from the second door state to a third door state at operation 908. In some embodiments, the first door state of process 900 may include a closed door state, and the door assembly of process 900 may be configured to transition from the first door state to any open door state of the plurality of open door states only via the second door state (e.g., door 120 may transition from the sealed state to the open state only by first transitioning to the unsealed state). In some embodiments, the first door state of process 900 may not include any of a plurality of open door states. In some embodiments, the transitioning of operation 904 from the first door state to the second door state may include unsealing a body-frame gap of a door-frame passage between the door body and the door frame (e.g., by disengaging the sealing mechanism 409 of the smart door 120), and wherein the transitioning of operation 908 from the second door state to the third door state may include unlocking the door body from the door frame (e.g., using any suitable locking mechanism of the smart door 120), and wherein the first stage of interaction of process 900 may include a user approaching within a threshold distance to the door assembly (e.g., distance TDE or distance TDI), and/or wherein the second stage of interaction of process 900 may include a user authenticating the user's authority to pass through the door-frame passage (e.g., using any suitable sensor of system 199).

Fig. 10 is a flow diagram of an illustrative process 1000 for adjusting a door assembly of a system (e.g., smart door 120 of computing system 199), which may include: a door frame that may define a door frame channel; a door main body; a retention mechanism operable to selectively engage to retain the door body in a closed position relative to the door frame; and a sealing mechanism, which may be a body-frame gap operable for selective engagement to seal a door-frame passage between the door body and the door frame when the door body is in the closed position (e.g., any suitable locking mechanism and/or coupling mechanism that defines the door frame 130 and the door body 124 of the door-frame passage 135 and the door 120 (e.g., any suitable sealing mechanism 409 for maintaining the door 120 in a closed door state (e.g., of fig. 5A) and for sealing any gap 135g of the passage 135 of the door 120)), wherein the system may further include at least one sensor (e.g., any sensor of the system 199) and at least one controller (e.g., any controller of the system 199) operable for detecting potential trigger event data. At operation 1002, the process 1000 may include at least one controller receiving first potential trigger event data detected by at least one sensor. At operation 1004, the process 1000 may include: the at least one controller determines that the first potential trigger event data received at operation 1002 satisfies the decapsulation requirement for the decapsulation trigger event and does not satisfy the release requirement for the release trigger event. Based on the determination of operation 1004, process 1000 may include: at operation 1006, the at least one controller disengages the sealing mechanism to unseal the body-frame gap of the door-frame passage between the door body and the door frame when the door body is held in the closed position by the retention mechanism. In some embodiments, the at least one sensor may be positioned at least partially within the door body. In some embodiments, the received first potential trigger event data of process 1000 may satisfy the decapsulation requirement of the decapsulation trigger event by indicating a potential intent of the user to pass through the door-frame channel. Alternatively, in some embodiments, process 1000 may also include: after operation 1002, receiving second potential trigger event data detected by at least one sensor; determining that the received second potential trigger event data meets a release requirement for a release trigger event; and based on a determination that the received second potential trigger event data satisfies the release requirement for the release trigger event, disengaging the holding mechanism to release the door body from being held in the closed position upon disengagement of the sealing mechanism, wherein the received second potential trigger event data may satisfy the release requirement for the release trigger event by indicating a permission of the user to pass through the door-frame passage, or wherein the received first potential trigger event data may satisfy the unseal requirement for the unseal trigger event by indicating a potential intent of the user to pass through the door-frame passage, and the received second potential trigger event data may satisfy the release requirement for the release trigger event by indicating an authorization of the user to pass through the door-frame passage, or wherein the received second potential trigger event data may satisfy the release requirement for the release trigger event by indicating an intent of the user to soon pass through the door-frame passage, or wherein the received first potential trigger event data may satisfy the decapsulation requirement for the decapsulation trigger event by indicating a potential intent of the user to pass through the door-frame passage, and the received second potential trigger event data may satisfy the release requirement for the release trigger event by indicating an urgent intent of the user to pass through the door-frame passage. In some embodiments, the door assembly may further include a coupling mechanism that may define a path along which the door body may move between the closed position and the open position relative to the door frame (e.g., the mechanical coupling mechanism 403 may define a path along which the door body 124 may move between the closed position of fig. 5A and the open position of fig. 5D and/or fig. 6A and/or fig. 6B relative to the door frame 130), wherein, after operation 1002, the process 1000 may further include the at least one controller receiving second potential triggering event data detected by the at least one sensor at operation 1008. In such embodiments, process 1000 may further include: the at least one controller determines at operation 1010 that the second potential trigger event data received at operation 1008 meets the release requirements of the release trigger event but does not meet the open requirements of the open trigger event. In such embodiments, process 1000 may further include: based on the determination of operation 1010, and when the sealing mechanism is disengaged (e.g., after operation 1006), at operation 1012, the at least one controller disengages the retention mechanism to release the door body from being retained in the closed position. In such embodiments, the process 1000 may further include the at least one controller receiving, at operation 1014, third potential trigger event data detected by the at least one sensor after operation 1008. In such embodiments, the process 1000 may further include the at least one controller determining, at operation 1016, that the third potential trigger event data received at operation 1014 meets the open requirement of the open trigger event. In such embodiments, based on the determination of operation 1016, the process 1000 may further include the at least one controller actuating the coupling mechanism upon disengagement of the retention mechanism (e.g., after operation 1012) for moving the door body from the closed position to the open position along the path. In some embodiments, the first potential trigger event data received at operation 1002 may satisfy the decapsulation requirement of the decapsulation trigger event by indicating a potential intent of the user to pass through the door-frame passage (e.g., the user comes within a threshold distance TDE of the smart door 120), the second potential trigger event data received at operation 1008 may satisfy the release requirement of the release trigger event by indicating an authorization of the user to pass through the door-frame passage (e.g., biometric information of the authorized user is provided to one or more appropriate sensors of the system 199), and the third potential trigger event data received at operation 1014 may satisfy the opening requirement of the opening trigger event by indicating an imminent intent of the user to pass through the door-frame passage (e.g., the user comes within a shorter threshold distance of the smart door 120 (e.g., to position P4)).
It should be understood that the operations shown in process 1000 of fig. 10 are merely illustrative, and existing operations may be modified or omitted, additional operations may be added, and the order of certain operations may be changed.
Fig. 11 is a flow diagram of an illustrative process 1100 for adjusting a sealing mechanism of a computing system (e.g., the sealing mechanism 409 of the smart door 120 of the computing system 199), where the computing system may include one or more processors (e.g., any processor of the system 199) and one or more sensors (e.g., any sensor of the system 199) and a locking mechanism and a door body and a door frame defining a door frame channel (e.g., the door body 124 and the door frame 130 and the door frame channel 135 of the door 120 and any locking mechanism). At operation 1102, the process 1100 may include detecting potential trigger event data using one or more of the sensors. At operation 1104, the process 1100 may include determining, using one or more processors, that each requirement of a trigger event is satisfied at least by the potential trigger event data detected at operation 1102. In response to the determination of operation 1104, the process 1100 may maintain engagement of the locking mechanism at operation 1106 to maintain the door body in the closed position relative to the door frame and disengage the sealing mechanism to terminate sealing of the body-frame gap of the door-frame passage between the door body and the door frame while the door body is maintained in the closed position relative to the door frame.
