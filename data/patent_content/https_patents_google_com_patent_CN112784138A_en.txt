Description
Description of the cases
The present application belongs to the divisional application of Chinese patent application 201680004449.2 filed 2016, 7, 26.
Technical Field
This description relates to data processing and content distribution.
Background
The internet facilitates the exchange of information and transactions between users worldwide. This exchange of information enables content sponsors (sponsors) to provide sponsored content to various users. Content sponsors can control the distribution of their content items (e.g., promotions, advertisements, audio files, video files, or other content items) based on a set of distribution parameters that specify under what conditions the content items are eligible to be distributed. When a presentation opportunity is obtained that satisfies the condition, the content provided by the content sponsor is deemed eligible to be provided for presentation.
Disclosure of Invention
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method that includes the actions of: receiving, by one or more data processing apparatus, event distribution data from a content provider, the event distribution data specifying content to be distributed during a live event that will occur in the future; identifying, by the one or more data processing apparatus after receiving the event data, an opportunity to provide the content to a user at a user device based on data submitted by the user device to the one or more data processing apparatus; determining, by the one or more data processing devices, that a time of the opportunity is between a start time and an end time of the live event; determining, by the one or more data processing apparatus, that the user device is in the same geographic area as the live event based on geographic data provided by the user device, and determining that the user is interested in the live event based at least in part on the attributes of the user matching attributes of users identified as being interested in the live event; and providing, by the one or more data processing apparatus, computer-executable instructions to the user device, the computer-executable instructions initiating presentation of the content on a display of the user device in response to determining that the time of the opportunity is between the start time and the end time, that the user device is located in the same geographic area, and that the user is interested in the live event. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The method may include the acts of: data is provided that presents a user interface at a device of the content provider that specifies a list of live events. Receiving event data may include receiving, through the user interface, a selection of one or more of the live events.
The method may comprise the acts of: the period of interest for the live event is determined based on a query volume change for a search query referencing the live event. The interest period may include an interest start time, a peak interest time, and an interest end time.
Determining the period of interest may include: determining the interest start time of the live event when a search query volume of queries related to the live event increases by a specified amount; determining the peak time of interest may include determining when a volume of search queries for the query related to the live event will reach a maximum level during the period of interest; determining the interest end time includes determining when a search query volume of the query related to the live event will be reduced from the highest level by a specified number.
Determining that the time of the opportunity is between the start time and the end time of the live event may include determining that the time of the opportunity is between the interest start time and the interest end time.
The method may include the acts of: identifying future events having characteristics that match distribution criteria associated with content provided by a content provider; and providing, based on the identifying, computer-executable instructions that initiate presentation of the future event as a live event for selection by the content provider as a live event for use for purposes of distributing content provided by the content provider.
The method may include the acts of: identifying a set of distribution criteria that will cause the content to be distributed to users interested in the live event, the set of distribution criteria including a time period of the event and a geographic area in which the live event occurred; and associating the set of distribution criteria with the content within the computer memory in response to receiving the event data. Determining that the time of the opportunity is between the start time and the end time of the live event may include determining that the time of the opportunity is within a time period of the event; and determining that the user is in the same geographic area comprises determining that a match exists between the geographic data and the geographic area where the live event occurred.
Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. Using a live event as a basis for content delivery enables the system to provide relevant information when the information is most relevant (e.g., during periods of interest of the live event). When a live event is used as a basis for content delivery, the progress of the live event can be monitored to stop the delivery of content when the live event has ended. The delivery of content can also be stopped when the user's interest in the live event drops by a specified amount, thereby preventing distribution of content to the user after the interest in the live event subsides. User interest in the duration of a future event can be determined based at least in part on historical search query data of previous instances related to the same or similar event, thereby enabling content delivery during a period in which the user will be interested in the future event. The use of event-based content distribution reduces the amount of input required to a content sponsor, thereby simplifying and efficiently selecting distribution parameters for the content (streamline). For example, selection of a single event will cause multiple different distribution criteria to be associated with a given portion of content. In this way, multiple distribution parameters can be associated with a given portion of content in the time used to select a single event, without requiring entry of multiple different criteria (e.g., which typically takes longer).
The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

Detailed Description
With existing content distribution techniques, which already enable setting of one or more distribution conditions, it is difficult to adapt the distribution of content based on current and real-time environments, situations or event occurrences, which have a significant impact on the type of content that one or more users or groups of users want to receive. Thus, the inventors have recognized that the relevance of such content to the respective user will increase or change based on real-time situations and future events. Such changes in the relevance of the content to the potential viewer are based on real-time or ongoing situations, events, or event occurrences, etc. The embodiments described herein provide methods and systems that can adapt to current and future environments for controlling and providing content distribution to a community of users in real time, thereby ensuring that the most relevant content reaches the right community of users at the right moment.
This document discusses event-based content distribution. In some implementations, a real-world event occurrence (e.g., a concert, sporting event, weather event, news event, or political event) can serve as a basis for distributing content related to the event. A content sponsor (or other content provider) can select (e.g., via a provided user interface) one or more events to be used as a basis for distributing content. The content sponsor does not need to specify a complete set of distribution criteria because the devices and systems discussed in this document will select distribution criteria based on the selected event and associate the selected distribution criteria with the content to be distributed.
In some implementations, the distribution criteria include user attributes and geographic information that cause the content to be distributed to users interested in the live event, even when the users are accessing network resources unrelated to the event. For example, a user requesting a social media feed may not request resources related to an upcoming concert, but when the user's user attributes match the distribution criteria selected for the concert and a request for a social media feed is received within the concert's period of interest, the content can be distributed to the user, even though the user may not actually express interest in the concert directly.
The following description is applicable to the distribution of various types of content (e.g., audio files, video files, or other content) provided to user devices.
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for distributing content to user devices 106. The example environment 100 includes a network 102, such as a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Network 102 connects website 104, user devices 106, and content sponsors 108 and content distribution system 110. The example environment 100 may include many different websites 104, user devices 106, and content sponsors 108.
A resource 105 is any data that can be provided over the network 102. The resource 105 is identified by a resource address associated with the resource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and Portable Document Format (PDF) documents, images, videos, and feed resources, to name a few. The resources may include content such as words, phrases, images, and sounds, which may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).
The units of content presented in (or with) a resource are referred to as content items, and individual content items can be stored in a single file or collection of files independent of the resource. In some implementations, the content item is inserted into the resource based on execution of a script embedded in the resource. For example, as discussed in more detail below, a script embedded in the electronic resource can cause the user device to initiate a request for the content item after the electronic resource is retrieved. As such, the content item may not be considered part of the resource, but may be considered additional content (e.g., from a third party other than the resource provider) that is combined with the resource as it is rendered. The request may be formatted as packetized data including a header and payload data. The request may include data such as the name (or network location) of the server from which the content item was requested, the name (or network location) of the device making the request, and/or information that the server can use to select the content item that was provided in response to the request. As described in more detail below, the request is transmitted by the user device to a server of the content distribution system over a network (e.g., a telecommunications network).
The user device 106 is an electronic device that is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102. Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices capable of sending and receiving data over the network 102. The user devices 106 typically include user applications, such as web browsers, to facilitate the transmission and reception of data over the network 102.
The user device 106 can submit a resource request 112, which requests the resource 105 from the website 104. In turn, data representative of the requested resource 114 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106. For example, the requested resource 114 may be a home page of the website 104, a web page from a social network, or another resource 105. The data representing the requested resource 114 may include data that causes the resource content 116 to be presented at the user device 106. The data representing the requested resource 114 may also include data specifying a content item slot 118.
A content item slot is a portion of a resource (e.g., a portion of a web page) or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of another window or in a slot of a web page) in which one or more content items, such as advertisements, can be presented. The content item slot 118 may also be referred to as an ad slot, but any type of content (e.g., content items other than advertisements) can also be presented in the content item slot 118.
A single content item slot 118 may be configured to include one or more presentation positions 119a and 119 b. Alternatively or additionally, each different content item slot 118 can be considered a separate presentation location, and the resource can include a plurality of different content item slots. Each presentation position may represent a portion of the content item slots 118 at which the content item can be presented. In some implementations, the number of presentation positions and/or the size of presentation positions of a particular content item slot 118 can be determined based on the number, type, and/or value of content items available for presentation in that content item slot.
To facilitate resource searching, the environment 100 can include a search system 113 that identifies resources by crawling and indexing resources provided by publishers on the website 104. Data about a resource can be indexed based on the resource with which the data is associated. The indexed and optionally cached copy of the resource is stored in search index 122. The data associated with the resource is data representing metadata of content and/or resources included in the resource.
The user device 106 can submit a search query to the search system 113 over the network 102. In response, the search system 113 accesses the search index 122 to identify resources relevant to the query. The search system 113 identifies resources in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user device in a search results page. The search results are data generated by the search system 113 that identifies resources that are responsive to a particular search query, and include links to the resources. Example search results may include a web page title, a snippet or image portion of text extracted from the web page, and a URL for the web page. As with other resources, the search results page can include one or more content item slots 118 capable of presenting content items, such as advertisements.
When a user device 106 requests a resource 105, execution of code associated with a content item slot 118 in the resource initiates a request for one or more content items to fill the slot, referred to as a content item request. The content item request may include data specifying resources and characteristics of slots defined for the requested resources 114. For example, data specifying a reference (e.g., a URL) to the requested resource 114 for which the content item slot 118 is defined, a size of the content item slot, a maximum number of presentation locations (or content items) that can be included in the content item slot 118, and/or a media type that is eligible for presentation in the content item slot 118 can be provided to the content distribution system 100. Similarly, data specifying keywords associated with the requested resource ("resource keywords") or entities referenced by the resource may also be included in the content item request and provided to the content distribution system 110 to facilitate identification of content items 114 related to the requested resource 114. The content item request may also include data related to other information, such as information that the user has provided, geographic information indicating the state or region from which the request was submitted, or other information that provides context for the environment in which the content item is to be displayed (e.g., the type of device, such as a mobile device or tablet device, at which the content item is to be displayed). For example, the content item request can be transmitted over a packetized network, and the content item request itself can be formatted as packetized data with a header and payload data. The header may specify the destination of the packet and the payload data may include any of the information discussed above.
The content item that is provided in response to the content item request (or other request) is identified based in part on a distribution parameter (e.g., represented by distribution data) associated with the content item. A distribution parameter is a set of criteria on which the distribution of a content item is conditional. In some implementations, the distribution parameters for a particular content item can include distribution keywords that must be matched to qualify the content item for presentation (e.g., by resource keywords or search queries). The distribution parameters can also require that the content item request include information specifying a particular geographic area (e.g., country or state) and/or information specifying that the content item request originates from a particular type of user device. The distribution parameters can also specify a bid (bid) and/or budget for distributing a particular content item. As described in more detail below, bidding can be used to select a collection of content items for presentation with a resource and/or to determine a presentation location at which the content item is to be presented.
The content item is selected for presentation at the presentation location based on the results of the content item selection process. In some implementations, the content item selection process can include an auction. The auction can be performed based at least in part on an auction associated with the content item. For example, assume that a first content item is associated with a Cost Per Click (CPC) bid of $1.25 and a second content item is associated with a CPC bid of $ 1.00. In this example, since the bid for content item 1 is higher than the bid for content item 2, a first content item can be selected for presentation at presentation location 119a (e.g., the highest presentation location) and a second content item can be selected for presentation at presentation location 119 b.
In the above example, content items are selected based only on the value of their respective CPC bids. However, the content items can be selected based on auction scores determined based on additional (or other) information. For example, the auction score for a particular content item may be the product of the CPC bid for the content item and the probability that the user will click on the content item to request the landing page to which the content item connection points (e.g., CPC bid p _ click, where p _ click is the probability that the user will click when the content item is presented). Note that for purposes of example, this document refers generally to bidding, and the bidding can be specified as a CPC bid or a CPM ("cost of thousand") bid, and the CPC bid can be converted to an eCPM (estimated CPM) value to enable the bids to be directly compared.
For example, ePCM bids can be determined based on the product of an interaction rate (e.g., click-through rate) of a content item and a CPC bid for the content item. If a content item provides two or more different actions that a user can invoke through interaction with the content item, the eCPM for the content item can be determined based on the sum of the products of the interaction rate and the bid for the action (e.g.,
The probability that a particular content item will receive a click (or another interaction) can be based on the historical click-through rate (or interaction rate) of that content item. For example, assume that a particular content item has a historical click-through rate of 0.10, indicating that the particular content item received one click in every ten presentations of the content item. In this example, the probability that the content item will receive a click can be set to 0.10. Thus, the value 0.10 can be multiplied by the CPC bid for the particular content item to obtain the auction score for the particular content item. Further, the content item with the highest N auction scores can be selected for presentation at N available presentation locations, where N is an integer number of available presentation locations.
As discussed above, various different distribution criteria can be specified to control the distribution of content items to user devices 106. Typically, these distribution criteria are each individually specified by a content sponsor who sponsors the content item. For example, a content sponsor that sponsors a given content item may select a given professional sports team name as a distribution key to distribute the given content item in an attempt to reach users interested in the given professional sports team. Similarly, a content sponsor can individually configure the time during which a given content item is to be distributed and/or the geographic region in which a given content item is to be distributed. In some implementations, the content sponsor provides these distribution criteria to the content distribution system 110, and the content distribution system 110 then controls the distribution of a given content item in response to a request that includes information matching the distribution criteria.
It may sometimes be difficult to reach the intended audience by specifying the distribution criteria as described above. For example, assume that a content sponsor wants content to be distributed to users interested in an upcoming live event. In this example, it is difficult for content sponsors to identify combinations of distribution keywords and/or time periods that can be used to reach users while they are interested in an upcoming live event. For example, the user interest for an upcoming live event may be at some point in time before the live event begins, may peak at some point in time during the live event, and may end at some point in time after the live event. Thus, resources requested by some users interested in a live event may not be relevant to the live event. For example, a community of users who would be interested in a given concert may not actually access resources related to the concert or submit online search queries about the concert to a search engine. In this example, it is difficult for a content sponsor to identify distribution keywords that would make a content item reach the user population.
The environment 100 includes a live event device 124 that enables a content sponsor to distribute content items to users interested in the live event. As discussed in more detail below, the live content device 124 can determine a time period during which a user will be interested in a given live event and determine various distribution keywords that will cause content items to be distributed to users interested in the given live event. For example, live event device 124 can evaluate search query trend data 126 to determine when user interest for a given live event has begun, when the user interest has peaked, and/or when the user interest for the given live event has ended. In addition, the live event device 124 can identify attributes of users interested in a given live event and/or keywords related to the live event. The live event device 124 can enable a content sponsor to simply specify the given live event (e.g., by picking the live event from a set of upcoming live events presented in a user interface), and the live event device 124 in turn can distribute one or more content items of the content sponsor to users interested in the given live event (e.g., based on distribution criteria determined by the live event device (LEA)124 that would cause the content items to reach users interested in the live event).
FIG. 2 is an example data flow 200 for distributing content to users interested in a live event. The data flow begins with the LEA 124 obtaining event data 202 from a scheduled event device 204 (e.g., a server that provides information about scheduled events). The events represented in the event data 202 can be identified from a variety of sources. For example, sports event schedules can be obtained from websites of various sports teams or sports leagues, concert schedules can be obtained from websites of concert promoters, and political event schedules (e.g., debate schedules) can be obtained from various political-related websites. In some implementations, a program guide for a television (or other media) can be used to identify upcoming live events. For example, analysis of the results of a program guide listing may reveal that a given event (e.g., a tennis event) will be live at a given time in the future and scheduled for a given period of time.
In some implementations, the start time and/or the end time may not be specified. Instead, the data referencing the start time and/or the end time may specify a location (e.g., a network address of a server) from which the current state of the live event can be obtained. For example, with respect to the sporting event above, the data referencing the start time and/or the end time may specify a location where the current state of the sporting event (e.g., the period and/or time remaining on the game clock) can be obtained upon request. In this example, LEA 124 can update the start and end times by submitting a request to the specified location. In particular, the LEA 124 can periodically obtain updated event information specifying the progress of the event, and then change the event criteria based on the event information.
In some implementations, the start and end times can be determined based on when a user interest in the event begins or ends, rather than based on the actual start or end time of the live event. For example, LEA 124 can determine a period of interest for a live event based at least in part on a query volume and/or a query volume variation of a search query referencing the live event. To determine the period of interest, LEA 124 can obtain (or otherwise access) trend data 206 from a query trending device 208 (e.g., a server or system that tracks the volume of search queries). The trend data 206 can specify the amount of queries over time for a given search query, and can be based on historical search query information about previous instances of a live event or search query information about other live events similar to an upcoming live event. In this way, the LEA 124 can request the query trender 208 to provide a measure of the amount of search queries for one or more search queries related to a given live event. For example, as illustrated in fig. 2, LEA 124 can request search query volume information (e.g., Ev1 SQV-EvA SQV) for queries related to each of event 1-event a, and receive various measures of the search query volume for those queries over time.
For purposes of example, assume that graph 210a represents the amount of search queries over time for queries related to event 1, while graphs 210b and 210c represent the amount of search queries over time for queries related to event 2 and time a, respectively. In this example, assume that a threshold amount of search queries (e.g., relative to a baseline amount of search queries) represented by line 212 has been specified to determine a period of interest for event 1. When the volume of search queries rises above a threshold (e.g., at t1), interest in event 1 is deemed to have begun, and when the volume of search queries falls below the threshold (e.g., at t3), interest in event 1 is deemed to have ended. Thus, in this example, LEA 124 can determine that the period of interest for event 1 is between t1 and t3 (e.g., representing a period between time 1 and time 3), while enabling the start time of event 1 to be set to t1 and the end time of event 1 to be set to t 3. For example, times t1 and t3 can be represented as specific dates and/or times, or as relative measures around the live event (e.g., 3 days before and 1 day after the live event).
In some implementations, the period of interest for a given event can be based on determining that the amount of search queries has changed by at least a specified number within a specified time period. For example, referring to the graph 210b of event 2, assume that the query volume variation between t4 and t5 satisfies the specified lowest query volume variation with respect to the onset of interest of event 2. In this example, the LEA 124 can determine that interest in event 2 has begun at t5 (or t4) based on the query volume variation satisfying the specified minimum query volume variation. In this way, LEA 124 can set the start time of event 2 to t 5. Similarly, assume that the query volume variation between t7 and t8 satisfies the specified lowest query volume variation with respect to the end of interest of event 2. In this example, the LEA 124 can set the end time of event 2 to t8 (or t7) so that the interest period of event 2 can be between t5 and t 8.
In some implementations, user attributes of users that have been deemed to be of interest for a given event can be determined based on the profile data 216, which the LEA 124 can obtain from a user profile device 218 (e.g., a server or other data processing device that provides access to user profile information). The user profiling means 218 is capable of providing profile data 218 specifying user attributes of users who have been identified as being of interest to a given event. For example, the user attributes can include other interests of the user (e.g., interests in events or topics beyond a given event), demographic (demographic) information about viewers who express an interest in the event, geographic areas in which users interested in the given event are located, and/or other information about users interested in the given event. For example, as shown by profile data 216, users that have been deemed to be interested in event 1 have user attribute X (e.g., geographic area X), user attribute Y (e.g., interest in topic Y), and user attribute Z (e.g., in user group Z), while users that have been deemed to be interested in event 2 have user attribute B (e.g., geographic area B), user attribute C (e.g., interest in topic C), and user attribute D (e.g., in user group D).
The data transmitted to the content sponsor device 222 can include event list data 224 that specifies events that can be used to distribute content of the content sponsor. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, the content sponsor device 222 can receive event list data 224 and present an event list 226 in a display of the content sponsor device 222. The event-based distribution interface 220 can also include a content list 228 that can be used for distribution using the event list 226. For example, the content list 228 can specify content 1 and content 2 that are available for distribution using the event list 226. To distribute content based on events, the content sponsor can select content from the content list 228 and then specify which event will be used to distribute the selected content. For example, as illustrated in fig. 2, pointer 230 is used to select content 1 from content list 228 and then to select event 2 from event list 226. It will be apparent that the association between content and events can be made using other techniques (e.g., drop-down boxes, text entry, etc.).
The content sponsor device 222 communicates the selected event data 232 to the LEA 124 (or the content distribution system 110), thereby indicating that content 1 should be distributed to users interested in event 2. The content sponsor can also specify other distribution criteria that can be used by the LEA 124 (and/or the content distribution system 110) to distribute content, as will be discussed in detail below. In response to receiving the selected event data 232, the LEA 124 can associate event criteria of the selected event with content of the content sponsor. For example, as illustrated in fig. 2, LEA 124 can associate content 1 with event criteria 234 from event criteria set 214. As such, the content sponsor need only select a single event, and the LEA 124 will assign corresponding event criteria (e.g., a plurality of different distribution criteria to reach users interested in the event) for the specified content.
Once the LEA 124 has associated event criteria corresponding to the selected event with the content, the content can be distributed to users deemed to be interested in the selected event. In some implementations, users deemed to be interested in the selected event are users who do not express any interest in the selected event directly, but have the user attributes specified in the event criteria. For example, assume that the user device 106 submitted a request for content 236 based on execution of code regarding an ad slot on a publisher page of a dog. Assume further that the content sponsor requests that content 1 be distributed to users interested in event 2, which is an upcoming concert. In this example, the publisher pages presented to the user are not directly related to the upcoming concert. However, request 236 can include user attribute information and timestamp information that can be used to determine whether content 1 should be presented to the user with the publisher page about the dog.
For example, LEA 124 can compare a timestamp (or current time) in the request to the period of interest for event 2 to determine whether the opportunity to provide content in response to the request is within the period of interest for event 2. When LEA 124 determines that the timestamp (or current time) in the request is within the period of interest for event 2 (e.g., between the start time (e.g., start 2) and the end time (e.g., end 2) for event 2), LEA 124 can further determine whether user attributes associated with the request (e.g., included with the request or stored in profile information corresponding to the user identifier included in the request) match user attributes of users deemed to be interested in event 2. For example, LEA 124 can determine whether geographic data provided by the user device (e.g., internet protocol addresses, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) data collected using a GPS component of the user device, or other geographic information) matches the geographic area corresponding to event 2, and whether the user's interests and/or demographic information matches the user's interests and/or demographic information specified in the event criteria for event 2.
When the LEA 124 determines that the information in the request matches the event criteria, the LEA 124 can qualify the content 1 for distribution in response to the request 236. In turn, the LEA 124 can respond to the request 236 by transmitting computer-executable instructions 238 to the user device 106, the computer-executable instructions 238 initiating presentation of the content 1 at the user device. For example, LEA 124 can generate packetized data that includes a network address from which user device 106 can retrieve content 1. Upon receiving the packetized data, the user device 106 will execute the instructions, which will cause the user device 106 to initiate a request for content 1 from the network address included in the packetized data. Upon receiving content 1, the user device 106 renders and presents content 1 with the publisher's webpage.
When LEA 124 identifies an opportunity to provide content at user device 106 that is not within the period of interest of a given event (e.g., by receiving a request for content or determining that a given user is accessing content such as a social network feed), the content associated with the event criteria corresponding to the given event will not be eligible for distribution in response to the opportunity. Similarly, if the opportunity is within the period of interest of a given event, but the user attributes specified in the event criteria of the given event are not matched, content distributed based on the given event will not be eligible for distribution.
The above description refers to scheduled upcoming live events. However, the above description can also be adapted to unscheduled live events. For example, weather events or other unscheduled/recurring (Non-recurring) events can be used for the purpose of distributing content during periods of interest for those events. LEA 124 is capable of communicating with various other devices, such as a weather device and a news device, which respectively provide information about weather and/or news events. For example, the LEA 124 can communicate with one or more servers that provide real-time weather information to obtain weather information for various geographic locations. LEA 124 can then use this weather information to identify a live weather event. For example, if there is currently snowfall in a geographic location, LEA 124 can determine that the event "snowfall" is a live event for that geographic location. Similarly, LEA 124 can obtain instant news information from various third-party news servers and use the news information to identify live news events. For example, assume that the U.S. headquarters is performing unscheduled speech. In this example, LEA 124 is able to identify the occurrence of the speech based on information obtained from breaking news information and identify the speech as a live event. The occurrence of the live event can then be used to distribute the content.
Assume for purposes of example that the content sponsor selects the event "snowfall" from the event list 226. In this example, the LEA 124 can use information obtained from various other devices to determine when and where to snowfall and associate appropriate event criteria with the content. Due to the nature of these events, LEA 124 can dynamically and automatically (e.g., without human intervention) change the event criteria that are required to be matched in order to distribute content. For example, based on the information obtained, LEA 124 may determine that there was snowfall during the first hour in Austin, Texas (TX) rather than Atlanta, california (GA), and that Austin, texas, no longer snowfell for the second hour and Atlanta, california. During the first hour, the event criteria for the content will specify a geographic region corresponding to Austin, Texas, and the event criteria will become specified during the second hour as the geographic region corresponding to Atlanta, Calif. In this example, during the first hour, the content will be eligible for distribution to users of Austin, Tex, but not eligible for distribution to users of Atlanta, Calif. However, during the second hour, the content will be eligible for distribution to users of Atlanta, Calif., but not eligible for distribution to users of Austin, Tex.
FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example user interface 300 that can be used to select event-based content distribution. The user interface 300 includes a Content list 302 (e.g., Content 1-Content 3) that is available for event-based distribution. The user interface 300 also includes a collection of controls 304a-304c that can be used to select events to be used to distribute content. For example, as illustrated, control 304a is used to select Concert 1(Concert 1) as the Event to be used to distribute content 1, while control 304b is used to select a Weather Event (Weather Event) as the Event to distribute content 2. Referring to control 304c, FIG. 3 shows that interacting with the content sponsor of control 304c causes a list of events to be presented in the user interface. For example, interaction with control 304c shows events of concert 1, sporting Event 1(Sport Event 1), and Weather Event (Weather Event) as events that can be used to distribute content 3. Subsequent interaction with sporting event 1 will cause content 3 to be distributed based on sporting event 1. When selection of the submit control 306 can cause the selected event to be sent to the LEA 124, then the LEA 124 can associate a plurality of different event criteria with the content based on selection of a single event from the list.
The user interface 300 also includes a set of default bid entry elements 308. A default bid entry element 308 enables a content sponsor to enter a default bid that will be used in the content selection process to identify content to be distributed in response to a given presentation opportunity. The default bids can be used at any time during the period of interest for a given event used to distribute the content. For example, a bid of $1.00 can be used at any point during the period of interest for concert 1.
The user interface 300 further includes a set of peak bid entry elements 310. A peak bid entry element 310 enables a content sponsor to enter bids to be used during the peak interest period of an event. For example, as discussed above, trend data can be used to identify peak interest in a given event, and peak interest periods can be specified based on the identified peak interest. During this peak interest period, LEA 124 will automatically (e.g., without human intervention) use peak bids rather than default bids for purposes of selecting content in the content selection process. Where a peak bid is not specified for a given event, a default bid can be used during the peak interest of the given event.
The user interface also includes a set of other criteria entry elements 312. Other criteria entry elements 312 enable a content sponsor to specify various other distribution criteria that can be used to distribute content in conjunction with selected events. For example, the content sponsor can specify geographic criteria, demographic criteria, time of day criteria, and/or other criteria that can be used to further control content distribution (e.g., in addition to event criteria to be assigned by the LEA 124 based on the selected event).
Fig. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for event-based content distribution. For example, the process 400 can be performed by the LEA 124, the content distribution system 110, or another data processing apparatus. Process 400 can also be implemented as computer-executable instructions stored on a computer storage medium, and execution of the instructions by one or more data processing apparatus causes the one or more data processing apparatus to perform some or all of the operations of process 400.
An event distribution user interface is provided to a content sponsor device (402). In some implementations, the event distribution user interface enables a content sponsor to select one or more events to be used to distribute a given portion of content (e.g., a content item such as an advertisement). For example, an event distribution user interface similar to the reviewer user interface discussed above can be provided to the content sponsor device. The user interface can present, at a content sponsor's device, a list of upcoming live events (e.g., concerts, elections, movie premiums, awards, or sporting events, to name a few) that can be used to distribute the content of the content sponsor.
In some implementations, the events listed in the user interface can include events selected based on distribution criteria that the content sponsor has previously used to distribute the content. For example, the data processing apparatus (e.g., LEA 124) can identify distribution criteria (e.g., keywords and/or geographic distribution criteria) that the content sponsor has previously used to distribute the content. Using the identified distribution criteria, the data processing apparatus can identify future events having one or more characteristics that match the identified distribution criteria (e.g., distribution criteria that the content sponsor has associated with the content). In turn, the data processing apparatus can provide computer-executable instructions to a content sponsor device that initiates presentation of the identified future event as a live event for selection by a content sponsor as a live event for use for purposes of distributing content provided by a content provider.
Selected event data is received (e.g., distributed as event data) (404). In some implementations, the selected event data specifies content to be distributed during a live event that will occur in the future. As discussed above, a content sponsor can select an event from a list of events presented in a user interface that specifies that content provided by the content sponsor is to be distributed to users interested in the selected event. For example, the selected event data can specify which of the one or more live events is selected from a user interface presented at the content sponsor device. For example, the selected event data can be stored in a data structure corresponding to the content sponsor that submitted the selected event data.
In response to receiving the selected event data, a set of event criteria is associated with given content provided by a content sponsor (406). The set of event criteria is a set of distribution criteria that will cause the given content to be distributed to users interested in the live event. In some implementations, the set of event criteria includes a time period of the event (e.g., a period of interest and/or a start/end time of the event) and a geographic area in which the event occurred.
As discussed above with reference to fig. 2, the set of event criteria can be identified based on information obtained from various sources. For example, a list of upcoming events and start/end times can be obtained from the event device, the period of interest can be determined based on trend data obtained from the query trend analysis device, and user attributes of users interested in the event can be determined based on profile information obtained from the user profile device. Information corresponding to each event can be associated with the event and used as event criteria for the event.
In some implementations, the event criteria include a time period for each event. For example, the time period may specify when an event is scheduled to begin and when an event is scheduled to end. Additionally or alternatively, the time period may specify a period of interest for the event. The interest period is a period during which the user interest in the event is considered to be active. As discussed above, the period of interest for a given event can be determined based on the amount of search queries (or the amount of search queries that vary) for the search query pertaining to (or referencing) the event. For example, the beginning of the period of interest (e.g., the interest start time) can be specified based on an increase in the amount of search queries before the beginning of the event (or some other time during the event), while the end of the period of interest (e.g., the interest end time) can be specified based on a decrease in the amount of search queries after the end of the event (or some other time before the end of the event). In some implementations, the interest start time corresponds to a specified increase in the number of search queries for the event-related query and the interest end time corresponds to a specified decrease in the number of search queries for the event-related query (e.g., relative to the highest number of search queries).
The peak time of interest (or period) of an event can be identified based on the highest level (or at least a specified level) of search query volume reached (or to be reached) during the period of interest. For example, based on historical search query volume data, it can be determined that the user's interest in a given concert will peak 1 day before the concert based on the number of peaks of search queries historically received 1 day before other instances of the concert (or similar concerts).
An opportunity to provide content to the user at the user device is identified after receiving the event data (408). For example, the opportunity can be identified based on data submitted by the user equipment to one or more data processing apparatus. In some implementations, the opportunity to provide content is identified based on a content item request initiated by receipt of a code embedded in a network resource. In some implementations, the opportunity to provide content is identified based on a user request for other content (e.g., a social network feed) or based on a user logging into a service (e.g., a social network).
A time of the opportunity is determined to be between the start time and the end time of the live event (410). As discussed above, the start time and end event of a live event can be specified in an event criteria associated with the content. The start time may be based on the actual time that the live event will start or based on the interest start time of the event. Similarly, the end time may be based on an actual (or estimated) end time of a live event or based on an interest end time of the event. For example, the determination can be made by comparing the time of the opportunity to the start time and end time of the live event. The time of the opportunity can be determined, for example, based on a timestamp received with the content item request (or other data), a current time available to one or more data processing devices (e.g., a server clock), or based on a future time at which the presentation opportunity will occur. In some implementations, the content will be delivered to the user when the time of the opportunity is between the start time and the end time of the live event. In some implementations, the content will be delivered to the user when the time of the opportunity is between the actual start time of the event and the actual end time of the event.
It is determined that the user device is in the same geographic area as the live event (412). In some implementations, the determination is based on geographic data provided by the user device. For example, the user device can include a global positioning system, and the system is used to provide data about the location of the user device. Additionally or alternatively, the generalized location of the user device can be determined based on an IP address of the user device. Once the geographic location of the user device has been determined, the location can be compared to the geographic location specified in the event criteria. When there is a match between the location of the user device and the location specified in the event criteria, the content is still eligible for distribution in response to the opportunity. When there is no match, the content may be identified as not being eligible for distribution. Note that the geographic information specified in the event criteria may include any geographic location corresponding to a user deemed to be interested in the event, and may not be limited to geographic locations where live events will occur.
It is determined that the user is interested in the live event (414). In some implementations, the determination is made based on user attributes associated with the opportunity to provide content and the event criteria. For example, a user profile of a user to whom content is to be provided can be compared to a set of user attributes specified in the event criteria. For example, the user attributes may include user interests, a user group to which the user belongs, and/or group characteristic information provided by the user. When a match is determined to exist, the content remains eligible to be distributed in response to the identified opportunity. When there is no match, the content may be identified as not being eligible to be distributed in response to the opportunity.
In some implementations, the determination that the user is interested in the live event is made independent of the online resource that the user is viewing or has requested. For example, as discussed above, the user may request a web page about a dog, which is unrelated to an upcoming concert. However, when the user attributes of the user match the event criteria and the opportunity is within the period of interest of the live event, the content distributed based on the concert may be shown to the user along with a web page about the dog. In this way, event-based content distribution can extend the reach of content (e.g., increase audience size) beyond keyword-based content distribution. In particular, event-based content distribution enables content related to a given event to be shown with the given online resource even when the online resource relates to a different topic or interest outside of the given event.
Computer-executable instructions are provided for initiating presentation of content on a display of a user device (416). In some implementations, the instructions are provided in response to determining that the time of the opportunity is between the start time and the end time, that the user device is in the same geographic area as the live event, and that the user is interested in the live event.
In some implementations, the instructions are provided when content is selected (e.g., by a content selection process) from a set of eligible content for distribution. For example, when multiple portions of content are eligible to be delivered, an auction can be used to select the content. When using an auction, the bid for the content can be selected from a default bid or a peak bid. As discussed above, peak bids can be used when the event is within a peak interest period of the event, and default bids can be used when peak bids are not used during the interest period.

Although an example processing system has been described in FIG. 5, the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in other types of digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
The subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments of the subject matter disclosed in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by data processing apparatus. The computer storage medium may be or be included in the following: a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Moreover, although a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium may also be or be included in: one or more separate physical components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices).
The operations described in this specification can be implemented as operations performed by data processing apparatus on data stored on one or more computer-readable storage devices or received from other sources.
The term "data processing apparatus" encompasses all types of apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, a system on a chip, or a plurality or combination of the above.
