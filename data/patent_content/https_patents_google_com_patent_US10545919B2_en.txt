Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to processing data organized along multiple dimensions and, more particularly, to techniques for decomposing tensor representations of such data for subsequent completion and/or compression.
- Another example embodiment of the techniques of the present disclosure is another computer-implemented method for manipulating multi-dimensional data, in which the acts are executed by one or more processors.
- the method includes receiving original data organized along three or more dimensions to define a tensor D with rank n, where the original data describes a real-world object or activity. Further, the method includes executing a constrained Lp norm optimization to decompose the tensor D into a core S and a plurality of unitary matrix multipliers, where the core S includes fewer non-zero values than the tensor D, and generating modified data based on the original data using the core S and one or more of the unitary matrix multipliers.
- Generating the modified data includes compressing or completing the tensor D, such that the modified data provides a description of the real-world object or activity that is less complete or more complete, respectively, relative to the original data.
- a digital image can be modified to estimate the missing colors or other attributes of some of the pixels, users' ratings of movies can be predicted based on these users' ratings of the other movies and the other users' rating of the same movies, a bitmap can be compressed for efficient transmission via a communication network, etc.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example computing environment 100 in which data, expressible in the form of a multi-dimensional array (e.g., a tensor), can be decomposed and subsequently completed or compressed.
- the computing environment 100 includes a processing server 102 communicatively coupled to a multi-dimensional array database 104 .
- the processing server 102 can be communicatively coupled to the multi-dimensional array database 104 via a communication link 106 , which can be part of any suitable wired and/or wireless network, including the Internet.
- the processing server 102 can transfer data to and from the multi-dimensional array database 104 via the communication link 106 and a network interface 108 .
- a norm of S may be a max (upper) bound for all unfolding of D
Abstract
Description
D=Π i SU i (Eq. 1) d
where D, S∈
S=argminX
where for all indices i, Ui HUi=UiUi H=I (e.g., the matrices Ui are unitary if Ui are complex), D=ΠiXUi, and X∈
or equivalently as,
where the ∥·∥F 2 notation indicates a Frobenius norm. In some cases, the Frobenius norm reflects an assumption that noise within D follows a normal distribution, and the constrained minimization of L gives a convex relaxation of tensor rank, ∥X∥1, ensuring the properties of S discussed above.
and
Although Eq. 6 includes a k+1 index for Uj, the index of the update equation for Uj may be k+1 or k depending on whether the ALM algorithm uses a Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel scheme.
minX,{U
maxX,{U
where X∈
limp→0 ∥X*(p)∥p p =∥X∥ p =∥S∥ 0=rank(S)=orank(D), (Eq. 14)
where X*(p) is the optimum of the Lp-norm optimization for D, and “orank” represents strong orthogonal rank (e.g., the minimum number of non-zeros in X s.t. D=ΠiXUi, where Ui are unitary).
(a sum over all unfolding of D) which is more tractable than minimizing the norm of 2k-1−2 unfolding.
min∥X∥ p s.t. vec(D)=({circumflex over (×)}i U i)vec(X), (Eq. 15)
where Ui is unitary and p<2, and
max∥X∥ p s.t. vec(D)=({circumflex over (×)}i U i)vec(X), (Eq. 16)
where p>2.
min∥X∥ p s.t. vec(D)=(V{circumflex over (×)}U)vec(X),p<2, (Eq. 17)
max∥X∥ p s.t. vec(D)=(V{circumflex over (×)}U)vec(X),p>2 (Eq. 18)
where U and V are unitary, the expressions of Eq. 15 and Eq. 16 may be transformed into SVD form by substituting Ui for U. Since the Kronecker product of two unitary matrices is still unitary, SUD (with the general Lp norm) is an SVD of all unfolded D's with the additional constraint that U and V can be expressed as a Kronecker product of matrices.
