Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to the field of computer software, and more specifically, to methods of displaying videos within software applications.
- a number of web sites on the Internet are now available that allow users to post and share digital video content in various ways.
- existing video sharing web sites fail to provide an effective user interface that enables a user to view and interact with the video content in a convenient manner.
- some video sharing sites display a video at only a single resolution (e.g., 320 ⁇ 240), and do not to resize the video when the user increases or decreases the size of the browser window, leading to the video not taking advantage of the larger screen size when the window is expanded, or being “cropped” when the window is contracted.
- Still other systems allow the video to be scrolled along with other content displayed in the window, leading to portions of the video disappearing from view as the user scrolls in the window.
- video playback controls such as play/pause, skip forward, skip back, and progress indicator controls, associated with the video are always visible to the user, thus requiring users to take additional actions, such as scrolling the window, before they can control video playback.
- a user interface provides various features for viewing and interacting with a video.
- the region for displaying and controlling video continues to be displayed in its entirety rather than being cropped, and the aspect ratio of the video image remains constant.
- the user can enlarge the video by increasing the size of the window, enabling better display when viewing the video from a greater distance.
- the buttons and other user interface elements for controlling the playback of the video are persistently displayed despite changes in the user interface state, so that even as portions of the user interface shrink or are scrolled, the user still has quick and convenient onscreen access to the controls.
- the user interface of a web browser includes a video region containing a video display region for displaying a video image and a video control region for controlling video playback, and a data region for displaying data associated with the current video.
- the browser window is resized, either by the user or by programmatic events, the video region is correspondingly resized so as to remain fully visible and maintain the aspect ratio of the video image.
- FIGS. 1 a - 1 b illustrate the resizing of elements of a user interface in response to a reduction in window size.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a system architecture useful in conjunction with the method and user interface described herein.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a software architecture useful in conjunction with the method and user interface described herein.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a user interface useful in conjunction with the method and user interface described herein.
- FIG. 5 is an event trace of the operation of a web browser and a video sharing web site.
- FIGS. 6 a - e show an exemplary user interface with various window sizes.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a method of resizing video content.
- the client device i.e. any client computing device capable of displaying video
- obtains video data either from its own local storage or by requesting if from a server, such as a workstation, mainframe computer, networked computer, or processor-based device.
- a server such as a workstation, mainframe computer, networked computer, or processor-based device.
- the request travels over a network, such as the Internet, and is received by the server.
- the server obtains the desired video data, either from its own local storage or by querying another server system that provides the actual data storage.
- the server then sends the video data back over the network to the client device, which then displays the video to the user.
- the video data can be delivered as a single file which the user system then receives in its entirety before starting to display it, or it can be delivered via streaming, so that the user system overlaps the receipt and displaying of the video, displaying only as much as it has currently received. It is within this context that the present invention is described herein.
- FIGS. 1 a and 1 b illustrate the resizing of elements of a web browser-based user interface in response to a reduction in browser window size.
- FIG. 1 a represents the window 100 in an initial state, with a video region 102 containing a video display region 104 within which a video image 108 is placed, and a video control region 106 for controlling video playback.
- FIG. 1 b represents the same window 100 after it has been reduced in both width and height.
- two primary operations are performed. First, the new size (i.e. width and height) of the video region 102 is calculated.
- the new sizes of the video display region 104 and the video control region 106 contained within the video region 102 are calculated, and the size of the video image 108 is calculated such that it fits within the video display region 104 and maintains its aspect ratio.
- these operations have resulted in the video region 102 becoming smaller but still displaying the full video display region 104 and video control region 106 without cropping the video image 108 .
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an example method for resizing a window.
- the browser displays 702 the window in its initial state-that is, already containing a selected video, which may be either paused or playing, but not yet resized.
- the selected video may be chosen from a list of videos and/or may be the result of a query for video content.
- a window resize event is received—by explicit user actions or by the operating system, for example—and in response, the video region and its components are resized 704 as appropriate.
- the resize 704 involves a series of operations, including calculating the new sizes of the video region 102 and the regions contained within it based on the new window size, and resizing the video image 108 such that it maintains its aspect ratio.
- these operations are accomplished by determining 706 the size of the video window, determining 708 the height of the video region within the video window, determining 710 the width of the video region within the video window, determining 712 the height of the video control region within the video region, determining 714 the height of the video display region within the video region, comparing 716 the aspect ratios of the video display region 104 and the video image 108 , and determining 718 the video image size based on the comparison of 716 , the video display region size, and the video image aspect ratio.
- the particular sequence of these determinations can be changed without departing from the invention.
- One embodiment of a method takes place in the context of a standard client-server architecture, such as a client communicating with a server over the World Wide Web.
- a standard client-server architecture such as a client communicating with a server over the World Wide Web.
- the video data is accessible via the World Wide Web and displayed in a web browser window, it is appreciated that that the present invention is not limited to this situation. Rather, the present invention is independent of the source of the video data and of the particular application used to display that data.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a client-server architecture suitable for supporting the method.
- client device 202 can be any type of client computing device capable of displaying video, for example, a device executing a browser application or other application adapted to communicate over Internet related protocols (e.g., TCP/IP and HTTP) and/or display a user interface.
- the client device 202 is of conventional design according to one embodiment, and includes a processor, an addressable memory, and other conventional features (not illustrated) such as a display, local memory, input/output ports, and a network interface.
- one or more of the components of the client device 202 may be located remotely and accessed via a network, e.g., 204 .
- the network interface and a network communication protocol provide access to a network 204 and other computers, such as server 206 or third party computers, along with access to the Internet, via a TCP/IP type connection, or to other network embodiments, such as a LAN, a WAN, a MAN, a wired or wireless network, a private network, a virtual private network, via other networks, or other systems allowing for data communication between two or more computing systems.
- the client 204 may be implemented on a computer running a Microsoft operating system, Mac OS, various flavors of Linux, UNIX, Palm OS, Symbian, and/or other operating systems.
- the server 206 provides access to the client device 202 via, for example, its web server software.
- the server 206 also has access to video data, either storing such data locally or requesting it of other servers.
- the server 206 is depicted in FIG. 2 as a single computer system, it may be implemented as a network of computer processors and associated storage devices.
- the details of the hardware aspects of servers 206 are well known to those of skill in the art and are not further described herein. Examples of servers 206 are workstations, mainframe computers, networked computers, processor-based devices, and similar types of systems and devices.
- the present invention is not limited by the details of the particular client-server video sharing architecture. Rather, the present invention relates to a user interface displayed at the client and is thus not dependent on the details of the interaction of the client with other systems, such as the server providing the video data.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a software architecture.
- the embodiment of FIG. 3 involves a client device 202 and the applications on it.
- Client device 202 includes a web browser 306 and a video player component 308 .
- Web browser 306 further includes a window controller component 310 .
- Web browser 306 accesses video data held at a web site (not shown) and provides the user interface to display the video.
- Video player 308 provides the actual video display; video player 308 can play video for any format(s) including existing formats (e.g., MPEG, Flash, AVI) or formats developed in the future. Video player 308 can be a separate process executable or a browser plug-in that runs in the context and process space of web browser 306 .
- existing formats e.g., MPEG, Flash, AVI
- Video player 308 can be a separate process executable or a browser plug-in that runs in the context and process space of web browser 306 .
- Window controller 310 is a logical component of web browser 306 that can respond to window events and modify the user interface of web browser 306 accordingly.
- the window controller 310 is composed of, for example, the HTML, JavaScript, and other programming content residing in the web page provided by the particular web site that provides the video data and stored by web browser 306 .
- FIG. 4 is an exemplary user interface, used in applications such as web browser 306 , that illustrates the variables that can be considered in one embodiment when calculating the sizes of the various elements of the user interface. These variables are later referenced in the discussion of the size calculations of FIG. 5 .
- FIG. 4 represents one particular embodiment of the user interface.
- there is shown only one height_otherRegion 454 whereas there could be many such other non-video display regions, and such regions could be in different window locations.
- many other user interface layouts are possible.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example event trace that occurs responsive to a window resize, described in terms of the variables of FIG. 4 .
- FIGS. 6 a to 6 c illustrate how a user interface of a web browser 306 reacts in response to a series of window resize events, according to one embodiment in which the video is viewed within a web browser 306 . Note that in the initial state of FIG. 5 , the window of web browser 306 already contains a selected video, which may be either paused or playing. It should also be noted that the below calculations are used for sizing the user interface, not only in response to resize events, but also during the initial state, before any resize events have taken place.
- FIG. 6 a represents the web browser window 600 in an initial state, before a resize event.
- the data region 610 is located on the right-hand side of the browser window 600 and displays information about the current video 608 , such as its title, average user rating, and description.
- the video region 602 includes the video display region 604 , the video image 608 (which is the currently-displayed frame of the selected video), and the video control region 606 .
- the video region 602 occupies height_vr 460 , the vertical region between the bottom of the fixed search panel 612 and the top of the browser status bar 614 , and width_vr 471 , the horizontal region between the edge of the browser window 600 on the left and the data region 610 on the right.
- the video control region 606 is located at the bottom and contains user interface elements 616 providing a means of controlling video playback, including play/pause button 630 , frame selection slider 632 , volume control slider 634 , full screen mode button 636 , and drop-down options list 638 .
- the video display region 604 is located in the remainder of the video region 602 not occupied by the video control region 606 , and displays the video image 608 at the largest size consistent with maintaining the aspect ratio of the video as originally received by the video sharing site, so as to prevent cropping or stretching. The remainder of the video display region 604 not used to display the video image 608 is displayed in black.
- the video image 608 can be set to a fixed size, such as original size or double size, that does not vary along with the size of the window; thus, as video display region 604 increases in size beyond this fixed size, video image 608 will be surrounded by an increasingly large amount of black space. If the window is decreased below this fixed size, the video is scaled to fit the space available while maintaining its aspect ratio, without cropping or stretching.
- a fixed size such as original size or double size
- the data region 610 need not be at the right-hand side of the window, nor need the video control region 606 be directly below the video display region 604 .
- the web browser 306 receives an input 505 to resize.
- the input can be provided directly by the user (e.g., by mouse or keyboard actions), or by a programmatic event, such as an automatic screen resize or other system event.
- the web browser 306 detects that the window resize occurred and transfers control 510 to window controller 310 , which causes the video to be resized 515 as discussed below.
- the window controller 310 executes code (e.g., JavaScript) that is provided as part of the video sharing web site and that recalculates 515 the appropriate width and height of the video region 602 and sends a notification 520 to the video player 308 of this video region size recalculation.
- the video player 308 then recalculates 525 the size of the video within the video region 602 so as to preserve the original aspect ratio and thus avoid image cropping.
- the video player 308 determines the height of the video control region 606 , height_vc, according to the fixed value previously chosen by the web page designer.
- the video control region 606 and video display region 604 that are contained within video region 602 inherit its width, but this is not a requirement of the invention.
- the width of data region 610 may be based on a fixed number of “m-dashes,” a measurement based on the size of the current font, since this would allow displaying a desired amount of text.
- This technique makes it easier, for example, for the designer of a video sharing site to set the sizes of portions of the user interface with the needs of special groups in mind, such as those with impaired vision who need larger fonts.
- This m-dash width could easily be converted by window controller 310 to a pixel width by multiplying the width in m-dashes by the number of pixels per m-dash in the current font.
- the video player 308 places video image 608 within it while still maintaining the original aspect ratio of the video so that no cropping of the image occurs. This involves comparing the aspect ratios (that is, the ratio of width to height) of video display region 604 and of the video. If the aspect ratio of the resized video display region 604 is greater than the aspect ratio of the video, then it is proportionally wider than the video itself.
- the window controller 310 scales the video image 608 by setting its height to the full height of video display region 604 , and its width to the height of video display region 604 multiplied by the aspect ratio of the current video image. This causes the video image 608 to occupy the full height of video display region 604 , and less than the entire width.
- width_vi new width_vdr
- height_vi new width_vdr*(height_vi/width —vi)
- video player 308 Having performed the above resize calculations, video player 308 then displays the video image so as to fit within the video display region.
- the window controller 310 requests 530 the web browser 306 to resize video region 602 , and the web browser 306 in turn redraws 530 its window 600 so as to reflect the foregoing size changes to the user.
- FIG. 6 b it illustrates the same browser window as in FIG. 6 a , but after the window has been reduced in width in response to a window resize event.
- the data region 610 maintains its original width
- video region 602 is adjusted to accommodate the overall reduction in the window width.
- Video control region 606 has been reduced in width in keeping with video region 602 , which contains it, but it maintains its height.
- frame selection slider 632 has been reduced in width and has begun to float over play/pause button 630 while still leaving it accessible to a mouse click
- volume control slider 634 , full screen mode button 636 , and drop-down options list 638 have moved to the left to occupy the space vacated by frame selection slider 632 .
- the user does not need to take additional actions, such as scrolling the video window up and down, in order to access the controls.
- the video image 608 has been resized in response to the overall window resize; note that even though only the width of the window was reduced from FIG. 6 a , the height of video image 608 has been reduced significantly in order to maintain the video's original aspect ratio, resulting in portions of the video display region above and below the video image being left blank.
- FIG. 6 c illustrates the same browser window as in FIG. 6 b , but after the window has further been resized again, with a substantial reduction in both width and height.
- the video display region 604 has been resized so as to occupy only the remaining space after the window has been reduced in size.
- the video control region 606 has been reduced in width so as to fit within the video display region 604 , yet it retains its original height so that it remains visible and accessible to the user.
- the video image 608 has been resealed so as to retain its original aspect ratio, even though its height and width have been reduced considerably.
- volume control slider 634 , full screen mode button 636 , and drop-down options list 638 have floated completely over top of play/pause button 630 .
- FIGS. 6 d and 6 e illustrate how the video image 608 remains fixed and visible, despite scrolling in other regions of the window.
- FIG. 6 d represents an initial state of the browser window 600 , before any scrolling has taken place. Note that the scroll control 620 of the vertical scrollbar 618 is at its highest location, and the topmost content of data region 610 is visible, but content lower down—such as video thumbnails 622 below the top two—is not.
- FIG. 6 e represents the same window as that of FIG. 6 d , but after the user has scrolled downward. The upper content of data region 610 has thus vanished, and a corresponding amount of the lower content has become visible, so that two additional video thumbnails 622 are shown in the display region 610 .
- the scrolling of data region 610 is independent of the display of video region 602 ; thus, the video control region 606 and the video image 608 are not scrolled, but are displayed at the same location relative within the browser window as they were in FIG. 6 d prior to the scroll event. This allows the user to continue viewing the video image, while concurrently accessing the additional information in the display region 610 .
- Certain aspects of the present invention include process steps and instructions described herein in the form of an algorithm. It should be noted that the process steps and instructions of the present invention could be embodied in software, firmware or hardware, and when embodied in software, could be downloaded to reside on and be operated from different platforms used by real time network operating systems. In one embodiment, the process steps and instructions are embodied in a computer program executable by a processor and stored by a computer readable memory.
- the computer-readable memory is a non-transitory, tangible storage medium, and can include, but is not limited to, hard disks, CD-ROMs, DVDs, flash memory, and the like.
- the present invention is well suited to a wide variety of computer network systems over numerous topologies.
- the configuration and management of large networks comprise storage devices and computers that are communicatively coupled to dissimilar computers and storage devices over a network, such as the Internet.

- Height_userContent 456 is the height of the portion of the window that is available for displaying the contents of particular web pages.
- Height_otherRegion 458 is a portion of height_userContent 456 that is directly above or below the video region.
-
Height_vr 460 is the height of the video region, the portion of the window that contains the primary video-related UI elements. -
Height_vc 462 is a constant height, fixed at a value previously chosen by the web page designer as the height for the video controls. -
Height_vdr 464 is the height of the video display region, which represents the portion of the video region not occupied by the video controls. -
Height_vi 466 is the height of the area actually allocated for displaying the video image, which is atmost height_vdr 464. -
Width_window 468 is the total width of the window. -
Width_displayRegion 470 is the width of a display region containing additional information about the video. In the exemplary user interface ofFIG. 4 , this value is fixed. -
Width_vdr 472 is the width of the video display region, and occupies the portion of the width not occupied bywidth_displayRegion 470. -
Width_vc 474 is the width of the video controls, and in a preferred embodiment is also of width width_vdr, since the video controls are contained within the video display region and in that embodiment are as wide as their container.
