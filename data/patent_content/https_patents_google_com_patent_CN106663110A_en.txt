Abstract
A match score provides a semantically-meaningful quantification of the aural similarity of two chromae from two corresponding audio sequences. The match score can be applied to the chroma pairs of two corresponding audio sequences, and is independent of the lengths of the sequences, thereby permitting comparisons of matches across subsequences of different length. Accordingly, a single cutoff match score to identify "good" audio subsequence matches can be determined and has both good precision and good recall metrics. A function for determining the match score is determined by establishing a function PM indicating probabilities that chroma correspondence scores indicate semantic correspondences, and a function PR indicating probabilities that chroma correspondence scores indicate random correspondences, repeatedly updating PM and the match function based on existing values of PM and the match function as applied to audio subsequences with known semantic correspondences.

Description recognizes, structures and methods illustrated herein can be used in the case of the principle without departing from invention as described herein
Alternate embodiment.
Specific embodiment
Fig. 1 illustrates the computing environment that audio analysis wherein occur according to one embodiment.Audio server 100 is included：
The set in audio storage storehouse 101, wherein audio storage storehouse 101 storage different digital tonic train (for example, song)；And audio frequency
Analysis module 105, wherein audio analysis module 105 include the feature for analyzing simultaneously comparing audio sequence.User uses client
Device 110 and audio interaction, for example, obtain and play sequence from audio storage storehouse 101, submit the inquiry to tonic train to, will
Tonic train is submitted to audio database etc..
Audio server 100 and client 110 connect via network 140.Network 140 can apply to data transfer
Any appropriate communication network.Network 140 can include internet using standard communication techniques and/or agreement.In another reality
In applying example, network 140 includes customization and/or special data communication technology.
Tonic train in audio storage storehouse 101 can represent any kind of audio frequency, for example, music or voice, and wrap
Include metadata (for example, title, label and/or description) and audio content.In one embodiment, audio content is pressed by discrete
The unit (hereinafter referred to as " colourity ") of time-sequencing is constituted.Each colourity is corresponding to the specified time interval (example in tonic train
Such as, specific 50 ms interval), and the value of each measurement frequency in the set with measurement frequency.For example, in one embodiment
In, each colourity has the floating point values of each in 12 semitones (semitone) in 8 tone (octave), and wherein this is floated
Point value represents the intensity of the frequency of this specific semitone during correspondence time interval.The set of the value of different measuring frequency is (for example,
Embodiment for measuring 12 frequencies, set<0.25、1.1、2.5、1.0、0.6、0.79、1.9、2.3、1.11、4.6、1.5、
2.0>) be referred to as " chroma vector (the chroma vector) " of colourity.In alternative embodiments, audio content is used as continuous letter
Number and store, and before being analyzed by audio analysis module 105 dynamic translation be discrete colourity.
Tonic train in the analysis audio storage of audio analysis module 105 storehouse 101, to determine the " semantic of tonic train pair
Correspondence (semantic correspondence) ", i.e. tonic train sounds identical for for human listener.For example
Fig. 2A and Fig. 2 B are visually illustrated, and a type of analysis performed by audio analysis module 105 is in a pair of audio frequency sequences
Correspondence subsequence is found in row.Fig. 2A illustrates two different tonic train (SequenceA201 and SequenceB202) one
Example.In order to example it is simple for the sake of, each sequence in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2 B is made up of (for Sequence 8 colouritiesA 201
For, A0To A7, and for SequenceBFor 202, B0To B7).It will be appreciated, however, that two sequences can have any quantity
Colourity (for example, 3,600, it is assumed that be 3 minutes long tonic trains, and each colourity corresponds to 50 ms intervals), and
And need not be with the colourity with another identical quantity.Fig. 2 B illustrated example subsequence matchings, wherein having found colourity A1
To A3Colourity B is corresponded to semantically3To B5, this meaning is used as overall, chroma vector pair<A1,B3>、<A2,B4>With<A3,B5>Tool
There is pole similar value, and therefore will sound the same for human listener.
The ability that correspondence subsequence is found in two sound sequences realizes many applications.One kind application is to determine a first song
Song (for example, due to the big subsequence correspondence of song) whether same with another prime minister.Another Application be in response to sing in user or
A part for song is otherwise described by audio input, is corresponded to semantically by attempting to be found in known songs
The subsequence of the audio input that user is provided and find the song.
In order to determine whether individual shades --- or subsequence of multiple colourities --- are semantically mutually corresponding to, language is needed
Justice is measured to a certain of response.As example, quantify two colourities c1With c2Between semanteme the similar function of response can be determined
Justice is sim (c1,c2)=c1·c2/|c1||c2|.As 3 element chroma vector c1=<1,0,1>And c2=<1,1,0>(wherein to
Value is 0 or 1 with simplified example) simplified example, similar scoring is sim (c1,c2)=<1,0,1>·<1,1,0>/|<1,0,1
>||<1,1,0>|=(1*1+0*1+1*0)/[(12+02+12)*(12+12+02)]=1/ [2*2]=1/4.
However, can be difficult to interpret the implication of the correspondence scoring produced by specific similar function.In example above, scoring
1/4 does not inherently pass on whether the scoring is " good " scoring, i.e. with script generally in the internal generation of randomly selected colourity
Scoring caused by the similar institute of chroma vector is compared, the scoring indicate whether between colourity it is significant semantic to response (so that
Obtaining colourity will likely sound the same for human listener).Extra Heuristics is for knowing that such as 0.6 is have
Real significant semantic corresponding chroma vector and only have accidentally to most effectively carrying out area between the chroma vector of response
Other appropriate cut-off score value will be necessary.Extra Heuristics has 10 continuous colourities of scoring 0.6 for determination
With indicate whether than with scoring 0.5 12 continuous chromaticity match also will be by force necessary.In the right of even single colourity pair
Should score can not pass in whether certain strong, such as example discussed above of correspondence, it is determined that what is be made up of many colourities is whole
The significant correspondence scoring of individual subsequence is more difficult.
Fig. 3 is the high-level block diagram of the detailed view of the audio analysis module 105 for illustrating the Fig. 1 according to one embodiment.Make
With with regard to the certain semantic corresponding Given information between subsequence and by compare these semanteme correspondence with it is randomly selected
Intrinsic weaker correspondence in subsequence, the derivation of audio analysis module 105 is applied to the respective function of colourity pair (hereinafter referred to as
Match () function).Intuitively, derived respective function match () of institute, for using certain initial respective function (for example on,
Example function sim (c described in text1,c2)) and the first colourity correspondence of acquisition scores, and represent and compare colourity c1And c2Only at it
Have accidentally similar in chroma vector, the scoring more likely indicates colourity c1And c2In semantically corresponding degree.Therefore, led
Intrinsic implication is passed in semanteme correspondence scoring produced by respective function match () for going out, and without recourse to the implication with regard to scoring
Extra Heuristics.
Audio analysis module 105 includes representing the data of the set of function 305 derived from audio analysis module.The function
Comprising probability density function PM, wherein probability density function PMBy given initial respective function (for example, the sim (c of colourity pair1,
c2)) output be mapped to its indicate two colourity significant corresponding probability.The function also includes probability density function
PR, wherein probability density function PRThe output for giving initial respective function is mapped into that its instruction is randomly chosen/have at random
Correspond to rather than with the probability of certain semantic corresponding a pair of colourity.The function is also comprising the derived respective function of institute
Match (), wherein derived respective function match () of institute is P thenMPRFunction.In one embodiment, match ()
Function is defined as match (c1,c2)=log (PM/PR)。
Audio analysis module 105 includes that input set forms module 310, wherein input set forms module 310 and sets up filling
When the set of the tonic train of the input to function export module 340, wherein function export module 340 derives function 305.Specifically
For, input set forms module 310 and recognizes to contain and is confirmed as first set S with semantic corresponding tonic trainM。
If two sequences in a pair of tonic trains are confirmed as having similar audio properties (the same intuitively, sounding),
So the pair of tonic train is referred to as having semantic correspondence.In one embodiment, tonic train has similar audio property
The determination of matter is manually to carry out, and for example, listens to different tonic trains (for example, song) by human expert and determines that they listen
Get up the same.
Input set forms module 310 and is also formed and form module and randomly select from audio storage storehouse 101 containing being input into set
The set S of the tonic train selectedR.Therefore, different from set SMInterior sequence, set SRInterior sequence is not yet determined to be in language
Correspondence in justice, and may not correspond to semantically.
Audio analysis module 105 is also included to grading module 320, wherein being directed to any two audio frequency to grading module 320
Sequence and produce the scoring of the various possible colourity pair between First ray and the second sequence.Scoring is by the derived respective function of institute
The current state of match () is produced, wherein derived respective function match () of institute is P thenMPRFunction.For example, Fig. 4
Illustrate two exemplary sequences (that is, Sequence that Fig. 2A and Fig. 2 B are directed to grading module 320A201 and SequenceB 202)
And the example collection of the scoring for producing, wherein the two of Fig. 2A and Fig. 2 B exemplary sequences all have 8 colourities.Therefore, to the mould that scores
Block 320 produce can as illustrated in the grid of Fig. 4 it is visual 8*8=64 score set, wherein element Hi,jRepresent
match(ci,cj) scoring that exported, ciIt is SequenceAThe i-th chroma vector in 401, and cjIt is SequenceB 402
In jth chroma vector.
Audio analysis module 105 also includes subsequence identification module 330, and wherein subsequence identification module 330 will be to scoring
The set to scoring that module 320 is produced for a pair of colourities is used as input.Based on to scoring, subsequence identification module 330
Response is recognized based on the semanteme of the composition colourity of subsequence most have by force semantic corresponding subsequence.For example, Fig. 4 is given
The illustrated sample set to scoring, subsequence identification module 330 can be based on correspondence match () scoring H1,3、H2,4And H3,5
Summation be relatively higher than other subsequences match () scorings summation and by subsequence A1To A3And B3To B5It is identified as having
Semanteme correspondence.
In one embodiment, subsequence identification module 330 is used with affine gap penalty (affine gap
Penalty dynamic programming algorithm) is with continuous colourity of the identification in full sequence with maximum match () scoring summation
Set.
Audio analysis module 105 also includes function export module 340, and wherein function export module 340 is from input set shape
Function P is derived into the input set produced by module 310M、PRWith match ().Function export module 340 is based on set SRValue
And function P is derived in single iterationR.That is, the scoring of initial respective function (for example, sim ()) is directed to from SRDifference
To randomly selected tonic train and calculate.The scoring is then fitted to probability distribution (for example, such as β probability distribution),
Wherein the probability distribution is then used as function PR。
Function export module 340 derives function P in multiple iterationMWith match ().In the first iteration, PMIt is set
For rough initial approximation, wherein rough initial approximation is subsequently improved in iteration after a while.For example, in one embodiment,
PMIt is initialized to PMX-the 2x of ()=2, wherein x are initial chroma respective functions (for example, as described above, sim (c1,c2)) institute it is defeated
The value for going out, it is to be understood that many other initial functions can be used equally.The output of derived respective function (match ()) can
Then according to PMCurrency and PRAnd calculated.
In each iteration, function export module 340 uses PRValue and PMCurrency and match (), to enter one
Step improves PMWith match () function.For example, function export module 340 is by using the derivation P to grading module 320MIt is new
Value, to produce input set SMIn known semantically corresponding subsequence pair to scoring.Function export module 340 also makes
With subsequence identification module 330 with the subsequence of colourity of the identification with maximum match () scoring summation.Function export module
340 will be fitted to probability distribution from the scoring of initial respective function (for example, as described above, sim () function), wherein described
Probability distribution serves as PMNew value.
In one embodiment, probability distribution is β distributions, and as illustrated in Fig. 5 A, but other distributions are also possible.Specifically
For, Fig. 5 A illustrate specific similar function (that is, sim (c as defined above1,c2)=c1·c2/|c1||c2|) sample PM
And PRFunction, as β distribution probability density functions are modeled.P represented by solid lineMFunction for about 0.93 sim () scoring and
Peak value is reached, so as to the sim () scorings for indicating that there is semantic corresponding a pair of colourity most probable to be produced 0.93.PMFor being less than
The sim () scorings of 0.7 (for example) and the relatively low value that produces indicate there is semantic corresponding a pair of colourity will produce low
In 0.7 sim () scoring be at all impossible.Similarly, PRFunction reaches peak value for about 0.79 sim () scorings,
So as to mean that typical randomly selected a pair of colourity will produce about 0.79 sim () scorings.
In one embodiment, derived respective function match () of institute is defined as match (c1,c2)=log (PM/
PR).Fig. 5 B illustrate the sample P corresponding to Fig. 5 AMAnd PRThe curve map of sample the match () function of probability density function.
Due to the property of logarithm, log (PM/PR)=log PM-log PR.Therefore, 0 match () scorings indicate log PM
(sim(c1,c2))=log PR(sim(c1,c2)), i.e. PM(sim(c1,c2))=PR(sim(c1,c2)), so as to mean and color
Degree c1And c2Only have a case that randomly selected colourity is distinctive to compare response, colourity c1And c2Will not be with more semantic right
Should.Sample the match () function of Fig. 5 B is directed to about 0.83 (PMAnd PRCurve map intersect in fig. 5 part value) input tool
There is value 0.
Further, since log Π Pi=Σ log Pi(that is, event P for occurring togetheriThe logarithm of probability be equal to indivedual generations
Event probability logarithm summation) logarithmic property, from the derived respective function of institute of the successive range of colourity pair
The summation of the scoring of match () is equal to the logarithm of the combined probability of the matching in the scope.Therefore, the scoring X of the scope is (i.e.,
In all right of the scope<ci,cj>The scoring Σ log (P of upper assessmentM(sim(ci,cj))/PR(sim(ci,cj))) in a pair of languages
The possibility occurred in corresponding sequence in justice is the e in randomly selected a pair of sequencesXTimes.Because match () scores very
To the quantity of the colourity pair being not dependent in matching range, so the unbiased of the subsequence of different length is relatively possible.Example
Such as, the occurrent short subsequence with strong matching is also impossible to as the long sub-sequence with weak matching will be assigned
Identical cumulative match () scoring.
Consequently, because the matching scoring of the successive range of colourity pair is not dependent on length, and because therefore different length
The matching of subsequence can meaningfully be compared, so the matching scoring of single scope can be determined and be applied to any length
Scope, so as to constitute cut-off scoring, wherein being taken as an indication that less than the scoring of cut-off scoring non-matching, and be more than or equal to
The scoring of cut-off scoring is taken as an indication that matching.The subsequence that cannot meaningfully compare different length matching scoring its
In its system, it is difficult to select the cut-off scoring for producing good accurate rate and both good recall ratios (recall).For example, for reality
The Mean match scoring 5 of the colourity pair of the subsequence of length 10 on border is approximately equal to the Mean match scoring on the subsequence of length 20
For 3 system, the cut-off of average score 5 or the cut-off of average score 3 all without the well suited subsequence in length 10 with
Both subsequences of length 20.For example, the high cut-off scoring for producing good accurate rate (that is, reducing false positive) is selected (for example, to exist
In examples detailed above, 5) tend to excessively guard, and cause inferior recall ratio (i.e., it is impossible to recognize many matched wells)；On the contrary
The low cut-off scoring for producing good recall ratio (that is, recognizing most matched wells) is selected (i.e., in the above-described example, 3) to tend to
It is overly aggressive and produce inferior accurate rate (that is, by many inferior match cognizations be matched well).Compared to these, other are
System is generally speaking good because match () score value mentioned above is consistent across the subsequence of different length
Single cut-off suitable for subsequence can be chosen, regardless of whether sub-sequence length, and therefore good accurate rate can be produced and not
Recall ratio is sacrificed, vice versa.Therefore, ending match () scorings can be chosen --- manually and rule of thumb, or it is based on
The training set of the subsequence with known good and inferior matching and programmatically --- to recognize the sub- sequence of random length
" good " matching of row, and end scoring will with regard to both accurate rate and recall ratio the favourable result of generation.
It should be noted that the scoring produced by function match () is in the sense independently of the specific initial correspondence for being used
Function (for example, sim () above)：Scoring has property discussed herein above, regardless of whether the initial respective function for being used is such as
What.For example, no matter the initial respective function for being used, the match () scorings 0 of a pair of colourities indicate to compare this pair of colourity
Situation about being selected at random, this pair will not be with more semantic correspondence.
Audio analysis module 105 optionally includes approximate generation module 350, wherein approximate generation module 350 is produced approximately
Function match () and the function that can relatively efficiently calculate.For example, in one embodiment, approximate generation module 350 calculates shape
Formula is (anxn+an-1xn-1+…+a1x+a0)/(bmxm+bm-1xm-1+…+b1x+b0) reasonable interpolating function, wherein coefficient aiAnd bj
It is the parameter for being calculated for defining reasonable interpolating function.Assume that molecule and denominator are defined by polynomial function, then molecule and point
Mother can effectively be calculated.
Audio analysis module 105 is optionally comprising audio frequency correspondence identification module 360, the corresponding identification module 360 of its sound intermediate frequency
Semanteme correspondence between identification tonic train.Specifically, the first tonic train and the second tonic train, correspondence identification mould are given
Block 360 by using to grading module 320 being produced using final match () function determined by function export module 340
Match () between the colourity pair of two tonic trains scores to recognize the sub- sequence of best match between two tonic trains
Row.The scoring that given match () function is used, correspondence identification module 360 further using subsequence identification module 330 with
The optimal son matching of identification.Correspondence identification module 360 can be next based on recognized subsequence, for example, the subsequence for being recognized
Quantity, cumulative the match () scoring (that is, the summation of the match () scorings of the colourity pair in subsequence) of the subsequence for being recognized
Or its a certain combination, and determine whether two tonic trains have semantic correspondence as overall.
The semantic corresponding ability of overall identification tonic train allows to carry out various Audio Matching operations.As from one
One example of embodiment, user whistles or hums a first song, or otherwise provides speech audio input, and sound
Frequency correspondence identification module 360 compares the known tonic train in the tonic train of the song and audio storage storehouse 101, so as to by sound
The best match of frequency sequence is presented as entirety to user, as explained above.For example, Fig. 8 is the figure according to one embodiment
Show the matching set of the song audio sequence 801 to 804 found in response to the device microphone input humming of user to user
And allow user to listen to the example user interface of these tonic trains.In change, user is for example by uploading containing music
The file of fragment provides non-karst areas audio input to match with known songs.As another example from one embodiment,
System compares given tonic train with the known tonic train that all rights reserved to recognize using audio frequency correspondence identification module 360
Possible infringement of copyright.For example, audio server 100 itself can all rights reserved for being present in audio storage storehouse 101
Tonic train and check the new tonic train for submitting to audio storage storehouse 101, so as to if it find that have relative to copyright institute
The semanteme correspondence of some tonic trains, then the new tonic train of mark.Used as the yet another embodiment from one embodiment, system makes
Identification module 360 is corresponded to audio frequency to compare user speech with known language model to perform speech recognition.
Fig. 6 is to illustrate calculating P according to one embodimentMAnd PR(and depending on PMAnd PRMatch () function) when
Audio analysis module 105 operation data flowchart.
In step 610, audio analysis module 105 for example as above for input set formed module 310 discuss and
Set up input set SMAnd SR.Audio analysis module 105 is also based on set SRTo calculate 620 function PR, and by function PMInitially
- the 2x of function 2 is turned to, as discussed above.
In order to calculate preferred function PM, audio analysis module 105 based on derived respective function match () of institute (its then
