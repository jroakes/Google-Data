- Embodiments of a system and method for improving access to network content are described herein. Aspects of the disclosure minimize the delay between a user's selection of a navigation event and display of the content associated with the navigation event by prerendering content associated with the navigation event prior to the user's selection of the event. For example, the method and system may predict a likely next uniform resource locator during web browsing to preemptively request content from the network before the user selects the corresponding link, thus minimizing the wait time when a user selects a hyperlink on a web page.
- Various methods for performing the prerendering operation, configuring the prerendering operation, and managing the prerendering operation are described.
- prerendering generally refers to the act of requesting all resources (e.g., any executable code, scripting language, files, and/or interactive objects) necessary to load the content of a web address, and loading the content in a web browser instance .
- resources e.g., any executable code, scripting language, files, and/or interactive objects
- data, metrics, and indicators may be used to select a particular navigation event for prerendering.
- aspects of the disclosure may attempt to determine the most likely navigation event based on historical data associated with user browsing habits.
- One set of metrics that may be useful for predicting a likely navigation event may utilize the relationship of links on a web page to the web page. For example, a user may be more likely to select a link that is at a particular location on a given page (e.g., a top news headline or breaking news alert on a news page), associated with a particular page frame, associated with a particular hypertext markup language (HTML) style, or located at a particular place in a document-object model hierarchy.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Methods and systems may also be employed to identify correlations in the relationship of previously selected links to a particular page. For example, there may be a particularly strong correlation between links associated with a "headline" location on a news website, but a weaker correlation between selection of a link in the same style on a business or reference website.
- the system can provide privacy protections for the client data including, for example, anonymization of personally identifiable information, aggregation of data, filtering of sensitive information, encryption, hashing or filtering of sensitive information to remove personal attributes, time limitations on storage of information, and/or limitations on data use or sharing.
- Data can be anonymized and aggregated such that individual client data is not revealed.
- a user may also be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out to enable the collection of sharing of data.

- the instructions 106 may comprise an application for a web browser 110.
- the web browser 110 may be operable to display network content, such as web pages, to a user of the client 100.
- the web browser 110 may perform prerendering functions using a prerender module 114, where content is retrieved and rendered in a hidden browser instance before the user actually selects the network content for display. In this manner, delay in the display of network content may be minimized by performing network and rendering operations in parallel with the user's other browsing activities.
- the instructions 106 may include a prerender module 114 for receiving navigation and location history data from the client 100, for predicting a navigation event using information stored in the data 108, such as a navigation history and metadata 116, or for providing the client with the predicted navigation event (e.g., by identifying an embedded prerender tag in content provided by a server) .

- the hidden rendering environment refers to any representation that does not have an immediately apparent interface for the user.
- the prerendered web page 112 may be stored within a browser "tab" that does not have an associated selection control in a web browser tab interface.
- the hidden rendering environment may be accessible via a menu or interface command, and in response to the selection of this interface command an interface for the prerendered content is generated, such as by adding a selection control for the prerendered content to the browser tab interface.
- the hidden rendering environment may also be provided by a variety of other methods suitable to receive and render the page environment while avoiding distraction of the user with potentially irrelevant content.
- the prerendered web page 112 may be stored in a completely executed and rendered format. For example, any executable code, scripting language, multimedia files, and/or interactive objects may be fully requested and loaded in the prerendering environment.
- the browser 110110 may swap the prerendered web page 112 into an active browser instance, thus providing the content associated with the navigation event without the need to send another network request.
- the data 108 may be retrieved, stored or modified by the processor 102 in accordance with the instructions 106.

- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 200 for prerendering a web page based upon a predicted navigation event in accordance with aspects of the disclosure. Aspects of the method 200 operate to identify one or more likely navigation destinations from a set of navigation indicators, and then prerender the identified navigation destinations.
- the method 200 may be performed by a computing device, such as the computing device 100, to eliminate delays in the user web browsing experience by prerendering web pages that are identified as likely navigation targets by the user.
- the method 200 may be performed by elements of the browser 110. While aspects of the method 200 are described with respect to the computing device 100, the method 200 may also be performed by the server 104, or any device with hardware and/or software designed to accept instructions.
- the computing device 100 receives one or more indicators of navigational intent.
- Navigational intent may be any action that would tend to indicate that the user will generate a particular network request, such as a request for a particular web page.
- the indicators may provide metrics by which to determine what the particular request will be, such as a confidence value.
- the user may navigate to a certain web page, from which they generally navigate to another certain web page based upon their browsing history, or the user may move his mouse cursor towards a particular hyperlink embedded within a web page.
- the indicator is received from a remote server, such as a search engine that embeds an indicator within search results, indicating that most users that submit a particular search query select a particular search result .
- the computing device 100 attempts to predict the most likely navigation event. In short, the computing device 100 makes a best guess of to where the user is likely to navigate next, based upon the indicator. Methods of performing this prediction are described below (see Figures 4-12) .
- the computing device 100 prerenders the content from the predicted next navigation event as determined at stage 204.
- the prerendering process may include storing a prerendered web page within a browser, such as the prerendered web page 115.
- the computing device 100 may prerender a single web page predicted as the most likely navigation event, or the computing device 100 may prerender multiple pages.
- the computing device 100 determines the number of pages to prerender based upon one or more system capabilities of the computing device 100, such as available system resources, available network bandwidth, processor speed, installed memory, and the like. In some aspects, the number of pages to prerender may be configurable in one or more user settings.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 300 for indicating a navigation event to prerender.
- the server hosting the content such as the server 104
- a server may embed a prerender tag or tags within a hosted page, instructing the browser 110 of the computing device 100 in which content to render.
- prerender targets may be determined irrespective of links available in the browser interface. For example, prerender targets may be identified from user navigation histories and browsing habits, without the need to examine links on a page visible in the browser.
- one or more links are identified within a hosted web page. For example, a list of websites may be generated in response to a query from the computing device 100. Each search result may be associated with a particular link on the page that is to be provided in response to the query.
- one or more links are selected to be prerendered, chosen from the links identified at stage 302.
- the links to prerender may be chosen by a variety of methods for a variety of purposes, such as by examining a user navigation history, an aggregate navigation history, a most relevant link, and the like.
- the links are chosen by a search engine analyzing the links most frequently clicked in response to a particular query. For example, the search engine may collect "click-through" data indicating which links are clicked on in response to a particular query, and select one or more links to prerender based upon the frequency with which the particular links are selected.
- the server 104 might identify the top search result, or the top "n" search results as optimal links to prerender.
- the links may be ranked to identify a ranking of links to prerender, with the most optimal link to prerender being ranked number 1, the next most optimal link being ranked number 2, and so on.
- a likelihood may be identified that each link will be selected, rather than a rank. For example, it may be indicated that a particular link has a 50% likelihood, a 25% likelihood, or a 80% likelihood of being selected by a user.
- Prerender operations performed by the client may elect to prerender links associated with a threshold level of likelihood, for example, such as at least 50% likelihood, at least 80% likelihood, or any other threshold value.
- prerender tags are embedded with the one or more links identified at stage 304.
- a hypertext markup language (HTML) tag may be included in the page for identifying the optimal link or links to prerender.
- the prerender tag may also include a ranking value and a TTL value specifying a time to keep the prerender.
- each search result may be associated with a prerender tag, along with ranking the prerender order of the results by the relevance of the search result.
- the page with the embedded prerender tags is sent to the client that requested the page.
- the method 300 then ends after sending the page.
- Figure 4 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 400 for predicting a navigation event based on a client navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 400 provides for storing a navigation history for a user, and predicting a next navigation event based upon a navigation history of a particular user.
- the method 400 may be performed by a computing device such as the computing device 100.
- the method 400 may be performed by a browser executing on a processor, such as the browser 110.
- the computing device 100 tracks a user's navigation history.
- the computing device 100 may store records of web pages visited by the user, such as the browsing history commonly maintained in web browsers.
- the browsing history may comprise the URLs of the web pages visited by the user, the order in which the URLs were visited, and the manner in which the user selected the URL (e.g., whether the URL was a clicked hyperlink, typed into an address bar, a redirect operation from another web page, etc . ) .
- the computing device 100 determines a most likely navigation event or events based upon the user navigation history.
- the most likely navigation events may be determined by identifying the globally most visited pages for the user, or the navigation events may be associated with one or more current criteria. For example, the computing device 100 may examine the user's navigation history to determine that, when the user is viewing a particular news web page, they almost always select a link to the top news story on that page, or that when the user first opens the browser in the morning, they are likely to navigate to their bank account page to check their daily balance.
- the computing device 100 may employ various rules, heuristics, and filters to determine the most likely navigation event from the user history.
- the computing device 100 may associate each navigation event with a particular confidence value, indicating the likelihood that the user will select each navigation event. These confidence values may then be used to sort the navigation events to determine the most likely navigation event . A method to determine a confidence value for a given navigation event is described further below (see Figure 5 ) .
- the computing device 100 reports the most likely navigation event as the predicted navigation event. For example, these predicted most likely navigation event may then be employed by the method described above (see Figure 2) to facilitate prerendering of the web pages associated with the most likely navigation event.
- Figure 5 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 500 for computing a confidence value for a URL using a user navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 500 is operable to track navigation events input by the user and to maintain a frequency value for each stored event.
- the method 500 may be employed to build a client navigation history as used by the method 400, and stored on the computing device 100.
- the computing device 100 tracks the selection of a particular URL. For example, the user may type a URL for a news site into the browser, or click a link on a page.
- the computing device 100 may monitor the navigation events using functionality built into the browser 110, through a browser extension such as a plug-in or toolbar, or via a third party application executing in tandem with the browser.
- the computing device 100 increments a frequency value associated with the URL selected at stage 502.
- the computing device 100 may track a frequency value associated with each URL selected by a user.
- the frequency value is a data metric used to rank a number of visits to a particular web site or the number of times a particular navigation event is selected.
- the computing device 100 may increment the frequency value associated with the URL, for example by 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, .5, or any other value.
- the frequency value associated with the URL represents how often the user has selected the particular URL, and thus is an indicator of how likely the user is to select the URL in the future.
- the computing device 100 time decays the stored frequency values for the URLs after a given "sweep interval" . Decaying the URL frequency values in this manner allows for current browsing habits to be more heavily weighted than previous browsing habits.
- the computing device 100 may execute the sweep every 30 seconds, every minute, or every 5 minutes during which the user has selected at least one URL.
- the sweep interval may be conducted in response to the selection of at least one URL during a particular sweep interval to ensure that the navigation history values are not decayed below a threshold value during periods where the user is inactive.
- the sweep may decay the stored frequency value associated with the URL by a particular value, such as .99, .5, or 1.0, or by a percentage value, such as 5%, 10%, or 50%.
- the URL may be removed from the list of possible navigation destinations to avoid the list growing too large.
- the frequency values for the URLs may be persisted to a local storage on the computing device 100, or sent to a remote storage .
- the stored frequency values may be used to determine the relative frequency with which the user visits particular web sites.
- the frequency value thus provides a basis from which a confidence value associated with a navigation event leading to each web site may be derived.
- the frequency value itself may be provided as the confidence value.
- the confidence value is determined by comparing a frequency value for a particular web page with the entire user navigation history. For example, the navigation event with the higher frequency value may be associated with a particular percentage confidence value, the second highest frequency value a lower percentage, and the like.
- the confidence value is determined by frequency value by the total number of logged navigation events. For example, the frequency value of a particular URL may be divided by the sum of all frequency values to determine a confidence value.
- a user may be in the process of buying a home, and thus regularly checking financial and banking websites for mortgage rates. During this time, these financial and banking sites would have high values and thus be more likely to be prerendered, thus improving the user experience while searching for a mortgage rate. After completing the home purchase process, the user is likely to lose interest in day to day rate fluctuations, and thus it is no longer optimal to prerender these websites, since the user is unlikely to visit them. As such, providing for a time decay value allows these sites to fall off of the list over time .
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 600 for predicting a navigation event based on an aggregate navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 600 is operable to track navigation events voluntarily submitted by users to determine likely navigation patterns.
- the navigation patterns are then analyzed and supplied to the user to facilitate navigation event prediction during the browsing process.
- a server may send updates to a computing device, such as the computing device 100, as the user browses to different pages, to provide information on which link displayed on a given page is most likely to be selected based on the aggregate navigation history.
- the navigation history may include location data, as described below (see Figures 8- 10) .
- a set of navigation information comprising a browsing history is received by a computing device, such as the computing device 100.
- the browsing history is preferably provided by using an "opt-in/out" method, where the user specifically enables (or disables) reporting functionality to provide elements of their browsing history to the computing device 100.
- personally identifying data can be anonymized and aggregated before it is stored or used, such that no personal information is stored or accessible.
- a browsing history may be tracked and provided to the computing device 100 via a browser plug-in or toolbar installed on the user's computing device which tracks the user's browsing history, or by the web browser itself.
- the browsing history may be combined with other received browsing histories to create a set of aggregate data used in a similar manner as the client navigation history described with respect to Figure 4, to predict a likely navigation event.
- the received navigation history may be anonymized to remove any personally identifying information.
- the received navigation history is received with individual URLs and/or transitional URL pairs provided in a hashed data format to remove any personally identifying information .
- the computing device 100 determines a confidence value for each URL on a particular web page, based on the navigation information received at stage 602.
- the server may employ a method similar to that disclosed above with respect to Figure 5 for generating confidence values for URLs on a page, except the navigation events are determined based upon aggregated data instead of specific user data.
- the computing device 100 may compute confidence values based upon the frequency values derived from the navigation information. In some aspects, confidence values are determined by the percentage of the time that users selected a particular navigation event when they were presented with the choice to select the particular navigation event.
- the transitional URL pairs provide for the determination of a confidence value by dividing a frequency value of a source/destination URL pair by a total number of appearances of the source URL.
- the server may determine navigation events based upon transitions from a first page to a second page, rather than from a pure visit frequency metric.
- the computing device 100 may maintain an index of web pages and associated URLs and confidence values for each link on the web page, such as in a database. For example, a news site may have five URLs pointing to different news stories. The computing device 100 may receive aggregate data indicating that one of the five news stories is selected 60% of the time, with the other four being selected 10% of the time each. As such, the computing device 100 would index the page in a database with a 60% likelihood for the first story link, and 10% likelihoods for each of the other four story links .
- the computing device 100 maintains history data in a confidential manner, such as by converting each URL to a hash value at stage 606.
- the computing device 100 may provide predicted URL data to a client device without disclosing any personal user data. For example, a user may visit a banking web page that has a particular user name and password login. Depending upon the user, the banking web page may provide URLs to each account the user possesses. Each user accessing the page may have a different set of links provided, depending upon the accounts the user has with the bank.
- the computing device 100 may provide confidence values that are not associable to links on the page unless the user also possesses access to the same links (e.g., the client can apply the hash function to links they already possess on the currently viewed page to determine if the confidence values apply) .
- the hash value is computed by the computing device 100 prior to sending navigation history data to the server 104. In this manner, the computing device 100 may receive the navigation history data in the hashed format, without the need to compute a hash value.
- the computing device 100 may transmits the hash values and confidence values associated with the hash values to another device.
- the transmittal may be in response to a request from the computing device 100 for a particular URL.
- the computing device 100 may transmit the hash values and confidence values in response to a request for such values from a service executing on the computing device 100. For example, when the computing device 100 requests the news web page described above, the computing device 100 may provide the hash values and confidence values for the five story links present on that page.
- the computing device 100 may also request data for particular link hash values by first generating a hash value on the client side, then requesting a confidence value for the particular hash value.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 700 for computing a confidence value for navigation events associated with a URL using an aggregate navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 700 serves to compare navigation events from a given URL received from a plurality of users, in order to determine how likely each individual navigation event is.
- the confidence values may be determined in relation to a particular "source" web page, with different confidence values for each URL depending upon the page the user is currently viewing. For example, the confidence values may be used above as described with respect to stage 604 of the method 600 (see Figure 6) .
- the method 700 is described using the server 104 as an example, the method 700 (as with other methods in this disclosure) may also be performed by the client 102 to identify prerendering targets.
- the computing device 100 examines received browsing histories and computes a number of instances for each navigation event as associated with a particular URL.
- the instance value may be a percentage or a raw number .
- the computing device 100 may determine if the number of visits to the URL exceeds a minimum threshold of statistical significance. For example, five visits to a particular URL may not provide statistically significant data sufficient to reasonably predict a likely navigation event away from the URL. For example, if the number of instances of the event is less than 1000, the computing device 100 may proceed to stage 710, and not calculate a probability for the event because the sample size is insufficient.
- the computing device 100 may determine if a minimum number of users have submitted data regarding the URL to provide statistically significant data. For example, the method 700 may require that at least 50 users have provided data in order to compute and store a confidence value for the navigation event. Otherwise the method 700 may proceed to stage 710 and disregard the event until a sufficient number of users have provided data. As above, the threshold value may fluctuate depending upon the size of the dataset.
- the computing device 100 determines a window size of recent instances.
- the window size refers to the number of latest visits to the URL that will be examined to determine the confidence value, or a length of time to search back through the instances.
- the window size may be determined based on the amount of traffic the URL receives, how often the content of the URL changes. For example, a news website that has constantly changing content might require a small instance window, because links from the regularly changing URL would grow stale. A website with a small amount of traffic would typically require a longer window size in order to gather enough results for statistical significance.
- the window size might be set at 50 instances, 100 instances, 1000 instances, all instances within the last hour, within the last day, within the last week, or the like.
- the computing device 100 computes the number of times each particular navigation event, such as the next URL visited for the current URL, occurs within the instances defined by the window size determined at stage 710. For example, out of 1000 visits to a news website, a particular article might be selected 600 times, resulting in a confidence value of 60% for navigating to that article from the URL.
- While the present example primarily relates to determination of a navigation event based upon a number of accesses as a percentage of total navigation events, additional heuristics may also be used to derive the likely event based upon information supplied by the user, such as the previous navigation event (e.g., the website that led to the currently analyzed URL), the time of day (e.g., users are more likely to check news sites when in the morning when they arrive at work), the user's location (e.g., users in a particular geographic region are likely to check sports scores for local teams), or other demographic information.
- the previous navigation event e.g., the website that led to the currently analyzed URL
- the time of day e.g., users are more likely to check news sites when in the morning when they arrive at work
- the user's location e.g., users in a particular geographic region are likely to check sports scores for local teams
- the computing device 100 optionally compares the confidence values for the navigations events from the URL with a threshold value. If the confidence values do not meet the threshold value, the computing device 100 may identify a subset of available navigation events, as possible predicted likely navigation events. In this manner the computing device 100 avoids predicting navigation events when the event does not have a statistically significant likelihood of occurring, thus potentially saving bandwidth on prerender operations on pages that are unlikely to be visited.
- the threshold may be set at a variety of different values, such as 5%, 25%, 50%, or 75%. In some aspects, the threshold may be dynamically altered based upon the number of navigation links present at the URL, the type of URL, the traffic of the URL, the speed at which content changes at the URL, and the like. If the confidence values do not meet the minimum threshold, the server 104 may filter out the possible events that do not meet the minimum threshold.
- FIG. 8 is an illustration depicting an example of a web page 800 rendered in a browser employing a relationship of a page link to a source page to predict a navigation event in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the depicted web page 800 shows multiple links that are associated with the page www. a.
- www. a. com may be assumed to be a news site with a headline link 804 and multiple subheadings, for instance subheading A 806, subheading B 808, and subheading C 810.
- the headline link 804 is associated with an article entitled "Man Bites Dog!”
- the page source may identify particular styles, properties, or text to be associated with each of the links 804-810.
- the headline link 804 may be associated with a "heading" style and placed in a separate frame at the top of the page within the page DOM, and the subheadings 806, 808, 810 may be assigned to a "subheading" style and placed in a separate frame from the headline link 804.
- the computing device 100 may store information describing the relationship of the selected page to the selected link. For example, if the headline link 804 is selected, the link may be stored along with data indicating the link's place in the page DOM, the style associated with the link, text associated with the link, or the physical location on the web page.
- Figure 9 is an illustration depicting another example of a web page 900 rendered in a browser employing a relationship of a page link to a source page to predict a navigation event in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the web page 900 depicts another rendering of the site associated with the address www. a, com, as depicted in the browser address bar 902.
- the web page 900 is associated with a different set of links than the web page 800. This represents how links on a page may change over time. For example, news sites typically update their headline articles multiple times in a given day. In systems and methods where only destination URLs or source/destination pairs of URLs are tracked, repeated browsing of such sites might not provide useful data for predicting navigation events, as the destination URLs stored as part of the navigation history would constantly change as the articles displayed on the main news sites changed .
- the web page 900 depicts a headline link 904 associated with an article "Unexpected Event happenss! and a set of subheading links subheading D 906, subheading E 908, and subheading F 910. These links may be associated with different destination URLs than the links depicted with respect to Figure 8, but a user may still be likely to be attracted to the same link. As such, if the user has established that they tend to select a link in a headline position when visiting www. a. com, the headline link 904 may be identified as a predicted link for prerendering purposes .
- link metadata A method for identifying a correlation between data associated with a link (hereafter, link metadata) is described further below (see Figure 10) .
- Figure 10 is a flow diagram depicting an example of a method 1000 for gathering data to identify correlations between a web page and link metadata in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 1000 allows for metadata associated with links selected by the user to be stored so that said metadata may be used in link prediction operations associated with the same source web page.
- a link is selected for navigation. For example, a user may select a hyperlink from the web page to indicate that the user wishes to view the page associated with the hyperlink.
- the stored metadata may include information other than the destination address of the link.
- the metadata may include one or more of text associated with the display of the link, a coordinate location of the link within the page, one or more fonts or styles associated with the selected link, the location of the link within the page DOM hierarchy, or any other data describing the relationship of the selected link to the web page.
- the stored metadata may then be used to identify correlations between user behavior and the relationship of the selected link to the web page for prediction of navigation events .
- FIG. 11 is a flow diagram depicting an example of a method 1100 for predicting next navigation events using correlations between a web page and link metadata in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- metadata for previously selected links may be stored along with data indicating which link was selected. This metadata may be analyzed to identify correlations between link metadata and a given web page or web pages. For example, as described above (see Figures 8- 9), a user may typically select a link associated with a headline of a news page.
- a navigation history associated with a particular web page may be accessed.
- the particular web page may be associated with a web page that a user is currently viewing, for the purpose of predicting the navigation event the user is likely to select.
- the particular web page may be analyzed as part of an "offline" process whereby data is correlated and processed separate from browsing activities.
- the navigation history may be a set of data stored in a navigation history and metadata 116 structure as described above (see Figure 1) .
- a data structure may be indexed by source web page, or correlations may be drawn across data collected for all possible source web pages, or all pages of a particular type (e.g., news pages, blogs, or reference pages).
- a particular type e.g., news pages, blogs, or reference pages.
- correlations may be identified between link metadata and navigation events associated with the page or pages.
- Different types of metadata may be examined to identify which metadata characteristics appear most frequently in the navigation history associated with the page or pages. For example, a majority of the particular navigation events associated with a news page may have metadata that indicates the selected link was displayed in a headline style or had the text "Giraffe" in text associated with the link.
- Correlations may be identified across sets of metadata as well. For example, a user may have established browsing habits whereby they frequently select links associated with the text "Zebra", but only when those links appear in a subheadline style. Negative correlations may also be identified. For example, users may be much less likely to select a link that appears in a frame marked "advertisement" or when the link is located in a lower frame or table of the page DOM.
- the strongest correlation or correlations among the link metadata are identified to be used in navigation prediction operations.
- this correlation data may be stored in the navigation history data structure to be associated with a particular page, a particular type of page, or all pages in aggregate for future reference.
- negative correlations e.g., a user is much less likely to select a link with a particular characteristic
- the determined correlations are used to predict navigation events that are most likely to occur.
- the correlations may be used to determine navigation events from the same page from which the navigation history is derived, or from other subsets, combinations, and/or aggregations of pages.
- the stages of the illustrated methods are not intended to be limiting. The functionality of the methods can exist in a fewer or greater number of stages than what is shown and, even with the depicted methods, the particular order of events may be different from what is shown in the figures .
- URLs may be reinterpreted as a function of the web page they are contained in, and the location in which they appear. Although different URLs may be presented at different points in time on the same web page, each of them may be resolved into an identical logical transition. For instance, the top news story on a web page may change daily, hourly, etc. Thus, one news story may have a transition of www. a. com/ -> www . a . com/politics/Primaries , while another such news story may have a transition of www. a. com/ -> www . a . com/politics/Protest . A more beneficial representation for both stories could be www. a. com/ ->
- the systems and methods described herein advantageously provide for an improved browsing experience.
- the system and methods minimize the amount of time users wait for network content to load.
- links may be predicted even where user data regarding specific destination URLs is not present.
- Page location, DOM position, and URL text matching provides additional metrics to improve prerendering accuracy and coverage, thereby providing time savings to the user while minimizing wasted system resources on prerendering target links that the user does not select.
