Definitions
- An autonomous vehicle may use various computing systems to aid in the transport of passengers from one location to another.
- the autonomous vehicle may require an initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger.
- Other autonomous systems for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the autonomous vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the autonomous vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- the autonomous vehicle may be equipped with various types of sensors in order to detect objects in its environment.
- the autonomous vehicles may include such sensors as lasers, sonar, radar, cameras, and other sensors that scan and record data from the autonomous vehicle's environment. Sensor data from one or more of these sensors may be used to detect objects and their respective characteristics (position, shape, heading, speed, etc.). This detection and identification is a critical function for the safe operation of the autonomous vehicle.
- the autonomous vehicle may rely on a prior stored electronic representation of the environment (e.g., a roadway, a highway, etc.).

- This disclosure generally relates to an autonomous driving computer system configured to determine whether a driving environment of a vehicle has changed.
- the autonomous driving computer system may have stored the previous locations of one or more objects from a driving environment. The autonomous driving computer system may then compare the prior locations of those one or more objects with the current locations of those one or more objects as they then are detected in the driving environment.
- the autonomous driving computer system may store the previous locations of the left and right lane edge boundaries, and then, while the vehicle is subsequently navigating the driving environment, the autonomous driving computer system may compare the location of the detected left and right lane edge boundaries with the stored previous locations. If there is a significant difference between the locations of these two sets of boundaries, the autonomous driving computer system may conclude that stored detailed map information map is no longer accurate. The autonomous driving computer system may then stop relying on its stored detailed map information and, instead, rely on other information or feedback to navigate the driving environment (e.g., using a wireless connection to obtain detailed map information or requesting manual operation of the vehicle).

- a given lane may be associated with left and right lane lines or other lane markers that define the boundary of the lane. Thus, most lanes may be bounded by a left edge of one lane line and a right edge of another lane line.
- the detailed map information 136 may also include information about previously identified core or primary objects relied upon by the autonomous driving computer system 106 in determining whether a driving environment (e.g., a road, highway, etc.) has changed.

- Individual objects, such as a house, restaurant, rest stop, or other such object, may also be identified as a core object.
- the detailed map information 136 may also include the prior identification of object types as core object types. For example, while a specific k-rail concrete barrier or billboard may be identified as a primary object, the detailed map information 136 may be configured such that all k-rail concrete barriers and/or all billboards are identified as primary object types.
- traffic safety cones may be identified as a primary object type for one road, such as U.S. Route 1, but traffic safety cones may not be identified as a primary object type for another road, such as Interstate 95.
- object types and/or individual objects may be hierarchically classified.
- a first object type such as lane markers
- a second object type such as k-rail concrete barriers
- the hierarchical classification of object types and/or objects may be used in evaluating whether there is an actual discrepancy in the detailed map information 136 versus the driving environment of the autonomous vehicle 104 .
- different driving environments may have different hierarchical classifications (e.g., traffic safety cones may be considered a primary object type in one driving environment, but may be considered a secondary object type in a different, second driving environment).
- the identification of primary object types for determining discrepancies in the detailed map information 136 may be done in a variety of ways.
- the identification of primary object types may be performed by manually programming the autonomous driving computer system 106 .
- the user may configure the autonomous driving computer system 106 to identify certain object types, such as lane edges, lane reflectors, etc., as primary object types and other objects, such as traffic safety cones and other objects, as secondary object types.
- the user may configure the autonomous driving computer system 106 to identify specific objects (as opposed to object types) as primary objects.
- One example may be a well-known object, such as a restaurant, bridge, or other such object. It is also possible that the autonomous driving computer system 106 is configured such that there is no distinction between a primary object type and a secondary object type.
- the identification of primary object types may be performed automatically.

- the server 402 may comprise a plurality of computers, e.g., a load balancing server farm, that exchange information with different nodes of a network for the purpose of receiving, processing and transmitting the data from the autonomous driving computer system 106 .
- the server 402 may be configured similarly to the autonomous driving computer system 106 (i.e., having a processor 404 , a memory 406 , instructions 408 , and data 410 ).
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example of a detailed map 502 including an exemplary section of roadway (as well as information outside of the range of the laser).
- the detailed map 502 of the section of roadway may include such information as information about a solid lane line 504 , broken lane lines 506 , 508 , and double solid lane lines 510 .
- These lane lines may define lanes 512 and 514 .

- the lane 512 may be bounded by a right lane line 504 and a left lane line 506
- the lane 514 is bounded by a right lane line 506 and a left lane line 510 .
- the edges for lane 512 are edges 520 , 522 while the edges for lane 514 are edges 524 , 526 .
- the detailed map information may be depicted as an image-based map.
- the map information need not be entirely or completely image-based (e.g., raster-based).
- the detailed map information may include one or more roadgraphs or graph networks of information such as roads, lanes, intersections, and the connections between these features.
- Each feature may be stored as graph data and may be associated with information such as a geographic location and whether or not it is linked to other related features, for example, a stop sign may be linked to a road and an intersection, etc.
- the associated data may include grid-based indices of a roadgraph to allow for efficient lookup of certain roadgraph features.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may also receive or transfer information to and from other computers.
- the detailed map information 136 stored by the memory 110 may be received or transferred from other computers.
- the sensor data collected from the sensors of the vehicle 104 may be transferred to another computer for processing as described herein.
- the instructions 112 may include various algorithms for determining whether a driving environment (e.g., a road, a highway, a street, etc.) has changed since the driving environment information was last included in the detailed map information 136 .
- the instructions 112 may include one or more object detection algorithms 138 and one or more map discrepancy algorithms 140 for determining whether such changes have occurred.
- the object detection algorithm 138 may facilitate the detection of objects by the autonomous driving computer system 106 .
- the object detection algorithm 138 may process laser scan data describing the intensity and location information of objects within range of the laser in order to produce a set of data points.
- objects detected by the laser may include k-rail concrete barriers, traffic safety cones, lane markings, lane reflectors, pedestrians, and other such objects.
- the objects detected by the object detection algorithm 138 may be used in determining whether the road environment has changed since the last update to the detailed map information 136 .
- the detailed map information 136 may have been updated in January, but road construction in April may have changed the layout or number of travelable road lanes.
- the objects detected by the object detection algorithm 138 may be compared with objects previously detected and identified in the detailed map information 136 to determine whether the detailed map information 136 is still accurate.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may initially determine whether the driving environment has changed based on the detection of core/primary objects.
- each beam of the laser may be associated with a respective subset of data points.
- the subset of data points may be further divided into sections.
- the average intensity and standard deviation may be used to determine a threshold intensity.
- the data points may then be generated by comparing the intensity of each data point to the threshold intensity for the section in which the data point appears and based on the elevation of the data point relative to the roadway surface.
- This algorithm may also be stored at the vehicle 104 , computer 402 or both.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may invoke a map discrepancy algorithm 140 to determine whether there is a discrepancy in the previously acquired detailed map information 136 and the driving environment of the autonomous vehicle 104 . More specifically, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may use the map discrepancy algorithm 140 to determine whether the detailed map information 136 is still accurate based on objects detected using the object detection algorithm 138 .
- the map discrepancy algorithm 140 may compare the location of an object detected by the object detection algorithm 138 with a corresponding location in the detailed map information 136 .
- the absence or presence of the detected object in the detailed map information 136 may indicate whether the driving environment has changed. For example, suppose that the autonomous vehicle 104 has detected a k-rail concrete barrier as an object in the driving environment. The absence of the k-rail concrete barrier from a corresponding location in the detailed map information 136 may indicate that the driving environment has changed. Similarly, the change in location of the detected k-rail concrete barrier (e.g., measured in feet, inches, etc.) may indicate that a change in the driving environment has occurred.
- Another example of identifying a potential discrepancy is comparing the location of detected lane markings with the corresponding location of the lane markings in the previously acquired detailed map information 136 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may initially detect and estimate the location of lane markings in a driving environment, and may then compare those estimated locations with the previously detected location of those lane markings. Mismatches or detected changes in the location of the lane markings, explained further below, may indicate that the driving environment has changed.
- the map discrepancy algorithm 140 may be configured to perform a discrepancy analysis using the location of the primary objects and/or primary object types before other objects or object types.
- the map discrepancy algorithm 140 may first use this primary group of objects and/or object types to determine whether there are discrepancies in the detailed map information 136 . Where the discrepancies are slight or there is uncertainty whether there is actually a discrepancy, the map discrepancy algorithm 140 may leverage a hierarchical classification of objects and/or object types to determine whether a discrepancy exists.
- lane markings may be considered a primary object type, but if the map discrepancy algorithm 140 is unable to conclusively determine that a discrepancy exists based on the detected locations of the lane markings, the map discrepancy algorithm 140 may analyze the detected location of k-rail concrete barriers (a possible secondary object type) and/or the detected location of traffic safety cones (a possible tertiary object type). In this manner, the map discrepancy algorithm 140 may proceed through the hierarchically classified objects and/or object types to determine whether a driving environment has changed.
- k-rail concrete barriers a possible secondary object type
- traffic safety cones a possible tertiary object type

- the vehicle 104 is depicted surrounded by laser lines 804 indicating the area around the vehicle scanned by a laser (e.g., laser 302 ).
- Each laser line may represent a series of discrete data points from a single beam. Data points from more highly reflective features such as lane lines, white paint, reflectors, traffic safety cones, or those with retroreflective properties may have a greater intensity than less reflective features.
- reference line 806 connects the data points 808 associated with a solid lane line. The reference line 806 may not be part of the laser data.
- FIG. 8 also includes data points 810 generated from light reflecting off of the double lane lines 610 (shown in FIG. 6 ) as well as distance and data points 812 generated form light reflecting off of the broken lane line 606 (shown in FIG. 6 ).
- the laser scan data of FIG. 8 may include data points generated from the laser reflecting off other objects, such as a vehicle 814 , a traffic safety cone (not shown), a k-rail concrete barrier (not shown), or any other object in the driving environment (i.e., the roadway 602 ).
- the system 106 may determine an initial estimate for the location of an object to be used in determining whether there is a discrepancy in the detailed map information 136 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine an edge of one or more of the lane lines (i.e., a primary object) based on the collected data points. Referring back to FIG. 6 , if vehicle 104 is being driven in lane 614 , the relevant edges for this lane may be those associated with double lane lines 610 and lane line 606 , in other words, edges 616 and 618 . Thus, the computer may generate an initial estimate for edge 616 and/or edge 618 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may reference the previously stored detailed map information 136 in generating the initial estimate.

To generate the initial estimate, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may first cluster generated lane marker data points, extract a general shape, and then use this general shape as an initial estimate for the lane edge.

- FIG. 9 illustrates an example of data points collected by the autonomous driving computer system 106 according to aspects of the disclosure.
- FIG. 9 illustrates a detailed view of a section of data points 902 that may have been collected by the autonomous driving computer system 106 and their relationship to the lane line 606 of FIG. 6 .
- a first subset of data points 904 may be associated with a black or darker area of the roadway, while a second subset of data points 906 may be associated with a lane line.
- the first subset of data points 904 may have a lower intensity value than the second subset of data points 906 and are thus depicted as grey (rather than black).
- FIG. 9 illustrates collecting data points from the reflectivity of one or more lane lines
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may collect data points based on the reflectivity of any type of object.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may be configured to collect and analyze data points from a variety of objects, including lane lines, such as k-rail concrete barriers, traffic safety cones, billboards etc. During the analysis phase of the collected data points, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may then determine the type of objects represented by the collected data points.
- lane lines such as k-rail concrete barriers, traffic safety cones, billboards etc.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may then determine the type of objects represented by the collected data points.
- similar analysis of the collected data points may be performed for other types of objects as well.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may use the previously identified location of the lane line 506 from the detailed map information 136 .
- lane line 506 of the detailed map information 136 may correspond to the physical lane line 606 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may use the location of the edge 524 of the lane line 506 as an initial estimate 908 of the edge 616 of the lane line 606 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may reference the prior location of an object (e.g., a k-rail concrete barrier, lane line, traffic safety cone, etc.) to determine the type of object represented by the collected data points.
- an object e.g., a k-rail concrete barrier, lane line, traffic safety cone, etc.
- the current physical location of edge 616 differs from its previously stored location (i.e., the location of edge 524 ). For example, it may be that construction or a vehicle accident has caused a shift in one or more of the lane lines 604 - 606 .
- the distance difference 910 may correspond to the difference in distance between the detected lane edge 616 and the lane edge estimate 908 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine whether the driving environment has changed (e.g., one or more lane lines have shifted) based on the distance difference 910 between a detected object and its previously stored location.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may use an initial estimate 908 of the edge 616 of the lane line 606 to generate additional possible estimates.
- a set of possible locations for the edge 616 of the lane line 606 may be generated by offsetting the initial estimate 908 to the left and to the right (relative to the lane line).
- the offset may be a relatively small distance, for example, a centimeter or less, and may be repeated in each direction for a much larger distance, for example, 1 meter.
- the distance difference 910 may be used in determining the offset for the subsequent estimates.
- FIG. 10 illustrates one example of offsetting the initial estimate 908 to derive further estimates of the lane 606 according to aspects of the disclosure.
- the offsets may include six offsets 1002 - 1012 , two to the right and four to the left of the initial estimate 910 . Each of these offsets may separated by an offset distance of ⁇ d.
- the offset distance ⁇ d may be consistent between each of the estimates or it may differ.
- the value of the offset distance ⁇ d may correspond to the distance value of the distance difference 910 between the detected lane edge 616 and the lane edge estimate 908 based on the prior location of the lane edge 524 .
- Each estimate 1002 - 1012 of the set of estimates may be evaluated to determine how likely a particular estimate is to be the actual lane line edge (i.e., lane line edge 616 ).
- Various criteria may be used in this determination.
- the object detection algorithm 138 may be used to extract lane marker data points or data points that are potentially residing on lane lines.
- the criteria may include the total number of lane marker data points within a distance (e.g., on the order of 25 to 40 centimeters), from each estimate of the set and/or the dispersion of the lane marker data points close (e.g., on the order of 25 to 40 centimeters) to the estimate (in particular how well lane marker data points are spread over the entire range of the estimate).
- the dispersion may be calculated in many ways. For example, the distance between each point in the estimate and some reference point (e.g., the first point in the estimate) could be calculated and the standard deviation of this distance could be used. The higher the standard deviation, the better the spread of the points along the estimate. However, any measure for approximating how well the points are spread out along the estimate would be useful.
- the criteria may also include the total number of data points (all data points, and not specifically lane marker data points) within the distance of the estimate, and, if available, the deviation of the estimate from the most recent estimate.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may select an estimate 1002 - 1012 most likely to be the lane line edge 616 . For example, all or some of the aforementioned criteria may be used to determine a likelihood value for each estimate 1002 - 1012 of the set of estimates. The estimate 1002 - 1012 with the highest likelihood value may be selected as the most likely estimate. The autonomous driving computer system 106 may then identify a set of data points by filtering all of the data points or the lane marker data points which are within a distance of the selected estimate. Again, the filter may be on the order of 25 to 40 centimeters.
- the identified set of data points may be fit to a model describing the location and shape of the lane edge 616 .
- the fit may be based on parametric models such linear, cubic, higher-order polynomials, splines, or clothoids, or non-parametric models.
- the fit may also involve using a least squares method and a quadratic model.
- an independent variable used for the model may first be aligned with a heading or principle direction for the estimate. For example, for edge 616 , the direction of rail 518 (or some small deviation from the direction) for lane 514 may be the direction of the estimate.
- the model may be post-processed to remove any noisy sections. This may be useful at end points (between broken sections of a lane line or simply the end of a lane line) where there are only few data points have a significant bearing on the solution.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may analyze the number points used to calculate a particular part of the estimate (the support) over various sections of the model. This may include comparing the absolute number of data points of the identified set of data points in a given section to the number of data points of the identified set of data points of other second or over the entire model. The analysis may also include evaluating the curvature or smoothness of sections and filtering or smoothing out those sections that appear spurious.
- end sections can be removed or other sections can be smoothed so that the sections deviate less from the adjacent sections.
- an end section of the estimate may be removed from the estimate, so that the estimate does not extend as far as it originally did.
- the estimate of another edge or other edges may be computed simultaneously or in any other order.
- the aspects above may be applied to the edges of other types of lane markers, such as reflectors.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may also calculate all, or less than all, of the edges proximate to the vehicle (for example within the line of sight of laser 302 and/or laser 304 ). This may be useful where the laser scan data is being used to generate map information.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may estimate locations for all of the edges or only the locations of those edges of the lane in which the vehicle is traveling. For example, referring to FIG. 6 , the vehicle 104 is driving in lane 614 . Thus, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may estimate a model of the location of edges 616 and/or 618 . The autonomous driving computer system 106 may also estimate a model of the locations of other edges such as edges 570 and/or 572 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may then determine whether the driving environment of the vehicle 104 has changed relative to the previously stored detailed map information 136 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may have conducted an analysis of the collected data points for any type of object.
- the foregoing detection and object modeling may have been conducted for data points collected based on the reflectivity of a k-rail concrete barrier, a traffic safety cone, a billboard, a restaurant, and any other type of object.
- the foregoing object detection and modeling methodology may be applied to a hierarchical classification of object types.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine location estimates for objects classified as primary object types, such as lane edges, reflectors, and other objects that are integral to the road.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may also determine estimates for objects classified as secondary object types, such as traffic safety cones and k-rail concrete barriers.
- a secondary object type may be assigned as a primary object type.
- the hierarchical classification of object types may be leveraged by the autonomous driving computer system 106 to predict, within a degree of accuracy, whether the driving environment has changed. For example, where the estimated locations of the primary object types indicates a significant change in the current detected location from the previously stored location, then the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine with a high degree of accuracy that the driving environment has changed. A significant change may be based on a difference threshold, such as where the change is greater than a predetermined difference, e.g., one centimeter, ten centimeters, one meter, and so forth.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may forego an estimate analysis of the secondary object types.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may also use estimates and models of the secondary object types to further increase the accuracy that the driving environment has changed or for any other reason (e.g., to confirm that the estimates of the primary object types are accurate).
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may conduct an estimate analysis based on one or more of the secondary object types. For example, should the estimated location of a primary object be less than ten centimeters, but greater than three centimeters, from its expected location, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may conduct the estimate analysis based on secondary object types.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine whether a driving environment has changed based on differences between the detected location of various object types and their corresponding previously stored locations.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine a model representing a primary object, such as the lane line edge 616 , and compare the location of determined model with a model representing the prior stored location of the primary object (i.e., the lane line edge 524 ).
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may use one or more algorithms stored in the memory 110 for comparing the various models. For example, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may use a map discrepancy algorithm 140 stored in the memory 110 .
- FIGS. 11A-11C illustrate examples 1102 - 1106 of the autonomous driving computer system 106 comparing the data points 1108 - 1118 of a model for the detected lane line edge 616 with the data points 1120 - 1130 of a model for the stored lane line edge 524 .
- Each of the examples 1102 - 1106 illustrates an exemplary metric (or metrics) that may be determined by the autonomous driving computer system 106 .
- examples 1102 - 1106 refer to comparing the data points of models of the lane line edge 616 and the stored lane line edge 524
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may also compare data points of models of other objects, such as k-rail concrete barriers, rail guards, billboards, and other such objects.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine a number of metrics.
- FIG. 11A illustrates an example 1102 of determining a maximum deviation metric based on the determined deviations 1132 - 1142 of the data points 1108 - 1118 and the data points 1120 - 1130 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine one or more distance deviations 1132 - 1142 for corresponding pairs of data points, such as a distance deviation 1132 for data point 1108 and data point 1120 .
- a distance deviation may indicate the amount of separation or distance between one or more data points.
- distance deviations include a distance deviation 1134 for data point 1110 and data point 1122 , a distance deviation 1136 for a data point 1112 and data point 1124 , a distance deviation 1138 for a data point 1114 and a data point 1126 , a distance deviation 1140 for a data point 1118 and a data point 1130 , and a distance deviation 1142 for a data point 1116 and a data point 1128 .
- the distance deviations 1132 - 1142 may be measurements of any type such as pixels, feet, inches, millimeters, or any other measurement. A maximum deviation (i.e., a deviation having the greatest value) may then be selected from the determined distance deviations 1132 - 1142 .
- FIG. 11B illustrates another example 1104 of a metric that may be determined by the autonomous driving computer system 106 in evaluating whether a change in the driving environment occurred.
- FIG. 11B illustrates determining an average deviation (i.e., an average offset) based on corresponding pairs of one or more data points.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine one or more distance deviations 1144 - 1154 based on data points 1108 - 1118 and data points 1120 - 1130 .
- the average deviation determined by the autonomous driving computer system 106 may be an average of the determined distance deviations 1144 - 1154 .
- the values of the distance deviations 1144 - 1154 may be similar, or equal to, the values of the distance deviations 1132 - 1142 shown in FIG. 11A .
- FIG. 11C illustrates yet a further example 1106 of a metric that may be determined by the autonomous driving computer system 106 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may be configured to determine an average signed deviation (i.e., offset) based on one or more distance deviations 1156 - 1168 . With the average signed deviation, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may be configured to account, not only the value of the distance between pairs of data points, but also the direction (i.e., “postiveness” or “negativeness”) of the deviation.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may be configured to assume that a data point of a previously identified object starts at a origination point along an imaginary X-axis, and that a detected data point is accordingly assigned a value to the left (negative) or right (positive) of this origination point.
- the direction of the deviation may be based on whether the change in the direction is to the left or right of the data point of the previously detected object.
- the average signed deviation may be a negative value, as many of the detected data points 1108 - 1118 have been detected to the left of the previously detected data points 1120 - 1130 .
- the deviations 1156 - 1168 include a mix of positive deviations (i.e., detected data points to the right of previously detected data points), negative deviations (i.e., detected data points to the left of previously detected data points), and deviations that are neutral (i.e., detected data points being detected in substantially the same location as previously detected data points).
- the average signed deviation determined by the autonomous driving computer system 106 may be an average (in direction and/or value) of the deviations 1156 - 1168 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may then determine a confidence probability that the driving environment has changed for the vehicle 104 .
- each of the metrics may be compared to a corresponding threshold that yields a binary value of whether the driving environment has changed. For example, based on a comparison of the maximum deviation metric with a maximum deviation metric threshold, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine that the driving environment has changed (yes/no). Similar comparisons may be made for the average deviation with an average deviation threshold, and for the average signed deviation with an average signed deviation threshold. These binary decisions may then each be weighted to yield a confidence probability that the driving environment has changed.
- One or more of the thresholds may be determined based on prior data (i.e., comparisons of objects in a known, changed environment) or determined by prior experimental testing.
- the metrics may be used as input for a probability model that also provides a confidence probability that the driving environment has changed.
- the probability model may be based on experimental or empirical data from driving environments that are known to have changed.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine additional or alternative confidence probabilities to confirm whether the driving environment has changed. For example, where the determined confidence probability of a primary object type (e.g., lane markers) is below a given confidence probability threshold or within a tolerance of error, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine yet another confidence probability for another primary object type (e.g., k-rail concrete barriers) to confirm whether the driving environment has changed. Alternatively, or in addition, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine confidence probabilities for secondary or tertiary object types to confirm whether there has been a change in the driving environment. As the autonomous driving computer system 106 determines additional or alternative confidence probabilities, the autonomous driving computer system 106 increases the accuracy of determining that the driving environment has changed.
- a primary object type e.g., lane markers
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine yet another confidence probability for another primary object type (e.g., k-rail concrete barriers) to confirm whether the driving environment has changed.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine confidence
- the confidence probabilities and thresholds may vary according to driving environments. For example, a single lane road may experience less construction or lane changes than a highway. Accordingly, the thresholds discussed above may be assigned different values depending on the driving environment of the vehicle. As an example, a driving environment of a single lane road may be given a higher threshold than a driving environment of a highway, which may be given a lower threshold. It is also conceivable that driving environments are assigned the same, or substantially the same, thresholds.
- FIGS. 12A-12B illustrates an example of logic flow 1202 for determining whether the driving environment of the vehicle 104 has changed according to aspects of the disclosure.
- the operations shown in FIGS. 12A-12B may be performed sequentially or at varying times. Moreover, one or more of the operations shown in FIGS. 12A-12B may be performed by one or more of the processors and/or systems previously discussed.
- a set of objects or object types may be identified in the detailed map information of the vehicle 104 that serve as indicators for determining whether a driving environment has changed (Block 1204 ).
- identified objects may include lane markers, lane edges, lane reflectors, billboards, traffic safety cones, restaurants, or other objects.
- Object types may also be included such that the identification of a given object type may indicate that objects having the given object type are to be used as indicators for determining whether a driving environment has changed.
- a hierarchy of objects and/or object types may be established such that the autonomous driving computer system 106 may refer to the hierarchy should there be a need to resolve potential ambiguity as to whether a driving environment has changed based on a given object or object type.
- scan data such as laser scan data
- object detectors such as laser 302 and/or laser 304
- the scan data may include one or more data points for a detected object. As discussed previously, the data points may describe intensity and location information for objects from which laser light was reflected.
- an initial estimate for the location of an object such as the edge of a lane line bounding a lane, may then be determined (Block 1208 ). Estimates may also be determined for other types of detected objects (e.g., k-rail concrete barriers, traffic safety cones, etc.) The initial estimate may be determined based on detailed map information, previous estimates, and/or any of the examples described above. Moreover, it is possible that the location of the detected object has since shifted or moved from its previously detected location.
- the initial estimate may then be used to generate a set of possible estimates for the location of the object based on an offset distance (Block 1210 ).
- the offset distance may be predetermined and stored in the autonomous driving computer system 106 .
- the offset distance may be determined based on a difference distance between the detected object and its prior location identified in the detailed map information 136 .
- a likelihood value is determined for each estimate of the set of estimates.
- the likelihood value may indicate how likely the estimate is to be the actual location of the detected object (Block 1212 ).
- the most likely estimate may then be selected based on the likelihood values (Block 1214 ).
- the scan data may then be filtered to identify data points within a pre-determined distance of the selected most likely estimate (Block 1216 ).
- the filtering may also include using an object detection algorithm.
- the identified data points may then be fit to a model describing the location and shape of the detected object (Block 1218 ). As described above, these steps may be repeated or performed simultaneously to in order to determine models of other detected objects (e.g., lane line edges, traffic safety cones, lane reflectors, etc.).
- the resulting models may then be used by the autonomous driving computer system 106 to determine whether the driving environment has changed based on previously stored models of those objects in the detailed map information 136 . Initially, the data points from the model of the detected object may be compared with the data points of the previously stored model of the object (Block 1220 ).
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may obtain various metrics. For example, the autonomous driving computer system 106 may determine a maximum deviation metric (Block 1222 ). Referring to FIG. 12C , the autonomous driving computer system 106 may also obtain an average deviation metric (Block 1224 ), and an average signed deviation metric (Block 1226 ).
- One or more of these metrics may then be compared to corresponding thresholds (e.g., a maximum deviation threshold, an average deviation threshold, etc.) to determine whether a change in the driving environment has occurred (Block 1228 ).
- the comparison may yield a confidence probability indicating the degree of confidence that the autonomous driving computer system 106 has in that the driving environment has changed (Block 1230 ).
- one or more of the obtained metrics may be weighted to further increase the accuracy of the obtained confidence probability.
- the metrics may be further used as inputs to a probability model to also obtain a confidence probability.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may perform the foregoing analysis for other objects and/or object types based on a comparison of the obtained confidence probability with a confidence probability threshold.
- the resulting obtained confidence probabilities may be leveraged by the autonomous driving computer system 106 to determine whether the driving environment has changed, such as by comparing one or more of the obtained confidence probabilities with one or more of the confidence probability thresholds.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 may be configured to determine whether there is a discrepancy in the previously stored detailed map information 136 and the objects currently detected in the vehicle's driving environment.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 is able to readily discern whether there has been a change in a driving environment when there is some ambiguity in the detected location of various objects or object types.
- the autonomous driving computer system 106 leverages multiple metrics, the autonomous driving computer system 106 further increases the probability that a detected change in the location of an object (or object types) is the result of an actual change in the driving environment (and not due to a sensor error, e.g., a faulty sensor).
- the disclosed autonomous driving computer system 106 represents an advancement in object detection and maneuvering within a driving environment.
