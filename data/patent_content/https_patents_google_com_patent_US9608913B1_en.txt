Definitions
- FIG. 5 is a diagram schematically illustrating a WCMP routing table that may be implemented in a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM), according to an embodiment.
- TCAM ternary content addressable memory
- the network 100 includes such an uneven inter-stage topology (connectivity).
- the data switch 110 may communicate data traffic to the data switch 140 via the data switch 120 , or via the data switch 130 .
- there are two links 112 , 114 connecting the data switch 110 and the data switch 120 while there is only one link 116 connecting the data switch 110 and the data switch 130 .
- WCMP may easily implemented by replicating the egress port listing for the link 116 in an EMCP table
- Scalability of WCMP in such networks has multiple considerations. For example, one consideration is the ability to support an arbitrary mix of weights with sufficient resolution in the switches of such networks.
- using ECMP tables with replicated entries to implement WCMP would typically require a prohibitive degree of replication (i.e., the required table sizes would likely far exceed the capacity of memory structures currently used to implement ECMP tables).
- fence encoding may be used to encode a set of contiguous integer ranges corresponding with a set of WCMP routing weights.
- Fence encoding uses 2 W bits for each prefix, where the contiguous integer ranges have W bits of resolution.
- fence encoding uses wildcard bits (“x”) to denote the integer range, and 0s and 1s to mark the integer range boundaries. Accordingly, each integer range may by represented by a single encoded prefix. Referring again to the example WCMP group discussed above, prefixes for the integer ranges for port_0, port_1 and port_2 using fence encoding would be as follows:
- DIPRE encoding can be adjusted to be implemented in a TCAM of a given width. Prefix expansion is then used to achieve a desired resolution of weights within the available TCAM width.
- DIPRE when used to encode TCAM prefixes for implementing a WCMP routing table, may include splitting up an available TCAM width into a number of chunks and, likewise, similarly splitting the integer-range values into multiple chunks.
- Fence encoding may then be used to encode each chunk separately. The fence encoded chunks can then be concatenated to produce a TCAM prefix.
- Such a split-and-concatenate approach reduces some of the exponential (e.g., 2 W ) TCAM width requirement (of raw fence encoding) by encoding a set of smaller width chunks.
- the integer value of 12 may likewise be encoded as the binary representation of an unsigned-integer (i.e., 12) and, thus, would be encoded as a search key having a binary value of 01100.
- a TCAM lookup may be performed using this search key, which would match the prefix 01xxx (e.g., the second prefix for port_1), which would result in port_1 being the egress port assigned by the WCMP routing table for transmitting the received data packet toward its destination (e.g., at block 650 ).
Abstract
Description
Lookup value=Hash_value mod 9 Equation 1
LL[i]=Σ j=0 i-1 w[j]
The upper limit UL[i] for each of the i integer ranges may be determined by Equation 3 below:
UL[i]=LL[i]+w[i]−1 Equation 3
-
- port_0=(0-4)
- port_2=(5-19)
- port_3=(20-27)
-
- port_0=(0-4)=>{000xx (0-3), 00100 (4)}
- port_1=(5-19)=>{00101 (5), 0011x (6-7), 01xxx (8-15), 100xx (16-19)}
- port_2=(20-27)=>{101xx (20-23), 110xx (24-27)}
-
- port_0=(0-4)=>00000000000000000000000xxxx (bits 0-4 are wildcards)
- port_1=(5-19)=>00000000xxxxxxxxxxxxxx11111 (bits 6-19 are wildcards)
-
port 2=(20-27)=>xxxxxxx11111111111111111111 (bits 21-27 are wildcards)
-
- a)
port 0=(0-4) in 6 bit binary can be represented as 000000-000100 - b) breaking into 3 chunks of 2-bits each: 00 00 00-00 01 00
- c) now fence encoding to capture this range gives the following prefixes: {000 000 xxx, 000 001 000}
For port_1: - a) port_1=(5-19) in 6 bit binary can be represented as 000101-010011
- b) breaking into 3 chunks of 2-bits each: 00 01 01-01 00 11
- c) now fence encoding to capture this range gives the following prefixes: {000 001 xx1, 000 x11 xxx, 001 000 xxx}
For port_2: - a) port_2=(20-27) in 6 bit binary can be represented as 010100-010111
- b) breaking into 3 chunks of 2-bits each: 01 01 00-01 01 11
- c) now fence encoding to capture this range gives the following prefixes: {001 001 xxx}
- a)
Integer value=Hash_value mod 27 Equation 4
Equation 4 will produce an integer value in the range of 0-27, where that range corresponds with the overall size of the contiguous integer ranges of the example WCMP group.
