- This specification relates to providing information relevant to user queries.
- Search systems provide access to vast amounts of data from a variety of resource collections, particularly when provided in a networked environment, e.g., the Internet.
- Some search systems also provide an interactive mapping system. Users can submit a query to the interactive mapping system to search for map entities, e.g., cities, states, countries, addresses, business names, etc.
- map entities e.g., cities, states, countries, addresses, business names, etc.
- the interactive mapping system can display a geographic region.
- This specification describes technologies relating to identifying news and social content search results and presenting geographic entities referenced in the search results in an interface of an interactive mapping system.
- Users seeking information about a particular geographic location are presented with aggregated news and social content updates about that geographic location.
- the news and social content updates can be automatically updated to present the user a current view of activity in or about that geographic location.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving map coordinates coinciding with a user viewport, wherein the user viewport defines a region of map data; obtaining map data corresponding to the region defined by the user viewport; identifying a location corresponding to the region defined by the user viewport; generating a query corresponding to the identified location; searching one or more collections of dated resources using the generated query to obtain one or more resources that refer to the identified location, wherein the dated resources are news resources or social content resources; ranking the dated resources based at least on the date of each resource; and presenting the map data with one or more of the obtained dated resources according to the rank for each resource.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- the dated resources are one or more news resources and one or more social content resources.
- Generating the query includes using a database of geographic entity names to identify a geographic entity name associated with a location corresponding to the query.
- the ranked list of dated resources is updated, including searching updated additions to the one or more collections and providing the map data with the updated list.
- Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a query; searching one or more collections of dated resources using the query to obtain one or more resources responsive to the query, wherein the dated resources are news resources or social content resources; ranking the dated resources based at least on the date of each resource; generating a list of the one or more dated resources according to the rank for each resource; identifying geographic entity names in the one or more obtained dated resources; identifying a geographic region corresponding to each identified geographic entity name; generating map data to differentiate the identified geographic regions from geographic regions that were not identified; and providing the map data with the list.

- the identified geographic regions are differentiated with different colors.
- the identified geographic regions are differentiated with different fill patterns.
- the dated resources are one or more news resources and one or more social content resources.
- the identified geographic region corresponds to a region defined by a user viewport.
- the query is translated into a second query before searching the one or more collections of dated resources. Translating the query into a second query includes using a database of geographic entity names to identify a geographic entity name associated with a location corresponding to the query.
- the ranked list of dated resources is updated, including searching updated additions to the one or more collections and providing the map data with the updated list.
- Aggregating news and social content updates with an interactive mapping system provides users a convenient, up-to-date view of activity in a geographic location.
- the system provides users an interface for serendipitous discovery of events in a geographic area.
- the locations of current events can easily be identified, as well as other events happening at those locations.
- the level of activity in a location can be experienced by the amplitude of news and social content about a location, all by merely browsing to that location. Users can conveniently gauge the popularity of businesses and events at any current time of day in a geographic location.
- FIG. 1 is an illustration of an example interface of a search system that provides an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content updates.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example search system for providing an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process to generate map results with aggregated news and social content results.
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example interface of a search system that provides an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content updates.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process to generate map results with aggregated news and social content results.
- FIG. 6 is an illustration of an example interface of a search system that provides an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content updates.
- Search systems provide access to many kinds of resource collections. Some search systems provide access to map resources in an interactive mapping system.
- client devices can request map data coinciding with a region of interest.
- Map data can include map images (e.g., political or topographic map images), satellite images, business locations, popular landmarks, driving or walking directions, and vector graphics defining paths and regions overlaid on map images. Map data can also include various layers of related data, for example, a layer illustrating volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean or current traffic conditions.
- the region of interest can be defined by a user viewport, which can be an element of the interactive mapping system interface.
- the user viewport can have different shapes, e.g., rectangular or square, and can show map data of a particular geographic region.
- service providers can send the client device map data, which may be in the form of an image.
- the client's web browser then displays the map data or image in the user's viewport.
- Client devices can request map data by submitting queries.
- Interactive mapping systems can receive queries and provide map data responsive to received queries. Queries may correspond to various types of geographic entities, e.g., cities or countries. Queries may also correspond to specific locations (e.g., an address) or a specific entity (e.g., “baseball stadium”).
- Additional resources provided by search systems may include, for example, news resources and social content resources.
- Each resource can independently provide multiple pieces of information responsive to a query. These independent pieces of information can be located, combined, and presented in an interface including the interactive mapping system.
- FIG. 1 is an illustration of an example interface 100 of a search system that provides an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content updates. Users of the search system can search for map data by submitting queries. In response to received queries, an interactive mapping system provides map data in the form of an image.
- the mapping interface 100 shown in FIG. 1 depicts a user viewport 130 centered on downtown San Francisco, Calif.
- a user can enter a query 110 into a query box 105 .
- the interactive mapping system can retrieve map data 140 and present the map data 140 in a viewport 130 .
- the viewport 130 defines a range of current map coordinates to be displayed on the client device.
- Queries can also be generated according to a location indicated by the center of the viewport 130 .
- the latitude and longitude of the center of the viewport 130 can be used to look up a nearby map entity, e.g., an address, a business, a city, a county, a state, a country, etc.
- a database stores the latitude and longitude of each map entity along with a corresponding address of the entity.
- the latitude and longitude of the center of the viewport 130 can thus be used to generate one or more map entities at that latitude and longitude.
- the latitude and longitude of the center of the viewport 130 are translated into the nearest city. For example, query 110 could be generated by translating the latitude and longitude of the center of the viewport 130 into the nearest city, San Francisco, Calif.
- the interactive mapping system can include one or more interface elements, e.g., a panning control 132 , a zoom control 134 , a tilt control (not shown), or a rotation control (not shown).
- the user specifies a pan command by using an input device, e.g., a mouse, to drag the map image 140 or to manipulate the panning control 132 .
- the user specifies a pan command by dragging a finger across the screen of a touchscreen device.
- the interactive mapping system can provide data at multiple zoom levels (e.g., in response to a user input to the zoom control 130 ). Each subsequent zoom level provides more detail corresponding to a smaller geographic region.
- the interface 100 presents a number of news search results (e.g., news search results 152 and 154 ) and social content search results (e.g., social content search results 162 , 164 , and 166 ) in response to a query (e.g., query 110 ).
- the date that the news and social content search results were posted can also be displayed with each result.
- Each of the news search results 152 and 154 were retrieved in response to the query 110 .
- the news search results are obtained from a search engine that searches multiple collections of news resources.
- Each of the social content search results 162 , 164 , and 166 were retrieved in response to the query 110 .
- the social content search results are obtained by searching updates of multiple social content providers.
- a social content provider is a service that allows users who are members of the social content provider to interact with other members, for example, by contributing and receiving content from other members.
- a social content provider can be a social networking site.
- Member content can include, for example, a status message, a microblog message, multimedia content, shared content originating from another source, or any other kind of content.
- a member can provide content publicly or to only one or more other specific members.
- social content is intended for a specific member or a specific subset of members of a social content provider.
- a member may be associated with specific other members by connections established in the social content provider (e.g., as designated by the member). The member can choose to contribute content intended for or directed to one or more of those associated members. Content intended for one or more members may be publicly accessible. Publicly accessible social content responsive to the query 110 can be retrieved by a search engine and presented in the interface 100 . In some implementations, the search system may provide an option for users of social content providers to opt-in or opt-out of making their social content accessible by users of the interface 100 .
- Using the query 110 input into an interactive mapping system to automatically retrieve news and social content updates allows users to view activity in a particular geographic location or region. For example, a user who submits query 110 (or has the query 110 automatically generated by the location of user viewport 130 ) can obtain an overview of current activity in San Francisco, Calif. From news search result 152 , the user can learn that the San Francisco baseball team has made the baseball championship series, the World Series.
- a user can learn that “username 1 ” is going to be in San Francisco this weekend.
- the interface 100 can display only those social content updates from users that are contacts with the user for the same social content provider.
- the user would be presented with a relevant update from “username 1 ” only if they were contacts in a social content provider.
- From news search result 154 the user can access a news story about traffic in San Francisco. By clicking on news search result 154 , the user can be taken to the full news story shown in the news search result 154 . From social content result 164 , the user can see that “username 2 ” has indicated that the President will be in San Francisco today. From social content result 166 , the user can see that “username 3 ” is stuck in traffic in San Francisco. In this way, the user can quickly obtain information about a particular geographic location shown in the viewport 130 of the interactive mapping system.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example search system 210 for providing an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content.
- the example search system 210 can provide search results relevant to submitted queries from multiple collections of resources.
- the search system can be implemented in an Internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment.
- the search system 210 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described can be implemented.
- a user 202 can interact with the search system 210 through a user device 204 .
- the user device 204 can be a computer coupled to the search and mapping system 210 through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet.
- the user device 204 will generally include a random access memory (RAM) 206 and a processor 208 .
- RAM random access memory
- a user 202 can submit a query 212 to the search system 210 .
- the query 212 can be in the form of a text string, or alternatively, as described above, the query 212 can be in the form of coordinates defined by a user viewport of an interactive mapping system.
- the query 212 can be sent to a search engine 230 within the search system 210 and to a mapping engine 240 within the search system 210 .
- the search engine 230 and mapping engine 240 can be part of the same or different search systems.
- the search system 210 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network 218 .
- mapping engine 240 identifies map results 214 that correspond to the query 212 .
- Map results can be retrieved from a collection of map data 232 .
- the map data 232 can be stored in various data structures on multiple storage subsystems.
- An indexing engine 224 can index the names of map entities contained in the collection of map data 232 .
- the indexing engine can also store the latitude/longitude locations and addresses for map entities in the collection of map data 232 . Indexing location information allows the system to translate a latitude and longitude point (e.g., as provided by a user viewport) into an address or an entity name. Additionally, an address can be translated into a latitude longitude point or an entity name.
- the mapping engine 240 responds to the query 212 by generating map results 214 , which are transmitted through the network 218 to the client device 204 in a form that can be presented to the user 202 (e.g., as an interactive mapping system web page to be displayed in a web browser running on the client device 204 ).
- a query 212 received by the mapping engine 240 can also passed on to the search engine 230 or multiple other search engines.
- the query 212 can be passed on to the search engine 230 in its original form.
- the latitude and longitude can be translated into an entity name by the indexing engine 224 of the mapping engine.
- the entity name can then be passed on to the search engine 230 as a text query.
- the search engine 230 When the query 212 is received by the search engine 230 (either as the original text string or as an entity name translated from a latitude and longitude), the search engine 230 identifies resources that match the query 212 .
- the search engine 230 can access resources stored in multiple collections, e.g., a collection of news data 234 and a collection of social content 236 .
- the search engine 230 will generally include an indexing engine 220 that crawls and indexes resources (e.g., books, web pages, social content, images, or news articles stored as addressable resources accessible over the Internet) found in a collection or repository of content, an index (not shown) that stores the index information in one or more indices, and a ranking engine 222 (or other software) to rank the resources that match the query 210 .
- the indexing and ranking of the resources can be performed using conventional techniques.
- the search system 210 can transmit results that are responsive to the query 212 as map results 214 and as news and social content results 216 through the network 218 to the user device 204 for presentation to the user 202 .
- the map results 214 and news and social content results 216 can be presented to the user in an interface, for example, the interface 100 as shown in FIG. 1 .
- a query 212 received by the search engine 230 can also be passed on to the mapping engine 240 .
- the query 212 can be passed on to the mapping engine 240 to be translated into a latitude and longitude by the indexing engine 224 .
- the indexing engine can use the query 212 as an entity name and can look up a latitude and longitude or an address for the geographic entity name corresponding to the query 212 .
- the latitude and longitude or address can be used by the mapping engine 240 to provide map results 214 indicating the locations of entities identified by the query 212 .
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process to generate map results with aggregated news and social content results.
- a search system obtains information about a location and uses the location name to search news and social content resources. The search system can then combine the map results, news results, and social content results into an interface, e.g., the interface 100 as shown in FIG. 1 .
- the process begins when a search for a location is initiated ( 305 ).
- the search for a location can be initiated either as a result of a user entering a query into a search box of an interactive mapping system, or as a result of the user navigating with the user viewport to a location of the interactive mapping system.
- the query 307 is delivered to the search system.
- the query 307 can be identified as a query for which map results and aggregated news and social content results should be retrieved, for example, when the user selects an interface to submit the query, or when the user includes a predefined keyword in the query.
- the search system receives the query 307 and generates map results responsive to the query ( 310 ).
- Map results can include any of the various types of map data responsive to the query, e.g., a map image or a satellite image.
- a marker is shown on the location identified by the query (in the case of a text query).
- the search system selects the most popular location and provides other matching locations as alternatives.
- the search system typically centers the viewport on the location identified by the query. In the case of multiple matching locations, the system can center the viewport on the most popular location.
- the search system translates the map query into a search query ( 315 ). If necessary, the search system translates the query used for the interactive mapping system into a search query that can be used to search news or social content resource collections. If, for example, the query 307 was a latitude and longitude as specified by a user viewport, the search system can identify a geographic entity name from the latitude and longitude to use as a search query. Multiple geographic entity names are possible for a geographic location, e.g., an address, a business name, a sports arena, a city, a county, a state, or a country.
- the search system can use a database to identify geographic entities near those coordinates. For 37.8 degrees north and 122.4 degrees west, the search system can identify the address 1301 Battery St. (address), Fog City Diner (business name), San Francisco Stadium (sports area), San Francisco (city), San Francisco (county), California (state), and United States of America (country).
- the query chosen depends on the zoom level of the interactive mapping system. For example, if the interactive mapping system is zoomed in to street level, the search system can choose an address or business name. In contrast, if the interactive mapping system is zoomed all the way out, the search system can choose the city, state, or country name for the search query.
- the translation of the query may be unnecessary if the user submitted a text query to the interactive mapping system by, for example, typing the query into query box 105 .
- a submitted text query may still undergo modifications to improve search results retrieved in later steps. For example, extra information may be dropped from the query.
- the search system may drop the “CA” and identify only “San Francisco” as the search query for later steps.
- the query can be modified by expanding or contracting the query to well-known, popular, or colloquial variations.
- the search system can recognize that a user query for “LA” is a popular form for the city “Los Angeles,” and can therefore expand the query into “Los Angeles” instead of another query (e.g. Louisiana) for which “LA” is less popular.
- the search system uses both queries or multiple other variations of a query when searching collections of resources.
- the search system generates news search results ( 320 ). Using the identified search query, the search system can retrieve news results from one or multiple collections of news resources. The news resources can be ranked by relevance to the query as well as date posted, with newer articles given a higher ranking than older articles. The search system may also give more weight to a news resource that has the search query in the title or dateline of the news resource. For example, news result 152 as shown in FIG. 1 has the query “San Francisco” in the news story dateline.
- the search system generates social content search results ( 325 ).
- the search system can use the identified search query to search publicly available updates from multiple social content services. Similar to news results, the social content search results can be ranked by both relevance and date posted. For example, social content result 162 of FIG. 1 can be ranked higher than social content result 164 because it was posted more recently.
- the search system can retrieve social content updates from the user's contacts, which might be unavailable to another user.
- the search system can generate social content results before generating news results or vice versa, or the search system can generate the results in parallel. Alternatively, the search system can generate only news results or only social content results. In some implementations, the search system retrieves both news and social content resources from the same collection.
- the search system combines the maps, news, and social content search results ( 330 ).
- the search system can select a subset of the news and social content search results to be presented to the user.
- the search system selects a specified number of the highest-ranked news and social content results.
- the search system arranges the news and social content search results together in a single ranking.
- the search system normalizes the results before assembling the final ranking so that no particular type of search result dominates or overwhelms results presented in the interface.
- the search system sends the maps, news, and social content results to the client device ( 335 ).
- the search system can send these results over a communication network, e.g., the network 218 shown in FIG. 2 .
- the search system automatically and periodically updates the news and social content search results and retransmits them to the client device (branch to 320 ).
- the client device displays the map results with the news and social content results ( 340 ).
- the combined results can be displayed in a single interface, e.g., the interface 100 as shown in FIG. 1 .
- the user can be presented with a continually and automatically updating stream of news and social content about a geographic location without ever typing a search query.
- the search query 307 can be updated each time the user browses to a new geographic location in the user viewport, resulting in continually updated news and social content about each new geographic location.
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example interface 400 of a search system that provides an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content updates.
- the interface in FIG. 4 presents geographic locations identified in news and social content search results as data points in the interactive mapping system. Combining multiple data points in the viewport 430 can provide a “heat map” of the activity relating to a given query.
- the query 410 entered into the example interface 400 need not be a geographic query, and can instead be a query relating to any topic of interest.
- the query is “football championship,” relating to a professional football championship game.
- the search system can retrieve news and social content results responsive to the query, e.g., news results 452 and 454 and social content results 462 , 464 , and 466 .
- the search system can identify geographic entity names and plot the geographic entities in the viewport 430 .
- the search system can use a database to identify a latitude and longitude location for a geographic entity name.
- the database can identify an address for a geographic entity name.
- the search system can retrieve news result 452 , about a Chicago football team reaching the football championship game.
- the search system can identify geographic entity names in the news result, e.g., Chicago and Pittsburgh.
- the search system can identify that news result 454 includes a geographic entity name “Glendale, Ariz.”
- the type of geographic entity identified depends on the zoom level of the user viewport 430 . For example, because the user viewport 430 is at a zoom level that shows an entire country, the search system can identify only cities, states, or country geographic entities. At further zoomed-in levels, the search system could identify other geographic entities, such as business names or street names.
- the search system can identify a location for the geographic entity, e.g., by using a database of geographic entities. For each identified location, the search system can include a marker in the viewport 430 at the identified location. This process can provide the user with a view of activity in geographic locations relevant to the query 410 .
- the search system includes a marker 422 at the geographic location for Chicago.
- the system can cluster the markers to give the user an idea of the number of results identified for that geographic location.
- the size of the marker increases according to the number of news or social content results relevant to the query 410 .
- the color of the markers change according to the number of results relevant to the query 410 , providing a “heat map” effect.
- the search system can identify geographic entities in social content results that were responsive to the query 410 .
- social content result 462 includes the geographic entity name “Pittsburgh.”
- the search system can identify the geographic location for Pittsburgh, Pa., and plot a marker in the user viewport accordingly.
- Social content result 464 includes the geographic entity name “Chicago,” and social content result 466 includes the geographic entity name “Glendale, Ariz.”
- the search system can include in the viewport 430 markers 424 and 426 for geographic locations corresponding to each of these geographic entities.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process to generate map results with aggregated news and social content results.
- a search system obtains information news and social content results relevant to a query and identifies geographic entities in the results. For identified geographic entities, the search system identifies geographic locations and marks these geographic locations in the interactive mapping system. The search system can then combine the map results, news results, and social content results into an interface, e.g., the interface 400 as shown in FIG. 4 .
- a search for a topic is initiated ( 505 ).
- the search for a topic can be initiated by a user entering a query into a search box of an interface, e.g., the interface 400 as shown in FIG. 4 .
- a query 507 is delivered to the search system.
- the query 507 can be identified as query for which map results and aggregated news and social content results should be retrieved, for example, when the user selects an interface to submit the query, or when the user includes a predefined keyword in the query.
- the search system generates news results ( 510 ) and social content results ( 515 ).
- the results can be retrieved in a substantially similar manner to steps 320 and 325 as described with respect to FIG. 3 .
- the search system need not retrieve results for both news and social content results, and can generate the results in any order or in parallel.
- the search system identifies geographic entities in the results ( 520 ).
- the search system uses a database of geographic entity names to identify geographic entities in the news and social content results.
- the search system can also identify only certain types of geographic entities based on a current zoom level of a user viewport. For example, if the user viewport shows an entire country, the search system can only identify city, state, or country geographic entities.
- the search system identifies geographic locations for the identified geographic entities ( 530 ).
- the search system can use a database to identify a latitude and longitude location or an address for each identified geographic entity.
- the search system marks the identified geographic locations on a map ( 535 ). Using the identified geographic locations, the search system can include a marker in the viewport of an interactive mapping system. The search system can cluster the markers, use different sizes and shapes, or use color coding to indicate the number of markers at a common geographic location.
- the search system combines the maps, news, and social content results ( 540 ). In some implementations, the search system combines the results into a single interface, e.g., the interface as shown in FIG. 4 .
- the search system sends the maps, news, and social content results to the client device ( 545 ).
- the search system can send these results over a communication network, e.g., the network 218 as shown in FIG. 2 .
- the search system can also automatically and periodically update the news and social content search results (branch to 510 ).
- the search system can also accordingly update the corresponding location markers for geographic entities identified in newly retried news and social content results.
- the client device displays the map results with the news and social content results ( 550 ).
- the search system can allow the user to view a time lapse of previous news and social content results.
- the user can specify a previous time period and view an animation of geographic locations relevant to previous news and social content results, providing the user with a view of previous activity in geographic locations identified in previous news and social content search results.
- FIG. 6 is an illustration of an example interface 600 of a search system that provides an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content updates.
- the interface in FIG. 6 differentiates geographic regions based on the number of geographic locations in that region that were identified in news and social content search results. These geographic regions also provide a type of “heat map” that shows regions relevant to a particular submitted query.
- the search system receives a query 610 and generates news and social content results, e.g., news results 652 and 654 , and social content results 662 , 664 , and 666 responsive to the query.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for aggregating news and social content with map presentations. A method includes receiving map coordinates coinciding with a user viewport defining a region of map data. Map data corresponding to the region defined by the user viewport is obtained. A location corresponding to the region defined by the user viewport is identified, and a query corresponding to the identified location is generated. One or more collections of dated resources are searched using the generated query to obtain one or more resources that refer to the identified location, wherein the dated resources are news resources or social content resources. The dated resources are ranked based at least on the date of each resource. The map data is presented with one or more of the obtained dated resources according to the rank for each resource.
Description
- This specification relates to providing information relevant to user queries.
- Search systems provide access to vast amounts of data from a variety of resource collections, particularly when provided in a networked environment, e.g., the Internet. Some search systems also provide an interactive mapping system. Users can submit a query to the interactive mapping system to search for map entities, e.g., cities, states, countries, addresses, business names, etc. In response to a query, the interactive mapping system can display a geographic region.
- This specification describes technologies relating to identifying news and social content search results and presenting geographic entities referenced in the search results in an interface of an interactive mapping system. Users seeking information about a particular geographic location are presented with aggregated news and social content updates about that geographic location. The news and social content updates can be automatically updated to present the user a current view of activity in or about that geographic location.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving map coordinates coinciding with a user viewport, wherein the user viewport defines a region of map data; obtaining map data corresponding to the region defined by the user viewport; identifying a location corresponding to the region defined by the user viewport; generating a query corresponding to the identified location; searching one or more collections of dated resources using the generated query to obtain one or more resources that refer to the identified location, wherein the dated resources are news resources or social content resources; ranking the dated resources based at least on the date of each resource; and presenting the map data with one or more of the obtained dated resources according to the rank for each resource. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The dated resources are one or more news resources and one or more social content resources. Generating the query includes using a database of geographic entity names to identify a geographic entity name associated with a location corresponding to the query. The ranked list of dated resources is updated, including searching updated additions to the one or more collections and providing the map data with the updated list.
- Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a query; searching one or more collections of dated resources using the query to obtain one or more resources responsive to the query, wherein the dated resources are news resources or social content resources; ranking the dated resources based at least on the date of each resource; generating a list of the one or more dated resources according to the rank for each resource; identifying geographic entity names in the one or more obtained dated resources; identifying a geographic region corresponding to each identified geographic entity name; generating map data to differentiate the identified geographic regions from geographic regions that were not identified; and providing the map data with the list. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The identified geographic regions are differentiated with location markers. The identified geographic regions are differentiated with different colors. The identified geographic regions are differentiated with different fill patterns. The dated resources are one or more news resources and one or more social content resources. The identified geographic region corresponds to a region defined by a user viewport. The query is translated into a second query before searching the one or more collections of dated resources. Translating the query into a second query includes using a database of geographic entity names to identify a geographic entity name associated with a location corresponding to the query. The ranked list of dated resources is updated, including searching updated additions to the one or more collections and providing the map data with the updated list.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Aggregating news and social content updates with an interactive mapping system provides users a convenient, up-to-date view of activity in a geographic location. The system provides users an interface for serendipitous discovery of events in a geographic area. The locations of current events can easily be identified, as well as other events happening at those locations. The level of activity in a location can be experienced by the amplitude of news and social content about a location, all by merely browsing to that location. Users can conveniently gauge the popularity of businesses and events at any current time of day in a geographic location.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- Search systems provide access to many kinds of resource collections. Some search systems provide access to map resources in an interactive mapping system.
- In an interactive mapping system, client devices can request map data coinciding with a region of interest. Map data can include map images (e.g., political or topographic map images), satellite images, business locations, popular landmarks, driving or walking directions, and vector graphics defining paths and regions overlaid on map images. Map data can also include various layers of related data, for example, a layer illustrating volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean or current traffic conditions. The region of interest can be defined by a user viewport, which can be an element of the interactive mapping system interface. The user viewport can have different shapes, e.g., rectangular or square, and can show map data of a particular geographic region. In response to the request for map data, service providers can send the client device map data, which may be in the form of an image. The client's web browser then displays the map data or image in the user's viewport. Client devices can request map data by submitting queries. Interactive mapping systems can receive queries and provide map data responsive to received queries. Queries may correspond to various types of geographic entities, e.g., cities or countries. Queries may also correspond to specific locations (e.g., an address) or a specific entity (e.g., “baseball stadium”).
- Additional resources provided by search systems, may include, for example, news resources and social content resources. Each resource can independently provide multiple pieces of information responsive to a query. These independent pieces of information can be located, combined, and presented in an interface including the interactive mapping system.
-
FIG. 1 is an illustration of anexample interface 100 of a search system that provides an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content updates. Users of the search system can search for map data by submitting queries. In response to received queries, an interactive mapping system provides map data in the form of an image. Themapping interface 100 shown inFIG. 1 depicts auser viewport 130 centered on downtown San Francisco, Calif. - A user can enter a
query 110 into aquery box 105. By clicking asearch button 120, the interactive mapping system can retrievemap data 140 and present themap data 140 in aviewport 130. Theviewport 130 defines a range of current map coordinates to be displayed on the client device. - Queries can also be generated according to a location indicated by the center of the
viewport 130. The latitude and longitude of the center of theviewport 130 can be used to look up a nearby map entity, e.g., an address, a business, a city, a county, a state, a country, etc. In some implementations, a database stores the latitude and longitude of each map entity along with a corresponding address of the entity. The latitude and longitude of the center of theviewport 130 can thus be used to generate one or more map entities at that latitude and longitude. In some implementations, the latitude and longitude of the center of theviewport 130 are translated into the nearest city. For example, query 110 could be generated by translating the latitude and longitude of the center of theviewport 130 into the nearest city, San Francisco, Calif. - To control what is shown in the
user viewport 130, the interactive mapping system can include one or more interface elements, e.g., a panningcontrol 132, a zoom control 134, a tilt control (not shown), or a rotation control (not shown). In some implementations, the user specifies a pan command by using an input device, e.g., a mouse, to drag themap image 140 or to manipulate the panningcontrol 132. In some other implementations, the user specifies a pan command by dragging a finger across the screen of a touchscreen device. The interactive mapping system can provide data at multiple zoom levels (e.g., in response to a user input to the zoom control 130). Each subsequent zoom level provides more detail corresponding to a smaller geographic region. - In addition to the
map data 140, theinterface 100 presents a number of news search results (e.g.,news search results 152 and 154) and social content search results (e.g., socialcontent search results - Each of the
news search results query 110. In some implementations, the news search results are obtained from a search engine that searches multiple collections of news resources. - Each of the social
content search results query 110. In some implementations, the social content search results are obtained by searching updates of multiple social content providers. A social content provider is a service that allows users who are members of the social content provider to interact with other members, for example, by contributing and receiving content from other members. A social content provider can be a social networking site. Member content can include, for example, a status message, a microblog message, multimedia content, shared content originating from another source, or any other kind of content. A member can provide content publicly or to only one or more other specific members. In some implementations, social content is intended for a specific member or a specific subset of members of a social content provider. For example, a member may be associated with specific other members by connections established in the social content provider (e.g., as designated by the member). The member can choose to contribute content intended for or directed to one or more of those associated members. Content intended for one or more members may be publicly accessible. Publicly accessible social content responsive to thequery 110 can be retrieved by a search engine and presented in theinterface 100. In some implementations, the search system may provide an option for users of social content providers to opt-in or opt-out of making their social content accessible by users of theinterface 100. - Using the
query 110 input into an interactive mapping system to automatically retrieve news and social content updates allows users to view activity in a particular geographic location or region. For example, a user who submits query 110 (or has thequery 110 automatically generated by the location of user viewport 130) can obtain an overview of current activity in San Francisco, Calif. Fromnews search result 152, the user can learn that the San Francisco baseball team has made the baseball championship series, the World Series. - From
social content result 162, a user can learn that “username1” is going to be in San Francisco this weekend. In some implementations, theinterface 100 can display only those social content updates from users that are contacts with the user for the same social content provider. In this example, the user would be presented with a relevant update from “username1” only if they were contacts in a social content provider. - From
news search result 154, the user can access a news story about traffic in San Francisco. By clicking onnews search result 154, the user can be taken to the full news story shown in thenews search result 154. Fromsocial content result 164, the user can see that “username2” has indicated that the President will be in San Francisco today. Fromsocial content result 166, the user can see that “username3” is stuck in traffic in San Francisco. In this way, the user can quickly obtain information about a particular geographic location shown in theviewport 130 of the interactive mapping system. -
FIG. 2 is an illustration of anexample search system 210 for providing an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content. Theexample search system 210 can provide search results relevant to submitted queries from multiple collections of resources. The search system can be implemented in an Internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment. Thesearch system 210 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described can be implemented. - A
user 202 can interact with thesearch system 210 through auser device 204. For example, theuser device 204 can be a computer coupled to the search andmapping system 210 through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet. Theuser device 204 will generally include a random access memory (RAM) 206 and aprocessor 208. - A
user 202 can submit aquery 212 to thesearch system 210. Thequery 212 can be in the form of a text string, or alternatively, as described above, thequery 212 can be in the form of coordinates defined by a user viewport of an interactive mapping system. Thequery 212 can be sent to asearch engine 230 within thesearch system 210 and to amapping engine 240 within thesearch system 210. Thesearch engine 230 andmapping engine 240 can be part of the same or different search systems. When theuser 202 submits aquery 212, thequery 212 is transmitted through anetwork 218 to thesearch system 210. Thesearch system 210 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through anetwork 218. - When the
query 212 is received by themapping engine 240, themapping engine 240 identifies map results 214 that correspond to thequery 212. Map results can be retrieved from a collection ofmap data 232. Themap data 232 can be stored in various data structures on multiple storage subsystems. Anindexing engine 224 can index the names of map entities contained in the collection ofmap data 232. The indexing engine can also store the latitude/longitude locations and addresses for map entities in the collection ofmap data 232. Indexing location information allows the system to translate a latitude and longitude point (e.g., as provided by a user viewport) into an address or an entity name. Additionally, an address can be translated into a latitude longitude point or an entity name. - The
mapping engine 240 responds to thequery 212 by generatingmap results 214, which are transmitted through thenetwork 218 to theclient device 204 in a form that can be presented to the user 202 (e.g., as an interactive mapping system web page to be displayed in a web browser running on the client device 204). - A
query 212 received by themapping engine 240 can also passed on to thesearch engine 230 or multiple other search engines. In the case of a text query, thequery 212 can be passed on to thesearch engine 230 in its original form. In the case of a latitude and longitude query identified by a user viewport, the latitude and longitude can be translated into an entity name by theindexing engine 224 of the mapping engine. The entity name can then be passed on to thesearch engine 230 as a text query. - When the
query 212 is received by the search engine 230 (either as the original text string or as an entity name translated from a latitude and longitude), thesearch engine 230 identifies resources that match thequery 212. Thesearch engine 230 can access resources stored in multiple collections, e.g., a collection ofnews data 234 and a collection ofsocial content 236. Thesearch engine 230 will generally include anindexing engine 220 that crawls and indexes resources (e.g., books, web pages, social content, images, or news articles stored as addressable resources accessible over the Internet) found in a collection or repository of content, an index (not shown) that stores the index information in one or more indices, and a ranking engine 222 (or other software) to rank the resources that match thequery 210. The indexing and ranking of the resources can be performed using conventional techniques. Thesearch system 210 can transmit results that are responsive to thequery 212 as map results 214 and as news andsocial content results 216 through thenetwork 218 to theuser device 204 for presentation to theuser 202. The map results 214 and news andsocial content results 216 can be presented to the user in an interface, for example, theinterface 100 as shown inFIG. 1 . - A
query 212 received by thesearch engine 230 can also be passed on to themapping engine 240. Thequery 212 can be passed on to themapping engine 240 to be translated into a latitude and longitude by theindexing engine 224. The indexing engine can use thequery 212 as an entity name and can look up a latitude and longitude or an address for the geographic entity name corresponding to thequery 212. The latitude and longitude or address can be used by themapping engine 240 to providemap results 214 indicating the locations of entities identified by thequery 212. -
FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process to generate map results with aggregated news and social content results. In general, a search system obtains information about a location and uses the location name to search news and social content resources. The search system can then combine the map results, news results, and social content results into an interface, e.g., theinterface 100 as shown inFIG. 1 . - The process begins when a search for a location is initiated (305). The search for a location can be initiated either as a result of a user entering a query into a search box of an interactive mapping system, or as a result of the user navigating with the user viewport to a location of the interactive mapping system. When the search is initiated, by a user on a client device, for example, the
query 307 is delivered to the search system. Thequery 307 can be identified as a query for which map results and aggregated news and social content results should be retrieved, for example, when the user selects an interface to submit the query, or when the user includes a predefined keyword in the query. - The search system receives the
query 307 and generates map results responsive to the query (310). Map results can include any of the various types of map data responsive to the query, e.g., a map image or a satellite image. In some implementations, a marker is shown on the location identified by the query (in the case of a text query). In some implementations, if multiple locations match the query (e.g., “Springfield”), the search system selects the most popular location and provides other matching locations as alternatives. The search system typically centers the viewport on the location identified by the query. In the case of multiple matching locations, the system can center the viewport on the most popular location. - The search system translates the map query into a search query (315). If necessary, the search system translates the query used for the interactive mapping system into a search query that can be used to search news or social content resource collections. If, for example, the
query 307 was a latitude and longitude as specified by a user viewport, the search system can identify a geographic entity name from the latitude and longitude to use as a search query. Multiple geographic entity names are possible for a geographic location, e.g., an address, a business name, a sports arena, a city, a county, a state, or a country. For example, if a user centers the user viewport at 37.8 degrees north and 122.4 degrees west, the search system can use a database to identify geographic entities near those coordinates. For 37.8 degrees north and 122.4 degrees west, the search system can identify the address 1301 Battery St. (address), Fog City Diner (business name), San Francisco Stadium (sports area), San Francisco (city), San Francisco (county), California (state), and United States of America (country). In some implementations, the query chosen depends on the zoom level of the interactive mapping system. For example, if the interactive mapping system is zoomed in to street level, the search system can choose an address or business name. In contrast, if the interactive mapping system is zoomed all the way out, the search system can choose the city, state, or country name for the search query. - The translation of the query may be unnecessary if the user submitted a text query to the interactive mapping system by, for example, typing the query into
query box 105. However, a submitted text query may still undergo modifications to improve search results retrieved in later steps. For example, extra information may be dropped from the query. If a user submits a query for “San Francisco, Calif.,” the search system may drop the “CA” and identify only “San Francisco” as the search query for later steps. Alternatively, the query can be modified by expanding or contracting the query to well-known, popular, or colloquial variations. For example, the search system can recognize that a user query for “LA” is a popular form for the city “Los Angeles,” and can therefore expand the query into “Los Angeles” instead of another query (e.g. Louisiana) for which “LA” is less popular. In some implementations, the search system uses both queries or multiple other variations of a query when searching collections of resources. - The search system generates news search results (320). Using the identified search query, the search system can retrieve news results from one or multiple collections of news resources. The news resources can be ranked by relevance to the query as well as date posted, with newer articles given a higher ranking than older articles. The search system may also give more weight to a news resource that has the search query in the title or dateline of the news resource. For example,
news result 152 as shown inFIG. 1 has the query “San Francisco” in the news story dateline. - The search system generates social content search results (325). The search system can use the identified search query to search publicly available updates from multiple social content services. Similar to news results, the social content search results can be ranked by both relevance and date posted. For example,
social content result 162 ofFIG. 1 can be ranked higher thansocial content result 164 because it was posted more recently. In some implementations, if the user is logged in to a current social content service, the search system can retrieve social content updates from the user's contacts, which might be unavailable to another user. The search system can generate social content results before generating news results or vice versa, or the search system can generate the results in parallel. Alternatively, the search system can generate only news results or only social content results. In some implementations, the search system retrieves both news and social content resources from the same collection. - The search system combines the maps, news, and social content search results (330). The search system can select a subset of the news and social content search results to be presented to the user. In some implementations, the search system selects a specified number of the highest-ranked news and social content results. In some other implementations, the search system arranges the news and social content search results together in a single ranking. In some implementations, the search system normalizes the results before assembling the final ranking so that no particular type of search result dominates or overwhelms results presented in the interface.
- The search system sends the maps, news, and social content results to the client device (335). The search system can send these results over a communication network, e.g., the
network 218 shown inFIG. 2 . In some implementations, the search system automatically and periodically updates the news and social content search results and retransmits them to the client device (branch to 320). - The client device displays the map results with the news and social content results (340). The combined results can be displayed in a single interface, e.g., the
interface 100 as shown inFIG. 1 . - With the process as described in
FIG. 3 , the user can be presented with a continually and automatically updating stream of news and social content about a geographic location without ever typing a search query. Furthermore, thesearch query 307 can be updated each time the user browses to a new geographic location in the user viewport, resulting in continually updated news and social content about each new geographic location. -
FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example interface 400 of a search system that provides an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content updates. The interface inFIG. 4 presents geographic locations identified in news and social content search results as data points in the interactive mapping system. Combining multiple data points in theviewport 430 can provide a “heat map” of the activity relating to a given query. - The
query 410 entered into the example interface 400 need not be a geographic query, and can instead be a query relating to any topic of interest. In this example, the query is “football championship,” relating to a professional football championship game. The search system can retrieve news and social content results responsive to the query, e.g., news results 452 and 454 and social content results 462, 464, and 466. - For news and social content results responsive to the query, the search system can identify geographic entity names and plot the geographic entities in the
viewport 430. In some implementations, the search system can use a database to identify a latitude and longitude location for a geographic entity name. Alternatively, the database can identify an address for a geographic entity name. - For example, in response to the
query 410 “football championship,” the search system can retrieve news result 452, about a Chicago football team reaching the football championship game. The search system can identify geographic entity names in the news result, e.g., Chicago and Pittsburgh. Similarly, the search system can identify that news result 454 includes a geographic entity name “Glendale, Ariz.” In some implementations, the type of geographic entity identified depends on the zoom level of theuser viewport 430. For example, because theuser viewport 430 is at a zoom level that shows an entire country, the search system can identify only cities, states, or country geographic entities. At further zoomed-in levels, the search system could identify other geographic entities, such as business names or street names. - After identifying geographic entity names in the news or social content search results, the search system can identify a location for the geographic entity, e.g., by using a database of geographic entities. For each identified location, the search system can include a marker in the
viewport 430 at the identified location. This process can provide the user with a view of activity in geographic locations relevant to thequery 410. - For example, the search system includes a
marker 422 at the geographic location for Chicago. For multiple markers, the system can cluster the markers to give the user an idea of the number of results identified for that geographic location. In some implementations, the size of the marker increases according to the number of news or social content results relevant to thequery 410. In some other implementations, the color of the markers change according to the number of results relevant to thequery 410, providing a “heat map” effect. - In a similar manner, the search system can identify geographic entities in social content results that were responsive to the
query 410. For example, social content result 462 includes the geographic entity name “Pittsburgh.” The search system can identify the geographic location for Pittsburgh, Pa., and plot a marker in the user viewport accordingly.Social content result 464 includes the geographic entity name “Chicago,” andsocial content result 466 includes the geographic entity name “Glendale, Ariz.” The search system can include in theviewport 430markers 424 and 426 for geographic locations corresponding to each of these geographic entities. -
FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process to generate map results with aggregated news and social content results. In general, a search system obtains information news and social content results relevant to a query and identifies geographic entities in the results. For identified geographic entities, the search system identifies geographic locations and marks these geographic locations in the interactive mapping system. The search system can then combine the map results, news results, and social content results into an interface, e.g., the interface 400 as shown inFIG. 4 . - A search for a topic is initiated (505). The search for a topic can be initiated by a user entering a query into a search box of an interface, e.g., the interface 400 as shown in
FIG. 4 . Aquery 507 is delivered to the search system. Thequery 507 can be identified as query for which map results and aggregated news and social content results should be retrieved, for example, when the user selects an interface to submit the query, or when the user includes a predefined keyword in the query. - The search system generates news results (510) and social content results (515). The results can be retrieved in a substantially similar manner to
steps FIG. 3 . The search system need not retrieve results for both news and social content results, and can generate the results in any order or in parallel. - The search system identifies geographic entities in the results (520). In some implementations, the search system uses a database of geographic entity names to identify geographic entities in the news and social content results. The search system can also identify only certain types of geographic entities based on a current zoom level of a user viewport. For example, if the user viewport shows an entire country, the search system can only identify city, state, or country geographic entities.
- The search system identifies geographic locations for the identified geographic entities (530). The search system can use a database to identify a latitude and longitude location or an address for each identified geographic entity.
- The search system marks the identified geographic locations on a map (535). Using the identified geographic locations, the search system can include a marker in the viewport of an interactive mapping system. The search system can cluster the markers, use different sizes and shapes, or use color coding to indicate the number of markers at a common geographic location.
- The search system combines the maps, news, and social content results (540). In some implementations, the search system combines the results into a single interface, e.g., the interface as shown in
FIG. 4 . - The search system sends the maps, news, and social content results to the client device (545). The search system can send these results over a communication network, e.g., the
network 218 as shown inFIG. 2 . The search system can also automatically and periodically update the news and social content search results (branch to 510). The search system can also accordingly update the corresponding location markers for geographic entities identified in newly retried news and social content results. - The client device displays the map results with the news and social content results (550).
- This process provides the user with a continually and automatically updating “heat map” of geographic locations relevant to the provided query. In some implementations, the search system can allow the user to view a time lapse of previous news and social content results. The user can specify a previous time period and view an animation of geographic locations relevant to previous news and social content results, providing the user with a view of previous activity in geographic locations identified in previous news and social content search results.
-
FIG. 6 is an illustration of anexample interface 600 of a search system that provides an interactive mapping system with aggregated news and social content updates. The interface inFIG. 6 differentiates geographic regions based on the number of geographic locations in that region that were identified in news and social content search results. These geographic regions also provide a type of “heat map” that shows regions relevant to a particular submitted query. - The search system receives a
query 610 and generates news and social content results, e.g.,news results 652 and 654, and social content results 662, 664, and 666 responsive to the query. The search system identifies geographic entities in the news and social content results and their corresponding geographic locations by, e.g., using a database of geographic entities. - Instead of including a marker for each identified geographic location, the search system can maintain a count of the number of news and search results inside a geographic region. Any geographic region can be defined by the search system. However, in some implementations, using predefined geographic regions, e.g., states or countries, simplifies the process. For example, in
interface 600, the geographic regions are states of the United States. - The search system can differentiate the presentation of the geographic regions according to the number of news and social content results identifying a location within that region. In some implementations, the geographic regions are differentiated by color. In some other implementations, the geographic regions are differentiated by fill pattern.
- For example,
geographic region 622 corresponds to Arizona. The search system can identify thatsocial content result 664 includes the geographic entity “Arizona.” Other news and social content results that include “Arizona” as well as geographic entities within the state of Arizona can be counted. In response, the search system can present the geographic region of theviewport 630 corresponding to Arizona in a particular color, fill pattern, or other distinguishing characteristic. - The search system can identify that multiple news and social content results include “New York” or geographic entities contained within the state of New York. If the number of results responsive to the
query 610 “football championship” that include “New York” (or geographic entities within New York) is different than the number of results that include “Arizona” (or geographic entities within Arizona), the search system can present theregion 622 corresponding to New York with a different color, fill pattern, or other distinguishing characteristic. - In this example,
geographic regions news results 652 and 654, and social content results 662, 664, and 666) responsive to thequery 610. In some implementations, the news and social content search results are grouped by their corresponding geographic region. The grouped geographic regions can be ranked by the frequency of news and social content search results in each respective geographic region.Geographic regions - Thus, the
interface 600 presents the user a quick “heat map” view of geographic regions included in news and social content search results responsive to aquery 610 identifying a specific topic. - Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
