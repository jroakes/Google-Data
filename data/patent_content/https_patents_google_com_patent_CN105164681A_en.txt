Abstract
A device is configured to receive a translation query that requests a translation of terms from a source language to a target language; determine translation features associated with the translation query; assign a feature value to each of the translation features to form feature values; apply a feature weight to each of the feature values to generate a final value; and determine whether to provide a dialog translation user interface or a non-dialog translation user interface based on whether the final value satisfies a threshold. The dialog translation user interface may facilitate translation of a conversation, the non-dialog translation user interface may provide translation search results, and the non-dialog translation user interface may be different than the dialog translation user interface. The device is also configured to provide the dialog translation user interface for display when the final value satisfies the threshold
