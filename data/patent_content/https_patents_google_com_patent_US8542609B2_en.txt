Definitions
- the present invention relates to a method and a device for multicast rate optimization.
- the present invention relates to a method for controlling an encoder in a communications system and an associated device.
- Multicast is a bandwidth efficient technique for transmission of a source signal from a transmitter to a plurality of receivers in a communications system.
- an encoder is included in a transmitter, and a decoder is included in a receiver.
- the purpose of encoding a signal is to achieve a compact representation of the signal.
- redundancy removal that is exploiting signal properties that are predictable, e.g., the correlation between pixels in an image (spatial redundancy), the correlation between pixels in adjacent video signal frames (temporal redundancy), etc.
- irrelevancy removal that is exploiting the indifference of a receiver to certain variations in the signal representation, e.g., the indifference of a viewer to small quantization errors in a video signal.
- the efficiency of multicast is mainly due to the fact that the encoding of the source signal needs to be transmitted only once over any link in the communications system.
- the bandwidth efficiency comes with the disadvantage that all receivers in the communications system are constrained to use the same encoding of the source signal.
- every receiver perceives the same signal quality, which is determined by the bit-rate of the encoding, regardless of their respective capacity to receive signals.
- each receiver may have a different capacity to receive signals compared to the other receivers in the communications system.
- coding systems need to take into account the reliability of the communications system in which they operate.
- a communications system there is generally a certain probability of non-ideal transmission of signals, for example distorting the encoded signal or transmitting only parts of the encoded signal.
- demands on the coding systems may change rapidly due to variations in the load on the communications system, inaccurate estimations of the capacity of receivers to receive signals, receivers joining and leaving the transmission session, etc.
- an encoder should therefore be able to quickly adapt to changes in the estimated conditions of the communications system and account for uncertainty of the estimated conditions.
- Conventional methods for choosing the bit-rate of the encoding are based on iterative procedures having high computational complexity, see, e.g., Y. R. Yang, M. S. Kim, and S. S. Lam, “Optimal partitioning of multicast receivers”, Int. Conf. on Network Protocols, pp. 129-140, November 2000, H. Yousefi'zadeh, H. Jafarkhani, and A. Habibi, “Layered media multicast control (LMMC): Rate allocation and partitioning”, IEEE/ACM transactions on Networking, vol. 13, pp. 540-553, 2005, and J.
- a key aspect of the multicast bit-rate optimization problem is the time variance of the communications system, e.g., the load on the communications system, inaccurate estimations of the capacity of receivers to receive signals, receivers joining and leaving the transmission session, etc.
- a method for controlling an encoder in a communications system as defined in the independent claim 1 is provided.
- the properties of the decodable subsets of the streams preferably consists of, but are not limited to, transmission quality measures that have an impact on the overall encoder-decoder system performance.
- uncertainties in estimates of conditions of the communications system are taken into account by modelling the conditions, in particular the average distortion perceived by the receivers, as the outcome of a stochastic variable, where the stochastic nature of the model accounts for uncertainties in the estimates of the conditions. Also, because the output of the method according to the first aspect of the invention depends on the estimates of the conditions, the method is adaptive to varying conditions in the communications system.
- an encoder for use in a communications system including a plurality of receivers as defined in the independent claim 8 .
- the encoder according to the second aspect of the invention is adapted to perform the method according to the first aspect of the invention, and thus the same advantages as for the first aspect of the invention apply to the second aspect of the invention.
- This ensures that the average distortion perceived by the receivers, contained in the one or more cells and the bordering cells of said one or more cells, is minimal.
- the properties of the decodable subsets of the streams consists of one or more of the following: the signal representation length per time unit, the error resilience, and the erasure resilience. These properties directly influence the perceived distortion by the receivers, and thus it is advantageous to be able to vary these properties during the process of controlling the encoder.
- feedback information for the plurality of receivers is received, wherein the feedback information includes a measure of a constraint on the rate that may be used to transmit signals to a receiver, wherein the constraint consists of the available bandwidth for communicating with the receiver.
- the plurality of streams includes video or audio signals.
- the encoder includes a plurality of sub-encoders, each sub-encoder outputting one stream, wherein each sub-encoder is provided with a property of the stream that is outputted by the sub-encoder.
- the encoder includes a layered (embedded) or multiple-description encoder outputting a plurality of streams, which form a number of decodable subsets, wherein the layered or multiple-description encoder is provided with a property for each decodable subset that is outputted by said layered or multiple-description encoder.
- each stream of the plurality of streams is transmitted to one or more predetermined receivers.
- the communications system may be regarded as a relay network for facilitating transfer of signals between transmitters (encoders) and receivers.
- the total number of streams that a receiver may receive is equal to the number of decodable subsets of the streams.
- the method according to the first aspect of the invention further includes receiving feedback information for the plurality of receivers, wherein the feedback information includes a measure of the rate that may be used to transmit signals to a receiver, and furthermore, choosing one or more cells of the at least one cell, and for each of the at least one or more chosen cells determine if the condition (i) above is satisfied for the cell, and, if that is not the case, assign a new value for the rate of the decodable subsets of the streams that is associated with the cell, such that the condition (i) above is satisfied for the cell.

Abstract
Description
The parameters a, b, θ, R0 and D0 in equations (1) and (2) are model parameters chosen such that d(r) corresponds to the distortion perceived by the receiver. These parameters can, for example, be chosen in an off-line search for the parameters that, via the model d(r), best represent the perceived distortion. Further, these parameters may change over time in order to better suit the signals, e.g., video signals, that are being transmitted at any given instance.
V i ={c:a(r,c)=r i}, (3)
where the assignment function is defined by
r i =a(r,c)={r i :r i ≦c≦r i+1 ,r i εr}. (4)
The assignment function ensures that each receiver obtains the stream having the highest rate available, while not exceeding the constraint of the receiver.
where r0=0 and rI+1→∞.
Δ(r i)=Δi. (7)
The inverse of Δ(c) represents the density of reconstruction points:
g(c)=1/Δ(c). (8)
By integrating the density of reconstruction points, the total number of reconstruction points is obtained:
In order to find the minimum distortion D, the density of reconstruction points g(c) is optimized by some optimization method, for example by applying the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian to be minimized is
where W(·) is the Lambert W function, defined according to:
X=W(X)exp(W(X)). (13)
γ=h(c) (15)
that maps c to γ in the interval [0,1]. The compressor h(c) is such that the optimal quantization cells in the γ domain all have equal width. By using the relation between a random variable and its transform by a monotonic function, the density of reconstruction point density can be expressed as
where it has been used that gΓ(γ)=I. Then, reevaluating the Lagrangian [equation (11)] for
and solving for
the following relation between the density of reconstruction points g(c) and the compressor h(c) can be found:
The optimal quantization cells are found by expanding the optimal quantization cells in the companded domain with the inverse of equation (17). The optimal reconstruction points are the reconstruction points for which the distortion within the cells is minimized and the quantization cell widths are not altered. For cells {Vi:i=2, . . . , I}, the reconstruction points are set as the lower boundary, because choosing any other point would result in non-optimal quantization cell boundaries according to the assignment function in equation (4). This is not the case for the first cell. Namely, choosing any reconstruction point within the cell effectively divides the cell into two subcells. The first subcell has the reconstruction point at rate zero, r0=0, and all receivers assigned to r0 are excluded from the multicast. The second subcell has the reconstruction point r1 as its lower boundary. r1 is set to the value that minimizes the expected distortion within the first cell, that is
A change in any element ri′ of the set of reconstruction points r affects the distortion of receivers in the cells that borders the cell Vi′. Let the set S contain the cells that borders the cell Vi′. Then, if ri′ is such that the distortion contributions of the cells in S is minimal, according to
ri′ is so called locally optimal.
