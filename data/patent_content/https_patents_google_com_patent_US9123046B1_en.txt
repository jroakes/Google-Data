Definitions
- This specification relates to identifying terms, e.g., spam terms within a collection of documents.
- map spam In the context of web mapping services, the owners of a business can attempt to attract customers by creating fake instances of their business in geographic locations where their business does not actually exist. These fake instances of a business, which are referred to by this specification as “map spam,” may appear on a map interface generated by the web mapping service when a user searches for a business, and may drive traffic to an online- or telephone-based sales channel for the business.
- map spamming In general, businesses which practice map spamming rely on the fact that, when a user performs a search using a web mapping service to identify nearby businesses, the user may not reconfirm whether the business is actually located in an identified location.
- a plumbing business may submit information to a web mapping service to indicate that the plumbing business has a brick-and-mortar presence on every block along a street.
- a user that lives along the street may search for a nearby plumber using the web mapping service when, for example, the user requires emergency plumbing service.
- the web mapping service may display a map that shows that the plumbing business is near to the user, and may display a telephone number or web address of the plumbing business. Comforted by the fact that the plumbing business appears to be nearby, the user may contact the plumbing business for service, even though the plumbing business may in fact be located a great distance away, and other plumbing business may actually be located closer to the user.
- Map spam may be detrimental to many different parties. For example, map spam harms the provider of the web mapping service because the information provided to the users is inaccurate, rendering the web mapping service's databases untrustworthy. Map spam harms users, who may experience delays when dealing with a business that is located farther from the user than is represented. Moreover, map spam harms local businesses, who may suffer a loss of business when local customers are diverted to faraway businesses, because of the faraway businesses' misleading listings.
- spam terms are identified by calculating a blacklist term frequency-inverse document frequency (BTF-IDF) score for multiple terms, and by selecting, as the spam terms, the terms that have scores above or below a threshold score.
- BTF-IDF blacklist term frequency-inverse document frequency
- the multiple terms may be derived from documents that are associated with accounts that have been designated as spam accounts.
- the multiple terms may be derived from account information, e.g., contact information or advertising information, that an account holder has supplied to a web mapping service.
- the BTF-IDF score may be calculated by counting the number of times the term is found in the documents that are associated with the accounts that have been designated as spam accounts, and comparing that number with the number of the times the term is found in the documents that are associated with the accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts.
- the documents that are associated with the accounts that have been designated as spam accounts are merged into a single document before counting occurs, and the BTF-IDF score is calculated using an equation that is derived from the equation which is used to calculate a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weight.
- TF-IDF term frequency-inverse document frequency
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving, for each of multiple accounts, a document associated with the account.
- the methods also include the actions of identifying the accounts that have been designated as spam accounts, and merging the documents that are associated with the accounts that have been designated as spam accounts, into a single, merged document.
- the methods include the actions of determining, for each of one or more terms that occur in the merged document, a blacklist term frequency (BTF) that represents a number of times that the term occurs in the merged document.
- BTF blacklist term frequency
- the methods include the actions of determining a number of accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, and determining, for each of the terms, a number of the documents that are associated with accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, in which the term occurs.
- the methods include the actions of determining, for each of the terms, an inverse document frequency (IDF) for the term based on the number of accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, and the number of documents that are associated with the accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, in which the term occurs.
- IDF inverse document frequency
- the methods include the actions of determining, for each of the one or more terms, a blacklist term frequency-inverse document frequency (BTF-IDF) score by multiplying the blacklist term frequency for the term by the inverse document frequency for the term, and using the blacklist term frequency-inverse document frequency scores to identify spam terms.
- BTF-IDF blacklist term frequency-inverse document frequency
- inventions of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a system of one or more computers can be so configured by virtue of software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be so configured by virtue having instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- determining the IDF for each of the terms is based only on the number of accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts and on the number of documents that are associated with the accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, in which the term occurs.
- the determined BTF-IDF score associated with a term in the merged document satisfies
- BTF ⁇ - ⁇ IDF BTF ⁇ log ⁇ ⁇ ( N + 1 k + 1 ) , ( 1 )
- N represents the determined number of the accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts
- k represents the determined number of the documents that are associated with the accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, in which the term occurs.
- the methods can include the actions of associating spam likelihood to each of the one or more terms in the merged document.
- the spam likelihood associated with a term is proportional to the determined BTF-IDF score associated with the term.
- the methods can include the actions of generating a data structure of spam terms based on sorting the terms included in the merged document based on the respective determined BTF-IDF scores, and providing the generated data structure for assessing whether a given account is a spam account or a non-spam account.
- an account from among the multiple accounts can be associated with an entity that requested to present entity-related information at a geo-location represented on an online map.
- the entity-related information can be stored in the document associated with the account and can include the geo-location, the entity's identifier, description of products or services offered by the entity, and one or more of the entity's contact info and the entity's website information.
- the methods can include the actions of assessing whether a proposed account is a spam account or a non-spam account based on the spam terms identified by said using the BTF-IDF scores, and designating the proposed account as a spam account or a non-spam account based on a result of said assessment.
- the methods can include the actions of receiving a request to add a new account, and generating a score for the new account at least in part by applying the BTF-IDF scores corresponding to the terms included in the merged document. For example, generating the score for the new account can include adding, for all words included in a document associated with the new account, the corresponding BTF-IDF scores determined for the terms included in the merged document.
- generating the score for the new account can include adding, for distinct words included in a document associated with the new account, the corresponding BTF-IDF scores determined for the terms included in the merged document.
- the methods can include the actions of designating the new account as a spam account in response to determining that the generated score of the new account is larger than a specified threshold.
- the described subject matter can also be implemented methods that include the actions of receiving, for each of multiple accounts, a document associated with the account, and identifying the accounts that have been designated as target accounts.
- the methods also include the actions of determining, for each of one or more terms that occur in documents corresponding to the target accounts, a frequency that represents a number of times that the term occurs in the documents corresponding to the target accounts.
- the methods include the actions of determining a number of accounts that have not been designated as target accounts, and determining, for each of the terms, a number of the documents that are associated with accounts that have not been designated as target accounts, in which the term occurs.
- the methods include the actions of determining, for each of the terms, another frequency for the term based on the number of accounts that have not been designated as target accounts, and the number of documents that are associated with the accounts that have not been designated as target accounts, in which the term occurs. Additionally, the methods include the actions of determining, for each of the one or more terms, a score by multiplying the frequency for the term by the other frequency for the term.
- the methods can include the actions of merging the documents that are associated with the accounts that have been designated as target accounts, into a single, merged document, prior to said determining the respective frequencies of the one or more terms that occur in the documents that are associated with the accounts that have been designated as the target accounts.
- the methods can include the actions of using the scores to identify target terms.
- the target accounts are spam accounts.
- the frequency can be a blacklist term frequency (BTF) that represents a number of times that the term occurs in the documents corresponding to the spam accounts.
- BTF blacklist term frequency
- the other frequency for the term is an inverse document frequency for the term determined based on the number of accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, and the number of documents that are associated with the accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, in which the term occurs.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. For example, by reducing map spam in accordance with the disclosed technology, information stored in the web mapping service's databases is rendered trustworthy, such that the information provided to the users by the web mapping service can be accurate. Further, a user of the web mapping service may avoid delays caused by spam business located farther from the user than is represented, if such spam businesses are removed from the map-search by using the described systems and techniques. Furthermore, the disclosed technologies can reduce faraway businesses' misleading listings, which in turn can lead to local vendors/service providers gaining business over the faraway businesses.
- reducing the number of spam accounts by using the processes disclosed in this specification can free storage space required to store the spam account information. Also, having to manage fewer spam accounts can result in maintaining more compact search indexes, which may in turn lead to faster searches.
- the process of setting up new accounts can be simplified by using the disclosed technologies. For example, fewer required manual operations are needed for setting up proposed accounts, and the speed of reviewing the proposed accounts is increased. Moreover in some cases, new accounts can be set up automatically in accordance with the systems and techniques described in this specification.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example spam term detector that identifies spam terms within a collection of documents.
- FIG. 2 is an example of a method for identifying spam terms within a collection of documents.
- FIG. 3 shows an example equation for generating scores that are used to rank spam terms in a collection of documents.
- FIG. 4 shows an example of an account manager system that determines whether an account is a spam account or a non-spam account.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example spam term detector 100 that identifies spam terms within a collection of documents.
- the spam term detector 100 can be implemented as a utility executed by a computer system, for example in conjunction with a web mapping service, (e.g., a provider of interactive electronic maps) to identify and/or score spam terms within a collection of documents associated with multiple accounts.
- a web mapping service e.g., a provider of interactive electronic maps
- the computer system may reference the spam terms to automatically classify new or proposed accounts as likely spam accounts or likely non-spam accounts.
- the spam term detector 100 can receive documents 101 , 103 , 105 , 107 and 109 associated with multiple accounts “ABC,” “ABD,” “ABE,” “ABF,” and “ABG,” respectively.
- a document may, but need not, correspond to a file.
- a document may be stored in a portion of a file that holds other documents, in a single file dedicated to the document in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- Each account can be associated with an instance of a business, e.g., with a particular location or storefront identified by an account owner, such as a vendor or service provider.
- the documents associated with each account generally store business information related to the account, such as account identifiers, business identifiers, street addresses or other geo-location information, website information, contact information, advertising information, review information, boilerplate information, terms and policies, operating hours, slogans, or other information provided to the web mapping service by the respective account owners.
- Some accounts e.g., accounts “ABC” and “ABD,” have been designated as spam accounts (in the figure, labeled “Spam (Y)”). These accounts may have been designated as spam accounts using the processes that are performed by the spam term detector 100 , and that are described below, or the accounts may have been designated as spam accounts through other processes. For example, an account may be designated as a spam account when a user drives by a physical location that a vendor or service provider has identified as being a storefront, discovers that no such storefront actually exists, and reports this discrepancy to the web mapping service.
- An account that has not been designated as a spam account may be an account that has not yet been evaluated (in the case of accounts “ABE” and “ABF,” labeled “Spam (“?)”), or an account that has been evaluated and designated as non-spam accounts (in the case of account “ABG,” labeled “Spam (N)”).
- the documents 101 , 103 , 105 , 107 and 109 are received from the respective account owners by the spam term detector 100 .
- the documents may be received by the spam term detector 100 when, for example, the respective account owners attempt to add a new instance of a business to the web mapping service, or when the respective account owners attempt to supplement information that they have previously provided in association with the instance.
- the received documents 101 , 103 , 105 , 107 and 109 are processed by various modules of the spam detector 100 to generate a list of spam terms 135 , which can be stored in persistent storage 140 .
- these various modules include a document merger 110 , a BTF-IDF generator 120 , and a BTF-IDF analyzer 130 .
- the spam term detector 100 receives the documents 101 , 103 , 105 , 107 and 109 .
- the document merger 110 merges the documents 101 , 103 that are associated with spam accounts, into a single, merged document 115 .
- the resulting merged document 115 includes the aggregated content of both of the documents 101 , 103 .
- the merged document 115 is output from the document merger 110 , and is provided to the BTF-IDF generator 120 .
- the document merger 110 does not merge the documents 105 , 106 and 109 , as they are not associated with accounts that have been designated as spam accounts.
- the merged document 115 and the documents 105 , 107 , 109 that are associated with accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts are input to the BTF-IDF generator 120 .
- the BTF-IDF generator 120 determines a blacklist term frequency (BTF) for each of the terms that occur in the merged document 115 .
- the BTF represents a number of times that a particular term occurs in the merged document 115 .
- the BTF-IDF generator determines that the term “storefront” has a BTF of “2,” because the term “storefront” occurs in the merged document 115 twice.
- the spam documents 101 and 103 need not be merged in one single document, but are instead processed individually and/or sequentially.
- a BTF associated with a term can be calculated separately for each document designated as spam. Then, the respective BTFs associated with the term corresponding to the multiple documents can be combined in a combined-BTF associated with the term.
- a BTF associated with the term that occurs in a document 101 associated with the spam account ABC can be determined by counting occurrences of the term in all the documents 101 , 103 associated with the spam accounts ABC, ABD.
- the BTF-IDF generator 120 also determines, for each of the terms in the merged document 115 , a value k, representing a number of the documents 105 , 107 , 109 that are associated with accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, in which the term occurs.
- a value k representing a number of the documents 105 , 107 , 109 that are associated with accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, in which the term occurs.
- the BTF-IDF generator determines that the term “storefront” has a value k of “1,” because, among documents 105 , 107 and 109 , the term “storefront” only occurs once, in document 109 .
- the BTF-IDF generator 120 also determines a value N, representing a total number of accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts. In FIG. 1 , the BTF-IDF generator 120 determines a value N of “3,” because three accounts, i.e., accounts ABE, ABF, and ABG, have not been designated as spam accounts.
- the BTF-IDF generator 120 determines an inverse document frequency (IDF) for each term from the merged document 115 .
- IDF inverse document frequency
- IDF log ⁇ ( N + 1 k + 1 ) . ( 2 )
- the BTF-IDF generator 120 calculates an IDF of log(4/2), or “0.301”, for the term “storefront.”
- the BTF-IDF generator 120 determines the BTF-IDF score for each term by multiplying the BTF for the term, by the IDF for the term.
- the BTF-IDF generator may generate a table 125 or other dataset, specifying the respective BTF-IDF scores for each term in the merged document 115 . As shown in table 125 , the BTF-IDF generator 120 determines a BTF-IDF score of “0.602” for the term “storefront.”
- the BTF-IDF analyzer 130 receives the BTF-IDF scores output from the BTF-IDF generator, e.g., as reflected in the table 125 . Because the BTF-IDF scores reflect an extent to which a term exhibits characteristics associated with spam terms, the BTF-IDF analyzer 130 uses the BTF-IDF score associated with each term of the merged document 115 to coarsely classify the term as spam or not spam. In other implementations, the BTF-IDF analyzer assigns a finer spam likelihood to each term, e.g., most-likely spam, likely spam, unlikely spam, etc.
- the BTF-IDF analyzer 130 can generate a list of spam terms 135 , for example by applying a predefined or dynamically defined threshold to the BTF-IDF scores, and selecting the terms of the merged document 115 that have a BTF-IDF score which satisfies the threshold.
- the BTF-IDF analyzer 130 may instead designate the terms of the merged document 115 that have a highest or lowest associated BTF-IDF score, in absolute terms or in terms of a percentage, as spam terms.
- the BTF-IDS analyzer 130 may designate the terms as likely spam terms or as candidate spam terms, to be subject to further evaluation.
- the BTF-IDF analyzer 130 can sort the list of spam terms 135 by respective BTF-IDF score, and can provide the list of spam terms 135 to the web mapping service. As described below with reference to FIG. 4 , the web mapping service may, for example, use the list of spam terms 135 to assess whether a new account is a spam account or a non-spam account.
- FIG. 2 is an example of a process 200 for identifying spam terms within a collection of documents.
- the process 200 can be executed by one or more computers, for example in conjunction with a web mapping service, to identify and/or score spam terms within a collection of documents associated with multiple accounts.
- a document associated with each of multiple accounts is received.
- the multiple accounts can be associated with respective instances of businesses, e.g., with particular locations identified by the account owners.
- the respective documents can include business information related to the associated accounts, such as business identifiers, street addresses, contact information, and slogans.
- the documents can be received from the respective account owners through some document uploading process, for instance.
- a large number of accounts and their associated documents can be managed by the web mapping service. For example, there may be tens of accounts associated with storefronts located on each block of a city's commercial and/or business districts. Sources of data other than business accounts can be used.
- an account can be automatically identified as a spam account by using, for example, the spam term detector 100 described in connection with FIG. 1 .
- the processes used for identifying the spam accounts can receive manual input for consideration. For example, an account may be designated as a spam account based on user input determining that no such storefront actually exists at the visited location of a physical location identified by an account owner as being a storefront.
- the documents associated with the accounts that have been designated as spam accounts are merged, into a single, merged document.
- all of the terms present in the merged document are evaluated as possible spam terms.
- the number of accounts identified as spam accounts M may represent a fraction of the total number of accounts managed by the web mapping service.
- the terms included in respective M documents associated with the M accounts that were designated as spam accounts are stored into the merged document. For example, terms from a second document associated with a second spam account can be entered in the merged document after terms from a first document associated with a first spam account; terms from a third document associated with a third spam account can be entered in the merged document after the terms from the second document associated with the second spam account, and so on.
- the merged document therefore forms a sequence of terms including the terms associated with the first account stored at the beginning of the merged document, the terms associated with the second account stored in the middle of the merged document, and the terms associated with the last, M th account stored at the end of the merged document.
- Merging the documents may include filtering terms that already occur within the document.
- the merged document can be generated by storing a sequence of terms including the terms associated with the first account stored at the end of the merged document, the terms associated with the second account stored in the middle of the merged document, and so on, with the terms associated with the last, M th account stored at the beginning of the merged document.
- a BTF is determined, such that BTF represents a number of times that the term occurs in the merged document.
- a term in the merged document can be a single word, e.g., any one of the words “free”, “is”, “or”, “prompt”, “service” or “the”.
- BTF(“service”) all the occurrences of the word “service” in the merged document are counted.
- BTF(“the”) all the occurrences of the word “the” in the merged document are counted.
- a BTF is not calculated for terms that occur in a stoplist, for example common terms such as “the” or “a.” If a BTF has already been calculated for a term, the BTF may not be re-calculated if the term occurs again in the merged document.
- the terms can be the n-gram “prompt service or the service is free.”
- BTF(“prompt service or the service is free”) all the occurrences of this combination of six words in the merged document, in this exact order and having the word “service” repeated twice, are counted.
- the determined BTF(“service”) and BTF(“the”) may be very large numbers, which is indicative that the terms “service” and “the” are good candidates to be evaluated as spam terms in accordance with the process 200 .
- the BTF of a term present in one of the documents associated with the spam accounts is determined by counting the number of times the term is found in all the documents that are associated with the accounts that have been designated as spam accounts, without merging these documents into the merged document.
- a number of accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts is determined.
- the number N of accounts from among the multiple accounts managed by the web mapping service that have not been designated as spam accounts can be accounts that have not yet been evaluated, or that have been evaluated and designated as non-spam accounts.
- the N accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts is found by subtracting the M accounts that have been identified as spam accounts from a total number of accounts (M+N) managed by the web mapping service.
- a number of the documents that are associated with accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, in which a term occurs is determined.
- the determined number k of documents associated with accounts designated as non-spam accounts in which the term “service” occurs can be small compared to the number N of documents associated with accounts designated as non-spam accounts, k ⁇ N.
- the term “service” may occur infrequently in documents associated with accounts designated as non-spam accounts. This determination would confirm that the term “service” is a good candidate to be classified as a spam term, as initially suggested by the large BTF(“service”) determined at 240 .
- the determined number k of documents associated with accounts designated as non-spam accounts in which the term “the” occurs can be almost equal to the number N of documents associated with accounts designated as non-spam accounts, k ⁇ N. Specifically, the term “the” may appear in almost all the documents associated with accounts designated as non-spam accounts. Such a determination would contradict the assumption that the term “the” is a good candidate to be classified as a spam term, as initially suggested by the large BTF(“the”) determined at 240 .
- an inverse document frequency (IDF) for the term is determined based on the number N of accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, and the number k of documents that are associated with the accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts, in which the term occurs.
- the determined IDF of a term can be used as a multiplying weight that either reduces the likelihood that the term is classified as spam term, when the term commonly appears in the accounts designated as non-spam accounts, or that reinforces the likelihood that the term is classified as spam term if the term infrequently appears in the accounts designated as non-spam accounts.
- the log of a large ratio (N+1)/(k+1)>>1, is calculated.
- the IDF(“service”) results in a value much larger than zero.
- the log of a ratio approximately equal to 1, (N+1)/(k+1) ⁇ 1 is calculated.
- the IDF(“service”) results in a value close to zero.
- a blacklist term frequency-inverse document frequency (BTF-IDF) score is determined by multiplying the BTF for the term (as determined at 240 ) by the IDF for the term (as determined at 270 .)
- BTF-IDF blacklist term frequency-inverse document frequency
- a large BTF-IDF score determined for a given term can reflect that the given term exhibits characteristics associated with spam terms.
- a term can have a small BTF-IDF score under the following different circumstances: (i) the term has a large BTF, corresponding to many occurrences of the term in the merged document, but has a small IDF, corresponding to a large number of documents associated with accounts designated as non-spam accounts in which the term occurs; (ii) the term has a large IDF, corresponding to a small number of documents associated with accounts designated as non-spam accounts in which the term occurs, but has a small BTF, corresponding to few occurrences of the term in the merged document; and (iii) the term has a small BTF, corresponding to few occurrences of the term in the merged document, and has a small IDF, corresponding to a large number of documents associated with accounts designated as non-spam accounts in which the term occurs. Accordingly, a small BTF-IDF score determined
- the BTF-IDF scores determined at 280 are used to identify spam terms. As described above, the determined BTF-IDF scores can reflect an extent to which a term exhibits characteristics associated with spam terms. Therefore, the BTF-IDF score associated with each term of the merged document can be used to classify the term as spam or not spam.
- a spam likelihood proportional with the associated BTF-IDF can be assigned to each term in the merged document. In the latter case, all the terms in the merged document are treated as spam terms.
- spam terms are selected from among the terms in the merged document by applying a predefined or dynamically defined threshold to the BTF-IDF scores, and selecting the terms of the merged document that have a BTF-IDF score which satisfies the threshold.
- terms from the merged document that have a highest or lowest associated BTF-IDF score, in absolute terms or in terms of a percentage can be designated as spam terms or likely spam terms.
- the identified spam terms can be sorted by respective BTF-IDF score and can provided as a sorted list of spam terms to the web mapping service, as described above in connection with FIG. 1 .
- the web mapping service may use the provided list of spam terms to assess whether a proposed account is a spam account or a non-spam account as described below in connection with FIG. 4 . Additionally, the web mapping service may use the provided list of spam terms to reassess a current designation of the M spam accounts and of the N accounts not designated as spam accounts. In some implementations, the reassessment can be performed periodically, for example every six months. In other implementations, the reassessment can be performed every time a user requests a map search from the web mapping service.
- FIG. 3 shows an example equation for generating scores that are used to rank spam terms in a collection of documents.
- the collection of documents includes one blacklisted document associated with accounts that have been designated as spam accounts, and N other documents that are not associated with accounts that have been designated as spam accounts.
- the blacklisted document from the collection of documents can be generated by merging the content of M emails that were discovered in spam email accounts.
- the N other documents from the collection of documents that are not blacklisted correspond to emails that were discovered in accounts that are not designated as spam email accounts.
- the blacklisted document from the collection of documents can be generated by merging the content of M webpages that were found on domains or subdomains that have been designated as spam domains or subdomains. Further, the N other documents from the collection of documents that are not blacklisted correspond to webpages that were found on domains or subdomains that have not been designated as spam domains or subdomains. In some other implementations related to map spam, the blacklisted document from the collection of documents can be generated by merging the content of M documents associated with accounts designated as spam accounts. Additionally, the N other documents from the collection of documents that are not blacklisted correspond to accounts that have not been designated as spam accounts.
- the score 300 represents BTF-IDF of a term included in the blacklisted document.
- the BTF of a term in the blacklisted document is determined as a number of times that the term occurs in the blacklisted document.
- the IDF of a term in the blacklisted document is determined as the log of a ratio that has in the numerator a total number of documents in the collection of documents, i.e., the merged, blacklisted document is counted as “1” plus the N other documents that are not blacklisted are counted separately, and in the denominator a total number of documents in which the term occurs, i.e., the blacklisted, merged document is counted as “1” plus the total number k of the documents that have not been blacklisted, and in which the term occurs, are counted separately.
- the score 300 of a term in the blacklisted document can be determined as the BTF-IDF by multiplying BTF and IDF, based on Equation (1′)
- the candidate spam terms from the merged document that are scored based on Equation (1′) can be used to generate a document score for a newly received document that is to be added to the collection of the documents. Further, the generated document score can be used to assess a spam likelihood of the newly received document.
- an email filter may use the scored spam terms to assess whether an incoming email is spam email or non-spam email. Based on a result of the assessment, the email filter may direct the incoming email to the addressee's inbox if the incoming email is classified as non-spam email, or may quarantine the received email if the incoming email is classified as spam email.
- a webpage filter may use the scored spam terms to assess whether a webpage to which a user seeks access is a spam webpage or a non-spam webpage. Based on a result of the assessment, the webpage filter may selectively allow or disallow loading of the webpage to which the user sought access.
- a web mapping service may use the scored spam terms to assess whether a proposed account is a spam account or a non-spam account, as described below in connection with FIG. 4 . Based on a result of the assessment, the web mapping service may selectively accept or reject registration of the proposed account. In case of a rejection, the web mapping service can de-rank or remove information related to the proposed account from results of map searches.
- FIG. 4 shows an example of an account manager 400 used to determine whether an account is a spam account or a non-spam account.
- the account manager 400 can be implemented as a utility executed by one or more computers, for example in conjunction with a web mapping service, to automatically classify new or proposed accounts as likely spam accounts or likely non-spam accounts by referencing spam terms identified and scored by the spam term detector 100 described above in connection with FIG. 1 .
- the account manager 400 can receive documents 405 , 407 associated with proposed accounts “AAA,” and “BBB.” As described above in connection with FIG. 1 , each of the proposed accounts “AAA,” and “BBB” can be associated with an instance of a business, e.g., with a particular location or storefront identified by the account owner such as a vendor or a service provider.
- the documents 405 , 407 store information provided by the owners of the proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB” to the web mapping service about the respective instances of the businesses.
- the documents 405 , 407 can be received through an input/output (I/O) interface 450 of the account manager 400 and are processed by one or more modules of the account manager 400 to classify the proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB” associated with the received documents 405 , 407 as likely spam or non-spam accounts.
- the one or more modules include an account scorer 455 .
- the account scorer 455 generates scores of the received documents 405 , 407 based on a list of spam terms 435 stored in persistent storage 440 , and then classifies the proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB” based on the generated scores.
- the list of spam terms 435 can be the list of spam terms 135 generated by the spam term detector 100 as described above in connection with FIG. 1 .
- Account scores and classifications generated by the account scorer 455 can be recorded in a data structure 445 (e.g., a table) stored in the persistent storage 440 .
- the persistent storage 440 can be part of the account manager 400 , for example, can be a storage device included in the computer system executing the account manager utility. However, the persistent storage 440 does not need to be part of the account manager 400 , instead the persistent storage 440 can be implemented as a storage device communicatively coupled with the account manager 400 as part of a network attached storage (NAS), of a storage area network (SAN) or of cloud storage.
- NAS network attached storage
- SAN storage area network
- the I/O interface 450 is implemented as a user interface through which users of the account manager 400 can provide account information for opening new accounts with the web mapping service, for example.
- the users of the user interface are associated with the proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB”, for example the users can be owners of the business associated with the proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB”.
- the users can enter the account information into a form of the I/O interface 450 to generate the documents 405 , 407 associated with the proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB”, respectively.
- the users can upload the documents 405 , 406 to the I/O interface 450 .
- the I/O interface 450 can present respective prompts 452 ′, 452 ′′ for the users to verify the provided account information, before relaying the documents 405 , 407 to the account scorer 455 .
- the users associated with the proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB” can interact with different instances of the I/O interface 450 .
- the users can interact with sequential instances of the I/O interface 450 .
- the user associated with the proposed account “AAA” can provide document 405 at a first time instance
- the user associated with the proposed account “BBB” can provide document 407 at a second time instance, later than the first time instance.
- the prompt 452 ′ presented to the user associated with the proposed account “AAA” corresponds to the first time instance
- the prompt 452 ′′ presented to the user associated with the proposed account “BBB” corresponds to the second time instance, later than the first time instance.
- the users can interact with simultaneous instances of the I/O interface 450 .
- the user associated with the proposed account “AAA” provides document 405 through a first online instance of the I/O interface 450 at a same time when the user associated with the proposed account “BBB” provides document 407 through a second online instance of the I/O interface 450 .
- the prompt 452 ′ presented to the user associated with the proposed account “AAA” corresponds to the first online instance of the I/O interface 450
- the prompt 452 ′′ presented to the user associated with the proposed account “BBB” corresponds to the second online instance of the I/O interface 450 .
- the account scorer 455 receives documents 405 , 407 from the I/O interface 450 and can retrieve information from the list of spam terms 435 stored in persistent storage 440 .
- the account scorer 455 generates account scores corresponding to the received documents 405 , 407 and classifies the proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB” based on the scores associated with the generated account scores.
- the classifications of the proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB” and the respective generated scores are recorded by the account scorer 455 in an account classification table 445 stored in the persistent storage 440 , for instance. Based on results of the classifications, the account scorer 455 can instruct the I/O interface 450 to selectively present notifications 458 ′, 458 ′′ to inform the user(s) associated with the respective proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB” whether the account registration was denied or allowed.
- Generating a score for the document 405 and classifying the proposed account “AAA” can be performed by an instance of the account scorer 455 ′ which is different from an instance of the account scorer 455 ′′ which performs generating a score for the document 407 and classifying the proposed account B.
- the different instances of the account scorer 455 ′, 455 ′′ can be performed sequentially by a same data processing apparatus, e.g., by a core of a central processing unit.
- the different instances of the account scorer 455 ′, 455 ′′ can be performed simultaneously by different data processing apparatuses, e.g., by different cores of the central processing unit.
- the account scorer 455 can generate scores for proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB” by scoring terms included in the respective documents 405 , 407 associated with the proposed accounts “AAA”, and “BBB” at least in part based on spam likelihoods of corresponding terms stored in the list of spam terms 435 .
- a score for a new account can be generated by adding respective scores for all terms in the document associated with the new account.
- the score for the new account can be generated by adding the respective scores for distinct terms in the document associated with the new account.
- the account scorer 455 can apply a score to the given term that is the corresponding spam likelihood of the given term as recorded in the list of spam terms 135 . Else, if the given term from the documents 405 , 407 is not a term, then the given term is deemed by the account scorer 455 unlikely to be spam and a score of “0” is applied to the given term.
- the spam likelihood of a term from the list of spam terms can be stored as a real-number corresponding to the BTF-IDF score of the term.
- the score applied by the account scorer 455 to a term identified in the documents 405 , 407 is the corresponding BTF-IDF score of the term recorded in the list of spam terms 135 .
- the spam likelihood of a term from the list of spam terms 135 can be stored as a bit “1” when the term has a BTF-IDF score larger than a predetermined BTF-IDF score.
- the score applied by the account scorer 455 to each of the terms identified in the documents 405 , 407 is “1”.
- the account scorer 455 generates an account score as the sum of scores of all the terms included in a document associated with an account. In this first example, the account scorer 455 applies scores to the terms included in the document associated with the account based on the BTF-IDF score of terms in the list of spam terms 135 . Moreover, the instance of the account scorer 455 ′ generates a score for the proposed account “AAA,” and the instance of the account scorer 455 ′′ generates a score for the proposed account “BBB.”
- the terms from the document 405 are “plumbers”, “inc”, “main”, “not”, “a” and “storefront”.
- the instance of the account scorer 455 ′ applies a score of “0” to the term “423” included in document 405 , because this term is not blacklisted.
- the score X generated by the instance of the account scorer 455 ′ for the proposed account “AAA” is generated as the sum of scores of all the terms in the document 405 associated with the proposed account “AAA.”
- the instance of the account scorer 455 ′ can classify the proposed account “AAA” by comparing the score X generated for the proposed account “AAA,” based on Equation (3), with a threshold score.
- a proposed account having an account score greater than a threshold score of 0.800 is classified as a spam account.
- the terms from the document 407 i.e., the terms that are also present in the merged document 405 , are two instances of the term “service”.
- a score of “0” is applied by the instance of the account scorer 455 ′′ to each of the other terms included in the document 407 because these other terms, “Soren's”, “plumbing”, “800”, “Maple”, “prompt”, “or”, “the”, “is” and “free”, are not included in the merged document.
- the account scorer 455 generates an account score as the sum of scores of distinct terms included in a document associated with an account. Further in this second example implementation, the account scorer 455 applies scores to the terms included in a document associated with an account based on the same rules for term scoring as in the first example implementation.
- the score Y generated by the instance of the account scorer 455 ′′ for the proposed account “BBB” is generated as the sum of scores of the distinct terms in the document 407 associated with the proposed account BBB.
- the threshold score for classifying an account as spam account or non-spam account also is 0.800 as in the first example implementation.
- the proposed account “AAA” is classified as a spam account because the score X, generated based on Equation (3), is larger than 0.800
- the account scorer 455 generates an account score based on the same rules of account scoring as in the first example implementation. Further in this third example, the score applied by the account scorer 455 to each of terms included in the document associated with the account is “1”. Thus, the instance of the account scorer 455 ′ applies a score of “1” to each of the terms from the document 405 , “plumbers”, “inc”, “main”, “not”, “a” and “storefront,” i.e., to the terms in the document 405 that are also present in the merged document 115 ; in addition, the instance of the account scorer 455 ′ applies a score of “0” to the term “423,” which is included in document 405 but is not blacklisted.
- the score X generated by the instance of the account scorer 455 ′ for the proposed account “AAA” is generated as the sum of scores of all the terms in the document 405 associated with the proposed account “AAA”.
- the instance of the account scorer 455 ′ can classify the proposed account “AAA” by comparing the score X generated for the proposed account AAA, based on Equation (6), with a threshold score.
- a proposed account having an account score greater than a threshold score of “5” is classified as a spam account.
- the score applied by the instance of the account scorer 455 ′′ to the term “service” from the document 407 is “1”.
- a score of “0” is applied by the instance of the account scorer 455 ′′ to each of the other terms included in the document 407 , “Soren's”, “plumbing”, “800”, “Maple”, “prompt”, “or”, “the”, “is” and “free”, because these other terms are not blacklisted.
- the score Y generated by the instance of the account scorer 455 ′′ for the proposed account “BBB” is generated as the sum of scores of all the terms in the document 407 associated with the proposed account “BBB”.
- the account scorer 455 generates an account score based on the same rules of account scoring as in the second example implementation. Further, the account scorer 455 applies scores to the terms included in a document associated with an account based on the same rules for term scoring as in the third example implementation.
- the score Y generated by the instance of the account scorer 455 ′′ for the proposed account “BBB” is generated as the sum of scores of the distinct terms in the document 407 associated with the proposed account “BBB”.
- the threshold score for classifying an account as spam account or non-spam account also is “5” as in the third example implementation.
- the proposed account “AAA” is classified as a spam account because the score X, generated based on Equation (6), is larger than 5
