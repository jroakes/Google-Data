Definitions
- the present invention is related to the following invention which is assigned to the same assignee as the present invention:
- This invention relates generally to speech-recognition systems and, in particular, to a method and system for identifying continuous speech.
- Applications for an automated speech-recognition device include a database query technique using voice commands, voice input for quality control in a manufacturing process, a voice-dial cellular phone which would allow a driver to focus on the road while dialing, and a voice-operated prosthetic device for the physically disabled.
- Dynamic time-warping is a technique which uses an optimization principle to minimize the errors between an unknown spoken word and a stored template of a known word. Reported data shows that the DTW technique is very robust and produces good recognition. However, the DTW technique is computationally intensive. Therefore, it is currently impractical to implement the DTW technique for real-world applications.
- the hidden-Markov modeling technique uses stochastic models for known words and compares the probability that the unknown word was generated by each model.
- the HMM technique will check the sequence (or state) of the word, and find the model that provides the best match.
- the HMM technique has been successfully used in many commercial applications; however, the technique has many drawbacks. These drawbacks include an inability to differentiate acoustically similar words, a susceptibility to noise, and computational intensiveness.
- a time-delay neural network is a type of neural network which addresses the temporal effects of speech by adopting limited neuron connections.
- TDNN shows slightly better result than the HMM method.
- HMM high-delay neural network
- the training time for a TDNN is very lengthy, on the order of several weeks.
- the training algorithm for a TDNN often converges to a local minimum, which is not the globally optimum solution.
- the method recognizes boundaries between spoken sounds, thereby vastly increasing the likelihood of correctly identifying spoken sounds.
- Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a method and system for training a learning machine to identify spoken sounds from continuous speech wherein the method and system do not require a repetitive or lengthy training period.
- a further advantage of the present invention is to provide a system which allows boundaries between spoken sounds in continuous speech to be identified in the same manner that spoken sounds are identified, thus reducing the overall complexity of the system.
- the system includes a method for recognizing a boundary between two spoken sounds in the continuously spoken speech.
- the method has the following steps. First, the continuously spoken speech is received. Next, a delimitative sound, which includes the boundary, is defined as being one of the spoken sounds. Finally, the boundary is recognized by identifying the delimitative sound in the continuously spoken speech.
- a speech-recognition system which includes a recognition means.
- the recognition means receives a plurality of features extracted from continuously spoken speech, and in turn, identifies a delimitative sound in the continuously spoken speech by applying a classifier to the plurality of features.
- FIG. 1 shows a contextual diagram of a speech-recognition system used in one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 shows a flow diagram of a method of identifying a delimitative sound from continuously spoken speech in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.

- FIG. 5 illustrates a classifier which receives a sequence of extracted features.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a classifier which is in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 7 shows a flow diagram of a method of training a speech-recognition system to identify spoken sounds from continuously spoken speech in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention.

- FIG. 1 shows a contextual block diagram of a speech-recognition system used in one embodiment of the present invention.
- the diagram shows microphone 2 or equivalent means for receiving audio input in the form of speech input and converting sound into electrical energy.
- Speech-recognition system 6 receives signals from microphone 2 over transmission medium 4 and performs various tasks such as waveform sampling, analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion, feature extraction and classification.
- Speech-recognition system 6 provides the identity of spoken sounds to computer 10 via bus 8.
- the method and system of the present invention are implemented in speech recognition system 6.
- Computer 10 executes commands or programs which may utilize the data provided by speech-recognition system 6.
- speech-recognition system 6 may transmit spoken sound identities to devices other than a computer.
- a communication network, data storage system, or transcription device could be substituted for computer 10.
- the system depicted by FIG. 1 is used for recognizing spoken sound from continuously spoken speech.
- Continuously spoken speech or continuous speech, takes place when a person speaking into the microphone does not un-naturally pause between each spoken sound. Rather, the person speaking pauses only when the natural form of speech dictates a pause, such as at the end of a sentence. For this reason, continuous speech can be thought of as "natural" speech which occurs in an ordinary conversation.
- Continuously spoken speech includes at least one spoken sound, wherein a spoken sound may be a word, syllable, or phoneme.
- a phoneme is the smallest element of speech sound which indicates a difference in meaning.
- a syllable includes one or more phonemes, and a word includes one or more syllable.

- continuously spoken speech which comprises at least one spoken sound, is received.
- a delimitative sound is defined.
- a delimitative sound is the portion of continuously spoken speech which occurs between two spoken sounds. Essentially, a delimitative sound contains the boundary between two spoken sounds which are included in continuously spoken speech.
- the boundary between two spoken sounds in the continuously spoken speech is recognized by identifying the delimitative sound.
- the delimitation sound is identified using a means or method similar to that used for identifying a spoken sound.
- FIG. 3 shows a flow diagram of a method of using a learning machine to recognize a spoken sound in continuously spoken speech in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

- a spoken example is defined as a set of given inputs and a desired output(s).
- a spoken example may include as given inputs a set of features extracted from continuous speech, and the example may include as desired output a binary code which represents the corresponding spoken sound in ASCII.
- Training the learning machine transforms the learning machine into a device which is capable of classifying the data it receives; thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the trained learning machine is then capable of classifying a delimitative sound.
- the continuously spoken speech typically includes a plurality of unidentified spoken sounds which are separated by delimitative sounds.
- a frame extractor extracts a plurality of features from the continuously spoken speech.
- the extracted features may include cepstral coefficients, predictive coefficients, or Fourier coefficients.
- At least one spoken sound is identified by classifying the features.
- the delimitative sounds may also be identified in order to determine the boundaries of each spoken sound. Determining the boundaries of a spoken sound increases the probability of correctly identifying the spoken sound. Delimitative sounds are identified in the same manner as spoken sounds, that is, they are identified by classifying the features of the delimitation sounds.
