- a generalized Jaccard distance between documents is defined as follows. Given an edge-weighted bipartite graph G(D,T,E), for two documents d 1 and d 2 , the generalized Jaccard similarity between d 1 and d 2 is defined as:
- Selecting, from the set S, a set V of quantity p representative documents, for a cluster C i of the set C, that maximizes a diversity function comprises: initializing an arbitrary set of quantity p documents from the set S as the set V; and iteratively, until no further swap of a document from the set V results in an increase in a sum of pairwise distances of documents in the set V: determining whether swapping a document d from the set V with a document d′ that is paired with the document d increases a sum of pairwise distances of documents in the set V, and swapping the document d from the set V with a document d′ that is paired with the document d when determining that swapping increases the sum of pairwise distances of documents in the set V.

- a property of the local search algorithm shown in Table 2 is its flexibility to optimize other objective functions, for example the quality and coverage of the documents.
- the sequence of local operations in the order of quality of the documents is employed, for example, the set of representatives is initialized to the set of documents with the highest quality score, and swapping other documents with these documents is considered in the order of their quality score.
- This quality score can take into account the reliability and coverage of each document, or the popularity of an owner of the micro-post, for example.
- a computational time complexity is considered, and specifically, the complexity of the local search algorithm.
- This algorithm converges as the value of the metric increases at each operation.
- a small change in the algorithm can give a polynomial running time, while preserving the approximation factor of the algorithm.
- the modified algorithm performs the local swap improvements only if such a swap increases the total diversity by a
- the modified algorithm swaps document d inside the set S with a document d′ outside the set, only if
- the local search algorithm does not need the clusters C 1 , . . . , C k to be disjoint, and these clusters can be arbitrary overlapping subsets of nodes.
- the diversity maximization algorithm is to choose a set of pk nodes in the graph to maximize diversity, independent of their coverage.
- the practical running time of the algorithms can be improved by slight modifications. Specifically, the order of trying local improvements can change the running time of the algorithm and the quality of the output. Moreover, other than the diversity metric, other objective functions like relevance, weighted-coverage, and popularity of the micro-posts in the set of representatives can be considered.

Abstract
Description
approximation to maximize this function. This algorithm generates k documents by iteratively picking a new document that covers more new weight. A clustering of items is then generated by choosing important items around the k documents. Each document is put in a cluster corresponding to the closest item in S by defining a distance measure among the documents provided by the Jaccard similarity of documents based on a set of terms associated with those documents.

More generally, gt can be any concave function of the total weight of the documents in S covering the term t, i.e.,
where h: R→R is a concave function. For concave functions h, function gt becomes sub-modular, and the coverage function g is also sub-modular. As a result, for any general concave function h, the problem of maximizing the general weighted-coverage function g is a sub-modular maximization problem subject to cardinality constraints, and thus a similar greedy algorithm is suitable to solve it within an approximation ratio of
