Definitions
- the invention relates to digital mapping systems, and more particularly, to computer generated driving directions that are visually-oriented.
- Computerized mapping systems have been developed to search for, identify, and discover information about geographic locations.
- One form of such computerized mapping systems includes travel-planning Internet websites. With an excess of 50 million unique monthly users, such map sites are a very popular offering. Examples of such sites include AOL's MapQuest, Yahoo's Telcontar-based maps, and Microsoft's MapPoint.net suite. Such sites all work along the lines of a common model, as will now be described.
- a Web user asks for a new map view (e.g., by entering a postal address, or by clicking a navigation link next to a current map view)
- the user's Web browser sends to a Web server a request indicating the boundaries of the new map view.
- the Web server extracts the corresponding vector-based map data from a database, and draws a bitmap image of the map.
- the server then converts the bitmap to an image format supported by the user's Web browser and returns the image, sometimes embedded in HTML, to the user's Web browser so that it can be displayed.
- Other map Web sites such as Britain's MultiMaps or Australia's WhereIs utilize a raster-based map database instead. In these cases, it is not necessary to extract vectors and draw a map image. Rather, these functions are replaced by simply extracting the appropriate part of a larger, pre-rendered image.
- One embodiment of the present invention provides a computer implemented method for generating visually-oriented driving directions.
- the method includes constructing a mapping between business listings and at least one of satellite images and storefront images of a target map area.
- the method continues with analyzing the at least one of satellite images and storefront images to identify waypoints, and evaluating distinctiveness of the identified waypoints, thereby providing a number of scored waypoints.
- the method further includes incorporating one or more of the scored waypoints into requested driving directions.
- the method may include applying OCR to storefront images to identify waypoints (e.g., to identify text and signage).
- the method may include performing visual recognition of chain stores using the at least one of satellite images and storefront images to identify waypoints (e.g., to recognize patterns of branding and architecture).
- the method may include performing non-visual recognition of chain stores using at least one of heuristics and business listings to identify waypoints (e.g., to recognize well-known and visually predictable businesses).
- the method may include storing the scored waypoints.
- the constructing, analyzing, evaluating, and storing are performed in advance of receiving requests for driving directions.
- Evaluating distinctiveness of the identified waypoints may include, for example, assigning a distinctiveness score based on at least one of a difference between a waypoint and its surroundings, scope of the difference, salience of the waypoint, visibility of the waypoint, and familiarity of pattern associated with the waypoint.
- the method may include adjusting a distinctiveness score of one or more of the scored waypoints based on user feedback.
- Incorporating one or more of the scored waypoints into requested driving directions may further include serving those driving directions to the requestor.
- the method may include providing a visual preview of the driving directions using at least one of satellite images, storefront images, heuristics, and business listings.
- Incorporating one or more of the scored waypoints into requested driving directions may include selecting waypoints related to a destination of the requestor.
- One or more of the scored waypoints can be associated with a business advertising arrangement. In one such configuration, a cost-per-use of the one or more scored waypoints associated with a business advertisement is a factor that impacts waypoint distinctiveness scoring.
- Another embodiment of the present invention provides a computer implemented method for generating visually-oriented driving directions.
- the method includes constructing a mapping between business listings and at least one of satellite images and storefront images of a target map area, analyzing the at least one of satellite images and storefront images to identify waypoints, and evaluating distinctiveness of the identified waypoints, thereby providing a number of scored waypoints.
- the method further includes storing the scored waypoints for subsequent use in computer-generated driving directions.
- the method may include at least one of applying OCR to storefront images to identify waypoints, performing visual recognition of chain stores using the at least one of satellite images and storefront images to identify waypoints, and performing non-visual recognition of chain stores using at least one of heuristics and business listings to identify waypoints.
- Evaluating distinctiveness of the identified waypoints may include, for example, assigning a distinctiveness score based on at least one of a difference between a waypoint and its surroundings, scope of the difference, salience of the waypoint, visibility of the waypoint, and familiarity of pattern associated with the waypoint.
- the method may include adjusting a distinctiveness score of one or more of the scored waypoints based on user feedback.
- the method may include incorporating one or more of the scored waypoints into requested driving directions, providing a preview of the requested driving directions using the at least one of satellite images and storefront images, and serving the driving directions to the requestor.
- the method may include selecting one or more waypoints related to a destination of a user requesting driving directions, and incorporating the selected scored waypoints into the requested driving directions.
- One or more of the scored waypoints can be associated with a business advertising arrangement. In one such case, a cost-per-use of the one or more of the waypoints associated with a business advertisement is a factor that impacts way
- Another embodiment of the present invention provides a computer implemented method for generating visually-oriented driving directions.
- the method includes identifying distinctive waypoints associated with an area covered by a digital mapping system, wherein the waypoints are visual data points along one or more driving routes and are in addition to road names (e.g., Main Street, Route 101a, and Highway 1) and road topology (e.g., bridges, traffic circles, on-ramp/off-ramp, paved/unpaved, tolls).
- the method further includes incorporating one or more of the distinctive waypoints into computer-generated driving directions produced by the digital mapping system in response to a user request, thereby providing visually-oriented driving directions.
- Each of these methods can be implemented, for example, using a tile-based mapping system.
- other systems such as non-tile vector-based and raster-based mapping systems can be used to implement the methods as well, as will be apparent in light of this disclosure.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a digital mapping system configured to provide visually-oriented driving directions, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the location data serving system shown in FIG. 1 , configured for generating visually-oriented driving directions in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the waypoint identification and scoring module shown in FIG. 2 , configured for generating scored waypoints for use in visually-oriented driving directions, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a method for generating visually-oriented driving directions, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- Digital mapping techniques are disclosed that provide visually-oriented information to the user, such as driving directions, thereby improving the user experience.
- mapping system configured in accordance with an embodiment of the presenting invention can give more visually-oriented (and hence human-friendly) directions.
- satellite-based imagery such as that provided by Google Earth or Digital Globe
- way points e.g., a particularly large building, an isolated building, a baseball or other large stadium, a park in an otherwise urban area.
- structures such as traffic lights and stop signs can be identified, which are also useful in giving directions.
- storefront (street-level) images can be used to identify salient buildings and features, such as stores with large visible logos, stores of unusual colors (e.g., “the bright purple store”), stores that are easily recognized because their brands are well-known and/or their store architectures and tradedress are distinctive (e.g., “the McDonalds”). This last category involving well-known brands, trademarks, tradedress, etc. can be identifiable even without image information (e.g., most everyone knows what a McDonalds looks like).
- Such visual data can be used to identify the target address, such as “Fred's Shoe Repair is in the middle of the block, just past the bright purple store”.
- the user can preview the driving route by a simulated drive-through or “fly-through” using the satellite/street-level images, in conjunction with the relevant digital maps.
- the visual cues in the directions will remind the user of what to look for, and give that user a greater sense of confidence that he or she is on the right track.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a tile-based digital mapping system configured in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the system includes a computing device 103 connected to a network 105 .
- Various serving systems are also connected to the network 105 , including a web serving system 110 , a tile serving system 115 , and a location data serving system 120 .
- Other computing devices 103 may also be in communication with the serving systems 110 , 115 , and 120 via the network 105 .
- the computing device 103 may be any type of device configured for computing, such as a personal computer or laptop, a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, a navigation system located in a vehicle, a handheld GPS system, and so on.
- the computing device 103 includes a browser (or other similar application) that allows the user to interface and communicate with other devices and systems on the network 105 . Examples of browsers include Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, Netscape's Navigator browser, Mozilla's Firefox browser, PalmSource's Web Browser, or any other browsing or application software capable of communicating with network 105 .
- the computing device 103 can be any device that allows a user to access the serving systems 110 , 115 , and 120 via the network 105 .
- the web serving system 110 is the part of an overall system that delivers the initial HTML (hypertext markup language), images, scripting language (e.g., JavaScript, JScript, Visual Basic Script), XSLT (extensible stylesheet language transformation), and other static elements that are used by the browser on computing device 103 .
- this serving system 110 may include one or more servers operating under a load balancing scheme, with each server (or a combination of servers) configured to respond to and interact with the computing device 103 .
- the web serving system 110 can be implemented with conventional technology, as will be apparent in light of this disclosure.
- the tile serving system 115 is the part of the overall system responsible for delivering individual map tiles in response to requests from the computing device 103 , with each tile being uniquely defined, for example, by x, y and z values that coordinate to an overall tile-based map. Other tile identification schemes can be used as well.
- the tile serving system 115 may include one or more servers operating under a load balancing scheme, with each server (or a combination of servers) configured to respond to and interact with the computing device 103 . Example architecture and functionality of the tile serving system 115 is further discussed in the previously incorporated U.S. application Ser. No. 11/088,542.
- the location data serving system 120 is the part of the overall system that delivers location data of various forms to the computing device 103 . Its functions include, for example, finding the geographic location of a street address, generating and formatting visually-oriented driving directions, and searching for location-specific results to a query (e.g., as with the Google Local Search service). Other services may also be provided. In general, when the user enters a search string, it is put into a request by the computing device 103 , and sent to the location data serving system 120 via the network 105 .
- the location data serving system 120 determines what the request is for (e.g., generate driving directions with visual “fly-through” of route, or generate visually-oriented driving directions, or generate both visually-oriented driving directions and visual “fly-through” of route), and responds with the appropriate data from various sub-systems, such as geo-coders, routing engines, and local search indexes or databases (e.g., including a scored waypoint database), in a format that computing device 103 can use to present the data to the user (e.g., via a browser).
- Example architecture and functionality of the location data serving system 120 will be discussed in turn with reference to FIGS. 2-4 .
- the network 105 may be any type of communications network, such as a local area network (e.g., intranet), wide area network (e.g., internet), or some combination thereof.
- the network 105 may be a direct connection between the computing device 103 and the serving systems 110 , 115 , and 120 .
- the computing device 103 , network 105 , and/or serving systems 110 , 115 , and 120 may be in communication via any type of wired or wireless connection, using a wide variety of communication protocols.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the location data serving system 120 shown in FIG. 1 , configured for generating visually-oriented driving directions in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the system 120 includes a waypoint identification and scoring module 205 , a scored waypoint database 210 , and a driving direction generator 215 .
- the location data serving system 120 can be part of the overall digital mapping system that delivers mapping data of various forms (e.g., location data, map images, etc) to the computing device 103 .
- the location data is in the form of visually-oriented driving directions. Note that these driving directions can be provided in conjunction with a map that includes an overlay of the driving directions in graphical form as well.
- the digital mapping system is configured to provide tile-based maps, as explained in detail in the previously incorporated U.S. application Ser. Nos. 11/088,542 and 11/051,534.
- the present invention is not intended to be limited to systems that provided tile-based maps.
- embodiments of the present invention can also be used with other systems, such as non-tile vector-based and raster-based mapping systems.
- other embodiments of the present invention can be used to provide visually-oriented driving directions (with no map). Numerous mapping system configurations can be used. The description herein focuses on the visually-oriented driving directions component of the system. Other components and map system functionality not shown or otherwise discussed, whether conventional or custom, can be used as desired in conjunction with visually-oriented driving directions, as will be apparent in light of this disclosure.
- the location data serving system 120 operates in both an off-line capacity, as well as in an on-line capacity.
- “scored waypoints” are generated by the waypoint identification and scoring module 205 in an off-line process, and stored in the scored waypoint database 210 .
- This off-line process effectively stocks the database 210 with waypoints and their corresponding distinctiveness scores.
- requests e.g., HTTP
- the request can be initiated, for example, by a user engaging a web browser of a computing device 103 to access the system.
- the driving direction generator 215 accesses the scored waypoint database 210 and integrates the relevant scored waypoints into the driving directions generated in response to the request. These visually-oriented driving directions are then served to the requestor via the network 105 and web browser of the computing device 103 .
- a waypoint is a visual data point along the way of a driving route, such as a building, business, park, billboard, or some other visually noticeable structure or place.
- the distinctiveness of the waypoint is indicative of its visual prominence. Color (e.g., purple), shape (e.g., round building), size (e.g., 7 mile long park), degree of landmark recognition (e.g., Golden Gate Bridge), and/or degree of brand recognition (e.g., Golden Arches) are example factors that can be used to evaluate the distinctiveness of a waypoint.
- the digital mapping system in which the location data serving system 120 operates may also generate and serve graphical map data relevant to the client request.
- the client receives the requested graphical map data, and requests any map tiles it doesn't already have displayed or cached (e.g., as explained in the previously incorporated U.S. application Ser. No. 11/051,534.
- the client draws and displays the map, along with the visually-oriented driving directions.
- the client side can also be used to draw (e.g., overlay) the graphical driving directions, location markers, etc on the map image. Note here that the distinctive waypoints can also be overlaid on the map, along with the route itself.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the waypoint identification and scoring module 205 shown in FIG. 2 , configured for generating scored waypoints for use in visually-oriented driving directions, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the module 205 generates scored waypoints, which can then be stored in scored waypoint database 210 . These scored waypoints can then be accessed by a driving direction generator to create visually-oriented driving directions.
- the module 205 includes a storefront image database 305 , a satellite image database 310 , a yellow pages database 315 , an image registration module 320 , a satellite image processor 325 , a storefront image process 330 , an optical character recognition (OCR) module 335 , a non-visual recognition module 340 , a visual recognition module 345 , and a waypoint distinctiveness evaluation module 350 .
- OCR optical character recognition
- the waypoint identification and scoring module 205 employs one or more a databases of images (e.g., storefront image database 305 and satellite image database 310 ), together with a corresponding database of business listings (e.g., yellow pages database 315 ).
- Each database can be structured to facilitate efficient access of data, and include various types of information.
- each street-level image e.g., digital photograph taken using a GPS-enable camera
- each satellite image stored in the satellite image database 310 can be indexed by geocode, and associated with corresponding GPS coordinates.
- the yellow pages database 315 can be structured, for example, as conventionally done.
- the illustrated databases are integrated into a single database.
- other databases or information sets could be included, such as a conventional white pages database or other such listing service databases.
- the image databases may include multiple views and/or zoom levels of each targeted area. For instance, one storefront image can be taken from an angle as it would be seen coming down one direction of the street, while another storefront image of the same address could be taken from an angle as it would be seen coming down the other direction of the street. Thus, depending on the driving directions, either image could be used.
- the image registration module 320 is programmed or otherwise configured to construct a mapping between images and business listings. In one embodiment, this mapping is accomplished by a combination of image segmentation using standard image-processing techniques (e.g., edge detection, etc.) and interpolation of a business's street address within the range of street addresses known to be contained in the image. Image registration is done for both storefront images and satellite images.
- the mapping can be implemented, for example, with a pointer or address scheme that effectively connects images from an image database to listings in the yellow pages database.
- a single database can be built as the image registration process is carried out, where the records of the single database are indexed by geocode, and each record includes image data and related yellow page listing information.
- image processing is performed by accessing the images by way of the image registration module 320 (e.g., which can access the images stored in the respective databases 305 and 310 using a pointer or addressing scheme).
- image processing is performed to propose candidate waypoints based on detected visual features.
- the satellite image processor 325 is programmed or otherwise configured to recognize navigational features included in the satellite images. Certain navigational features are particularly useful for drivers, because a driver has to attend to such features anyway, including the likes of traffic lights, stop signs, on/off-ramps, traffic circles, city blocks, tunnels, bridges, end of divided highway, and other driver-centric features. These navigational features facilitate human directions such as: “turn right at the third light”, “get off at the second off-ramp”, and “go through 2 traffic circles and then it's on your right.”
- the satellite image processor 325 uses standard machine-learning techniques to learn to recognize these navigational features from the satellite images.
- humans annotate a set of satellite images with instances of the desired feature (e.g., all traffic circles), and to then use standard machine-learning algorithms (e.g., SVMs, boosting over decision stumps, decision lists, etc.) to learn image features that correctly predict the occurrence of that feature.
- standard machine-learning algorithms e.g., SVMs, boosting over decision stumps, decision lists, etc.
- the machine-learning algorithms can be used to recognize the learned or known navigational features in all the satellite images. These identified features can then be evaluated for use as waypoints.
- the storefront image processor 330 is programmed or otherwise configured to analyze storefront images. In one embodiment, this analysis is earned out at both a coarse level (e.g., width, height, color histograms) and a more refined level (e.g., segmentation into facade, doors, windows, roof; architectural elements such as pillars and balconies; decorative elements such as awnings, signage, neon lights, painted designs). Such analysis can be carried out, for example, using standard image-processing techniques (e.g., computer vision). Standard feature extraction algorithms typically extract high level information from images, such as shapes, colors, etc. Pattern recognition algorithms can then be applied to classify the extracted information so as to “recognize” objects in the storefront images.
- a coarse level e.g., width, height, color histograms
- a more refined level e.g., segmentation into facade, doors, windows, roof; architectural elements such as pillars and balconies; decorative elements such as awnings, signage, neon lights, painted designs.
- GPS and 3-D accelerometer readings could also be collected for each photographic image taken.
- Certain navigational features are associated with a particular set of associated readings. For example: on-ramps would have strong acceleration, and off-ramps would have strong deceleration; and traffic lights would have deceleration to zero, followed at regular intervals by acceleration.
- the GPS could be used to record where these acceleration/deceleration patterns occurred.
- waypoints can be proposed based on observed locally distinctive or otherwise salient features, including any measurable dimension or highly noticeable quality (e.g., unusually wide/narrow/tall/short building, building with purple door, orange roof, green neon sign, etc). If a feature is “locally distinctive”, it is unique within some vicinity, such as the only pink building on the block. The features discussed so far are intrinsic to the building, but extrinsic features can also be used (e.g., the building at the corner, the first building over the railroad tracks, etc).
- the OCR module 335 can be applied to the storefront images to read the storefront signage (if any), using standard OCR algorithms and techniques. This text recognition enables waypoint proposal of visual features such as “the bar with the neon Karaoke sign in the window.”
- the OCR accuracy of module 335 can be improved by identifying what kind of a store is in the storefront image, based on its corresponding category listing (e.g., bars and restaurants) in the yellow pages database 315 . Recall that the image registration module 320 has already mapped the images to corresponding listings within the yellow pages database 315 , thereby facilitating this context identification for the OCR process.
- text related to that yellow pages category can be obtained, for example, by visiting web sites of stores in that category, and adjusting the language model used for OCR module 335 , accordingly.
- This supplemental information from yellow page listings and/or websites enables the OCR module 335 to be informed of the context in which it is operating.
- the visual learning module 345 receives the proposed waypoint information output by each of the image processors 325 and 330 , and the OCR module 335 .
- the visual learning module 345 is programmed or otherwise configured to perform visual learning based on established knowledge. For instance, in one particular embodiment, the visual learning module 345 recognizes chain stores. Chain stores (e.g., McDonalds) are a common element in human directions.
- the visual learning module 345 can learn which chain stores have distinctive logos/buildings by, for example, identifying common elements across storefront images of multiple branches using the results of the storefront image processor 325 and OCR module 335 , combined with yellow page listings and standard translation/rotation/scaling transformations to align multiple images, and even simpler image-processing techniques such as orientation histograms.
- the visual learning module 345 would discover that McDonalds frequently have the same logo (e.g., the word “McDonalds” in a particular color and font), a glass storefront, Golden Arches, etc. In this sense, the visual learning module 345 learns a prototype of what the target chain store typically looks like. In addition, the visual learning module 345 identifies the extent to which each branch of the chain store at a given address matches the prototype. If a McDonalds branch at a given address sufficiently matches the common McDonalds' features found in the prototype, that McDonalds branch is a useful waypoint to use in driving directions, because it will be easily recognized by humans as a McDonalds.
- the visual learning module 345 would discover that McDonalds frequently have the same logo (e.g., the word “McDonalds” in a particular color and font), a glass storefront, Golden Arches, etc. In this sense, the visual learning module 345 learns a prototype of what the target chain store typically looks like. In addition, the visual learning module 345 identifie
- a given chain-store branch may be actually be a “bad” waypoint if, for instance, it doesn't match the prototype well. For example, a McDonalds in an upscale neighborhood may be required to conform to the prevailing architecture (e.g., no large Golden Arches allowed), thus reducing its recognizability as a McDonalds.
- a given chain-store branch may actually be a “bad” waypoint if, for instance, that particular branch is not clearly visible from the road (e.g., obscured by foliage or other buildings).
- the visual learning module 345 will avoid using such branches of the chain store as waypoints, thereby further refining results from the image processors 325 and 330 , and the OCR module 335 .
- McDonalds is well-known and fairly consistent in its appearance (even when restricted by local ordinance), and may not need to be processed by the visual recognition module (e.g., McDonalds image and address data could simply pass through the visual learning module 345 as a proposed waypoint for a given area).
- the non-visual recognition module 340 can be used to identify McDonalds and other well-known architectures, as will be apparent in light of this disclosure.
- a more regional restaurant chain that is less well-known, but fairly consistent in its appearance, could be identified as a waypoint of comparable efficacy to McDonalds by the visual learning module 345 .
- the non-visual recognition module 340 can be used to recognize chain stores (and other such consistent structures and the like) without reference to any images. Rather, only address information (e.g., from the yellow pages database 315 in this embodiment) is needed. For instance, instead of learning from images of multiple branches of a chain store, heuristics about store recognizability can be used.
- gas stations are often good, recognizable waypoints because they tend to display their logo prominently, and they have distinctive architecture (e.g., canopy over gas pumps and ample signage).
- stores with a multitude of branches (e.g., over 1000) in the yellow pages tend to have distinctive branding and widespread marketing, and are typically well-recognized.
- chain grocery stores often have large logos, large buildings, and large parking lots. In addition, they are typically well-known in the communities in which they exist.
- the non-visual recognition module 340 uses address listings to identify chain stores and other predictable/consistent architectures that are known to be distinctive, and proposes them as waypoints.
- the waypoint distinctiveness evaluation module 350 evaluates the distinctiveness of the proposed waypoints received from the non-visual recognition module 340 and the visual recognition module 345 .
- the distinctiveness measure can range, for example, from 1 to 10, and can take into account a number of aspects, where a distinctiveness score of 1 is indicative of a low distinctiveness rating, and a distinctiveness score of 10 is indicative of a high distinctiveness rating.
- one or more of the following factors are considered in assigning a distinctiveness score: the magnitude of difference of the waypoint and its surroundings such as neighbors and open space (e.g., bright red is far away from white in color-space); the scope of the difference (e.g., the only bright red building on an entire block is more distinctive than a bright red building with another bright red building 2 doors down); the salience of a waypoint (e.g., a bright red door is less salient than a bright red entire facade); the visibility of the waypoint (e.g., a building separated from its neighbors by an empty lot may be easier to spot than a store in a row of connected buildings); the familiarity of the pattern associated with the waypoint (e.g., in the case of chain stores that have very familiar branding).
- the magnitude of difference of the waypoint and its surroundings such as neighbors and open space (e.g., bright red is far away from white in color-space); the scope of the difference (e.g., the only bright red building on an entire block is more distinctive than
- waypoints and their distinctiveness scores can be used in several ways when generating driving directions (e.g., using the driving directions generator 215 ). For instance, turns can be identified using waypoints at or near an intersection (e.g., “you'll see a McDonalds on your right and a Mobil station on your left” or “turn right just past the Home Depot on your right”). In one particular embodiment, the waypoints that are given are on the same side of the street as the turn (e.g., waypoints on the right-hand side for right turns), so drivers can focus on one side of the road at a time.
- waypoints at or near an intersection e.g., “you'll see a McDonalds on your right and a Mobil station on your left” or “turn right just past the Home Depot on your right”.
- the waypoints that are given are on the same side of the street as the turn (e.g., waypoints on the right-hand side for right turns), so drivers can focus on one side of the road at a time.
- Confirmatory waypoints can be provided, such as “You'll pass a Safeway on your left, then a large park on your right.” Also, “gone too far” waypoints can be given, such as “If you see a Tower Records on your right, you've gone too far.” Waypoints can also be used as early warning indicators, to signal the driver to start watching for a turn, especially if the driver has been on the same road for awhile (“you'll be on Center St. for 20 miles; after you pass the Crabtree Shopping Center on your left, start watching for your left turn”).
- Waypoints can also be used to identify the target destination (e.g., “your destination is the three-story white house on the left” or “you'll see the Fry's on your right; look for the big red logo”).
- the entire route can be chosen with the quality of waypoints in mind. For instance, the user can be directed along a somewhat longer route if the longer path affords better waypoints. In one particular embodiment, the user can be offered a choice of maximizing “ease of following directions” versus “shortest distance” (or other such alternatives).
- waypoint distinctiveness evaluation module 350 is configured to score the salience of streets (e.g., “large street with two lanes in each direction” or “a boulevard with grassy median”).
- the driving directions can be generated using conventional technology or as described in the previously incorporated U.S. application Ser. Nos. 11/088,542 and 11/051,534, with the addition of the incorporation of one or more of the scored waypoints.
- the waypoints are incorporated into a pre-selected set of driving directions, where conventional driving directions are generated, and then effectively annotated with waypoints.
- These waypoints can be added to the driving directions as text (as in the previously given examples) and/or as images (e.g., McDonalds icon).
- driving directions can also be generated for a plurality of routes, and taking the waypoint scores along each route into account when selecting the best route to give.
- a mechanism for collecting feedback from users as to the utility of different waypoints is provided.
- a GPS record of the user's actual route taken when attempting to follow the served driving directions e.g., from a handheld GPS receiver/recorder, or an on-board GPS navigation system, or a GPS-enabled cellphone.
- the reporting of GPS data can be transparent to the user, or enabled by the user.
- a user feedback module is downloaded into the user's browser, and is programmed to receive the GPS data and report it back to the serving system.
- An alternate feedback approach that can be used is to provide a form (e.g., online webform or email, and/or paper/fax submissions) for users to fill out and send back with positive/negative feedback about each step of the visually-oriented driving directions.
- the user feedback could be used, for example, by the waypoint distinctiveness evaluation module 350 to reduce the distinctiveness score of waypoint(s) that were used to indicate a turn that the user missed, or to increase the distinctiveness score of waypoint(s) that were used to indicate a turn that the user found.
- Feedback from multiple users could be categorized and tallied by waypoint, so that a meaningful sample of feedback data could be analyzed when upgrading/downgrading the distinctiveness score of a waypoint, thereby eliminating or otherwise reducing the impact of anomalies or individual biases regarding a particular waypoint. Numerous statistical techniques can be used to properly value the user feedback.
- businesses are allowed to bid or otherwise pay to be included as a waypoint.
- the “cost-per-use” of a waypoint could then be an additional factor that would be taken into account when scoring each waypoint.
- incorporating one or more of the scored waypoints into requested driving directions could include selecting waypoints related to a destination of the requestor. For instance, if the user is asking for driving directions to a national park, then waypoints such as camping equipment stores could be selected for integration into the served driving directions.
- This choice of waypoints has several benefits: (1) the waypoints might be of interest in their own right; (2) the waypoints are more likely to be familiar to the user and thus better waypoints; and (3) advertisers would be likely to pay more for such targeted waypoint usage.
- fly-throughs e.g., using satellite images
- walkthroughs e.g., using storefront images
- photos of the waypoints and intersections could be printed in advance by the user to aid the user in spotting them when driving the actual route.
- an “autoplay preview” feature is provided on the client side.
- a request for preview data would be sent to the server side.
- the client could initially be given the entire route, which can be represented, for example, as a sequence of latitude/longitude pairs of line segments approximating the path.
- the client can then use simple linear interpolation to follow the route.
- the client could display a map (e.g., satellite map or bitmap map) centered initially at the starting point of the route, with a progress marker (e.g., a car icon), and would continuously scroll the display along the desired route. Movement of the progress marker could be carried out using script code (e.g., JavaScript) executing on the client.
- the client could pre-fetch map tiles (or other map image) in conjunction with moving the progress marker to create an uninterrupted viewing experience.
- An analogous pre-fetching scheme could be used for displaying storefront images along the route, which may be more meaningful to the user, given the ease of perceiving street-level images.
- a perspective transformation can be used to show the storefronts on both sides of the street as the user drives (or walks) along the route.
- Other elements can be added to the preview as desired, such as traffic lights, street signs, and even simulated other cars, etc., to enhance realism.
- the user is able to control the playback (e.g., via start/stop/pause/reverse control objects included in the user interface).
- the user is allowed to divert from the original route, so as to explore alternate routes and the surrounding area (“virtual reconnaissance”). Note in this latter case, however, that pre-fetching becomes more difficult.
- predictive caching of the relevant map images/storefront images can be used based on the user's current direction and previous use habits. A number of predictive caching and image delivery schemes can be used, as will be apparent in light of this disclosure.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a method for generating visually-oriented driving directions, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the method can be carried out, for example, using the systems of FIGS. 1-3 .
- any mapping system can integrate the methodology.
- the method includes an off-line portion and an on-line portion.
- the off-line portion includes constructing 405 a mapping between business listings and satellite and storefront images of the target map area.
- the method continues with analyzing 410 the satellite images to identify waypoints, and analyzing 415 the storefront images to identify waypoints.
- the method further includes applying 420 OCR to storefront images to identify waypoints.
- image analysis can be used to detect decorative and structural features within the images, and OCR can be used to detect the storefront signage.
- the off-line portion of the method continues with performing 425 visual recognition of chain stores using images (e.g., storefront and satellite) to identify waypoints.
- images e.g., storefront and satellite
- the yellow pages can be used to identify the addresses of all locations a particular chain store, and then images of those locations can be analyzed to identify the common elements across the images.
- Chain stores with such consistent elements can be used as waypoints, as they are likely to be recognized.
- the off-line portion of the method also includes performing 430 non-visual recognition of chain stores using heuristics and/or business listings to identify waypoints. As previously explained, there are many rules of thumb that can be applied to identify waypoints, without using image data. In addition, both visual (e.g., machine learning) and non-visual (e.g., GPS/acceleration data collection) techniques can be used to identify navigational features, which can also be used as waypoints.
- visual e.g., machine learning
- non-visual e.g., GPS/acceleration data collection
- the method continues with evaluating 435 the distinctiveness of the proposed waypoints.
- the distinctiveness measure can range, for example, from 1 (low distinctiveness) to 10 (high distinctiveness), and takes into account a number of factors as previously explained. Numerous rating schemes are possible, and the end result is a number of scored waypoints.
- the off-line portion of the method further includes storing 440 the scored waypoints.
- the on-line portion of the method includes incorporating 445 one or more scored waypoints into requested driving directions.
- a driving direction generator on the server side accesses the stored waypoints, and generates visually-oriented written driving directions, which are sent back to the client.
- the server side could also send graphical map data.
- the client receives the graphical map data, and requests any map tiles (or other image data) it doesn't already have displayed or cached.
- the client draws and displays the map, along with the visually-oriented driving directions.
- the client side can also be used to draw (overlay) the graphical driving directions, location markers, waypoints, etc. on the displayed map image.
