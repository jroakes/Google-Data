Specific embodiment
Limiting mobile system using subscriber identity module (SIM) and call can allow not installing on a mobile computing device and not
It is that the application of a part for system constructing accesses API (API), and carry out may be otherwise forbidden
System is called.Mobile computing device can include operating system, and the operating system can include allowing to access operating system and behaviour
Make many limited API of the various sensitive functions of the associated component of system platform.Limited API can be to for example being set by mobile computing
It is addressable that standby manufacturer is installed as the application of a part for system constructing.In order to allow from such as cellular service
The third-party application of supplier accesses limited API, can be used from the privately owned close of disclosure/private cipher key pair by the third party
Key to this applying self-signing certificate.Using can be mounted on a mobile computing device, and can ask in installation process
Access the license of limited API.User can select to authorize the license.Third party can be by from the public affairs of disclosure/private cipher key pair
Open key and be transferred to receiving on the mobile computing device that the third party is authorized to and can modify with exclusive ability
Protection storage.For example, public key certificate can be transferred to Cellular Service Providers the user identity on mobile computing device
Safety certificate storage on module (SIM) card.When the application runs on a mobile computing device and carries out system for limited API
When calling, the operating system of the mobile computing device can be used in the public-key cryptography checking Application Certificate of protected storage
Private cipher key signature.If be proved to be successful, application can be licensed calls limited API.Then be limited API can perform by
Any function of being asked is called from the system of the application.
Such as the mobile computing device of smart phone or panel computer can run the part as mobile platform
Operating system.The operating system can include API and for allowing other application on mobile computing device to access by operating
The function of system control and the other systems component of data.Some system components can be constrained system component, such as be limited
API.Limited API in operating system can be the sensitive data and function of correlation.Allow to install on a mobile computing device
Any third-party application carries out system and calls possibly one security risk to limited API.For example, limited API can include working as
The function of the storage of mobile computing device can be wiped during activation.Another limited API can control to access various phones correlations
Function and data, such as SMS message is filtered, calling and is checked and changed for accessing cellular service emergency number
The network access of the network of supplier is arranged.May with the application that the appropriate license that system is called is carried out for limited API
The limited API can be denied access to.For example, install on a mobile computing device but be not belonging to system constructing a part the 3rd
Fang Yingyong can attempt the storage for calling limited API to wipe mobile computing device, and removing is stored on the mobile computing device
All data.Operating system can be called and security exception of dishing out in response to the system received from third-party application, resistance
Only third-party application wipes function using the storage of limited API.
Third party may wish to allow to access limited API and can be mounted after system constructing has been mounted with
Application on a mobile computing device can use.For example, smart phone can have by smart mobile phone manufacturer install its be
System builds, including the application for being able to access that limited API.After a while, smart phone can be activated, for Cellular Service Providers
It is used together.Cellular Service Providers may want to allow its user to install on smart phone and be able to access that some limited API
Application.Because Cellular Service Providers do not generate system constructing, and the system in future structure of possible not responsible smart phone
Build, Cellular Service Providers possibly cannot be applied the part for being installed as system constructing.Cellular Service Providers are likely to
It is not intended to wait system in future to build, be not belonging to the part that current system builds to being limited the access of API to allow has
Application installation.
Third party can create third party and want to access the application of the limited API on mobile computing device, and make
It is to apply self-signing certificate with the private cipher key from disclosure/private cipher key pair.Disclosure/private cipher key pair can be with any appropriate
Mode, generated using any appropriate encryption technology, system and algorithm.Private cipher key only may know by third party, and
May be maintained secrecy, to prevent any other side from obtaining key to sign application.When application is downloaded and installed mobile meter
During calculation equipment, the user that can ask mobile computing device authorizes the license that the application accesses limited API.The application is only in user
Just it is mounted in the case of authorizing asked license.For example, Cellular Service Providers can create and be operated using smart phone
The application of the limited phone API of system, to read and write the setting accessed by smart phone controlling network.User can with appoint
Application is downloaded and installed into their smart phone by what appropriate mode, such as by using ecosystem shop, logical
Cross by the shop of telephony service providers' offer or by downloading and answering beyond side loaded (sideload) online shop
With.The example of side loaded is included in transfer application and/or data between two local devices, such as moves in computer and such as
Between the mobile device of mobile phone, smart phone, PDA, panel computer, portable electronic device or E-book reader, or
Person is between two mobile devices.
In installation process, application may indicate that application needs to access limited phone to the operating system of smart phone
The license of API.Operating system can be presented a dialogue to user, it is allowed to which user authorizes this and applies access permission, and to receiving
Words of rationing the power supply API carries out system and calls.As application is asked, the license authorized by user can be only applied to for limited API
Selected system is called.For example, being permitted using the Sub-Set of System Calls from limited API can only be asked and be awarded to application
Can, and may not have the system tune in addition to subset requested and that license is awarded accessed from the limited API
License.
Being responsible for creating the third party of the application signed by private cipher key can be authorized to, and also can exclusively repair
Change the protected storage on mobile computing device.Protected storage can be any appropriate storage, such as on the sim card
Certificate storage.For example, the Cellular Service Providers of smart phone can be ability to store and change the SIM in smart phone
Unique side of the data in certificate storage on card.Third party can send the public-key cryptography from disclosure/private cipher key pair
In to be stored in the protected storage of mobile computing device.For example, Cellular Service Providers can perform near smart phone
SIM certificate storage public-key cryptography aerial download (OTA) transmission, from the out-of-band transmission of normal OTA system updates.The
Three sides can what reasonable time in office public-key cryptography is sent to the protected storage of mobile computing device.For example, when anticipating
Smartphone user following installation and by third party create using when, be installed on smart phone in application when, when should
Attempt carrying out its limited API to smart phone operating system when running for the first time on smart phone or when applying
When calling for the first time, Cellular Service Providers can be stored in public-key cryptography in the storage of the certificate of smart phone SIM.It is open
Key can be used to the instruction of the application of checking including public-key cryptography,.
Can on a mobile computing device run from third-party application, and system tune can be carried out to limited API
With.Before operating system performs the function or allows application to access data, operating system can be adjusted with the system to being limited API
License and the signature of the application are verified with trial in association.Operating system can for example by user check in installation process with
Guarantee, using appropriate license has been awarded, to call so as to carry out system to limited API.If using being permitted with appropriate
Can, operating system can retrieve public-key cryptography from protected storage, and in the certificate applied using public-key cryptography inspection
Signature, if on the contrary, using not having appropriate license, this is using the access denied to being limited API.Checking can make
With any appropriate encryption technology, such as any verification technique being associated with mode that is generating disclosure/private cipher key.If made
Signature is demonstrated with public-key cryptography, indicates that the application is by the private cipher key matched with the public-key cryptography from protected storage
Signature, then the system that operating system can be performed to being limited API calls asked function.If signature is not authenticated, or
There is no public-key cryptography in person, then application may be denied access to limited API for the application in protected storage.Lack open
Key may indicate that appropriate public-key cryptography is not yet sent to protected storage by third party, or application is by not with modification
What one side of the ability of protected storage created.
For example, the application for adjusting network access setting may be mounted on smart phone, and user can authorize this to answer
The license that system is called is carried out with the limited phone API of the operating system to smart phone.The application may via intelligent electricity
The Cellular Service Providers of words create, and may use the private cipher key maintained secrecy by Cellular Service Providers and be signed card
Book.Then Cellular Service Providers can be sent to corresponding public-key cryptography in the storage of the certificate of smart phone SIM.Should
With can run, and system can be carried out to limited phone API and called, to change during network access is arranged.Operation
System can first check for applying being awarded carries out the license that system is called to limited API, and the limited API is activated to network access
The function that write changes is set.If license is authorized to, operating system can retrieve public-key cryptography from protected storage, and
And verify the signature in the certificate of the application using the disclosure key.Because public-key cryptography is corresponding to the private for signature application
There is key, public-key cryptography can verify the signature of application.Then operating system can allow limited API execution systems to call to ask
The function of asking, specified change is written in network access setting.
Because third party can in confidence preserve private cipher key, and can possibly change unique the one of protected storage
Side, the limited API that the application for being created by third party and being signed can be accessed on mobile computing device.Created by any other side
Using limited API may be denied access to.Self-signing certificate may not be applied for four directions using any private cipher key, at this
In the case of kind, call in response to the system to being limited API and all will using any trial of upper signature by operating system checking
Can fail, so as to cause denied access to be limited API.Self-signing certificate can be applied for four directions using private cipher key, however, because
Be the private cipher key used by third party be secrecy, the private cipher key that used by four directions may not with used by third party
Private cipher key is identical.Because the private cipher key for signature four directions application may not be to disclose/private cipher key from third party
Right, any public-key cryptography for being sent to protected storage by third party possibly cannot verify the label in the application in four directions
Name.Because four directions may not change protected storage, four directions possibly cannot be sent to the public-key cryptography of their own to be received
In protection storage, for checking four directions application.This may allow the protected storage for being authorized to modification mobile computing device
A side create the application that system is called carried out to limited API, and by these applications installed in the outside of system constructing.
For example, one may be created with the incoherent application developer of the Cellular Service Providers of smart phone should
With it calls the function of limited API and the storage including erasing smart phone.Can be generated using free application developer is carried out
The private cipher key of disclosure/private cipher key pair be to apply self-signing certificate.User can install application, and can authorize the application
Access the license of limited API.When application operation, application carries out system and calls to limited API, and to activate intelligent electricity will be wiped
The function of the storage of words.Operating system can determine that there is appropriate license to call to carry out system for the application, then can taste
The signature in the certificate of the application is demonstrate,proved in test.The SIM of smart phone can have the public-key cryptography being stored in certificate storage.
Public-key cryptography can become a part for the disclosure/private cipher key pair generated by Cellular Service Providers, and can be
It is sent in the storage of the certificate of SIM by Cellular Service Providers.Application developer may not have by cellular service offer
The private cipher key that person generates.Operating system can use the public-key cryptography from SIM to attempt verifying application developer's
Using certificate signature.Because application is by from the disclosure/private cipher key different from storage public-key cryptography on the sim card
To private cipher key signature, checking trial may fail, and may prevent using the function erasing using limited API
The storage of smart phone.Application developer may have no ability to store the public-key cryptography of himself on the sim card.Due to only
Cellular Service Providers can on the sim card store public-key cryptography, and this may prevent application developer from testing operating system
Its application is demonstrate,proved, and does not allow to carry out system and call to being limited API in the case of the cooperation without Cellular Service Providers.It is logical
This mode is crossed, for the application installed by system creation person, and the Cellular Service Providers by SIM in smart phone
The application of approval, the access to the limited API of smart phone operating system is restricted.
Identical discloses/and private cipher key pair can be used for multiple installations of same application, and for from same third party
Multiple different applications.For example, Cellular Service Providers can create application, and using identical private cipher key pair application
All copies signed, and the copy of same public-key cryptography is sent to each mobile computing of application be installed set
It is standby.Different disclosure/private cipher key pairs can be used for multiple installations of same application, or for from same third-party many
Individual different application.For example, Cellular Service Providers can create three disclosure/private cipher key pairs, and each is open/private
There is key to for different applications, or for some in multiple installations of same application.
If necessary, the open private cipher key pair used by third party may be replaced.For example, third party may
Rotation of key, or private cipher key can be used be compromised or stolen and to become publicly available.Third party can give birth to
Disclosure/the private cipher key pair of Cheng Xin, and can remove from the protected storage of any mobile computing device it is old disclose it is close
Key, using new public-key cryptography it is replaced.Newly-established application can be signed by new private cipher key, and user may
It is required the version for updating the application on their mobile computing device.Using possibly cannot access limited API until
It is updated, this is because in the application that checking is signed using old private cipher key, new public-key cryptography may result in mistake
Lose.Further, since new public-key cryptography does not verify the signature made using old private cipher key, any trial using leakage or
The application of stolen private cipher key is likely to be prevented from accessing limited API.
In addition to public-key cryptography, unique software kit name list can also be stored in protected storage.It is unique soft
Part bag name list can recognize which third-party application may be allowed access to limited API.Third party can with disclose it is close
Unique software kit name list is sent to protected storage by key identical mode.As the limited API of application call, except utilizing
Beyond the signature of public-key cryptography checking application, operating system can check unique software kit name list to determine to apply whether known
Not, for example with the title in unique software kit name list.This may allow further to limit and limited API can be carried out
The application that system is called, because third party can add the title of application to unique software kit name list or from unique software
Bag name list is cancelled.For example, third party can cancel the title of application from unique software kit name list, even if using
As the disclosure/private cipher key pair with the public-key cryptography in protected storage a part private cipher key signature apply when,
Also application can be prevented to carry out system to limited API call.
The function of the limited API that can be used by application is probably limited.For example, it is responsible for creating, distribute or safeguarding movement
The operating system of computing device and a side of platform can specify which limited API and which function can with or cannot be by the 3rd
The application that side creates is accessed.This may cause any application for the part for not being installed to be system constructing still cannot access
Some limited API and some functions.
