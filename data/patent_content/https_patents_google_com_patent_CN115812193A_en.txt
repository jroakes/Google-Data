Detailed Description
The following is a more detailed description of various concepts related to methods, apparatus, and systems for controlling delivery of supplemental content via a digital assistant and implementations thereof. The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways.
The present technical solution is generally directed to controlling delivery of supplemental content via a digital assistant. A computing device having a display device may provide one or more graphical user interfaces ("GUIs") via the display device. The computing device may provide a home screen or main GUI. When the computing device receives the speech input, the computing device may process the speech input to detect a trigger keyword or hotword configured to invoke the digital assistant. Upon detecting a trigger word or hotword, the computing device may invoke the digital assistant to process the speech input and perform an action in response to the speech input. The digital assistant can process the speech input to generate an output. The digital assistant can provide output via the digital assistant GUI. However, the digital assistant GUI may not consume the entire main screen or track area (font) of the display device. That is, the digital assistant GUI may utilize only a portion of the display device, while the remainder of the display device or home screen may remain empty or unused by the digital assistant. Leaving the main screen or the remainder of the display device may result in wasted screen real estate. Even if this portion of the display is not used by the GUI of the digital assistant, the computing device may still consume battery resources or other resources to provide a portion of the home screen in this remaining space. Thus, the present technical solution can control the delivery of supplemental content to be provided via a portion of the display device that is not used by the digital assistant GUI that is invoked in response to the voice input. The present technology solution can select supplemental content that satisfies content parameters established to reduce battery consumption of the mobile computing device, thereby allowing the digital assistant to reduce wasted or empty GUI space without requiring excessive computing or energy utilization.
For example, the digital assistant can generate a GUI to display output in response to voice input. The digital assistant GUI may be designed or constructed as a compact GUI that does not utilize the entire portion of the display device that is available to provide GUI output. In such a configuration, the digital assistant may not fully utilize the available digital screen real estate. The present technology solution can utilize the empty screen space produced by the compact digital assistant GUI to provide supplemental content related to or enhancing the output of the digital assistant.
In an illustrative example, the voice input may include a query "work near me". A preprocessor or other component of the computing device can detect the input query and invoke the digital assistant to perform an action based on the input query. The digital assistant may converse with the user, perform a search, or perform another action in response to entering a query. However, such conversations or actions may not occupy the entire screen accessible to the computing device for output. The digital assistant may determine that there is wasted or unused screen space. In response to determining that there is wasted or unused screen space, the digital assistant can generate content selection criteria. The content selection criteria may be based on the input query, an action to be performed based on the input query, or a property associated with the computing device or available screen space. In generating the content selection criteria, the digital assistant can transmit a content request based on the content selection criteria. The digital assistant can send a request for supplemental content to a content selector component configured to perform a real-time content selection process. In response to the request, the digital assistant can receive the selected supplemental content item. The digital assistant can provide supplemental content items to be provided or presented in a graphical user interface slot located or positioned in a portion of the screen not used by the digital assistant to converse with a user of the computing device.
The digital assistant can automatically create GUI slots for the supplemental content items. The digital assistant can configure the GUI slot for the supplemental content item. The digital assistant may establish the dimensions of the slot. The digital assistant may limit the types of supplemental content items that may be provided via the slot. For example, the digital assistant may limit the type of supplemental content item to an assistant-type content item. Assistant-type content may refer to content items that are compatible with slots generated by an assistant. The digital assistant may control the format of the supplemental content items provided via the slot. The format may include, for example, application installation content, image content, video content, or audio content. The digital assistant may establish actions for the slot, such as pinning the supplemental content item to the home screen, muting the slot, adjusting parameters of the slot, or otherwise interacting with the slot. The digital assistant may configure the slots based on the quality signal or the content parameter. The content parameters may include brightness level, file size, frame number, resolution, or audio output level. In some cases, the digital assistant may utilize a machine learning model or engine to generate content selection criteria based on the input query and one or more attributes or configurations of the slot.
Thus, by having the digital assistant automatically create and configure GUI slots for supplemental content items that satisfy the content parameters, the present solution can reduce wasted screen space without using excessive computing resources. The content parameters may be configured to reduce computing and energy consumption by, for example, limiting the brightness level or file size of the supplemental content item. While selection of the supplemental content item may occur in parallel through a separate system or cloud-based computing infrastructure, the server digital assistant may control delivery of the supplemental content item based on delivery of the action data structure in response to the voice input. For example, the server digital assistant may combine or package the supplemental content items with the action data structure to reduce data transmission over the network. The server digital assistant can add a buffer to the transfer such that the action data structure responsive to the speech input is presented prior to the supplemental content item, thereby avoiding introducing a delay or latency in presenting the action data structure. Further, by automatically generating requests for supplemental content, the digital assistant can proactively augment or improve the action data structure without requiring a separate downstream request.
Fig. 1 illustrates an example system 100 for controlling delivery of supplemental content via a digital assistant. The system 100 may include a content selection infrastructure. System 100 may include a data processing system 102. The data processing system 102 may communicate with one or more of the computing device 140, the service provider device 154, or the supplemental digital content provider device 152 via the network 105. The network 105 may include a computer network, such as the internet, a local area network, a wide area network, a metropolitan area network, or other area network, an intranet, a satellite network, and other communication networks, such as voice or data mobile telephone networks. The network 105 can be used to access information resources, such as web pages, web sites, domain names, or uniform resource locators, which can be provided, submitted (render), presented, or displayed on at least one local computing device 140, such as a laptop computer, desktop computer, tablet, digital assistant device, smartphone, mobile telecommunications device, portable computer, or speaker. For example, via the network 105, a user of the local computing device 140 may access information or data provided by the supplemental digital content provider device 152. Computing device 140 may or may not include a display; for example, a computing device may include a limited type of user interface, such as a microphone and speaker. In some cases, the primary user interface of the computing device 140 may be a microphone and speaker, or a voice interface. In some cases, computing device 140 includes a display device 150 coupled to computing device 140, and a primary user interface of computing device 140 may utilize display device 150.
The network 105 may be any type or form of network, and may include any of the following: point-to-point networks, broadcast networks, wide area networks, local area networks, telecommunications networks, data communication networks, computer networks, ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks, SONET (synchronous optical network) networks, SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) networks, wireless networks and wired networks. The network 105 may include a wireless link, such as an infrared channel or a satellite band. The topology of the network 105 may include a bus, star, or ring network topology. The network may include a mobile telephone network using any protocol for communicating between mobile devices, including advanced mobile phone protocol ("AMPS"), time division multiple access ("TDMA"), code division multiple access ("CDMA"), global system for mobile communications ("GSM"), general packet radio service ("GPRS"), or universal mobile telecommunications system ("UMTS"). Different types of data may be transmitted via different protocols, or the same type of data may be transmitted via different protocols.
The servers in the machine farm may be stored in a high density rack system along with associated storage systems and located in an enterprise data center. For example, merging the servers in this manner may improve system manageability, data security, physical security of the system, and system performance by locating the servers and high performance storage systems on a local high performance network. The centralization of all or some of the data processing system 102 components, including servers and storage systems, and coupling them with advanced system management tools allows for more efficient use of server resources, which saves power and processing requirements, and reduces bandwidth usage.
The system 100 may include, access, or otherwise interact with at least one third party device, such as a service provider device 154 or a supplemental digital content provider device 152. The service provider device 154 may include at least one logical device, such as a computing device having a processor in communication with, for example, the computing device 140, the data processing system 102, or the supplemental digital content provider device 152 via the network 105. The service provider device 154 may include at least one computing resource, server, processor, or memory. For example, the service provider equipment 154 may include a plurality of computing resources or servers located in at least one data center.
The supplemental digital content provider device 152 may provide the audio-based digital component for display by the local computing device 140 as an audio output digital component. The digital component may be referred to as a sponsored digital component because it is provided by a third party sponsor. The numeric component may include an order for a good or service, such as a voice-based message, which states: "do you want to help you call a taxi? ". For example, the supplemental digital content provider device 152 may include a memory that stores a series of audio digital components that may be provided in response to a voice-based query. The supplemental digital content provider device 152 may also provide the audio-based digital components (or other digital components) to the data processing system 102, where they may be stored in the data repository 124. The data processing system 102 can select the audio digital components and provide them to the client computing device 140 (or instruct the supplemental digital content provider device 152 to provide them to the client computing device 140). The audio-based digital component may be audio only or may be combined with text, image or video data.
The local computing device 140 may include at least one sensor 144, transducer 146, audio driver 148, or local digital assistant 142, interfacing with or otherwise communicating with the at least one sensor 144, transducer 146, audio driver 148, or local digital assistant 142. The local computing device 140 may include a display device 150, such as a light indicator, a light emitting diode ("LED"), an organic light emitting diode ("OLED"), or other visual indicator configured to provide a visual or optical output. The sensors 144 may include, for example, ambient light sensors, proximity sensors, temperature sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, motion detectors, GPS sensors, location sensors, microphones, or touch sensors. The transducer 146 may include a speaker or a microphone. The audio driver 148 may provide a software interface to the hardware transducer 146. The audio driver may execute audio files or other instructions provided by the data processing system 102 to control the transducer 146 to generate corresponding sound or sound waves.
Local digital assistant 142 may include one or more processors (e.g., processor 510), logical arrays, or memories. The local digital assistant 142 may detect the keyword and perform an action based on the keyword. The local digital assistant 142 can filter out one or more terms or modify those terms before transmitting the terms to the data processing system 102 (e.g., the server digital assistant component 104) for further processing. The local digital assistant 142 may convert the analog audio signal detected by the microphone to a digital audio signal and transmit one or more data packets carrying the digital audio signal to the data processing system 102 via the network 105. In some cases, the local digital assistant 142 may transmit data packets carrying some or all of the input audio signals in response to detecting an instruction to perform such transmission. The instructions may include, for example, trigger keywords or other keywords or approvals to transmit data packets including the input audio signal to the data processing system 102.
The local digital assistant 142 may pre-filter or pre-process the input audio signal to remove certain frequencies of audio. The pre-filtering may include filters, such as low pass filters, high pass filters, or band pass filters. The filter may be applied in the frequency domain. The filters may be applied using digital signal processing techniques. The filter may be configured to maintain frequencies corresponding to human speech or human speech while eliminating frequencies that fall outside of typical frequencies of human speech. For example, the band pass filter may be configured to remove frequencies below a first threshold (e.g., 70Hz, 75Hz, 80Hz, 85Hz, 90Hz, 95Hz, 100Hz, or 105 Hz) and above a second threshold (e.g., 200Hz, 205Hz, 210Hz, 225Hz, 235Hz, 245Hz, or 255 Hz). Applying a band pass filter may reduce computational resource utilization in downstream processing. In some cases, the local digital assistant 142 on the computing device 140 may apply a band pass filter before transmitting the input audio signal to the data processing system 102, thereby reducing network bandwidth utilization. However, based on the computing resources available to the computing device 140 and the network bandwidth available, it may be more efficient to provide the input audio signal to the data processing system 102 to allow the data processing system 102 to perform filtering.
The local digital assistant 142 may apply additional pre-processing or pre-filtering techniques, such as noise reduction techniques, to reduce the ambient noise level that may interfere with the natural language processor. Noise reduction techniques may improve the accuracy and speed of the natural language processor, thereby improving the performance of the data processing system 102 and managing the submission of graphical user interfaces provided via the display device 150. The local digital assistant 142 may filter the input audio signal to create a filtered input audio signal, convert the filtered input audio signal into data packets, and transmit the data packets to a data processing system including one or more processors and memory.
The local digital assistant 142 may determine to invoke or launch an application on the computing device 140. The local digital assistant 142 can receive instructions or commands from the server digital assistant component 104 to invoke or launch an application on the computing device 140. The local digital assistant 142 may receive deep links or other information to facilitate the launching of applications on the computing device 140 or the execution of applications on the computing device 140.
The local client computing device 140 may be associated with an end user that enters a voice query as audio input into the local client computing device 140 (via the sensor 144) and receives audio output in the form of computer-generated speech, which may be provided from the data processing system 102 (or supplemental digital content provider device 152 or service provider computing device 154) to the local client computing device 140, output from the transducer 146 (e.g., speaker). The computer-generated speech may include a recording from a live person or a computer-generated language.
The data repository 124 may include one or more local or distributed databases and may include a database management system. The data repository 124 may include a computer data storage device or memory and may store one or more of the content data 126, attributes 128, content parameters 130, templates 156, or account information 158. The content data 126 may include or refer to information related to supplemental content items or sponsored content items. The content data may include content items, digital component objects, content selection criteria, content types, identifiers of content providers, keywords, or other information associated with the content items that may be used by the content selector component 120 to perform a real-time content selection process.
The attributes 128 may include or refer to qualities, features, or characteristics associated with the GUI slot. Example attributes may include the size of the GUI slot, the location of the GUI slot. Attributes 128 of the GUI slot may define aspects of the sponsored content item provided via the GUI slot, such as brightness level, file size of the sponsored content item, duration of the sponsored content item (e.g., video or audio duration).
The content parameters 130 may refer to a quality signal that is a criterion for a certain type of sponsored content item or supplemental content item. Types of supplemental content items may include digital assistant, search, contextual, video, or streamlining. Different types of sponsored content items may include different content parameters configured to improve presentation of the content item in a certain type of slot or in a certain type of computing device. Content parameters may include, for example, brightness level, file size, processor utilization, duration, or other quality signals. For example, the content parameter of the digital assistant content item may comprise a first brightness threshold that is lower than a second brightness threshold set for the contextual content item.
The template 156 may include fields in the structured dataset that may be populated by the direct action API 110 to advance an operation via an input audio request. The template 156 data structure may include different types of templates for different actions. Account information 158 may include information associated with an electronic account. The electronic account may be associated with the computing device 140 or a user thereof.

The interface 106 may communicate with one or more of the local computing device 140, the supplemental digital content provider device 152, or the service provider device 154 via the network 105.
The data processing system 102 may interface with an application, script, or program (such as an app) installed on the local client computing device 140 to transmit the input audio signal to the interface 106 of the data processing system 102 and to drive components of the local client computing device to submit the output audio signal. The data processing system 102 may receive data packets or other signals that include or identify audio input signals.
The data processing system 102 or the server digital assistant component 104 can include a natural language processor ("NLP") component 108. For example, the data processing system 102 can execute or run the NLP component 108 to receive or obtain an audio signal and parse the audio signal. For example, NLP component 108 can provide interaction between a human and a computer. The NLP component 108 may be configured with techniques for understanding natural language and allowing the data processing system 102 to derive meaning from human or natural language input. The NLP component 108 can include or be configured with machine learning based techniques, such as statistical machine learning. The NLP component 108 can parse the input audio signal using a decision tree, statistical model, or probabilistic model. NLP component 108 can perform, for example, processing such as named entity recognition (e.g., given a stream of text, determining which items in the text map to appropriate names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is, such as people, locations, or organizations), natural language generation (e.g., converting information from a computer database or semantic intent into intelligible human language), natural language understanding (e.g., converting text into a more formal representation, such as a first-order logical structure that a computer module can manipulate), machine translation (e.g., automatically translating text from one human language to another), morpheme segmentation (e.g., separating words into individual morphemes and identifying categories of morphemes, which are challenging based on the complexity of the morphology or structure of the words in consideration language), question answering (e.g., determining answers to human language questions, which can be specific or open), semantic processing (e.g., processing that can occur after recognizing and encoding the meaning of a word in order to associate the recognized word with other words having similar meaning).
The NLP component 108 can convert the audio input signal into recognized text by comparing the input signal to a stored set of representative audio waveforms (e.g., in the data repository 124) and selecting the closest match. The set of audio waveforms may be stored in data repository 124 or other database accessible to data processing system 102. Representative waveforms are generated across a large group of users and may then be augmented with speech samples from the users. After the audio signal is converted to recognized text, NLP component 108 matches the text with the associated words, e.g., via cross-user training or by manual designation, with an action that data processing system 102 can provide. Various aspects or functions of the NLP component 108 may be performed by the data processing system 102 or the local computing device 140. For example, a local NLP component may execute on the local computing device 140 to perform aspects of converting an input audio signal to text and transmitting the text via data packets to the data processing system 102 for further natural language processing.
The audio input signal may be detected by a sensor 144 or transducer 146 (e.g., a microphone) of the local client computing device 140. Via the transducer 146, audio driver 148, or other components, the local client computing device 140 can provide audio input signals to the data processing system 102 (e.g., via the network 105), which can be received in the data processing system 102 (e.g., through the interface 106) and provided to the NLP component 108 or stored in the data repository 124.
The local computing device 140 may include an audio driver 148, a transducer 146, a sensor 144, and a local digital assistant 142. The sensor 144 may receive or detect an input audio signal (e.g., a voice input). The local digital assistant 142 may be coupled to an audio driver, a transducer, and a sensor. The local digital assistant 142 may filter the input audio signal (e.g., by removing certain frequencies or suppressing noise) to create a filtered input audio signal. The local digital assistant 142 may convert the filtered input audio signal into data packets (e.g., using a software or hardware digital-to-analog converter). In some cases, the local digital assistant 142 may convert the unfiltered input audio signal into data packets and transmit the data packets to the data processing system 102. The local digital assistant 142 may transmit data packets to the data processing system 102, the data processing system 102 including one or more processors and memory that execute natural language processor components, interfaces, speaker recognition components, and direct action application programming interfaces.
The data processing system 102 may receive data packets from the local digital assistant 142 via the interface that include filtered (or unfiltered) input audio signals detected by the sensors. The data processing system 102 may process the data packets to perform actions or otherwise respond to voice input. In some cases, the data processing system 102 may identify an acoustic signature (acoustic signature) from the input audio signal. The data processing system 102 can identify an electronic account corresponding to the acoustic signature based on a lookup (e.g., querying a database) in a data repository. In response to identifying the electronic account, the data processing system 102 may establish the session and the account to be used in the session. The account may include a profile having one or more policies. The data processing system 102 can parse the input audio signal to identify a request and a trigger keyword corresponding to the request.
The data processing system 102 can provide the status to the local digital assistant 142 of the local computing device 140. The local computing device 140 may receive an indication of the status. The audio driver may receive an indication of a state of the profile and generate an output signal based on the indication. The audio driver may convert the indication into an output signal, such as a sound signal or an acoustic output signal. The audio driver may drive a transducer 146 (e.g., a speaker) to generate sound based on an output signal generated by the audio driver.
In some cases, the local computing device 140 may include a light source. The light source may include one or more LEDs, lights, displays, or other components or devices configured to provide an optical or visual output. The local digital assistant 142 may cause the light source to provide a visual indication corresponding to the status. For example, the visual indication may be a status indicator light that is on, a change in light color, a light pattern having one or more colors, or a visual display of text or images.
The NLP component 108 may obtain an input audio signal. In response to the local digital assistant 142 detecting the trigger keyword, the NLP component 108 of the data processing system 102 can receive a data packet with a speech input or an input audio signal. The trigger keyword may be a wake signal or hotword that instructs the local computing device 140 to convert subsequent audio input into text and transmit the text to the data processing system 102 for further processing.
Upon receiving the input audio signal, NLP component 108 can identify at least one request or at least one keyword corresponding to the request. The request may indicate an intention or a subject matter (subject matter) of the input audio signal. The keywords may indicate the types of actions that may be taken. For example, the NLP component 108 may parse the input audio signal to identify at least one request to go home in the evening to attend dinner and watch a movie. The trigger keyword may comprise at least one word, phrase, root or partial word or derivative indicating an action to be taken. For example, a trigger keyword "go (go)" or "go (to go to)" from an input audio signal may indicate that traffic (transport) is required. In this example, the input audio signal (or identified request) does not directly express the intent of the traffic, however the trigger keyword indicates that the delivery is an auxiliary action to the at least one other action indicated by the request. In another example, the voice input may include a search query, such as "find work near me".
The NLP component 108 can parse the input audio signal to identify, determine, retrieve, or otherwise obtain the request and one or more keywords associated with the request. For example, the NLP component 108 can apply semantic processing techniques to the input audio signal to identify keywords or requests. The NLP component 108 can apply semantic processing techniques to the input audio signal to identify keywords or phrases that include one or more keywords (such as a first keyword and a second keyword). For example, the input audio signal may comprise the sentence "i want to purchase an audio book". NLP component 108 can apply semantic processing techniques or other natural language processing techniques to the data package that includes the statement to identify keywords or phrases "want to purchase" and "voiced book". The NLP component 108 can further identify a plurality of keywords, such as purchases and voiced books. For example, the NLP component 108 can determine that the phrase includes a first keyword and a second keyword.
The NLP component 108 can filter the input audio signal to identify the trigger keyword. For example, a data packet carrying an incoming audio signal may include "it is too good if i can find someone that can help i go to an airport," in which case the NLP component 108 may filter out one or more of the following terms: "if", "I", "may", "find", "can", "help", "of", "person", "just", or "too good". By filtering out these terms, NLP component 108 can more accurately and reliably identify a trigger keyword, such as "go to an airport," and determine that this is a request for taxi or windward (ride sharing) services.
In some cases, the NLP component may determine that the data packet carrying the input audio signal includes one or more requests. For example, the input audio signal may comprise the sentence "i want to purchase voiced books and monthly subscription to movies". NLP component 108 can determine that this is a request for an audio book and a streaming multimedia service. The NLP component 108 can determine whether this is a single request or multiple requests. The NLP component 108 can determine that these are two requests: a first request to a service provider providing an audio book and a second request to a service provider providing a movie stream. In some cases, NLP component 108 may combine the multiple determined requests into a single request and transmit the single request to service provider device 154. In some cases, NLP component 108 may transmit a separate request to another service provider device, or transmit both requests separately to the same service provider device 154.
The data processing system 102 may include a direct action API 110 designed and constructed to generate an action data structure responsive to a request based on one or more keywords in a speech input. The processor of the data processing system 102 may call the direct action API 110 to execute a script that generates data structures to be provided to the service provider device 154 or other service provider to obtain a digital component, an order service, or a product, such as an automobile or audio book from a car share (car share) service. The direct action API 110 may obtain data from the data repository 124, as well as data received from the local client computing device 140 at the end user's consent, to determine location, time, user account, logistics, or other information to allow the service provider device 154 to perform operations, such as booking a car from a car sharing service. Using the direct action API 110, the data processing system 102 may also communicate with the service provider device 154 to complete the conversion by making a car share piggyback reservation in this example.
The direct action API 110 may perform a specified action that satisfies the intent of the end user, as determined by the data processing system 102. The action may include performing a search using a search engine, launching an application, ordering goods or services, providing requested information, or controlling a network-connected device (e.g., an internet of things device). Depending on the actions specified in its input and the parameters or rules in the data repository 124, the direct action API 110 may execute code or dialog scripts that identify the parameters needed to satisfy the user request. Such code may, for example, look up additional information in the data repository 124 (such as the name of the home automation service or third party service), or it may provide an audio output for presentation at the local client computing device 140 to query the end user, such as the intended destination of the requested taxi. The direct action API 110 may determine parameters and may package the information into an action data structure, which may then be sent to another component, such as the content selector component 120, or the service provider computing device 154 to be implemented.
The direct action API 110 may receive instructions or commands from the NLP component 108 or other components of the data processing system 102 to generate or build an action data structure. The direct action API 110 may determine the type of action to select a template from the template repository 156 stored in the data repository 124. The type of action may include, for example, a service, a product, a subscription, a ticket, multimedia content, a voiced book, an administrative subscription, an adjustment subscription, a transfer of digital money, a purchase, or music. The type of action may also include the type of service or product. For example, the service type may include a car sharing service, a meal delivery service, a laundry service, a commissioner service, a repair service, a housekeeping service, a device automation service, or a media streaming service. The type of product may include, for example, clothing, shoes, toys, electronics, computers, books, or jewelry. The type of subscription may include, for example, dinner subscriptions or hair salon subscriptions. The types of tickets may include, for example, movie tickets, stadium tickets, or airline tickets. In some cases, the type of service, product, reservation, or ticket may be categorized based on price, location, type of transportation, availability, or other attributes.
The NLP component 108 may parse the input audio signal to identify a request and a trigger keyword corresponding to the request and provide the request and the trigger keyword to the direct action API 110 to cause the direct action API to generate a first action data structure responsive to the request based on the trigger keyword. Upon identifying the type of request, the direct action API 110 may access the corresponding template in the template library 156. The template may include fields in the structured dataset that may be populated by the direct action API 110 to facilitate an operation requested via input audio detected by the local computing device 140 of the service provider device 154, such as an operation to send a taxi to pick up an end user at a pick-up location and to transport the end user to a destination location. The direct action API 110 may perform a lookup in the template repository 156 to select a template that matches the trigger keyword and one or more characteristics of the request. For example, if the request corresponds to a request for a car or ride to a destination, the data processing system 102 may select a car sharing service template. The car sharing service template may include one or more of the following fields: device identifier, pick-up location, destination location, number of passengers, or type of service. The direct action API 110 may populate the fields with values. To populate a field with a value, the direct action API 110 may ping, poll, or otherwise obtain information from one or more sensors 144 of the computing device 140 or a user interface of the device 140. For example, the direct action API 110 may use a location sensor, such as a GPS sensor, to detect the source location. The direct action API 110 may obtain additional information by submitting surveys, prompts, or queries to the end user of the computing device 140. The direct action API may submit a survey, prompt, or query via the interface 106 of the data processing system 102 and a user interface (e.g., an audio interface, a voice-based user interface, a display, or a touch screen) of the computing device 140. Accordingly, the direct action API 110 may select a template for an action data structure based on the trigger keyword or request, populate one or more fields in the template with information detected by the one or more sensors 144 or obtained via the user interface, and generate, create, or otherwise construct the action data structure to facilitate the service provider device 154 in performing the operation.
To construct or generate the action data structure, the data processing system 102 can identify one or more fields in the selected template to populate with values. These fields may be populated with numeric values, strings, unicode (Unicode) values, boolean logic, binary values, hexadecimal values, identifiers, location coordinates, geographic areas, timestamps, or other values. The fields or data structures themselves may be encrypted or masked to maintain data security.
After determining the fields in the template, the data processing system 102 can identify values for the fields to populate the fields of the template to create an action data structure. The data processing system 102 may obtain, retrieve, determine, or otherwise identify a value for a field by performing a lookup or other query operation on the data repository 124.
In some cases, the data processing system 102 may determine that no information or values for the fields exist in the data repository 124. The data processing system 102 can determine that the information or values stored in the data repository 124 are expired, stale, or otherwise not suitable for the purpose of constructing an action data structure in response to trigger keywords and requests identified by the NLP component 108 (e.g., the location of the local client computing device 140 can be an old location rather than a current location; an account can be expired; the target restaurant can have moved to a new location; physical activity information; or a transportation means).
If data processing system 102 determines that it does not currently have access to the values or information for the fields of the template in the memory of data processing system 102, data processing system 102 may retrieve the values or information. The data processing system 102 may obtain or obtain this information by querying or polling one or more available sensors of the local client computing device 140, prompting an end user of the local client computing device 140 for this information, or accessing an online network-based resource using the HTTP protocol. For example, the data processing system 102 may determine that it does not have a current location of the local client computing device 140, which may be a required field of the template. The data processing system 102 may query the local client computing device 140 for location information. The data processing system 102 may request that the local client computing device 140 provide location information using one or more location sensors 144, such as global positioning system sensors, WIFI triangulation, cell tower triangulation, bluetooth beacons, IP addresses, or other location sensing technologies.
In some cases, the data processing system 102 may generate an action data structure using the second profile. The data processing system 102 may then determine whether the action data structure generated using the second profile conforms to the first profile. For example, the first profile may include a policy that prevents one type of action data structure (such as purchasing a product from an electronic online retailer via the local computing device 140). The input audio detected by the local computing device 140 may have included a request to purchase a product from an electronic online retailer. The data processing system 102 may have used the second profile to identify account information associated with the electronic online retailer and then generated an action data structure for purchasing the product. The action data structure may include an account identifier corresponding to an electronic account associated with the acoustic signature recognized by the data processing system 102.
The data processing system 102 may identify an account associated with the user providing the voice input. The data processing system may receive an audio input signal detected by the local computing device 140, identify an acoustic signature, and identify an electronic account corresponding to the acoustic signature. The data processing system 102 can identify an electronic account corresponding to the acoustic signature based on a lookup in the account data structure 158 in the data repository 124. The data processing system 102 can access acoustic signatures stored in the data repository 124 (such as in the account data structure 158). The data processing system 102 may be configured with one or more speaker recognition techniques, such as pattern recognition. The data processing system 102 may be configured with a text-independent speaker recognition process. In the text-independent speaker recognition process, the text used to establish the electronic account may be different than the text used to later recognize the speaker. Accordingly, the data processing system 102 may perform speaker recognition or voice recognition to identify the electronic account corresponding to the signature of the input audio signal.
For example, the data processing system 102 may identify different acoustic features in the input audio signal between the input speech sources. The acoustic features may reflect physical or learned patterns that can correspond to unique input speech sources. The acoustic features may include, for example, pitch or speech style. Techniques for identifying, processing, and storing signatures may include frequency estimation (e.g., instantaneous fundamental frequency or discrete energy separation algorithms), hidden markov models (e.g., stochastic models for modeling stochastically-varying systems where future states depend on current states and where the systems are modeled as having unobserved states), gaussian mixture models (e.g., parametric probability density functions expressed as weighted sums of gaussian component densities), pattern matching algorithms, neural networks, matrix representations, vector quantization (e.g., quantization techniques in signal processing that allow modeling probability density functions through distributions of prototype vectors), or decision trees. Other techniques may include inverse speaker techniques, such as homogeneous group (cohort) models and world models. The data processing system 102 may be configured with a machine learning model to facilitate pattern recognition or to adapt to speaker characteristics.
The data processing system 102 can include a query generator component 112 designed, constructed and operative to generate a query or content selection criteria based upon a speech input. The query generator component 112 can be part of or interact with the server digital assistant component 104. For example, the server digital assistant component 104 can include a query generator component 112. The query generator component 112 can generate content selection criteria for input to the content selector component 120. The content selector component 120 can use the content selection criteria to select supplemental content provided by a third party content provider (e.g., supplemental digital content provider device 152). The query generator component 112 can generate content selection criteria having one or more keywords and a digital assistant content type.
The query generator component 112 may receive from the NLP component 108 an indication of one or more keywords or requests identified by the NLP component 108 in the input audio signal received from the computing device 140. The query generator component 112 can process the one or more keywords and the request to determine whether to generate a request to request supplemental content from the supplemental digital content provider device 152. The supplemental content may refer to or include sponsored content. For example, a supplemental digital content provider can bid on content items to be selected in a real-time content selection process for provision to a user via the computing device 140.
The query generator component 112 can generate content selection criteria based on one or more keywords identified in the speech input. The content selection criteria may include keywords in the voice input. The query generator component 112 can further expand or broaden the keywords to select additional keywords.
The query generator component 112 may identify additional content selection criteria based on profile information stored in the account data structure 158. For example, the query generator component 112 can receive an indication of an account associated with a user or voice input and retrieve account information, such as historical information associated with network activity (e.g., search history, clicks, or selection executions). The query generator component 112 can generate keywords or other content selection criteria based upon historical information associated with network activity. For example, if the search history includes search queries for "work near me," the query generator component 112 can generate keywords based on the term "work" and keywords based on the location of the computing device 140.
The query generator component 112 can access information associated with the sensors 144 of the computing device 140 to generate content selection criteria. The query generator component 112 can ping or poll one or more sensors 144 of the computing device 140 to obtain information such as location information, motion information, or any other information that can facilitate generating content selection criteria.
The query generator component 112 can ping or poll the computing devices 140 to obtain information associated with the computing devices 140, such as device configuration information. The device configuration information may include the type of device, the available user interface of the device, remaining battery information, network connection information, display device 150 information (e.g., the size of the display or the resolution of the display), or the manufacturer and model of the computing device 140. The query generator component 112 can use the device configuration to generate content selection criteria for input into the content selection component 120. By generating content selection criteria based on device configuration information, the data processing system 102 can facilitate selection of supplemental or sponsored content items based on device configuration information associated with the computing device 140. Accordingly, the data processing system 102 may select supplemental content items that are compatible with or otherwise optimized for device configuration information (e.g., to reduce energy or computing resource utilization of the computing device 140).
The query generator component 112 can generate content selection criteria that indicate the type of sponsored or supplemental content selected to be provided via the computing device 140. Types of sponsored content may include, for example: digital assistant, search, streaming video, streaming audio, or contextual content. Digital assistant content may refer to content configured to be provided via a graphical user interface slot generated by the local digital assistant 142 on the computing device 140. The digital assistant content may satisfy certain quality signals or content parameters that optimize the digital assistant content for provision in a graphical user interface slot generated by the local digital assistant 142. These content parameters may include, for example, image size, brightness level, file size, network bandwidth utilization, video duration, or audio duration. Examples of digital assistant content may include assistant applications, chat robots, image content, video content, or audio content.
Search-type content may refer to sponsored content configured to be provided with search results on a web browser. The search content may include plain text content or text and image content. The search content may include a hyperlink to a login to the web page.
Streaming video type content may refer to video content that is configured to be played before the video begins, at the end of the video, or during a video interruption. Streaming video type content may include video and audio. A streaming audio type content item may refer to a content item that is played before, after or during a streaming audio interruption. Contextual content may refer to content items displayed with a web page published by a content publisher, such as news articles, blogs, or other online documents.
The query generator component 112 can generate content selection criteria based on attributes associated with graphical user interface ("GUI") slots in which supplemental or sponsored content is to be provided. In some cases, the properties of the content slot may be predetermined or preconfigured. The attributes of the content slots may be stored in an attribute data structure 128 in the data repository 124. The attributes may include, for example, the size of the slot, the resolution of the display device 150, or other information. The attributes may be set based on the type of computing device 140. For example, a laptop computing device may have one or more different attributes than a smartphone computing device; or the smartphone computing device may have one or more attributes that are different from the desktop computing device.
The data processing system 102 may include a slot injector component 114 designed, constructed and operative to generate, create or otherwise provide graphical user interface slots on a display device 150 of a computing device 140. The local digital assistant 142 may provide sponsored or supplemental content items in a GUI slot generated by the slot injector component 114. The server digital assistant component 104 can include a slot injector component 114 or otherwise interface or communicate with the slot injector component 114.
The slot injector component 114 can establish one or more attributes for a GUI slot on the computing device 140. The slot injector component 114 may use various techniques to establish the properties. For example, the slot injector component 114 may obtain the attributes preconfigured or assigned to the computing device 140 from the attribute data structure 128. The attributes may be preconfigured or assigned based on the type of computing device 140. For example, the attribute data structure 128 may include a mapping of slot sizes to the size of the display device 150. Accordingly, the slot injector component 114 may identify the size of the display device 150 and select a corresponding slot size. The slot injector component 114 may determine the size of the display device 150 based on receiving device configuration information from the computing device 140. The slot injector component 114 may determine the size established for the slot based on the vendor or model of the computing device 140. For example, the attribute data structure 128 may include a mapping of device vendor and model to slot size.
When providing content items via a GUI slot on the computing device 140, the slot injector component 114 may determine a reduced energy consumption attribute for the GUI slot. Attributes that may reduce energy consumption may include, for example, a brightness level of the content item, a file size of the content item, or a duration of the content item (e.g., a length of the video or audio content item). In some cases where the content item is an application (such as an assistant application or a chat bot application), the attributes may include a processor utilization level of the application.
Slot-in injector component 114 may determine the energy consumption related attribute based on characteristics of computing device 140. For example, if the computing device is being powered by a battery and is not currently being charged, the slot injector component 114 may select attributes for the slot that reduce battery utilization and energy consumption. However, if computing device 140 is connected to a power source, such as a power outlet, slot injector component 114 may select attributes that allow for selection of content items that can consume more energy.
The data processing system 102 may receive an indication that the computing device is receiving power from a battery and is not connected to a charger. In response to the indication, the data processing system 102 may generate a graphical user interface slot (e.g., the GUI slot 202 depicted in fig. 2) having a first property that reduces energy consumption relative to a second property that consumes more energy. For example, the second attribute may have a higher brightness level. The second attribute may be used to generate a GUI slot of the action data structure (e.g., the second GUI slot 204 depicted in fig. 2). Attributes of the digital assistant content type may reduce the energy used to present supplemental content via the computing device relative to attributes of different types of supplemental content (e.g., search content, video stream content, or contextual content) that cause the computing device to use more energy. These attributes may relate to duration, file size, brightness level, or other characteristics of the digital content that affect computing resources, network, or energy consumption.
Accordingly, the data processing system 102 (e.g., via the slot injector component 114) can generate a second graphical user interface slot. The slot injector component 114 can generate GUI slots in a home screen (such as a smartphone home screen) of the computing device 140. The home screen may refer to a main screen, a start screen, or a default GUI output by the computing device 140 via the display device 150. The home screen may display links, settings, and notifications to applications. The data processing system 102 may generate a graphical user interface slot with properties configured for a smartphone display.
The query generator component 112 can generate content selection criteria based on the properties of the slots established by the slot injector component 114. The query generator component 112 can include attributes of the slots in the content selection criteria. The content selection criteria may include attributes of the slot. The query generator component 112 can select the type of content based on the attributes of the slot. For example, the property established by the slot injector component 114 may indicate the type of content that is compatible with the slot. For example, the content type may be a digital assistant type if the slot injector component 114 is invoked by the server digital assistant component 104 to generate a GUI slot to provide supplemental content along with an action data structure generated in response to a voice input.
The server digital assistant component 104 can send a request for content to the content selector component 120. The server digital assistant component 104 can transmit a request to request supplemental or sponsored content from a third-party content provider. The server digital assistant component 104 can transmit the content selection criteria generated by the query generator component 112 to the content selector component 120. The content selector component 120 can perform a content selection process to select a supplemental content item or a sponsored content item. The content item may be a sponsored or supplemental digital component object. The content item may be provided by a third party content provider, such as supplemental digital content provider device 152. The supplemental content item may include an advertisement for a good or service. The content selector component 120 can select content items using content selection criteria in response to receiving a request for content from the server digital assistant component 104.
The server digital assistant component 104 can receive supplemental or sponsored content items from the content selector component 120. The server digital assistant component 104 can receive content items in response to the request. The server digital assistant component 104 can provide supplemental content items to the supplemental digital content provider device 152 for provision via the GUI slots generated by the slot injector component 114. However, in some cases, the server digital assistant component 104 can receive the content item from the content selector component 120 before the direct action API 110 generates the action data structure responsive to the speech input audio signal received from the computing device 140. The direct action API 110 may take more time to generate an action data structure than the content selector component 120 uses the content selection criteria to select content items in a real-time content selection process. For example, the amount of computation made by the direct action API 110 to generate the action data structure may be greater than the amount of computation made by the content selector component 120 to select the content item. In another example, the computing infrastructure used by the content selector component 120 may be more powerful, robust, or extensible than the computing infrastructure used by the direct action API 110. In yet another example, the content selector component 120 can be more efficient in selecting content items than the direct action API 110 selects action data structures.
Thus, due to various technical challenges, the time for the direct action API 110 to generate the action data structure may be longer than the time for the content selector component 120 to select the content item. Further, due to the latency in generating the action data structure, the data processing system 102 may transmit the content item to the computing device 140 for presentation prior to the action data structure. However, transmitting the content item before the action data structure introduces further delay in rendering the action data structure, as the computing device 140 may utilize computing resources to submit and provide the content item, which may delay the rendering of the action data structure. Presenting a sponsored or supplemental content item before an action data structure may provide a poor user experience or result in a poor user interface relative to providing the action data structure first or concurrently with the content item. For example, to provide an improved user experience, the data processing system 102 may provide both the action data structure and the supplemental content item simultaneously (e.g., within 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 seconds). Another technical challenge includes sending multiple transmissions to the computing device 140, or executing multiple remote procedure calls. Sending the action data structure in one transmission and the content item in a second transmission may result in redundancy or inefficiency in the network, and the computing device 140 or local digital assistant 142 must receive and process multiple transmissions.
Thus, the present technical solution includes a transfer controller component 116 designed, constructed and operative to receive action data structures and content items and control delivery or transfer to reduce network utilization, power consumption or processor utilization while improving the user interface and user experience of the computing device 140. The server digital assistant component 104 can include, access, interface with, or otherwise communicate with the transmission controller component 116. The transmit controller component 116 may be part of the server digital assistant component 104. To address one or more technical challenges resulting from transferring the action data structure and the content item, the transfer controller component 116 can control the transfer of the action data structure or the content item.
For example, the transmission controller component 116 may receive both the action data structure and the supplemental content item. The transmit controller component 116 may receive the action data structure from the direct action API 110. The transmission controller component 116 can receive supplemental content items from the content selector component 120. The transfer controller component 116 can determine that the content item is not transferred prior to the action data structure. The transfer controller component 116 can determine that the content item is not transferred in a transfer separate from the action data structure. Instead, for example, the transmission controller component 116 may determine to combine the action data structure with the content item to generate a combined data package. The transmit controller component 116 may transmit the combined data packet as a set of data packets to the computing device 140 via the network 105 in one transmission. By generating a combined data package to be transmitted to the computing device 140, the transmission controller component 116 can improve a user interface or user experience by facilitating the computing device 140 to concurrently present the content item and the action data structure. By generating the combined data packets, the transmission controller component 116 can reduce the number of separate transmissions to the computing device 140 via the network 105, thereby increasing network transmission efficiency. Furthermore, a single transmission may also improve network security compared to multiple transmissions. Thus, the transmission controller component 116 may be configured with a policy that waits for a transmission action data structure or content item until both are received, and then generates a combined data package for transmission to the computing device 140.
The combined data packet may comprise a data packet with a header and the payload may comprise both the action data structure and the content item. The combined data package may include instructions on how the computing device 140 provides the action data structure and the content item. For example, the combined data package may include instructions for the local digital assistant 142 that cause the local digital assistant 142 to provide the action data structure in a first GUI slot generated by the local digital assistant 142 for the action data structure and to provide the supplemental or sponsored content item in a second GUI slot generated by the local digital assistant 142 for the content item.
In some cases, the transmission controller 116 may transmit the action data structure and the content item in separate data transmissions, but add delay or buffering in the transmission to reduce the delay between transmission of the action data structure and transmission of the content item. For example, if the transfer controller component 116 receives a content item from the content selector component 120 before receiving an action data structure from the direct action API 110, the transfer controller component 116 may add a delay or buffer to the content item transfer. The transmission controller component 116 may be preconfigured with a buffer or delay, such as 0.01 seconds, 0.02 seconds, 0.05 seconds, 0.1 seconds, or other time interval that facilitates reducing a delay or time difference between transmission of the content item and transmission of the action data structure. The transmission controller component 116 may automatically determine the buffering or delay based on historical execution of the content selector component 120 and the direct action API 110. For example, in contrast to the direct action API 110 generating an action data structure responsive to a voice input, the transmission controller component 116 may determine that the content selector component 120 is on average 0.1 seconds faster in selecting a sponsored content item via a real-time content selection process. The transmission controller component 116 may add a 0.1 second buffer or delay to the transmission of the sponsored content item to reduce the time difference between the transmission of the action data structure and the transmission of the content item.
In some cases, the transfer controller component 116 can wait to transfer the content item until an action data structure has been generated. The transfer controller component 116 may transfer the action data structure and the content item separately in separate transfers, but reorder the transfers such that the action data structure is transferred before the content item.
The transfer controller component 116 can transfer the content item without waiting to receive the action data structure. The local digital assistant 142 may be configured to wait to submit or provide the content item until the local digital assistant 142 receives the action data structure. The transfer controller component 116 can transfer with the instructional content item to instruct the local digital assistant 142 not to submit the content item upon receipt of the content item, but to wait until the action data structure is generated and transferred so that the local digital assistant 142 can submit or provide the action data structure before or concurrently with the content item.
Thus, for example, the server digital assistant component 104 can send a request to the content selector component 120 to select supplemental content in a manner that overlaps with the generation of an action data structure in response to a speech input. The server digital assistant component 104 can send the request while the server digital assistant component 104 is still generating the action data structure. For example, the query generator component 112 may generate content selection criteria and requests for content before the direct action API 110 has completed generating the action data structure. The query generator component 112 may continue to send requests for content and the generated content selection criteria in a manner that overlaps with the generation of action data structures by the direct action API 110. The query generator component 112 can continue to send requests for content without waiting for the direct action API 110 to generate an action data structure. The server digital assistant component 104 can receive supplemental content items from the content selector component 120 before the direct action API 110 generates the action data structure. The transmission controller component 116 can determine to delay delivery or transmission of the supplemental content item to the computing device 140 until generation of the action data structure is complete. The transmission controller component 116 may provide the action data structure and the supplemental content item to the computing device for presentation in response to generation of the action data structure.
If the query generator component 112 sends a request to the content selector component 120 to select supplemental content in a manner that overlaps with the generation of the action data structure, the transmission controller component 116 can receive the selected supplemental content item from the content selector component 120 prior to the direct action API 110 generating the action data structure. The transmission controller component 116 can instruct the computing device 140 to provide the supplemental content item in the second graphical user interface slot in response to rendering the action data structure in the first graphical user interface slot. For example, the transfer controller component 116 can independently transfer the supplemental content item upon receiving the supplemental content item from the content selector component 120, but include instructions that cause the local digital assistant 142 to present the supplemental content item only in the second GUI slot in response to, subsequent to, or concurrent with presenting the action data structure in the first GUI slot.
The data processing system 102 can include a content selector component 120 designed, constructed or operative to select supplemental content items (or sponsored content items or digital component objects). To select sponsored content items or digital components, the content selector component 120 may use the generated content selection criteria to select matching sponsored content items based on broad matches (broadcast matches), exact matches, or phrase matches (phrase matches). For example, the content selector component 120 can analyze, parse, or otherwise process the subject matter of the candidate sponsored content item to determine whether the subject matter of the candidate sponsored content item corresponds to the subject matter of the keyword or phrase of the content selection criteria generated by the query generator component 112. The content selector component 120 can use image processing techniques, character recognition techniques, natural language processing techniques, or database lookups to identify, analyze, or recognize speech, audio, terms, characters, text, symbols, or images of candidate number components. The candidate sponsored content item may include metadata indicating the subject matter of the candidate digital component, in which case the content selector component 120 may process the metadata to determine whether the subject matter of the candidate digital component corresponds to the input audio signal. The content action provided by the supplemental digital content provider device 152 may include content selection criteria that the data processing system 102 may match with criteria indicated in the second profile tier or the first profile tier.
The content provider 152 may provide an additional indicator when setting up a content action (content campaign) that includes a digital component. The supplemental digital content provider device 152 may provide information at the content action or content group level that the content selector component 120 may identify by performing a lookup using information about candidate digital components. For example, the candidate digital component may include a unique identifier, which may map to a content group, a content action, or a content provider. The content selector component 120 can determine information about the supplemental digital content provider device 152 based on information in the content data 126 stored in the data repository 124.
In response to the request, the content selector component 120 can select a digital component object from the data repository 124 or a database associated with the supplemental digital content provider device 152. The supplemental digital content may be provided by a supplemental digital content provider device different from the service provider device 154. The supplemental digital content may correspond to a service type other than the service type of the action data structure (e.g., taxi service versus meal delivery service). The computing device 140 may interact with the supplemental digital content. Computing device 140 may receive audio responsive to the digital component. The computing device 140 may receive an indication of a selection of a hyperlink or other button associated with the digital component object, cause or allow the computing device 140 to identify the supplemental digital content provider device 152 or the service provider device 154, request a service from the supplemental digital content provider device 152 or the service provider device 154, instruct the supplemental digital content provider device 152 or the service provider device 154 to perform the service, send information to the supplemental digital content provider device 152 or the service provider device 154, or query the supplemental digital content provider device 152 or the service provider device 154.
The supplemental digital content provider device 152 may establish an electronic content action. The electronic content action may be stored as content data 126 in the data repository 124. An electronic content action may refer to one or more groups of content that correspond to a common subject matter. The content action may include a hierarchical data structure including content groups, digital component data objects, and content selection criteria provided by a content provider. The content selection criteria provided by the content provider device 152 can be compared to the content selection criteria generated by the query generator component 112 to identify matching supplemental content items for transmission to the computing device 140. The content selection criteria provided by the content provider device 152 may include a type of content, such as a digital assistant content type, a search content type, a streaming video content type, a streamlined audio content type, or a contextual content type. To create the content action, the supplemental digital content provider device 152 may specify a value for an action level parameter of the content action. Action level parameters may include, for example, action name, preferred content network for placing digital component objects, value of resources to be used for content actions (values of resources), start and end dates of content actions, duration of content actions, schedule of digital component object placement, language, geographic location, type of computing device on which the digital component object is provided. In some cases, an impression (impression) may refer to when a digital component object is taken from its source (e.g., data processing system 102 or supplemental digital content provider device 152) and is countable. In some cases, robot activity may be filtered and excluded as an impression due to the likelihood of click fraud. Thus, in some cases, an impression may refer to a measure of the response of a web server to a page request from a browser, filtered from robot activity and error codes, and recorded at a point as close as possible to an opportunity to submit a digital component object for display on computing device 140. In some cases, an impression may refer to a visible or audible impression; for example, the digital component objects are at least partially (e.g., 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or more) visible on a display device 150 of the client computing device 140 or audible via a speaker (e.g., transducer 146) of the computing device 140. Clicking or selecting may refer to user interaction with a digital component object, such as voice, mouse click, touch interaction, gesture, shaking, audio interaction, or keyboard click in response to an audible impression. Conversion may refer to a user taking a desired action on a digital component object; such as purchasing a product or service, completing a survey, visiting a brick and mortar store corresponding to the digital component, or completing an electronic transaction.
The supplemental digital content provider device 152 may further establish one or more content groups for the content action. The content group includes one or more digital component objects and corresponding content selection criteria, such as keywords, words, terms, phrases, geographic locations, type of computing device, time of day, interests, topics, or vertical content (vertical). Content groups under the same content action may share the same action level parameters, but may have customized specifications for particular content group level parameters, such as keywords, negative keywords (e.g., preventing placement of numeric components if negative keywords are present on the primary content), bids for keywords, or parameters associated with a bid or content action.
To create a new content group, the content provider may provide a value for a content group level parameter for the content group. Content group level parameters include, for example, a content group name or content group subject (the me), and bids or results (e.g., clicks, impressions, or conversions) for different content placement opportunities (e.g., automatic placement or managed placement). The content group name or content group topic may be one or more terms that the supplemental digital content provider device 152 may use to grab the topic or subject matter for which the digital component objects of the content group were selected for display. For example, an automobile dealer may create a different content set for each brand of vehicle that it is acting on, and may further create a different content set for each model of vehicle that it is acting on. Examples of content set themes that may be used by an automobile dealer include, for example, "vendor a sports car", "vendor B sports car", "vendor C truck", "vendor C hybrid car" or "vendor D hybrid car". For example, an example content action topic may be "hybrid cars" and include a content set for both "vendor C hybrid cars" and "vendor D hybrid cars".
The supplemental digital content provider device 152 may provide one or more keywords and digital component objects to each content group. The keywords may include terms related to the product or service associated with or identified by the digital component object. Keywords may include one or more terms or phrases. For example, an automobile dealer may include "sports car", "V-6 engine", "four wheel drive", "fuel efficiency" as keywords for a content group or content action. In some cases, the content provider may specify negative keywords to avoid, prevent, block, or disable content placement with respect to certain terms or keywords. The content provider may specify a match type, such as an exact match, a phrase match, or a broad match, for selecting the digital component object.
The supplemental digital content provider device 152 may provide one or more keywords for use by the data processing system 102 in selecting the digital component objects provided by the supplemental digital content provider device 152. The supplemental digital content provider device 152 can identify one or more keywords to bid on and further provide bid amounts for the various keywords. Supplemental digital content provider device 152 may provide additional content selection criteria that are used by data processing system 102 to select digital component objects. Multiple supplemental digital content provider devices 152 may bid on the same or different keywords, and the data processing system 102 may run a content selection process or an advertising auction in response to receiving an indication of the keywords of the electronic message.
The supplemental digital content provider device 152 may provide one or more digital component objects for selection by the data processing system 102. The data processing system 102 can select (e.g., via the content selector component 120) a digital component object when a content placement opportunity becomes available that matches resource allocation, content scheduling, highest bids, keywords, and other selection criteria specified for a content group. Different types of digital component objects (such as a voice digital component, an audio digital component, a text digital component, an image digital component, a video digital component, a multimedia digital component, a digital component link, or an assistant application component) may be included in the content set. The digital component object (or digital component, supplemental content item, or sponsored content item) may include, for example, a content item, an online document, audio, an image, a video, multimedia content, sponsored content, or an assistant application. After selecting the digital component, the data processing system 102 can transmit (e.g., via the transmission controller component 116) the digital component object for submission on the computing device 140 or a display device 150 of the computing device 140. The submission may include displaying the digital component on a display device, executing an application such as a chat robot or conversation robot, or playing the digital component via a speaker of the computing device 140. Data processing system 102 may provide instructions to computing device 140 to submit a digital component object. The data processing system 102 may instruct the computing device 140 or the audio driver 148 of the computing device 140 to generate an audio signal or sound wave.
The data processing system 102, upon receiving the supplemental content item from the supplemental digital content provider device 152, may pre-process or otherwise analyze the received content item to verify the content item for delivery and presentation. The data processing system 102 may analyze, evaluate, validate, or otherwise process the content item to identify errors, vulnerabilities, malicious code or characteristics, or quality issues. For example, to reduce wasted energy consumption, network bandwidth utilization, computing resource utilization, and latency, the data processing system 102 can include a verification component 118 designed, constructed, and operative to verify a supplemental content item before authorizing the supplemental content item for selection by the content selector component 120. Due to additional technical challenges presented by presenting supplemental content items in conjunction with the action data structure generated by the server digital assistant component 104, the data processing system 102 can verify content items based on content item type.
For example, the supplemental digital content provider device 152 may provide a supplemental digital content item. The supplemental digital content item may be tagged, labeled, or otherwise indicated for type. The type may be an assistant type content item. The data processing system 102 may access a content parameter data structure 130 stored in the data repository 124 that includes content parameters or quality signals established for assistant-type content. The content parameter may comprise, for example, a brightness level of the content item, a file size of the content item, a duration of the content item, a processor utilization of the content item, or other quality signal. The content parameters may include thresholds for brightness, file size, duration, or processor utilization. The validation component 118 can simulate submitting a received content item to measure brightness level, processor utilization, file size, duration, or other content parameters. The verification component 118 can compare the simulated measurements to thresholds stored in the content parameter data structure 130 to determine whether the content item satisfies the thresholds. Meeting the threshold may refer to or include the measured quality signal being less than or equal to the threshold.
For example, the verification component 118 can determine a perceived brightness of an image corresponding to the supplemental content item based on simulating the image or otherwise processing the image. The verification component 118 can compare the perceived brightness to a brightness threshold established for the assistant-type content item. The verification component 118 can reject the supplemental content item if the determined perceived brightness of the image is greater than the brightness threshold. In some cases, the verification component 118 may not reject the supplemental content item, but may remove a flag or indication that the supplemental content item qualifies as an assistant-type content item. The data processing system 102 can include an assistant type flag or remove an assistant type flag based on whether the content item satisfies a threshold.
Thus, the verification component 118 can increase or decrease the likelihood that a content item is selected by the content selector component 120 by weighting the content item, thereby helping to optimize performance of the system 100. If the verification component 118 verifies the content item based on the content parameters (e.g., the content item satisfies the content parameter threshold), the verification component 118 can indicate that the content item is valid. A valid content item may refer to a content item marked as assistant-type and the verification component indicates that the content item satisfies the content parameters of the assistant-type content item.
The content selector component 120 can select content items based on content selection criteria. For example, if the content selection criteria generated by the query generator component 112 includes assistant-type content, the verification assistant content type can be weighted more heavily than content items that are not assistant-type. Thus, when the content selection criteria include assistant-type content, the assistant-type content item can have a higher likelihood of being selected by the content selector component 120. The digital assistant content type may define attributes of the content item (e.g., content parameters such as brightness level).
For example, the content selector component 120 can perform a real-time content selection process in response to a request from the query generator component 112 or receive content selection criteria from the query generator component 112. Real-time content selection may refer to or include performing content selection in response to a request. Real-time may refer to or include selecting content within 0.2 seconds, 0.3 seconds, 0.4 seconds, 0.5 seconds, 0.6 seconds, or 1 second of receiving the request. Real-time may refer to selecting content in response to receiving an input audio signal from the computing device 140.
The content selector component 120 can identify a plurality of candidate supplemental content items corresponding to a digital assistant content type. The content selector component 120 can use the content selection criteria to identify candidate supplemental content items that match the digital assistant content type and one or more keywords generated by the query generator component 112 for the content selection criteria. The content selector component 120 can determine a score or rank for each of a plurality of candidate supplemental content items to select the highest ranked supplemental content item to provide to the computing device 140. The content selector component 120 can select supplemental content items that have been verified as being of the digital assistant type.
In some cases, the content selector component 120 can weight different content types differently. The content selector component 120 can apply a higher weight to content types that match the content type indicated in the content selection criteria generated by the query builder component 112. The query generator component 112 can generate content selection criteria that include a desired content type or an optimal content type. In some cases, the query generator component 112 may require that the selected content items match a desired content type, while in other cases, the query generator component 112 may indicate an increase in the likelihood that content items having a matching content type are selected. For example, the content selector component 120 can identify a first plurality of candidate supplemental content items corresponding to a digital assistant content type based on one or more keywords. The content selector component 120 can identify a second plurality of candidate supplemental content items having a second content type different from the digital assistant content type based on the one or more keywords. The content selector component 120 can increase the weight of the first plurality of candidate supplemental content items to increase the likelihood of selecting one of the first plurality of candidate supplemental content items relative to selecting one of the second plurality of candidate supplemental content items. The content selector component 120 can then determine an overall score for each of the first plurality of content items and the second plurality of content items, wherein the score for the first plurality of content items increases based on the weight. The content selector component 120 can select a highest ranked or highest scoring content item, which can be one of the first plurality of content items or one of the second plurality of content items. Thus, the content selector component 120 can select one of the second plurality of content items having a content type different from the digital assistant type, even if the digital assistant content is weighted more heavily.
The content selector component 120 can receive one or more supplemental content items from a third-party content provider (e.g., supplemental digital content provider device 152). For one or more of the supplemental content items, the content selector component 120 can receive an indication from the third-party content provider indicating that the one or more supplemental content items correspond to a digital assistant content type. The content selector component 120 can invoke the verification component 118 to identify content parameters for a digital assistant content type. The verification component 118 can perform a verification process on the one or more supplemental content items in response to the indication of the digital assistant content type to identify one or more valid supplemental content items that satisfy the content parameters established for the digital assistant content type. The content selector component 120 can select a supplemental content item from one or more available supplemental content items.
FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example user interface with a slot according to one implementation. The user interface 200 may be provided by the computing device 140. User interface 200 may be provided via one or more systems or components of system 100, including, for example, a data processing system, a server digital assistant, or a local digital assistant. The user interface 200 may be output by a display device communicatively coupled to the computing device 140. The user interface 200 may include a home screen 222 (e.g., a main screen, a start screen, or a default screen). The home screen 222 may include one or more applications, such as App _ A214, app _ B216, app _ C218, or App _ D220. Applications 214-220 may refer to a telephony application, a web browser, a contact, a calculator, a text messaging application, or other application.
The user may provide voice input or input audio signals via the home screen 222. The user may invoke the digital assistant and provide voice input. When the local digital assistant is invoked, the computing device 140 may provide an indication that the local digital assistant is active or invoked. The indication may include, for example, a microphone icon 212. In some cases, selecting the microphone icon 212 may invoke a digital assistant.
The user may provide a voice input, such as a query. For example, the query may be "work near me". The local digital assistant may display a text box 210 with a voice input query for "work near me". The local digital assistant may send the data packet, the input audio signal, or the voice input query to the server digital assistant for further processing. The server digital assistant, upon receiving an input audio signal or a voice input query, may generate an action data structure responsive to the voice input query. The action data structure may include search results, work in the vicinity of the computing device. The server digital assistant can provide the action data structure to the computing device with instructions to submit or provide the action data structure in the second GUI socket 204. The data processing system may provide instructions to the local digital assistant to establish the second GUI slot 204 in accordance with one or more attributes associated with the computing device 140 or the action data structure.
The data processing system, upon receiving the voice input query, may generate content selection criteria and request supplemental content. The data processing system can generate content selection criteria based on the voice input query. The data processing system may select sponsored or supplemental content. The data processing system may transmit the sponsored content for provision via the user interface 200. For example, the data processing system may provide instructions to the local digital assistant to generate the first GUI slot 202 in which the sponsored content item 208 is provided. The first GUI slot 202 may be built or injected on the home screen 222. The first GUI slot 202 may be separate or independent from the second GUI slot 204 in which the motion data structure is provided.
One or more actions 206 may be utilized to establish the first GUI slot 202. Action 206 may include, for example, locking (pin), moving, resizing, hiding, or minimizing. Locking may refer to locking the sponsored content item 208 or the first GUI slot 202 to the home screen such that the sponsored content item 208 stays on the home screen 222 of the user interface 200. Moving may refer to moving the first GUI slot 202 to another location or position on the home screen 222. For example, from the top of the home screen 222 to the middle or bottom of the home screen 222 or any other location on the home screen 222. Resizing may refer to changing the size of the first GUI slot 202. Resizing the first GUI slot 202 may cause the local digital assistant to resize the sponsored content item 208 presented via the first GUI slot 202. Hiding may refer to removing the first GUI slot 202 or making the first GUI slot 202 no longer visible via the home screen 222.
The local digital assistant can remember the action 206 selected by the user and update the properties or configuration of the first GUI slot 202 based on the selected action. For example, moving the first GUI slot 202 or resizing the first GUI slot 202 may result in the first GUI slot 202 being moved for a subsequent sponsored content item 208 provided in the first GUI slot 202. However, locking may refer to locking a particular sponsored content item 208. For example, sponsored content items 208 selected in response to a "work near me" voice-entered query may include advertisements for clothing retailers selling business packages. The user, upon seeing the sponsored content item 208, may determine to lock the sponsored content item 208 on the home screen 222.
FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example method of controlling delivery of supplemental content via a digital assistant according to one implementation. Method 300 may be performed by, for example, one or more of a computing device, a data processing system, a local digital assistant, or a server digital assistant. At act 302, method 300 may include receiving a speech input. The data processing system may receive data packets that include voice input or input audio signals. The voice input may include a voice input query provided by a user or other speaker and detected by a microphone of a computing device, such as a smartphone or tablet computing device.
In act 304, the data processing system may process the speech input to generate an action data structure. A data processing system (e.g., a direct action API) may use natural language processing techniques to process or parse speech input and generate action data structures. The action data structure may be a response to a voice input.
At act 306, the data processing system may generate content selection criteria. The data processing system may generate content selection criteria based on the speech input. The data processing system may generate content selection criteria based on keywords in the speech input. The data processing system may generate content selection criteria based on profile or account information associated with the computing device that detected the voice input. The data processing system may generate content selection criteria that includes one or more keywords. The content selection criteria may include or indicate a content type, such as a digital assistant content type.
The data processing system can generate a request for content and send the request for content to the content selector component along with the content selection criteria. The data processing system may include a content selector component. The data processing system may select the supplemental content item based on the content selection criteria. The data processing system may select the content item using a real-time content selection process. The data processing system may select the content item using an online auction. The sponsored or supplemental content item selected by the data processing system may be different from the action data structure generated by the content item. The action data structure may be generated in response to a voice input. The supplemental content items may be selected using an online auction-based system in which third-party content providers may bid on the supplemental content items to win the auction.
At act 310, the data processing system may receive the selected supplemental content item. The data processing system can receive a supplemental content item from the content selector component. In some cases, the data processing system may receive the supplemental content item before the data processing system generates the action data structure. For example, the hardware or computing infrastructure that selects the supplemental content item may select the supplemental content item before the direct action API generates the action data structure.
At decision block 312, the data processing system may determine whether to control the transfer. Controlling the transfer may refer to or include adding buffering, combining the action data structure and the supplemental content item, or otherwise controlling how the action data structure and the content item are provided relative to each other. The data processing system may determine to control the transmission based on a policy or rule. For example, if the data processing system receives a supplemental content item before generating the action data structure, the data processing system may determine to control the transmission. The data processing system may determine to control the transmission if an amount of time the data processing system historically received the content item before the action data structure is greater than a threshold. The data processing system may determine to control the transmission to reduce energy consumption, network bandwidth utilization, or computing resource utilization. For example, if the computing device has limited battery resources or is on a network with limited bandwidth, the data processing system may determine to control the transmission to reduce network bandwidth utilization or battery energy utilization.
If the data processing system determines to control the transmission, the data processing system may proceed to act 314 to execute a transmission control protocol. The data processing system may determine to buffer or otherwise delay transmission of the content item to transmit the action data structure prior to or concurrently with the content item. For example, if the data processing system takes 0.4 seconds to generate the action data structure, but receives the supplemental content item within 0.1 seconds, the data processing system may add a buffer or delay of 0.3 seconds to the content item transmission so that the action data structure and the supplemental content item are simultaneously transmitted to the computing device for presentation.
The data processing system may control the transmission by providing instructions to the computing device to render the content item after rendering the action data structure. The data processing system may provide instructions to the computing device to present the content item while presenting the action data structure. Thus, the data processing system may control the presentation or submission of the action data structure and the supplemental content item with respect to each other.
The data processing system may control the transmission by combining the action data structure and the supplemental content item. The data processing system may generate a data package including a combination of the action data structure and the supplemental content item. The combined data package may include instructions that cause the computing device to submit the action data structure in a different GUI slot than the supplemental content item.
However, if the data processing system determines not to control the transfer, the data processing system may proceed to acts 316 and 318 to transfer the supplemental content item and the action data structure to the computing device for presentation. The data processing system may transmit the supplemental content item in act 318 and the action data structure in act 316 in accordance with the transmission control policy (if selected).
FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example method of verifying supplemental content based on content type according to one implementation. Method 400 may be performed by one or more systems or components depicted in diagram 100, including, for example, a data processing system, a content selector component, or a verification component. At act 402, method 400 may include receiving a supplemental content item from a content provider. The content provider may be a third party content provider that provides sponsored content. The data processing system can receive supplemental content or sponsored content as part of a content action. The data processing system may provide a user interface to allow a content provider to deliver a content item. The data processing system may provide an action building user interface or graphical user interface in which a content provider may upload or otherwise communicate electronic files containing supplemental or sponsored content items.
At act 404, the data processing system may identify a content type. The content provider may indicate a content type of each of the content items uploaded to the data processing system. The content type may indicate where the content item may be provided. For example, the content type may include digital assistant, search, contextual, streaming video, or streaming audio. Different content types may be optimized or preferred for different digital media. For example, the search content may include plain text content. Contextual content may include text and images. Streaming audio content can only include audio. Streaming video content may include both audio and video content. For example, digital assistant content may include text, images, audio, video, or assistant applications.
Different types of content may include different content parameters. The content parameter may refer to a duration of the content, a brightness level of the content, a file size of the content, or a processor utilization of the content. For example, the content parameters of digital assistant content configured for a home screen on a mobile device may include a lower brightness level threshold compared to contextual content that would be provided on a desktop computing device, for example.
At act 406, the data processing system may generate a quality signal value for the supplemental content item. The data processing system may simulate the provision or submission of supplemental content items to generate a quality signal. The data processing system may evaluate the supplemental content item to determine a value of the quality signal. The quality signal may include brightness level, file size, duration, audio level, processor utilization, or other quality signals. The data processing system may determine a brightness level, a file size, a duration, or a processor utilization of a supplemental content item provided by a third-party content provider.
In act 408, the data processing system may compare the generated quality signal value to a threshold established for the content type indicated by the content provider. For example, if the content provider indicates that the supplemental content item is of a digital assistant type, the data processing system may retrieve a brightness level threshold for the digital assistant content type and compare the quality signal value for the brightness level to the threshold. The data processing system may compare each quality signal value to a threshold value for the corresponding content type.
At decision block 410, the data processing system may determine whether the supplemental content item is valid. Validity may refer to whether the quality signal value of the content item meets a threshold for the content type. If the data processing system determines at decision block 410 that the content item is valid, the data processing system may proceed to act 414 to validate the content item for the content type. If, however, the data processing system determines at decision block 410 that the supplemental content item is not valid, the data processing system may proceed to act 412 to change the content type flag.
If the generated quality signal value is greater than the threshold, the data processing system may determine to reject the supplemental content item. The data processing system may remove the supplemental content item from the content data repository. In some cases, the data processing system may determine to change the content type flag; for example, if the remaining quality signal value satisfies the other content type, the content type is changed to search content instead of digital assistant content.
Fig. 5 is a block diagram of an example computer system 500. Computer system or computing device 500 may include or be used to implement system 100 or components thereof, such as data processing system 102. The data processing system 102 may include an intelligent personal assistant or a voice-based digital assistant. Computing system 500 includes a bus 505 or other communication component for communicating information, and a processor 510 or processing circuit coupled to bus 505 for processing information. Computing system 500 can also include one or more processors 510 or processing circuits coupled to the bus for processing information. Computing system 500 also includes main memory 515, such as a Random Access Memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 505 for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor 510. The main memory 515 may be or include a data repository 124. Main memory 515 also may be used for storing location information, temporary variables, or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor 510. Computing system 500 may also include a Read Only Memory (ROM) 520 or other static storage device coupled to bus 505 for storing static information and instructions for processor 510. A storage device 525, such as a solid state device, magnetic disk or optical disk, may be coupled to bus 505 for persistently storing information and instructions. The storage device 525 may include or be part of the data repository 124.
The processes, systems, and methods described herein may be implemented by the computing system 500 in response to the processor 510 executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory 515. Such instructions may be read into main memory 515 from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device 525. Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory 515 causes the computing system 500 to perform the illustrative processes described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory 515. Hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions and the systems and methods described herein. The systems and methods described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
Although an example computing system has been described in fig. 5, the subject matter including the operations described in this specification can be implemented in other types of digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
Where the systems discussed herein collect or may make use of personal information of a user, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control programs or functions that may collect personal information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, user preferences, or user location) or to control whether or how content more relevant to the user is received from a content server or other data processing system. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, to remove identifiable personal information when generating parameters. For example, the identity of the user may be anonymized such that no identifiable personal information of the user can be determined, or the geographic location of the user may be generalized to a location from which location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), such that no particular location of the user can be determined. Thus, the user can control how the content server collects and uses information about him or her.
The subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs (e.g., one or more circuits of computer program instructions) encoded on one or more computer storage media for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or additionally, the program instructions may be encoded on a manually-generated propagated signal (e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal) that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by the data processing apparatus. The computer storage media may be or be embodied in a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Although a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium may also be or be included in one or more separate components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices). The operations described in this specification may be implemented as operations performed by data processing apparatus on data stored on one or more computer-readable storage devices or received from other sources.
The terms "data processing system", "computing device", "component", or "data processing apparatus" encompass various devices, apparatus, and machines for processing data, including for example, programmable processors, computers, systems on a chip, or a plurality or combination of the foregoing. An apparatus may comprise special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). The apparatus can include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, a cross-platform runtime environment, a virtual machine, or a combination of one or more of them. The apparatus and execution environment may implement a variety of different computing model infrastructures, such as web services, distributed computing and grid computing infrastructures. For example, the direct action API 110, the content selector component 120, or the NLP component 108 and other data processing system 102 components may include or share one or more data processing apparatuses, systems, computing devices, or processors.
A computer program (also known as a program, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. The computer program may correspond to a file in a file system. A computer program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs (e.g., components of data processing system 102) to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks or removable disks; a magneto-optical disk; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
The subject matter described herein can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front-end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described herein), or a combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network ("LAN") and a wide area network ("WAN"), an internetwork (e.g., the Internet), and a peer-to-peer network (e.g., an ad hoc peer-to-peer network).
A computing system, such as system 100 or system 500, may include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network, such as network 105. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, the server transmits data (e.g., data packets representing the digital components) to the client device (e.g., to display data to and receive user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) may be received at the server from the client device (e.g., received by the data processing system 102 from the local computing device 140 or the supplemental digital content provider device 152 or the service provider device 154).
Although operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, such operations are not required to be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, and not all illustrated operations are required to be performed. The actions described herein may be performed in a different order.
The separation of various system components does not require separation in all implementations, and the program components may be included in a single hardware or software product. For example, the NLP component 108 or the direct action API 110 may be a single component, application, or program, or a logical device having one or more processing circuits, or part of one or more servers of the data processing system 102.
