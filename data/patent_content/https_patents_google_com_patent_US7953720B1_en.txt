Definitions
- the disclosed embodiments relate generally to queries for facts, and more particularly, to selection of a best answer to a factual query.
- Web search engines may be unhelpful to users in this regard, as they generally do not provide a simple, succinct answer to factual queries such as the ones described above. Rather, Web search engines provide a list of Web pages that are determined to match the query to the user, and the user has to sort through the matching Web pages to find the answer.
- search engines draw their facts from a single source, such as a particular encyclopedia. This limits the types of questions that these engines can answer. For instance, a search engine based on an encyclopedia is unlikely to be able to answer many questions concerning popular culture, such as questions about movies, songs or the like, and is also unlikely to be able to answer many questions about products, services, retail and wholesale businesses and so on. If the set of sources used by such a search engine were to be expanded, however, such expansion might introduce the possibility of multiple possible answers to a factual query, some of which might be contradictory or ambiguous. Furthermore, as the universe of sources expands, information may be drawn from untrustworthy sources or sources of unknown reliability.
- a method for selecting an answer to a factual query includes receiving a factual query; searching a fact repository to identify one or more possible answers to the factual query; determining for at least a subset of the possible answers a respective score; identifying a first answer of the possible answers with a best score; and generating a response including the first answer if the best score satisfies a first condition and satisfies a second condition with respect to the score of a second answer of the possible answers.
- a method for selecting an answer to a factual query includes receiving a factual query; identifying one or more possible answers to the factual query; determining for each of the possible answers a respective score; identifying first answers of the possible answers with best scores; for each of the first answers, identifying second answers of the possible answers that support the respective first answer and determining a supported score based on the score of the respective first answer and the scores of the second answers; identifying a third answer of the first answers with a best supported score; and generating a response including the third answer if the best supported score satisfies a first condition.

- FIG. 8 illustrates a system for selecting an answer to a factual query and displaying the answer and a list of sources of the answer, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- a query engine can store factual information gathered from many disparate sources and return answers in response to queries for factual information (or “factual queries”) from a user. Gathering information from many sources expands the scope of available factual information for the query engine, but also introduces the possibility of multiple possible answers.
- the query engine may identify possible answers and select a best answer from the possible answers to present to the user, or it may determine that none of the possible answers are presentable to the user.
- the query engine may also provide a list of sources of the answer, including portions of text from each source. The portion or portions of text is called a snippet and may include terms of the factual query and terms of the answer. While a snippet shows the answer identified or selected by the search engine, the list of sources provide the user with the basis for the answer and may aid the user in evaluating the veracity of the answer.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a network 100 , according to some embodiments of the invention.
- Network 100 includes a one or more clients 102 and a query engine 106 .
- a client 102 may include a client application (not shown).
- the network 100 also includes one or more communication networks 104 that couple these components.
- the client application provides a user (not shown) of client 102 an interface to the query engine 106 .
- the user can submit searches for documents (for example, Web searches) and factual queries to the query engine 106 and view responses from the query engine 106 .
- the client application may include web browsers. Examples of web browsers include FIREFOX, INTERNET EXPLORER, and OPERA.
- the query engine 106 provides a platform for storing factual information and responding to factual queries, as well as handling other types of searches.
- the query engine 106 can handle searches for documents, such as Web searches, and queries for factual information.
- the query engine 106 includes a query server 108 .
- the query server 108 provides a front-end to the query engine 106 .
- the query server 108 receives queries from the client 102 , directs queries to components of the query engine 106 that handle factual queries and other searches, generates responses, and transmits responses to the client 102 .
- the query server 108 may be distributed over multiple computers. In other embodiments, more or fewer functions may be handled by the query engine. For instance, in other embodiments response generation may be handled elsewhere in the query engine 106 .
- the query engine 106 includes a first search controller 110 , a first cache 112 , a document index 114 , and a document database 116 for handling document searches.
- these components may be deployed over multiple computers in order to provide fast access to a large number of documents.
- the document database 116 may be deployed over N servers, with a mapping function such as the “modulo N” function being used to determine which documents are stored in each of the N servers.
- N may be an integer greater than 1, for instance an integer between 2 and 8196.
- the document index 114 may be distributed over multiple servers, and the first cache 112 may also be distributed over multiple servers.
- the first search controller 110 may also be distributed over multiple computers.
- the first search controller 110 is coupled to the query server 108 .
- the first search controller 110 is also coupled to the first cache 112 , the document index 114 and the document database 116 .
- the first search controller 110 may be configured to receive document search queries from the query server 108 and transmit the queries to the first cache 112 , the document index 114 , and the document database 116 .
- the first cache 112 may be used to increase search efficiency by temporarily storing previously located search results.
- the first search controller 110 receives the document search results from the first cache 112 and/or the document index 114 and constructs an ordered search result list. The first search controller 110 then returns a list of located documents back to the query server 108 for onward transmittal to the client 102 .
- the document search results received by the first search controller 110 from the first cache 112 and/or the document index 114 may be accompanied by snippets of the located documents in the search results.
- the query engine 106 also includes a second search controller 118 , a second cache 120 , a fact index 122 , and a fact repository 124 .
- these components may be deployed over multiple computers in order to provider faster access to a large number of facts.
- the fact repository 124 may be deployed over N servers, with a mapping function such as the “modulo N” function being used to determine which facts are stored in each of the N servers.
- N may be an integer greater than 1, for instance an integer between 2 and 8196.
- the fact index 122 may be distributed over multiple servers
- the second cache 120 may also be distributed over multiple servers.
- the second search controller 118 may also be distributed over multiple computers.
- the second search controller 118 is coupled to the query server 108 .
- the second search controller 118 is also coupled to the second cache 120 , the fact index 122 and the fact repository 124 .
- the second search controller 118 may be configured to receive queries for answers to factual questions from the query server 108 and transmit the queries to the second cache 120 and to the fact repository 124 (via the fact index 122 ).
- the second cache 120 may be used to increase fact retrieval efficiency by temporarily storing previously located search results.
- the second search controller 118 receives facts that are possible answers to a factual query from the second cache 120 and/or the fact repository 124 .
- the second search controller 118 selects an answer from the possible answers as the best answer to present to the user. That answer is transmitted to the query server 108 , where a response including that answer is generated and transmitted to the client 102 for presentation to the user.
- the query server 108 may identify a list of sources associated with the answer and transmit the list of sources to the first search controller 110 .
- the first search controller 110 accesses documents that correspond to the sources and obtains snippets for at least a subset of the source documents from the document database 116 .
- the snippets include terms from the query and terms from the answer.
- the fact repository 124 stores factual information extracted from a plurality of documents.
- a document from which a particular fact may be extracted is a source document (or “source”) of that fact.
- Sources documents may include, without limitation, Web pages.
- entities, concepts, and the like for which the fact repository 124 may have factual information stored are represented by objects.
- An object may have one or more facts associated with it.
- Each object is a collection of facts; an object that has no facts associated with it (an empty object) may be viewed as a non-existent object within the fact repository 124 .
- each fact associated with the object is stored as an attribute-value pair.
- Each fact also includes a list of source documents that include the fact within their contents and from which the fact was extracted. Further details about objects and facts in the fact repository are described below, in relation to FIG. 2 .
- the second search controller 118 searches the fact index 122 for the terms in the search query or a query derived from a processing of the search query. This results in lists of fact repository locations (i.e., which correspond to facts or objects) that match the various terms in the search query. Using the logical structure of the search query (which may be considered to be a Boolean expression or tree), the second search controller 118 then forms logical combinations of these location lists to identify possible facts, if any, that match the search query.
- the fact index 122 provides one or more indexes to the fact repository 124 and facilitates efficient lookup of information in the fact repository 124 .
- the fact index 122 may include one or more indexes, each index indexing the fact repository 124 based on one or more parameters.
- the fact index 122 may have a first index (which may be called a main index or term index) that indexes unique terms to locations within the fact repository 124 .
- Another index that may optionally be included in the fact index 122 is an attribute index that maps attribute terms to locations within the fact repository 124 .
- Yet another index that may optionally be included in the fact index is an object name index that maps object name terms to objects in the fact repository 124 . Further details about the fact index 122 are described below, in relation to FIG. 3 .
- any of the components of the query engine 106 may be distributed over multiple computers, for convenience of explanation, we will discuss the components of the query engine 106 as though they were implemented on a single computer.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary data structure for an object within the fact repository 124 , according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the fact repository includes objects, each of which may include one or more facts.
- Each object 200 includes a unique identifier, such as the object ID 202 .
- the object 200 includes one or more facts 204 .
- Each fact 204 includes a unique identifier for that fact, such as a Fact ID 210 .
- Each fact 204 includes an attribute 212 and a value 214 .
- facts included in an object representing George Washington may include facts having attributes of “date of birth” and “date of death,” and the values of these facts would be the actual date of birth and date of death, respectively.
- a fact 204 may include a link 216 to another object, which is the object identifier, such as the object ID 202 of another object within the fact repository 124 .
- the link 216 allows objects to have facts whose values are other objects. For example, for an object “United States,” there may be a fact with the attribute “president” whose value is “George W. Bush,” with “George W. Bush” being another object in the fact repository 124 .
- the value field 214 stores the name of the linked object and the link 216 stores the object identifier of the linked object.
- Each fact 204 also may include one or more metrics 218 .
- the metrics may provide indications of the quality of the fact.
- the metrics include a confidence level and an importance level.
- the confidence level indicates the likelihood that the fact is correct.
- the importance level indicates the relevance of the fact to the object, compared to other facts for the same object. In other words, the importance level measures how vital a fact is to an understanding of the entity or concept represented by the object.
- Each fact 204 includes a list of sources 220 that include the fact and from which the fact was extracted.
- Each source may be identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), or Web address.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- some facts may include an agent field 222 that identifies the module that extracted the fact.
- the agent may be a specialized module that extracts facts from a specific source, or a module that extracts facts from free text in documents throughout the Web, and so forth.
- an object 200 may have one or more specialized facts, such as a name fact 206 and a property fact 208 .
- a name fact 206 is a fact that conveys a name for the entity or concept represented by the object 200 . For example, for an object representing the country Spain, there may be a fact conveying the name of the object as “Spain.”
- a name fact 206 being a special instance of a general fact 204 , includes the same parameters as any other fact 204 ; it has an attribute, a value, a fact ID, metrics, sources, etc.
- the attribute 224 of a name fact 206 indicates that the fact is a name fact, and the value is the actual name.
- the name may be a string of text.
- An object 200 may have one or more name facts, as many entities or concepts can have more than one name.
- an object representing Spain may have name facts conveying the country's common name “Spain” and the official name “Kingdom of Spain.”
- an object representing the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may have name facts conveying the agency's acronyms “PTO” and “USPTO” and the official name “United States Patent and Trademark Office.”
- a property fact 208 is a fact that conveys a statement about the entity or concept represented by the object 200 that may be of interest. For example, for the object representing Spain, a property fact may convey that Spain is a country in Europe.
- a property fact 208 being a special instance of a general fact 204 , also includes the same parameters (such as attribute, value, fact ID, etc.) as other facts 204 .
- the attribute field 226 of a property fact 208 indicates that the fact is a property fact, and the value field is a string of text that conveys the statement of interest. For example, for the object representing Spain, the value of a property fact may be the text string “is a country in Europe.”
- An object 200 may have zero or more property facts.
- each object may have additional special facts aside from name facts and property facts, such as facts conveying a type or category (for example, person, place, movie, actor, etc.) for categorizing the entity or concept represented by the object.
- name facts and property facts such as facts conveying a type or category (for example, person, place, movie, actor, etc.) for categorizing the entity or concept represented by the object.
- an object's name(s) and/or properties are represented by special records that have a different format than the facts records 204 associated with the attribute-value pairs of an object.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary fact index, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the fact index 122 may index the fact repository based on one or more parameters.
- fact index 300 may be that index.
- the fact index 300 maps unique terms to facts, or to locations of information within the fact repository 124 .
- a term is a word (such as “Spain” or “George”) or number (such as “123” or “ ⁇ 9”).
- terms may also include terms that contain two or more words, such as “United States” or “birth date.”
- the fact index 300 includes multiple sets 303 of terms and associated term location records, and may optionally include an index header 302 with information about the index 300 (e.g., information about the size of the index, information about a mapping function used to locate the sets, etc.).
- an index header 302 with information about the index 300 (e.g., information about the size of the index, information about a mapping function used to locate the sets, etc.).
- Within each set 303 is a term 304 and one or more term location records 306 that identify the locations of each appearance of the term within the fact repository 124 .
- Each term location record has an object identifier 308 (identifying the object where the term appears), a fact identifier 310 (identifying the fact within the object), a fact field identifier 312 (identifying the field within the fact), and a token identifier 314 (identifying the token within the field).
- object identifier 308 identifying the object where the term appears
- fact identifier 310 identifying the fact within the object
- fact field identifier 312 identifying the field within the fact
- a token identifier 314 identifying the token within the field.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary list of possible answers to a factual query, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the second search controller 118 receives a list of one or more possible answers to a factual query from the second cache 120 , or from a search of the fact repository 124 , selects the best answer from the list of possible answers, and transmits the best answer to the query server 108 for further processing, further details of which are described below, in relation to FIGS. 5A-5C .
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary list of possible answers 400 .
- the list 400 includes one or more possible answers 403 . Each possible answer 403 has one or more fields.
- the object ID 404 identifies the object which included the fact that is a possible answer.
- the object name 406 identifies the name of the entity or concept represented by the object identified by the object ID 404 .
- the object name 406 may be the value of a name fact included in the object (see above discussion of object data structure).
- the fact attribute 408 identifies the attribute of the fact that is a possible answer.
- the fact value 410 identifies the value of the fact that is a possible answer.
- the answer field 412 identifies which of three fields—object name 406 , fact attribute 408 , or fact value 410 —has the actual answer that is responsive to the factual query (that is, the kind of answer the user is looking for).
- the QA type 414 identifies the type of question that is posed by the factual query (that is, the kind of question the user is asking and, by implication, the answer that is responsive to the kind of question being asked).
- the score 416 indicates a score for the possible answer.
- the score is a metric that attempts to measure the quality of the possible answer as an accurate and responsive answer.
- the fact query 418 is the internal query generated by the second search controller 118 that led to the identification of the possible answer as such.
- the fact query 418 is generated based on the user query (that is, the query as entered by the user at client 102 ). Further details about the QA type 414 , the score 416 , and the fact query 418 are described below, in relation to FIGS. 5A-5C .
- possible answers 403 may be represented by more or fewer fields of information.
- the list 400 includes a list header 402 that contains information applicable to the entire list 400 .
- the header 402 may include a copy of the user query, a pointer to the top entry of the list 400 , or other data structures for facilitating access to the items or records in the list 400 .
- FIGS. 5A-5C illustrates an exemplary process for selecting a best answer to a factual query and presenting that answer according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the answer to a factual query is the fact in the fact repository 124 that is identified as the best response to the factual query.
- the query engine 106 processes the query, identifies possible answers, selects the best answer, and generates a response that includes the answer.
- the query engine 106 may also generate a response that includes a list of sources of the answer.
- a query is received by the query engine 106 ( 502 ).
- the query was entered at the client 102 by the user and transmitted by the client 102 to the query engine 106 .
- the query includes one or more terms.
- the query as entered by the user is the user query.
- the user query is processed ( 504 ).
- the user query is transmitted to both the first search controller 110 and the second search controller 118 .
- the user query may also be treated as a search query for documents, such as a Web search, it may be transmitted to system components that handle such searches, such as the first search controller 110 . Searches for documents, such as Web searches, are well known in the art and need not be further described.
- the user query is also transmitted to the second search controller 118 .
- the user query after conversion to a canonical form (e.g., conversion to all lowercase and removal of extraneous whitespaces), may be used to access the second cache 120 for possible answers that are pre-scored (e.g., from a previous processing of the same query). If found, those answers are returned immediately.
- the user query is also parsed by a set of parsers and one or more question frames may be generated based on the parsing.
- a question frame represents a possible interpretation of the user query.
- a question frame includes a sequence of phrases or terms, with each phrase or term optionally constrained to match only a particular field.
- the question frame may also include weights associated with each of one or more QA types, the weights indicating which QA types the question frame favors.
- a weight may be a positive number from a predefined range, such as between 0 to 1, inclusive.
- the question frame(s) are used to generate one or more fact queries.
- the process of generating fact queries may include dropping (or making optional) “stopwords” (such as definite and indefinite articles and prepositions) and expanding words and/or phrases within the user query to include their respective synonyms or equivalents. For example, a phrase “birth date” may be expanded to include its synonyms “date of birth” and “birthday.”
- the fact query is a query internal to the query engine 106 and used to access the second cache 120 , and the fact repository 124 (via the fact index 122 ) for possible answers. Each of these fact queries may be used to access the fact repository 124 and the fact index 122 for possible answers.
- a user query may conceptually fit into one or more QA types.
- a QA type is a question-to-answer mapping that indicates what factual question is being asked by the user query and the kind of answer that is responsive to factual query.
- NA-V name and attribute to value
- AV-N attribute and value, or property
- N-PTN name to property, type, or name
- there may be additional specialized QA types to handle specific types of questions.
- these specialized QA types may be specialized instances of the general QA types.
- NA-V type the user (by entry of a user query) provides an object name and an attribute and wants to know the value of the corresponding attribute for the object with the given name.
- An example of a NA-V type query may be “what is the capital of Tru,” in which “Poland” is the object name and “capital” is the attribute of “Poland” for which the value is desired.
- the answer for this query would be the value of a fact, associated with the object with the name “Poland,” and having the attribute “capital.”
- the value of the fact with the “capital” attribute may be the string “Warsaw.”
- the value may also be the object identifier for an object with name “Warsaw,” in which case the name “Warsaw” may be substituted for the object identifier and returned as a possible answer.
- the user provides an attribute and a value (or a property, since properties are merely specialized attribute-value pairs, as described above) and wants a name that has the given value for the given attribute. In a sense, this is a “reverse lookup.”
- An example of an AV-N type query may be “which country has Warsaw as its capital,” in which case “capital” is the attribute and “Warsaw” is the value.
- a possible answer may be the name of the object with this attribute-value pair, namely “Poland.”
- N-PTN the user provides a name and wants a property or type or alternate name of the object associated with the given name.
- One example of the N-PTN type query may be “what is the NRA.”
- NRA is the name of the object for which the user wants a property, type or alternate name.
- One possible property answer for “NRA” is “a Second Amendment rights advocacy group.”
- a type answer, which conveys a categorization of the entity or concept represented by an object, for “NRA” may be “organization,” indicating that the NRA is an organization, as opposed to other types such as a person, book, movie, etc.
- An alternate name for “NRA” may be “National Rifle Association,” which is the official name of the entity represented by the object with an (acronym) name “NRA.”
- the fact query may include additional constraints.
- the fact query may specify that a certain term may only match in a particular field and not other fields.
- Another constraint may be that any possible answer must match a specific type (such as person, book, etc.).
- Such constraints may be generated based on constraints included in the question frame.
- the fact queries are used to access the fact repository 124 (via the fact index 122 ) ( 506 ).
- the possible answers are the facts that match the fact query or queries, and/or match the user query.
- the possible answers are scored ( 508 ). The score for a possible answer provides an indication of the quality of the possible answer as an accurate and responsive answer.
- the score of a possible answer is a multiplicative product of a plurality of factor values.
- one or more of the factor values may be normalized values between 0 and 1, inclusive.
- a scorer may be disabled for a particular possible answer if the QA type weight is 0 for the question frame (for a particular fact query) that led to the identification of the possible answer, because the weight is part of the multiplicative product that makes up the score and a weight of 0 yields a score of 0.
- the factors utilized by the answer scorer for each QA type may vary from one QA type to another.
- the scoring for any particular possible answer may be aborted if the score for that particular answer decreases below a predefined threshold. This may be an indication that the possible answer is of such poor quality that further scoring would be wasteful.
- the factors may be based on the QA type weight, metrics of the fact that matched the fact query (such as a confidence metric and an importance metric), the agent that extracted the matching fact, the degree to which a field in the fact was matched by the fact query, the degree to which particular fields in the fact match the fact query completely, and so forth. It should be appreciated that the factors described above are merely exemplary and that other factors may be included in addition to the ones described above and some of the factors described above may be omitted.
- the possible answers are gathered into a possible answer list, such as the possible answers list 400 described above, in relation to FIG. 4 .
- a possible answer list such as the possible answers list 400 described above, in relation to FIG. 4 .
- only a predefined number of top scoring answers are gathered into the possible answers list 400 .
- the possible answers list may include only the 100 highest scoring possible answers.
- further processing of the possible answers list 400 is handled by the second search controller 118 .
- a number of the highest scoring possible answers are identified from the possible answers list 400 ( 510 ).
- the number may be a predefined number that specifies how many top scoring answers will be further processed.
- a next top scoring answer is processed.
- the processing involves identifying supporting answers for the respective top scoring answer ( 514 ) and determining a supported score for the respective top scoring answer based on the score of the respective top scoring answer and the scores of its supporting answers ( 516 ). The identification of supporting answers is discussed in more detail below.
- the supported score is determined by converting each of the scores of the top scoring answer and its supporting answers to odds space values.
- a score s is converted to an odds space value x.
- the top scoring answer with the highest supported score (hereinafter “best supported answer”) is identified ( 518 ).
- the top scoring answer within the list of possible answers that is contradictory to the best supported answer is identified ( 520 ).
- a contradicting score C which is the supported score for that contradictory answer, is determined ( 522 ).
- the top scoring answer within the list of possible answers that is unrelated to the best supported answer is identified ( 524 ).
- a unrelated score U which is the supported score for that unrelated answer, is determined ( 526 ).
- Whether two possible answers are supporting, contradictory, or unrelated are based on comparisons of the fields of the two answers.
- Each answer's fields of interest namely the name, attribute, and value
- the inputs are the name and the attribute and the output is the value.
- the inputs are the attribute and the value and the output is the name.
- Two possible answers are compared by doing pair-wise comparisons of their input fields and their output fields. The comparison takes into account the type of data in the fields, that is, whether the data in the field is a string of words, a date, a number, and so forth.
- the source of the answer may also be considered.
- the result of a pair-wise field comparison is one of five classifications. They are:
- the actual determination of whether the fields are the same or not may differ by data type. For example, for numbers, if the numbers are small integers, then they must be exactly equal in order to be treated as the same. If the numbers are very large integers or floating point numbers, then they may be treated the same if they are within a certain percentage of each other.
- the supported score S of the best supported answer is compared to a predefined threshold T ( 528 ).
- the threshold T is a minimum score that the supported score S must reach if the best supported answer is to be considered further. If S is less than or equal to T ( 528 —no), then the processor(s) performing the processing shown in FIG. 5B (e.g., the second search controller 118 or the query engine 106 ) may generate a response indicating that the query engine 106 is unable to provide an answer ( 534 ). For example, the second search controller 118 may transmit a response to the query server 108 indicating that an answer is unavailable, and the query server 108 may generate and transmit a response to that effect to the client 102 for presentation to the user.
- the constant ⁇ represents the minimum S to C ratio that must be achieved in order for the best supported answer to be selected as the best answer to the factual query. In other words, S has to be at least ⁇ times the contradicting score C. If S is less than ⁇ C ( 530 —no), then the processor(s) performing the processing shown in FIG. 5B (e.g., the second search controller 118 or the query engine 106 ) may generate a response indicating that the query engine 106 is unable to provide an answer ( 534 ).
- S is equal to or greater than ⁇ C ( 530 —yes)
- another a check is made to see whether the supported score S of the best supported answer exceeds the best supported score U of an unrelated answer by at least a second predefined margin. In one embodiment, this check is made by comparing to the unrelated score U multiplied by a constant ⁇ ( 532 ).
- the constant ⁇ represents the minimum S to U ratio that must be achieve before the best supported answer may be selected as the best answer to the factual query. In other words, S has to be at least ⁇ times the unrelated score U. If S is less than ⁇ U ( 532 —no), then the processor(s) performing the processing shown in FIG.
- 5B (e.g., the second search controller 118 or the query engine 106 ) may generate a response indicating that the query engine 106 is unable to provide an answer ( 534 ). If S is equal to or greater than ⁇ U ( 532 —yes), then the best supported answer is selected as the answer to the factual query and further processed, further details of which are described below in relation to FIG. 5C .
- the comparison of S to T, ⁇ C, and ⁇ U represents, in some embodiments, a three-part test for determining if the best supported answer is the best answer to present to the user.
- the test may utilize sigmoid functions.
- y ⁇ ( x , k , s ) 1 1 + ( k x ) s
- the query server 108 After the best supported answer is selected as the best answer to the factual query, the query server 108 generates a response ( 536 ).
- the response may include the best supported answer.
- the response may include an identifier and/or a hyperlink (e.g., to a URL), for a source of the best supported answer.
- the response may also include a link that, when clicked upon by a user at client 102 , can generate a request for a list of the sources of the best supported answer.
- the response may also include the results of a document search, such as a Web search, based on the user query.

- the user may make that request by clicking on a link included in the response (as described above) that generates the request for the sources listing upon being clicked.
- the query engine 106 receives the request to list the sources of the answer ( 540 ).
- the sources of the answer are identified ( 542 ).
- the sources of the answer may be identified by looking up the sources 220 ( FIG. 2 ) of the answer fact in the fact repository 124 .
- a snippet generation request is sent to the first search controller, along with the list of sources, the user query, the fact query 418 that matched the answer, and the answer.
- the snippet generation request is submitted to the first cache 112 and/or the document database 116 .
- a subset of the list of sources may be selected by the first search controller 110 and submitted to the first cache 112 and/or the document database 116 for snippet retrieval or generation.
- the first cache 112 and/or the document database 116 or one or more processors to which the snippet generation request is submitted, generates a snippet for each of the listed sources ( 544 ).
- Each snippet may include one contiguous portion of text or a plurality of non-contiguous portions of text from the respective source. For a particular snippet, if the text portions chosen for inclusion in the snippet are not contiguous within the source, the portions may be separated by ellipses.
- Each snippet is generated such that it includes as many terms of the user query and/or the fact query and as many terms of the answer as possible.
- the source may be analyzed for the scatter of query and answer terms (that is, how scattered the query terms and answer terms are in the source document) to assist in the generation of the snippet.
- the text portion or portions that yield the least query term and answer term scatter are selected for inclusion in the snippet.
- a response that includes the snippets is generated ( 546 ).
- the response includes a list of sources and snippets of each source that includes the user/fact query terms and answer terms.

Abstract
Description
The converted values (i.e., the odds space conversions of the scores) are summed to generate to a value X, and that sum X is converted back to a probability space value to get the supported score S for the top scoring answer.
-
- not comparable: the fields have different data types (for example, strings of words vs. a date) and thus cannot be compared;
- not similar: the fields are of the same data type, but are not the same at all;
- somewhat similar: the fields have some similarity, but it is difficult to conclude if they may mean the same thing;
- very similar: the fields are nearly the same; and
- identical: the fields are exactly the same.
-
- Two answers are classified as “complementary” if the answers came from the same source. Answers that are complementary to an answer A are ignored;
- Two answers are classified as “may support” (i.e., an answer A “may support” an answer B), if the answers have the identical or very similar inputs but the outputs are only somewhat similar. An answer A that “may support” an answer B is also ignored;
- Two answers are classified as “supporting” if the answers have identical or very similar inputs and identical or very similar outputs, unless the two answers came from the same source. The scores of “supporting” answers are part of the determination of the supported score;
- Two answers are “contradictory” if the inputs are identical or very similar but the outputs are not similar or are not comparable; and
- two answers are “unrelated” if the inputs are not similar or are not comparable.
The test involves determining the multiplicative product of y(S, k1, s1), y(C, k2, s2), and y(U, k3, s3), i.e., P=y(S, k1, s1)*y(C, k2, s2)*y(U, k3, s3), where k1, s1, k2, s2, k3, and s3 are predefined constants. If P is greater than a predefined threshold γ, then the best supported answer is selected as the answer and processed further.
