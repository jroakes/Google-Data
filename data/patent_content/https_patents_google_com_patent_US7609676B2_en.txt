Definitions
- the invention relates generally to communication systems, and more particularly to a method of operation within a communication device to prevent reporting of duplicate pilot signals within a communication system.
- a wireless communication system includes a number of base stations, scattered over a geographic area, to provide service for a number of communication devices, such as, personal data assistants (PDA), cellular telephones, messaging devices, mobile devices, and other suitable devices that can move throughout a geographic area.
- PDA personal data assistants
- CDMA code division multiple access
- each base station continuously transmits a pilot channel signal on the forward channel.
- the pilot channel signal transmitted by each base station has the same spreading code but with a different code phase offset.
- the phase offset allows the pilot signals to be distinguished from one another, which in turn allows the base stations to be distinguished.
- the communication device monitors the pilots and measures the received energy of the pilots.
- pilot Set three sets of pilot signals (collectively referred to as a Pilot Set): an active set, a candidate set, and a neighbor set.
- the active set consists of pilot signals associated with the forward traffic channels assigned to service the wireless device.
- the candidate set consists of pilots that are not currently in the active set but have been received by a particular communication device with sufficient signal strength to indicate that the associated forward traffic channels could be successfully demodulated.
- the neighbor set consists of pilot signals that are not currently in the active set or candidate set but are likely candidates for hand off. The remaining set consists of all pilots not found in the active set, candidate set, or neighbor set.
- the communication device As the communication device moves from the region covered by one base station to another, the communication device promotes certain pilots from the neighbor or remaining set to the candidate set, and certain pilots of the candidate set are subsequently promoted to the active set by the base station.
- the communication device provides the base station or base stations pilot signal strength measurement data corresponding to the received energy of the pilot signals via a pilot strength measurement message (PSMM).
- PSMM pilot strength measurement message
- the base station In response, notifies the communication device of the promotion from the candidate set to the active set via a hand off direction message.
- pilot set maintenance The process of continually updating the pilot set during a communication call is referred to as “pilot set maintenance.”
- the communication device erroneously reports two duplicate pilots to the network thinking that they are different pilots, one an already reported active pilot, and the second the same pilot whom the communication device mistakenly thinks is in the remaining pilot set.
- the root of the problem is based in the configuration of the network, and thus the communication device currently has no way of preventing this from happening.
- the network may have configured a rather large search window size for the remaining set.
- the network's remaining set window size dictates to the communication device's searcher how wide a search to use in order to find remaining set pilots. The larger the size of the window the wider the search.
- the remaining set window size is too large it is possible that active, candidate, and neighbor pilots fall within the search window for a remaining set pilot that is close, since remaining set pilots will be immediately adjacent to nonconsecutive active, candidate, and neighbor pilots.
- Pilots in CDMA are identified by their position in pilot PN sequence offset index space, hereafter referred to as PN (pseudonoise) space.
- the communication device can currently mistakenly report the same pilot in multiple entries in the pilot strength measurement message for handoff purposes.
- the network may command the communication device to do a remaining set search on a window that's +/ ⁇ 160 chips in width.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example communication system for implementing one exemplary embodiment of the invention
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a memory for use within the communication device of FIG. 1 according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention.

- the present invention is a method for preventing reporting of duplicate pilots within a wireless communication system.
- a mobile based solution is provided which eliminates a pilot from the remaining set if the remaining set window around the remaining set pilot overlaps any of the active, candidate, or neighbor set pilots.

- the operation illustrates one example of the operation of the communication device 105 in accordance with the present invention.
- the controller 120 of the communication device 105 can be programmed to perform the operations illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- the operation begins with Step 300 in which the communication device 105 communicates with the plurality of base stations 110 within the communication system 100 .
- Step 305 the communication device 105 maintains the pilot set 200 including the active set 205 , the candidate set 210 , the neighbor set 215 , and the remaining set 220 .
- Step 310 the communication device 105 allocates one or more pilots not found in the active set 205 , the candidate set 210 , or the neighbor set 215 to the remaining set 220 .
- Step 315 the remaining set window 225 is provided around each of the remaining set pilots stored within the remaining set 220 .
- Step 325 the communication device 105 checks the Nth remaining set pilot to determine whether the remaining set window around the Nth remaining set pilot overlaps any of the active, candidate, or neighbor set pilots. When the remaining set window around the Nth remaining set pilot overlaps one or more of the active, candidate, or neighbor set pilots in Step 325 , the operation continues to Step 330 in which the Nth remaining set pilot is eliminated.
- Step 340 the operation determines whether there exists an Nth remaining set pilot. When an Nth remaining set pilot exists, the operation cycles back to Step 325 . When no Nth remaining set pilot exists, the operation ends. The operation of FIG. 3 , thus limits the remainder set PN generation from including PNs within the remaining set window around active, neighbor, and candidate PNs.
- Step 400 the next remaining set pilot is selected.
- Step 405 the selection is made by starting with the last remaining set pilot and incrementing the remaining set pilot to the next remaining set pilot.
- Step 410 the operation determines whether the end of the active list has been reached. When the end of the active list has not been reached in Step 410 , the operation continues with Step 415 , in which it is determined whether the remaining set pilot selected in steps 400 and 405 is included with the current active list.
- Step 405 When the selected remaining set pilot is included with the current active set list, the operation returns to Step 405 .
- the operation continues to Step 420 in which it is determines whether the selected remaining set pilot surrounded by the remaining set window 225 overlaps a current active set pilot.
- the operation returns to Step 405 .
- the operation continues with Step 425 in which the next active set pilot is selected. The operation then returns to Step 410 .
- Step 430 in which it is determined whether or not the end of the candidate list has been reached.
- Step 435 in which it is determined whether the selected pilot is included within the current candidate list.
- the operation returns to Step 405 .
- Step 440 in which it is determined whether the selected remaining set pilot surrounded by the remaining set window 225 overlaps a current candidate pilot.
- the operation returns to Step 405 .
- Step 445 in which the next candidate pilot is selected. The operation then returns to Step 430 .
- Step 450 in which it is determined whether or not the end of the neighbor list has been reached.
- Step 470 returning to the remaining set.
- Step 455 in which it is determined whether or not the selected pilot is included in the current neighbor list.
- the operation returns to Step 405 .
- Step 460 in which it is determined whether the selected pilot surrounded by the remaining set window 225 overlaps a current neighbor set pilot.
- Step 405 When the selected pilot surrounded by the remaining set window 225 overlaps a current neighbor set window, the operation returns to Step 405 .
- Step 465 When the selected pilot surrounded by the remaining set window 225 does not overlap a current neighbor set pilot, the operation continues to Step 465 in which the next neighbor set pilot is selected. The operation then returns to Step 450 .
- the remaining set contains all the pilots in PN space which aren't in any of the other sets (active, candidate, or neighbor). Each PN is separated by ‘PILOT_INC’ chips 703 defined by the network in neighbor list messages.
- the mobile will check if the r_set member plus r_set_window size will overlap any of the active set members, candidate set members, or neighbor set members. If an overlap is detected then don't use the r_set candidate as a remaining set pilot, and go to the next potential remaining set member in PN space. This will prevent an active/candidate/neighbor pilot from failing within an r_set pilots search window 700 .
- any A 0 through A an is greater than or equal to PN i ⁇ n and less than and equal to PN i+n then eliminate r_set_pn as a remaining set member. That is, if any active pilot is found within the remaining set searcher window 700 , as determined by the number of chips (i.e. “pilot_inc” chips 703 ) in the intervals 705 , 707 , 709 and 711 , which make up the searcher window size 701 for the remaining set, then that overlapping pilot is eliminated from the remaining set.
- pilot_inc chips
- any C 0 through C cn is greater than or equal to PN i ⁇ n and less than and equal to PN i+n then eliminate r_set_pn as a remaining set member. That is, if any candidate pilot is found within the remaining set searcher window 700 , as determined by the number of chips (i.e. “pilot_inc” chips 703 ) in the intervals 705 , 707 , 709 and 711 , which make up the searcher window size 701 for the remaining set, then that overlapping pilot is eliminated from the remaining set.
- pilot_inc chips
- any N 0 through N n is greater than or equal to PN i ⁇ n and less than and equal to PN i+n then eliminate r_set_pn as a remaining set member. That is, if any neighbor pilot is found within the remaining set searcher window 700 , as determined by the number of chips (i.e. “pilot_inc” chips 703 ) in the intervals 705 , 707 , 709 and 711 , which make up the searcher window size 701 for the remaining set, then that overlapping pilot is eliminated from the remaining set.
- pilot_inc chips
- Step 500 the operation begins with Step 500 in which the base station (for example, 130 , 135 , 140 of FIG. 1 ) is in standby mode.
- Step 505 the operation determines whether or not a network configuration request has been received. For example, a user request for a network configuration can be communicated from a communication device to the base station. When no network configuration request is detected, the operation returns to standby Step 500 . When a network configuration request is detected, the operation continues with Step 510 , in which it is determined whether or not configuration parameters have been input.
- Step 510 When configuration parameters have been input in Step 510 , the operation continues to Step 515 in which it is determined whether an overlap condition will occur (as described previously herein) if the input configuration parameters are implemented. In other words, the base station will verify that the remaining set window size 701 is not too large to cause an overlap condition to occur.
- Step 515 the operation continues to Step 520 in which new configuration parameters are requested. The operation then cycles back to Step 510 .
- Step 510 when no configuration parameters have been input, the operation continues to Step 525 in which the system sets the configuration parameters.
- Step 530 and when no overlap is detected in Step 515 , the system configures the remaining set window 700 to prevent an overlap of one or more remaining set pilots with one or more other pilots of the pilot set.
- Step 535 the remaining set window 700 is communication to the communication device.
- Step 600 an example operation of the communication device 105 in accordance with the present invention is illustrated.
- the operation begins with Step 600 in which the communication device 105 communicates with one or more base stations 110 .
- Step 605 the communication device maintains a pilot set 200 as described previously herein.
- Step 610 the communication device 105 allocates one or more pilots not found in the active set, the candidate set, or the neighbor set of the pilot set 200 to the remaining set.
- Step 615 the communication device provides the remaining set window 225 around each of the remaining set pilots.
- Step 625 the operation determines whether or not the remaining set window around the Nth pilot includes an active set match.
- the communication device 105 can compare one or more multi-path components resulting from a search of the active set.
- Step 630 the duplicate is eliminated.
- Step 640 it is determined whether or not an Nth remaining set pilot exists. When an Nth remaining set pilot exists, the operation returns to Step 625 . When no Nth remaining set pilot exists, the operation ends.
- the present invention will keep a communication device from generating unnecessary signaling or having some other bad side effect depending on the infrastructure provider's implementation. Further, the present invention will improve data throughput not only for VOIP applications but also for other data applications. This makes the phone more robust in protecting it from bad network configuration settings. Further, the present invention will reduce battery usage as the communication device will not enter unnecessary idle modes.
