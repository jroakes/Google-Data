- the content server 220 can weight an item included in the group profile 228 based on one or more factors.
- the weight can be based on an influence score associated with a particular user. For example, a characteristic that is included in a user profile of a user who has a higher social influence score can be weighted higher with regards to consideration of inclusion in the group profile 228 than a characteristic that is included in a user profile of a user who has a lower social influence score.
- basketball may be weighted higher than baseball.
- a basketball interest is included in the user profiles of the user 204 and the user 206 , with the user 204 and the user 206 having social influence scores of 90 and 80, respectively, while a baseball interest is included in the user profiles of the user 206 and the user 208 , with the user 206 and the user 208 having social influence scores of 80 and 60, respectively.
- the content server 220 can include basketball as a primary interest and baseball as a secondary interest in the group profile 228 based on the basketball interest being associated with users having higher social influence scores than the social influence scores of users having an interest in baseball.
- a social influence score for a user can be determined, for example, based on a number of factors. For example, a user with a higher social influence score may have more connections in a social network than a user with a lower social influence score.
- Social influence scores can be based on other factors, such as a volume of social network posts, a number or a percentage of posts that are replied to, interacted with, or shared by other users, an average response time to others' social posts, a frequency of response to others' social posts, etc.
- a characteristic such as an interest
- a threshold number or more than a threshold percentage of user profiles include the characteristic.
- basketball and baseball can be included in the group profile 228 when the threshold is one.
- the content server 220 can select one or more content items for delivery to the television 210 in response to the request for content based at least in part on the group profile 228 .

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium for providing content to a group of users. A method includes: determining that a plurality of users are in proximity to each other and a likelihood that the users are viewing content on a single device; receiving a request for content from the single device; identifying a profile associated with each of the plurality of users, the profile for use in identifying relevant content for delivery to a respective user; creating a group profile based on the identified profiles; and selecting one or more content items for delivery responsive to the request based at least in part on the group profile.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for providing content to a group of users. A method includes: determining that a plurality of users are in proximity to each other and a likelihood that the users are viewing content on a single device; receiving a request for content from the single device; identifying a profile associated with each of the plurality of users, the profile for use in identifying relevant content for delivery to a respective user; creating a group profile based on the identified profiles; and selecting one or more content items for delivery responsive to the request based at least in part on the group profile.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products. A computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: determine that a plurality of users are in proximity to each other and a likelihood that the users are viewing content on a single device; receive a request for content from the single device; identify a profile associated with each of the plurality of users, the profile for use in identifying relevant content for delivery to a respective user; create a group profile based on the identified profiles; and select one or more content items for delivery responsive to the request based at least in part on the group profile.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems. A system includes one or more processing devices and one or more storage devices. The storage devices store instructions that, when executed by the one or more processing devices, cause the one or more processing devices to: determine that a plurality of users are in proximity to each other and a likelihood that the users are viewing content on a single device; receive a request for content from the single device; identify a profile associated with each of the plurality of users, the profile for use in identifying relevant content for delivery to a respective user; create a group profile based on the identified profiles; and select one or more content items for delivery responsive to the request based at least in part on the group profile.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining that a plurality of users are in proximity can include determining that the plurality of users are logged into a service and are located at a same location based on location information provided by a device associated with a respective user or the service. Determining that a plurality of users is in proximity can include querying one or more of the plurality of users to determine the likelihood. Receiving a request can include receiving a request for an advertisement to be included in a slot on a resource or to be provided along with search results. Creating a group profile can include creating the group profile in real time. Creating the group profile can include creating the group profile prior to determining the plurality of users is in proximity to each other. Creating the group profile can include identifying candidate groups of individuals for group targeting and creating a group profile for a candidate group based on profiles for individuals in the group. The candidate groups can be identified based on known relationships, interactions, or affinities of the respective users. The group profile can be stored and can be updated based on performance information for content that was selected to be presented to the group. The updated group profile can be used to select content to present to one or more members in the group when they are viewing content as a group in the future. An individual profile can include one or more characteristics that are associated with an individual user and creating the group profile can include weighting an importance of the one or more characteristics in the group profile based on an influence score associated with the individual user. A user interface can be provided to a content sponsor to facilitate selection of selection parameters to be associated with delivery of their content. The user interface can include one or more controls for enabling the content sponsor to designate selection criteria wherein at least one selection criterion can be for a display environment for the content sponsor's content to be a multi-party display environment. The user interface can include controls for enabling the content sponsor to specify one or more other characteristics of the parties in the multi-party environment that would be eligible for receipt of the content from the content sponsor. Information can be received from the service or the single device to develop situational awareness of a reason or occasion that the group has come together and selecting one or more content items can include selecting a content item based at least in part on the situational awareness.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Content that is presented to multiple users viewing a single device can be selected based on a group profile determined for the multiple users. A content sponsor can specify that a content item is eligible to be selected for presentation to a particular type of group of users viewing a single device.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 6 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Systems and methods are providing for selecting content to be presented to a group of users, such as a group that are viewing a same device. For example, a determination can be made that a plurality of users are in proximity to each other, such as based on location information associated with some or all of the users and/or based on some or all of the users being connected to a same local network. A likelihood that the users are viewing content on a single device can be determined. The single device can be, for example, a television, a computer screen, a tablet or other device. A request for content can be received from the single device, such as for content to be included in a slot on a resource or to be provided along with search results responsive to a received query. A profile associated with each of the plurality of users can be identified for use in identifying relevant content for delivery to a respective user. A group profile can be created based on the identified profiles and one or more content items can be selected for delivery responsive to the request based at least in part on the group profile.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be manipulated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be manipulated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server.

personal user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 105 over thenetwork 102. Examplepersonal user devices 106 include personal computers, tablet computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), televisions, set top boxes, personal digital assistants and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Apersonal user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The web browser can interact with various types of web applications, such as a game, a map application, or an e-mail application, to name a few examples. - A
personal user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to thepersonal user device 106 for presentation by thepersonal user device 106.Personal user devices 106 can also submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response to asearch query 116, thesearch system 112 can, for example, access the indexedcache 114 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to thepersonal user devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 116, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - The data representing the
resource 105 or the search results 118 can also include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 orsearch results 118 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots or impressions. An example slot is an advertisement slot. - When a
resource 105 orsearch results 118 are requested by apersonal user device 106, thecontent management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results 118. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots or impressions that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results 118. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to theresource 105 orsearch results 118 for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which searchresults 118 are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. The request for content can include a user identifier (e.g., a cookie) associated with the user of the requestingpersonal user device 106. - Based, for example, on data included in the request for content, the
content management system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request, such as content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot. As another example, content items having selection criteria (e.g., keywords) that match the resource keywords or thesearch query 116 may be selected as eligible content items by thecontent management system 110. As yet another example, content items matching information stored in a user profile associated with a user of thepersonal user device 106 can be selected as eligible content items. User profiles can be stored, for example, in a user profiles data store 119. One or more selected content items can be provided to thepersonal user device 106 in association with providing an associatedresource 105 or search results 118. - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction. For example,content providers 108 can provide bids specifying amounts that thecontent providers 108 are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items. In turn, an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated tocontent providers 108 according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item. For example, when a slot is being allocated in an auction, the slot can be allocated to thecontent provider 108 that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure). When multiple slots are allocated in a single auction, the slots can be allocated to a set of bidders that provided the highest bids or have the highest auction scores. - A
content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to thecontent provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device. - A
content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, providecampaign parameters 120 which define a content campaign. The content campaign can be created and activated for thecontent provider 108 according to theparameters 120 specified by thecontent provider 108. Thecampaign parameters 120 can be stored in aparameters data store 122.Campaign parameters 120 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria. Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and/or one or more selection terms. As another example, selection criteria can include criteria that makes a content item eligible for presentation to a group of users when a likelihood is determined that users in the group are viewing content on amulti-user device 107. - The multiple-
user devices 107 are devices on which content is presented and viewed simultaneously by multiple users. The multiple-user devices 107 can include, for example, televisions, computing devices, gaming systems, and movie theatre systems. Thecontent management system 110 can determine a likelihood that multiple users are viewing a particular multiple-user device 107. For example, thecontent management system 110 can determine that the multiple users are in proximity to each other and to the multiple-user device 107, such as based on location information associated withpersonal user devices 106 of the multiple users and with the multiple-user device 107 and/or on thepersonal user devices 106 of the multiple users each being connected to a same network. - The
content management system 110 can receive a request for content from a multiple-user device 107, such as for an advertisement or other content to be included in a slot on a resource 105 (or along with search results) presented on the multiple-user device 107. Thecontent management system 110 can identify a profile associated with some or all of the multiple users, such as from the user profiles data store 119. As described in more detail below, thecontent management system 110 can create a group profile based on the identified profiles. The group profile can be stored in a group profilesdata store 124 and can include information such as common interests and other summary information describing the group, such as average age, gender distribution, etc. Thecontent management system 110 can select one or more content items for delivery to the multiple-user device 107 in response to the request for content received from the multiple-user device 107, based at least in part on the group profile. -
FIG. 2A is a block diagram of anexample system 200 for providing content to a group of users. Users 202 (user1), 204 (user2), 206 (user3), and 208 (user4) are located in a same room, watching atelevision 210. Theusers mobile devices user devices content server 220. - The
content server 220 can determine that theusers content server 220 can determine that themobile devices local network 222. Thelocal network 222 can be, for example, a WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) network, a Bluetooth™ network, or some other type of network. As another example, thecontent server 220 can determine that theusers mobile devices users local network 222 and/or based on the location information associated with themobile devices content server 220 can determine a likelihood that theusers television 210. - As another example, the
content server 220 can query one or more of theusers users television 210. For example, auser interface 223 can be provided to and presented on themobile device 212 of theuser 202. Theuser interface 223 includes aquery 223 a asking theuser 202 if theuser 202 and a particular number of other people (e.g., three) are watching content on thetelevision 210. Theuser 202 can use acontrol 223 b to change the particular number to some other number. Theuser 202 can select acontrol 223 c to confirm that theuser 202 and the number of other users indicated by thecontrol 223 b are watching thetelevision 210. Theuser 202 can select acontrol 223 d to provide an answer of “No” to thequery 223 a. An indication of the selection of thecontrol 223 c or thecontrol 223 d and an indication of the number displayed in thecontrol 223 b can be sent to thecontent server 220. In some implementations, the query can include the names of the other potential viewers and the feedback from theuser 202 can include feedback to designate particular ones of the potential viewers as actually viewing the multi-user device 207. - As part of the presenting of content on the
television 210, thetelevision 210 can provide a request for content to thecontent server 220, such as for an advertisement or other content item to be included in a slot on a resource presented on thetelevision 210. In response to the request for content, thecontent server 220 can identify a profile associated with each of theusers data store 224. For example, as illustrated byexample profile data 226, a profile for theuser 202 indicates that theuser 202 has interests of tennis and volleyball, is female, is 42 years old, and has a social influencer score of 20. Social influencer scores are discussed in more detail below. Theexample profile data 226 indicates that theuser 204 is a male 20 year old who likes basketball and rock climbing, has a social influencer score of 90, and recently emailed theuser 206 about basketball. Theexample profile data 226 indicates that theuser 206 is a male 21 year old who likes basketball and baseball, has a social influencer score of 80, and received an email from theuser 204 about basketball. Theexample profile data 226 indicates that theuser 208 is a male 21 year old who likes cello and baseball and has a social influencer score of 60. - The
content server 220 can create agroup profile 228 based on theexample profile data 226. Thegroup profile 228 can include, for example, information common to the user profiles associated with theusers users group profile 228 includes a primary interest of basketball, a secondary interest of baseball, age information indicating a mean age of 26 and a median age of 21, and a gender distribution indicating 75% male and 25% female. Thegroup profile 228 can be stored in a group profilesdata store 230. - The
content server 220 can determine information to include in thegroup profile 228 and/or can weight an importance of one or more items in thegroup profile 228 based on theexample profile data 226. For example, thecontent server 220 can weight an item included in thegroup profile 228 based on one or more factors. In some implementations, the weight can be based on an influence score associated with a particular user. For example, a characteristic that is included in a user profile of a user who has a higher social influence score can be weighted higher with regards to consideration of inclusion in thegroup profile 228 than a characteristic that is included in a user profile of a user who has a lower social influence score. - For example, although both baseball and basketball interests are included twice in the
example profile data 226, basketball may be weighted higher than baseball. For example, a basketball interest is included in the user profiles of theuser 204 and theuser 206, with theuser 204 and theuser 206 having social influence scores of 90 and 80, respectively, while a baseball interest is included in the user profiles of theuser 206 and theuser 208, with theuser 206 and theuser 208 having social influence scores of 80 and 60, respectively. Thecontent server 220 can include basketball as a primary interest and baseball as a secondary interest in thegroup profile 228 based on the basketball interest being associated with users having higher social influence scores than the social influence scores of users having an interest in baseball. - A social influence score for a user can be determined, for example, based on a number of factors. For example, a user with a higher social influence score may have more connections in a social network than a user with a lower social influence score. Social influence scores can be based on other factors, such as a volume of social network posts, a number or a percentage of posts that are replied to, interacted with, or shared by other users, an average response time to others' social posts, a frequency of response to others' social posts, etc.
- Other criteria can be used to determine the contents of the
group profile 228. For example, in some implementations, a characteristic, such as an interest, can be included in thegroup profile 228 if more than a threshold number or more than a threshold percentage of user profiles include the characteristic. For example, basketball and baseball can be included in thegroup profile 228 when the threshold is one. - The
content server 220 can select one or more content items for delivery to thetelevision 210 in response to the request for content based at least in part on thegroup profile 228. For example, thecontent server 220 can select acontent item 230 related to basketball (e.g., basketball shoes) from a contentitems data store 232 based on the primary interest of basketball included in thegroup profile 228. Thecontent item 230 can be provided to and presented on thetelevision 210. - As another example,
FIG. 2B is a block diagram of anexample system 250 for providing content to a group of users. Users 252 (user5), 254 (user6), and 256 (user7) are watching atelevision 258. Theusers user devices user devices content server 220. Thecontent server 220 can determine that theusers users television 258, such as based on location information or local network connectivity information associated with theuser devices query 266 can be presented on thetelevision 258 and one of theusers query 266, such as by using a remote control associated with thetelevision 258. For example, acontrol 268 can be selected to confirm that three users are currently watching thetelevision 258 or acontrol 270 can be selected to answer “no” to thequery 266. In response to a “no” answer, a user interface may be presented on thetelevision 258 which allows entry of a number which represents the number of people currently watching thetelevision 258. - The
television 258 can provide a request for content to thecontent server 220, such as for an advertisement or other content item to be included in a slot on a resource presented on thetelevision 258. In response to the request for content, thecontent server 220 can identify a profile associated with each of theusers profiles data store 224. For example, as illustrated by example profile data 272, a profile for the user 252 indicates that the user 252 has interests of books and gardening, is female, is 44 years old, and has a social influencer score of 90. The example profile data 272 indicates that theuser 254 is a female 46 year old who likes books, politics, and tennis and has a social influencer score of 60. The example profile data 272 indicates that theuser 256 is a female 38 year old who likes volleyball and tennis and has a social influencer score of 20. - The
content server 220 can identify, in the groupprofile data store 230, a predefined group profile 274 associated, for example, with “female book lovers”. For example, thecontent server 220 can determine that a similarity score between the group profile 274 and the example profile data 272 is greater than a threshold. The characteristic of “books” can carry more weight in identification or creation of a group profile than, for example, a characteristic of tennis, based on the characteristic of books being associated with users who have higher social influencer scores than users who are associated with the characteristic of tennis. - The
content server 220 can select one or more content items for delivery to thetelevision 258 in response to the request for content based at least in part on the group profile 274. For example, thecontent server 220 can select acontent item 276 related to books from the contentitems data store 232 based on the predefined group profile 274. Thecontent item 276 can be provided to and presented on thetelevision 258. - The
content server 220 can select a content item based on other factors, such as based on recent searches submitted by one or more of theusers profiles data store 224, querying an activity log, or by receiving information from thesearch system 278, such as information from search logs). In some implementations, thecontent server 220 can determine user activity of one or more of theusers television 258 and at the same location as thetelevision 258. Thecontent server 220 can, for example, select a content item based at least in part on the identified current activity. As another example, thecontent server 220 can identify or create a group profile based at least in part on the identified current activity and on the example profile data 272. For example, the current activity may include information that is not included in the example profile data 272. -
FIG. 3 illustrates an example campaignmanagement user interface 300. Theuser interface 300 can be included, for example, in one or more user interfaces that a user, such as a content item provider or content sponsor, can use to configure a campaign. The content item provider can select atab 302 to display acampaign configuration area 304. The content item provider can view alist 306 of campaigns by selecting acontrol 308. The content item provider can edit an existing campaign in thecampaign configuration area 304 by selecting the name of an existing campaign (e.g., a name 310) in thecampaign list 306. The content item provider can select a content item associated with the campaign using acontrol 312. - The content item provider can select one or more keywords to be associated with the content item using a
control 314. The selected keywords can be used as selection criteria for the selected content item. Acontrol 316 can be selected to make the selected content item eligible for presentation to a group of users when a likelihood is determined that users in the group are viewing content on a multi-user device. - The content item provider can select one or more predefined groups using a control 318 and can add the selected group(s) to a selected groups list 320 using an
add control 322. For example, the selected groups list 320 includes a predefined “college-aged men” group 324. A group can be removed from the selected groups list 322 using aremove control 325. - The content item provider can define a custom group. A name for the custom group can be entered using a control 326 (e.g., “twenties men”). The content item provider can configure characteristics of members of the custom group or characteristics of the custom group in general. For example, one of gender controls 328 can be selected to specify whether the custom group is to include men, women, or both men and women. For example, the gender controls 328 include a selected control corresponding to men. As other examples, controls 330, 332, and 334 can be used to specify a minimum number of people to be included in the group (e.g., three), an age range (e.g., twenty two to twenty nine) of members in the group, and an income range of members in the group, respectively. A
control 336 can be selected to indicate the members of the group are to have interests (e.g., in a user profile) that match one or more of the keywords included in thecontrol 314. - The custom group can be added to the selected groups list 320 using the
add control 322. For example, the selected groups list includes a twenties-men group 338. In response to selection of thecontrol 316 and inclusion of the college-aged men group 324 and the twenties-men group 338 in the selected groups list 320, a content server can provide the selected content item in response to a request for content from a multi-user device based at least in part on a determination being made that users in a group of users matching either the college-aged men group 324 or the twenties-men group 338 are viewing content on the multi-user device. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of anexample process 400 for providing content to a group of users. Theprocess 400 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 , or thecontent server 220 described above with respect toFIG. 2A . - A determination is made that a plurality of users are in proximity to each other and a likelihood that the users are viewing content on a single device is determined (402). For example, a determination can be made that the plurality of users are logged into a service and are located at a same location based on location information provided by a device associated with a respective user or the service. The likelihood that the users are viewing content on the single device can be based on the location information of the users matching location information associated with the single device and based on the location information of the users indicating that the users have stayed at a same location for a particular period of time (e.g., thirty minutes, one hour).
- As another example, a determination can be made that the plurality of users are connected to a same network (e.g., a local network, such as a WiFi network). In some implementations, one or more of the plurality of users are queried to determine the likelihood. For example, a query can be sent to one or more of the plurality of users asking the one or more users if the plurality of users are viewing the single device. In some implementations, other techniques can be used to determine the likelihood that the users are viewing content on the single device. For example, a camera included in or associated with the single device can detect the presence of each of the plurality of users. The single device can be, for example, a television, a gaming system, a movie theatre system, or some other type of device.
- A request for content is received from the single device (404). For example, when the single device is a television, the request for content can be for an advertisement to be included in a slot on a resource presented on the television. When the single device is a gaming system, the request for content can be for a content item (e.g., advertisement) to display in a content slot presented on a display of the gaming system or can be for content to display during game play. For example, content item providers can bid on content to display in a portion of the game play of a game played in the gaming system. When the single device is a movie theatre system, the request for content can be, for example, for content to display in a pre-movie content segment. As another example, the request for content can be for content to display in a movie. For example, content item providers can bid for an opportunity to display a scene of a particular product (e.g., car, billboard advertisement, consumption of a product) in a movie, with the presentation of the movie including a scene including a product of the winning content provider.
- A profile associated with each of the plurality of users is identified (406). A respective profile can be for use in identifying relevant content for delivery to a respective user. A respective profile can include information, for example, about the associated user's interest, age, income, gender, or other characteristics, when the user has consented for use and storage of such information.
- A group profile is created based on the identified profiles (408). In some implementations, the group profile is created in real time, such as in response to the determination that the plurality of users are in proximity to each other or in response to the request for content from the single device. In some implementations, the group profile is created prior to determining that the plurality of users is in proximity to each other. For example, candidate groups of individuals for group targeting can be identified, such as based on known relationships, interactions or affinities of the respective users. For example, a group of college friends who interact with each other frequently through social networking sites can be identified as a candidate group. As another example, a husband, wife, and children can be identified as a candidate group based on known relationships between the family individuals. A group profile for a candidate group can be created based on the profiles for individuals in the group.
- In some implementations, the created group profile is based on a predefined group profile. For example, a predefined group profile may exist for a family having certain characteristics, such as parents and children each in particular age ranges and a particular number of children. As another example, a predefined group profile may exist for “college friends”. A determination can be made that the plurality of users matches the existing college-friends group profile based, for example, on the user devices of the plurality of users being connected to a network address that is associated with a college dormitory.
- In general, the group profile can include characteristics that are common to some or all of the individual profiles. For example, the group profile can include common interests. As another example, the group profile can include summary information that summarizes information in the individual profiles, such as a gender, age, income, or other distributions, a median or mean age or income, etc. An importance of one or more characteristics in the group profile can be weighted based on influence scores associated with individual users. For example characteristics that are associated with users having more influence can be weighted higher than characteristics that are associated with users having less influence.
- One or more content items are selected for delivery responsive to the request based at least in part on the group profile (410). When the single device is a television, a content item can be selected to be presented on the television. When the single device is a gaming system, a content item to be presented during game play can be selected. When the single device is a movie theatre system, a content item to display during movie previews or within a movie can be selected. In some implementations, information from a service or the single device can be used to develop situational awareness of a reason or an occasion that the group has come together and one or more content items can be selected based on the situational awareness. For example, a determination can be made of a significant event (e.g., birthday, anniversary) related to one or more of the individual users. As another example, selecting of a content item can be based on determining a match between an interest (e.g., football) associated with more than a threshold of the users and a particular type of content (e.g., a football game) being presented on the single device.

FIG. 5 is a flowchart of anexample process 500 for providing content to a group of users. Theprocess 500 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 , or thecontent server 220 described above with respect toFIG. 2A . - A group profile is stored (502). For example, the group profile can be stored in a group profiles data store such as the group profiles
data store 124 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . The group profile can be created and stored, for example, for a group of users in response to a request for content from a multi-user device that is displaying content being viewed by the group of users. - The group profile is updated based on performance information for content that was selected to be presented to the group (504). For example, performance information, such as conversion information, can be tracked for the users included in the group and can be stored in the group profile. A conversion can occur, for example, using the multi-user device or using some other device such as a personal user device associated with one of the users in the group. The multi-user device may include, for example, a touch display or other user input device with which users can provide input and perform conversion actions for a content item presented on the multi-user device. The multi-user device may be interactive in other ways, such as being an interactive television which with users in the group can interact, such as using a remote control. A user can, for example, perform a conversion action, such as making a purchase, using the remote control. As another example, one or more of the users may perform a conversion action using a personal user device subsequent to presentation of content on the multi-user device, with the conversion action attributable at least in part due to the presentation of content on the multi-user device.
- The updated group profile is used to select content to present to one or more members in the group when they are viewing content as a group in the future (506). For example, in response to a request for content, a content item with a highest conversion rate among content items previously presented to the group can be identified and a content item similar to the identified content item can be selected in response to the request.

FIG. 6 is a block diagram ofcomputing devices 600, 650 that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. Computing device 600 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 650 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be illustrative only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document. - Computing device 600 includes a
processor 602,memory 604, astorage device 606, a high-speed interface 608 connecting tomemory 604 and high-speed expansion ports 610, and alow speed interface 612 connecting tolow speed bus 614 andstorage device 606. Each of thecomponents processor 602 can process instructions for execution within the computing device 600, including instructions stored in thememory 604 or on thestorage device 606 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 616 coupled tohigh speed interface 608. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices 600 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 604 stores information within the computing device 600. In one implementation, thememory 604 is a computer-readable medium. The computer-readable medium is not a propagating signal. In one implementation, thememory 604 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 604 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. - The
storage device 606 is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device 600. In one implementation, thestorage device 606 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, thestorage device 606 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations.
