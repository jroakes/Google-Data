Definitions
- This specification relates to digital data processing and, in particular, to ranking of search results.
- Internet search engines provide information about Internet accessible resources (e.g., web pages, images, electronic books, text documents, sounds, music, videos, electronic games, and multimedia content) by returning search results in response to queries.
- a search result includes, for example, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and a snippet of information for resources responsive to a query.
- the search results can be ranked (i.e., put in an order) according to scores assigned to the search results by a scoring function.
- the scoring function ranks the search results according to various signals, for example, where (and how often) query terms appear in the search results and how common the query terms are in the search results indexed by the search engine.
- This specification relates to digital data processing and, in particular, to combining user feedback.
- the quality of search results may be improved.
- Quality metrics from one search engine may be used to improve the ranking of search results for another search engine.
- Fresh content from video property could get chance to surface on web search engine which serves large volume of pages from variety of properties.

- FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of an example system configured to derive a combined quality metric.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example of video search results displayed in a web page 100 presented in a web browser or other software application.
- the web page 100 includes a text entry field 102 which accepts queries from users.
- a query is submitted by a user and specifies general or specific topics of interest to the user.
- a query may be in the form of text (e.g. “palm tree”) or a spoken word or phrase, for example. Queries can also comprise images or videos.
- a submitted query is transmitted to a search engine.
- the search engine identifies videos in an index of resources that are responsive to the query.
- the search engine transmits search results 106 , 108 and 110 that reference the identified videos to the web browser for presentation in region 112 of the web page 100 .
- Each search result can include summary information such as a representative frame from the video (e.g., frame 106 a ), the video's title (e.g., title 106 b ), a textual summary (e.g., synopsis 106 d ), the running time of the video (e.g., time data 106 c ), and a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or other identifier specifying the location of the video (e.g., identifier 106 e ).
- time data 106 c includes the duration of the video and the date on which the video was uploaded.
- Other search result information is possible.
- a video may be stored at the location (e.g., identifier 106 e ) in a portion of a file that holds other content, in a single file dedicated to the video in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- a video may, but need not, correspond to a file.
- a user can select a search result (e.g., frame 106 a or identifier 106 e ) with a mouse click, a finger gesture on a touch-sensitive surface, a speech command to a microphone, or by way of another input device, for example, in order to view the video identified by the search result.
- Search results 112 can be ranked according to traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed resources in view of a given query, for example.
- IR information retrieval
- the relevance of a particular resource with respect to a particular search term or other provided information may be determined by any appropriate scoring technique.
- the score of the resource can be modified based on prior interactions of users with the resource in view of the given query.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary video player as displayed in a web page 250 presented in a web browser or other software application.
- the video player is a stand-alone software application.
- the video player includes a playback window 252 for displaying a video.
- Different video formats are supported including, but not limited to, HD, HDV, DVD, Blu-Ray, HD-DVD, HD-VMD, CH-DVD, HDTV, Adobe Systems Incorporated FLASH, MPEG, MPEG-4, and Apple Inc.
- QUICKTIME A play button 260 a starts and pauses the video playback while a progress bar indicator 260 b indicates how much of the video has been played.
- the current time offset into the playback or (“watch time”) is displayed at 260 c and the total running time of the video is displayed at 260 d .
- the watch time is 1 minute and 15 seconds
- the total running time is 2 minutes and 33 seconds.
- a rating 262 indicates the average rating (e.g., three out of five stars) of all user ratings of the video and the total number of ratings (e.g., fourteen).
- a video rating system can have rating values of one, two, three, four or five stars, with one star indicating strong dislike and five stars indicating strong enjoyment on the part of the user rating the video. Other rating systems are possible, however.
- the total number of users who have viewed the video (or “view count”) 264 in part or in its entirety is also presented.
- a system described below with reference to FIG. 3 maintains user feedback data including user ratings, watch times, view counts, and other data.
- User interactions with a video are logged. For example, the amount of time a user plays the video is logged as a watch time for the video.
- the watch time is the total time the user spent watching the video before navigating off of the web page. The watch time can be unaffected by whether the user watched portions of the video out of sequence or skipped portions. If the watch time for a video is not known (e.g., because the video is not hosted by a system that keeps track of user watch times), the watch time can be estimated based on when users navigate off of the web page for the video.
- a web browser plug-in or other software can monitor when users navigate off of web pages and record this information. If the system hosting the video does not programmatically provide a view count for the video (e.g., through an application programming interface), the view count can be detected by a plug-in or other software that analyzes the web page for text indicating the view count.
- User feedback data can also include user interaction counts, targeted interaction counts, and impression counts.
- a user interaction represents users' selections (e.g., clicks with a mouse) of search results that reference resources (e.g., videos or web pages).
- a targeted interaction represents a user interaction where the time duration the user interacts with the resource referred to by selected search result satisfies a threshold (e.g., the time duration is greater than a threshold or less than a threshold).
- a targeted interaction can be a user interaction where the watch time exceeds a threshold (e.g., one minute).
- targeted interactions can be user interactions where a period of time beginning when a user selects a search result from a search web page and ending when the user returns to the search web page exceeds a threshold (e.g., thirty seconds, one minute, two minutes, five minutes).
- a threshold e.g., thirty seconds, one minute, two minutes, five minutes.
- An impression is a presentation of a search result that references a resource.
- an impression is limited to presentations of a search result identifying the resource where the search result is ranked among the top search results for the query (e.g. in the top twenty search results, on the first page of search results).
- quality metrics may be determined based on user interactions and targeted interactions. For example, the number of targeted interactions for a resource may be divided by the number of impressions of the resource. Another quality metric may be calculated by dividing the count of the number of targeted interactions for the resource by the number of targeted interactions with any resource responsive to the query. Examples of quality metrics include a traditional quality metric, a targeted interaction quality metric, and an impressions quality metric.
- TQM TI i / ⁇ TI
- TQM represents a traditional quality metric.
- TI i is the number of targeted interactions for a particular resource responsive to a query.
- TI is a targeted interaction for any resource responsive to the same query.
- TIQM TI/ I
- TiQM represents the Targeted Interactions Quality Metric
- TI is the number of targeted interactions for a particular resource.
- I is the number of user interactions with the resource.
- TI is the number of targeted interactions for a particular resource.
- IMP is the number of impressions of the resource.

- the relevance of a particular resource with respect to a particular search term or to other provided information may be determined by any appropriate technique.
- the ranking engine 352 receives quality signals from a quality rank modifier engine 356 to assist in determining an appropriate ranking for search results.
- the quality rank modifier engine 356 calculates the quality signal using a quality metric calculated from user feedback data 370 stored in tracking logs 369 .
- the search engine 330 forwards the final, ranked result list within a server-side search results signal 328 a through the network 312 .
- a client-side search results signal 328 b is received by the client device 304 a where the results are stored within the RAM 306 and/or used by the processor 308 to display the results on an output device for the user 302 a .
- the server system 314 may also maintain one or more user search histories based on the queries it receives from a user and which results that a user selected after a search was performed.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating example user interfaces for search systems.
- a first user interface 408 is provided by a video search system 412
- the video search system may include a server system 414 , for example, the server system 314 of FIG. 3 , and an analyzer system 416 , for example, the analyzer system 364 of FIG. 3 .
- a second user interface 410 is provided by a web search system 418 .
- the web (or “universal”) search system 418 includes a server system 420 and an analyzer system 422 .
- the video search system 412 provides video search results “Palm Tree Removal” 404 , “Pruning Palm Trees” 402 , and “Tree & Plant Care: Palm Trees” 400 in response to receiving a query, “palm tree,” as shown by the text in the search text area 424 on the user interface 408 .
- the video search system provides links to the videos as part of the search results.
- “Pruning Palm Trees” 402 is displayed first (i.e., has the highest rank), “Palm Tree Removal” 404 is displayed second (i.e., has the second highest rank), and “Tree & Plant Care: Palm Trees” 400 is displayed third (i.e., has the third highest rank).
- the web search system 418 provides a wider variety of resources as search results responsive to receiving the same query, “palm tree,” as shown by the text entered into the search text area 426 on the user interface 410 .
- the search results from the web search system include the video search result “Tree & Plant Care: Palm Trees” 400 in addition to links to assorted web pages and images 430 .
- the search system 418 Based on the ranking algorithm used by the second search system 420 and user feedback data maintained by the analyzer system 422 , the search system 418 ranks “Tree & Plant Care Palm Trees” 400 highest.
- the difference in the order of search results between the two search systems in this example is based, at least in part, on differences in the user feedback data in the video search system 412 and user feedback data in the web search system 418 . These differences may be caused by many factors both legitimate and idiosyncratic. For example, typical users of the video search system may have different interests than typical users of the web search system. The video search system may be a less popular fall back search system when compared to the Web search system, therefore, many of the users who search on the video search system have already explored the videos provided in the Web search system. The video search system may have only a few users, therefore the preferences of a few individual may disproportionately affect the user feedback data when compared to a larger user population of the Web search system.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a diagram of an example video search system using the user feedback data from a Web search system.
- a video search system 502 a contains a quality rank modifier engine 504 a that references user feedback data 506 a , referred to as primary user feedback data.
- the web search system 502 b contains a quality rank modifier engine 504 b that references a user feedback data 506 b .
- the video quality rank modifier engine 504 a accesses the user feedback data 506 b of the web search system 502 b , as secondary user feedback.
- primary user feedback data refers to user feedback data from the search system performing the ranking and secondary user feedback data refers to user feedback data taken from another search system.
- the quality rank modifier engine 504 a combines primary user feedback data for a given video with the secondary user feedback data.
- the quality rank modifier engine creates a combined quality metric 508 from the combined user feedback data.
- the secondary user feedback data 506 b may contain significantly more data than the primary user feedback data 506 a .
- the difference in the quantity of user feedback data presents a risk of bias.
- the secondary user feedback data could dominate the combined quality metric 508 .
- the unique interests of users of the primary video search system would be discounted.
- a weight is applied to the secondary user feedback data.
- the weight is based on the primary user feedback data and a smoothing factor.
- the smoothing factor identifies a threshold quantity of primary user feedback data. As the amount of primary user feedback data approaches the smoothing factor the weight of the secondary user feedback data decreases. When the primary user feedback data is equal to or greater than the smoothing factor, the secondary user feedback data no longer affects the combined quality metric. In this way, the smoothing factor provides a threshold quantity of primary user feedback data, above this threshold the secondary user feedback data is not used.
- the combined quality metrics are not calculated when the quantity of primary user feedback data is greater than the smoothing factor.
- the smoothing factor is selected to balance the risk of bias with the benefits of utilizing the secondary user feedback data.
- the users of the different systems have different preferences which should be respected.
- a small quantity of primary user feedback data allows individuals to skew video search results based on their idiosyncratic preferences. If the smoothing factor is too large then the secondary user feedback data can overwhelm the primary user feedback data, ignoring legitimate differences. If the smoothing factor is too small then the secondary user feedback data is underutilized, resulting in search results being skewed by the idiosyncrasies of a small number of users.
- the smoothing factor is based, in part, on the quality metric being calculated.
- the smoothing factor for the traditional quality metric may be different from the smoothing factor for the targeted interactions quality metric.
- the smoothing factor for the traditional quality metric can be 25; the smoothing factor for the targeted interaction quality metric can be 10,000; and the smoothing factor for the impression quality metric can be 0.
- Other smoothing factors are possible.
- the smoothing factor is also based, in part, on the source of the secondary user feedback data.
- the smoothing factor applied to user feedback data from a general Web search system may be different from the smoothing factor applied to the user feedback data from a dedicated video search system.
- the smoothing factor may be customized for specific video search systems. For example, when utilizing secondary feedback data from a general Web search system, the smoothing factor for the traditional quality metric can be 0.
- the smoothing factor for the targeted interaction quality metric may be 10,000.
- the smoothing factor for the impression quality metric can be 0. Other smoothing factors are possible.
- user feedback data from search systems that have different ranking algorithms can be combined into a combined quality metric based on the following calculations.
- the quality metrics are defined by the fraction
- n represents a measure of targeted interactions with the resource and d represents a measure of a larger set of user feedback, for example, all user interactions with the resource, targeted interactions with any resource provided as a search result, or impressions of the resource.
- the weight applied to the secondary user feedback data is determined based on the following formula
- weight represents the weight
- smooth is the smoothing factor
- d 1 is the size of the larger population of primary user feedback data
- d 2 is the size of the larger population of secondary user feedback data.
- min calculates to the minimum value of two arguments
- max calculates to the maximum value of two arguments.
- the combined quality metric is calculated based on the following formula:
- n 1 is the number of targeted interactions from the primary user feedback data
- n 2 is the number of targeted interactions from the secondary user feedback data
- weight is the calculated weight
- d1 is the size of the larger population of primary user feedback data
- d2 is the size of the larger population of secondary user feedback data.
- FIG. 6 illustrates example search result rankings being adjusted based on combined quality metrics.
- a video “Tree & Plant Care: Palm Trees” 600 , is indexed by two different search systems 602 a , 602 b .
- Each search system maintains user feedback data.
- a first search system 602 a maintains first user feedback data in a data store 606 a .
- a second search system 602 b maintains second user feedback data in a data store 606 b .
- the quality rank modifier engine 604 a for the first search system 602 a uses first user feedback data 606 a to adjust the ranking for search results.
- user interface 608 a shows a search for “palm tree.”
- the video, “Tree & Plant Care: Palm Trees” 600 appears at the top of the rankings.
- the quality rank modifier engine 604 b uses the second user feedback data 606 b combined with the first user feedback data 606 a to adjust the ranking for search results.
- the first user feedback data affects the combined quality metrics for the “Tree & Plant Care: Palm Trees’ video 600 .
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an example process for combining user feedback.
- the example process 700 may be implemented by a quality rank modifier engine, for example the quality rank modifier engine 356 of FIG. 3 .
- search results may be obtained from a search system, for example the index engine 320 of FIG. 3 .
- search results are obtained which are responsive to a query.
- the search results are provided a score based on a ranking algorithm.
- the process obtains primary user feedback data ( 704 ).
- the primary user feedback data represents interactions previous users of the system have had with the search result.
- the primary user feedback data may include the number of targeted interactions, the number of user interactions, and the number of impressions.
- the primary user feedback data may also include user feedback data for other videos, for example, the number of targeted interactions for any video responsive to the query.
- the process obtains secondary user feedback data ( 706 ).
- the secondary user feedback data is user feedback data provided from a second search system.
- the secondary user feedback data represents interactions previous users of the second search system have had with the search result.
- the secondary user feedback data may include the number of targeted interactions, the number of user interactions, and the number of impressions.
- the secondary user feedback data may also include user feedback data for other videos, for example, the number of targeted interactions for any video responsive to the query.
- the process applies a weight to the secondary user feedback ( 708 ).
- the weight applied to the secondary user feedback may be determined based on a smoothing factor, the primary user feedback data, and the secondary user feedback data. In general, the larger the sample size of primary user feedback the smaller the weight applied to the secondary user feedback. For example, if the primary user feedback data contains a small sample set the secondary user feedback has greater weight than if the primary user feedback contains a larger sample set.
- the process aggregates the primary and secondary user feedback data ( 710 ).
- the process calculates combined user feedback data based on the primary user feedback data, the secondary user feedback data and the weight.
- FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of an example system configured to derive a combined quality metric.
- the system generally consists of a server 802 .
- the server 802 is optionally connected to one or more user or client computers 890 through a network 870 .
- the server 802 consists of one or more data processing apparatuses. While only one data processing apparatus is shown in FIG. 94 , multiple data processing apparatus can be used.
- the server 802 includes various modules, e.g. executable software programs, including an analyzer 804 for analyzing the tracking data in order to derive or update predictor and voting functions.
- a quality rank modifier 806 is configured to calculate the quality metrics of a video on the fly using the predictor and voting functions derived by the analyzer 804 .
- the quality metrics can be calculated for videos ahead of time so that the quality rank modifier engine 806 only needs to look up the value for a given video.
- a ranking engine 808 ranks videos responsive to a query which were identified using one or more indexes maintained by the indexing engine 810 .
- the ranking engine 808 can use the quality signal provided by the quality signal engine 806 as an additional input to is ranking algorithm.
