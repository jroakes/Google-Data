The word of system from the set of user's reception and the one or more words extracts calls the input (step 3020) of second inquiry of suggestion alternately.In some embodiments, the user by will be presented at cursor on the display device move on the word in the set with set in word mutual.For example, the web browser can receive user input and determine the user whether cursor is placed on gather in the zone that is associated of word in.The user can be placed on cursor in the zone by handling input equipment (for example mouse or tracking ball).If the web browser determine cursor be placed on gather in the zone that is associated of word in, then the web browser can (for example, in dialog box) shows second inquiry of suggestion.The user can select second inquiry of the suggestion that shows, and the web browser can be imported reception as the user with selecting.
In the example of Fig. 2, the user by cursor is placed on user interface in word " LSAT " or the searching elements that is associated of set 2050a on set 2050a in word " LSAT " alternately.User and the interaction triggers web browser display dialog box 2060 of gathering 2050a, it comprises alternative inquiry 2070 (i.e. " the law school admission LSATs ") of search engine 1030 with it suggestion that is associated with set 2050a.The alternative inquiry 2070 that is presented at the suggestion in the dialog box 2060 can have the embedded hyperlink that points to the webpage that is used for search system 1014.
In some embodiments, search system 1014 is associated second inquiry of a plurality of suggestions with the identity set of one or more words in extracts.The user cursor is placed on gather in the zone that is associated of word in the time, the web browser display comprises the dialog box with second tabulation of inquiring about of gathering all suggestions be associated.The user can select second inquiry of expectation from tabulation.
In some embodiments, when system determined that cursor is placed in the zone that the word in the set with one or more words in extracts is associated, for example system's outward appearance of changing the set of being given prominence to was associated with set to indicate second of shown dialog box and included suggestion to inquire about to the user.In the example of Fig. 2, the demonstration of the set 2050a " LSAT " that adds dashed underline changed into the runic that has shade or color background shown set 2050a.
In some embodiments, when the user was placed on cursor on the searching elements of the word in the set of being given prominence to, the web browser changed the outward appearance (for example, changing into hand shape from arrow) of cursor.In some embodiments, when the user was placed on cursor on the text that has embedded hyperlink, client device 1004 showed the URL of this embedded hyperlink in the status bar of web browser.For example, if the user hovers in second inquiry of suggestion that (that is, cursor being placed on) have embedded hyperlink, web browser second the inquiring about of suggestion that can in status bar, show this embedded hyperlink URL and append to this URL then.
Receive the input of second inquiry of selecting suggestion from the user in system after, search engine 1030 (step 3030) is submitted in second inquiry that system will advise.Search engine 1030 is handled second inquiry of suggestion.System shows second set (step 3040) about one or more Search Results of second inquiry of suggestion that receives from search engine 1030.Search engine 1030 with its mode of returning for any other inquiry return about the suggestion second the inquiry Search Results.Promptly, under the situation in the search text district of the webpage 2000 that new inquiry need not be input to clearly Fig. 2, the user can receive the set about the Search Results of the alternative inquiry 2070 of suggestion by the alternative inquiry 2070 of just selecting to be presented at the suggestion in the dialog box 2060.
In one case, dialog box comprises the navigation enquiry of quoting specific resources, rather than dialog box comprises second inquiry of suggestion.In some embodiments, search system 1014 can be identified as inquiry navigation enquiry and (for example comprise instruction, as the client-side script), described instruction is used for client device 1004 is redirected to the user specific resources of quoting about navigation enquiry when the user selects navigation enquiry webpage.For example, if the set 2050b of user and Fig. 2 " LSAT registration (LSAT registration) " is mutual, then client device 1004 can show the dialog box that comprises navigation enquiry " register for the LSAT ".If the user selects this navigation enquiry, then client device 1004 can be (for example, use is embedded in the hyperlink in the text of navigation enquiry) user is redirected to Law SchoolAdmission Council (the entrance council of the college of law) webpage that is used for online LSAT registration, rather than present the webpage that comprises the Search Results of quoting of the resource that is complementary with inquiry " LSAT registration ".
In some cases, second set about second Search Results of inquiring about comprises from first one or more Search Results of gathering about first Search Results of inquiring about.In some embodiments, when web browser submission second inquiry, search engine 1030 generates with first inquiry and second and inquires about the new Search Results that both all mate.In some embodiments, search engine 1030 is associated the 3rd inquiry of one or more suggestions with the set that is included in about the word in the extracts in second set of second Search Results of inquiring about.
Fig. 4 show be used for will suggestion the instantiation procedure 4000 that is associated with one or more words of alternative inquiry at the extracts of content.For simplicity, will instantiation procedure 4000 be described about the system of implementation 4000.
For first inquiry (for example, the original query that the user submits to), system receives the set of one or more Search Results, and wherein each Search Results is quoted respective resources and comprised the link of pointing to this respective resources and from the extracts (step 4010) of the content of this respective resources.System also receives second inquiry (for example, refine or the inquiry of alternative) (step 4020) of suggestion.In some embodiments, system can receive second inquiry of a plurality of suggestions.As an alternative, in some embodiments, system uses the one or more Search Results that received to generate second inquiry of one or more suggestions.
Second inquiry (step 4030) advised is represented in the set that system is chosen in the one or more words among in the extracts one.For example, system can be chosen in the shortest sequence of whole or most word of the word in second inquiry that comprises suggestion in the extracts.As an alternative, if second inquiry of suggestion is by the expansion of one or more extra words to first inquiry, then system can be chosen in the one or more words that comprise one or more extra words in the extracts.In some embodiments, system changes the content of extracts based on second inquiry of suggestion.For example, system can form extracts from the different segment (for example, be included in second inquiry of suggestion the sections of all words) that respective resources is extracted textual content.
Usually, second of the suggestion inquiry is different from the set of selected one or more words in extracts.For example, second of the suggestion inquiry can have one or more words different with one or more words of selected set or the one or more words that do not find in selected set.In some embodiments, system in the tabulate statistics of importing the follow-up inquiry of carrying out after first inquiry, pre-determines possible the substituting or extra word for first inquiry based on a plurality of users in the session formerly.In other embodiments, the document of system retrieval is used to be defined as second inquiry in the text, its title at these documents of retrieving or the frequent word or expression that occurs in the hyperlink text of pointing to these documents.
In some cases, the set of selected one or more words in extracts is identical with second inquiry of suggestion.In some embodiments, system selects two identical set (for example, set 2050a and the 2050c of Fig. 2) to represent second inquiry of same suggestion.As an alternative, system can select two identical set (for example, set 2050a and 2050c) to represent second inquiry of different suggestions.For example, system can select to gather 2050c " LSAT " and represent second inquiry " law school admission exam (LSAT) " advised, and it is different from second inquiry 2070 of the suggestion of being represented by set 2050a.
Second inquiry that system will advise is associated with the set of selected one or more words in extracts, makes the user to call second of suggestion alternately with the word in the set of one or more words in extracts and inquires about (step 4040).In some embodiments, system is associated second inquiry of a plurality of suggestions with the set of same one or more words in extracts.As mentioned above, the presenting of second inquiry that can call alternately a plurality of suggestions of user and the word in set is used for user's selection.
System carries out mark can call suggestion alternately with the word in the set in extracts with the indication user second inquiry (step 4050) to the set of the one or more words in extracts.System will comprise that the set of Search Results of set of one or more words of mark is sent to client device 1004 and is used for presenting (step 4060) to the user.Client device 1004 can for example present as the webpage that shows in the web browser on running on client device 1,004 2000 Search Results to the user.
In some embodiments, second of the suggestion inquiry generates by the one or more words that substitute in first inquiry with one or more different words.For example, system can come with a word in alternative first inquiry of another word according to the similarity measurement between two words.System can substitute word from word taking passages or the word in the resource (for example, in 30 words of first query terms in resource) identification candidate.In case the identification candidate substitutes word, system (for example can use for example semantic word cluster data storehouse, be grouped into the lexical data base of the word of cognitive synon set, wherein each set is distinct notion) determine two similarity measurements between the word.
In other embodiments, second inquiry of suggestion generates by the sequence with the word in another sequence replacing first inquiry of word, and one of them sequence is the substring of another sequence.For example, system can come to select the alternative sequence of word by the frequency values of more possible alternative sequence from the set of possible alternative sequence.System can come the calculated rate value based on for example counting to the quantity of the document that occurs therein with the first possible alternative sequence that be complementary of inquiry.System can use the inquiry log and the document that are complementary with given inquiry to pre-determine the possible alternative sequence that is used for given inquiry.
In some embodiments, generate second inquiry of a plurality of suggestions.For example, system can generate second inquiry of a plurality of suggestions and the subclass of second inquiry selecting according to predetermined standard to advise, and predetermined standard is the standard of the possibility of the calculating of second of the suggestion inquiry relatively for example.Second inquiry of selected suggestion can be second inquiry that has high likelihood or have the suggestion of the possibility that is higher than predetermined threshold value.
Fig. 5 illustrates the example part of webpage 5000 of the Search Results 5002 of the alternative inquiry 5004 that comprises suggestion.Webpage 5000 comprises original query 5010 " law school " and the set of the Search Results 5005 that returns from search engine (for example, search engine 1030) in response to original query 5010.
For in the ample resources each, Search Results can comprise the title 5020 that is used for this resource, the selectable link 5030 of pointing to this resource and from the extracts 5040 of the content of this resource.Usually, the extracts 5040 of content comprises one or more words, phrase, clause or the sentence that extracts from the textual content of resource.Phrase is the significant sequence of two or more words.Search engine 1030 extracts the continuous sections of textual content or separates sections from resource and forms extracts 5040.Search engine 1030 carries out mark with runic to the word of original query 5010 (, " law " in the example and " school ") alternatively when query terms occurs in extracts.
For example, use extracts or other content information, described the particular technology of the alternative inquiry that is used to generate suggestion in the above from Search Results 5005 or its resource that is associated.For example, the alternative of suggestion inquiry 5004 can comprise the text that directly obtains from excerpt text.As an alternative, in another example, the alternative of suggestion inquiry 5004 can comprise the inquiry of deriving from excerpt text.
When the alternative of the specific suggestion in the alternative inquiry 5004 that the user selects to advise was inquired about, the web browser was submitted the alternative inquiry of this suggestion to, and in response to above-mentioned, search engine 1030 is that the alternative inquiry of this suggestion generates new Search Results.
Fig. 6 shows the instantiation procedure 6000 of the alternative inquiry that is used to call the suggestion that is associated with the Search Results that shows.For simplicity, will be about the system description instantiation procedure 6000 of Fig. 5 and implementation 6000.
