Abstract
Systems and methods are disclosed herein for editing a collaborative spreadsheets hosted on a server. Multiple users may edit the spreadsheet, resulting in situations of intersecting or conflicting edits. A change provided by one user may intersect the cells affected by a change provided by another user. In these cases, one user's change is transformed against the other user's change. In this manner, the conflict is resolved and both changes can be applied to the spreadsheet. Each user device may perform these transforms, and the server may also perform these transforms. This can result in transmission of a reduced volume of data over a network between the devices and the server, in comparison with other methods.

Specific embodiment
To provide thorough understanding of the disclosure, now some illustrative embodiments are described, including in association
Make the system and method that copy paste operation is efficiently performed in electrical form.However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that
, system and method as herein described can be adjusted and be revised as being applied to handled application, and as herein described
System and method can be used in other suitable applications, and such other are supplemented and changed without departing from its scope.
Usually, computerized system as herein described can include one or more assemblies, and it includes processing equipment or multiple equipment,
Such as computer, microprocessor, logical device or one in being configured with for performing Computerized method as herein described
Or the other equipment or processor of multiple hardware, firmware and software.
As used herein, electrical form is the electronic document with the data being included in cell.Cell is arranged
Into array, typically rectangular array.Each cell can be recognized by one or more indexes.In rectangular array, this
A little indexes can be row and column index.Generally, in spreadsheet user interface, line index is represented by Arabic numerals, and
Column index is represented by English alphabet.Although this is conventional embodiment, such as using numeral pair or letter to other
Embodiment is also feasible.Other digital display circuits of such as Rome system and other letters of such as Greek alphabet can be used.
Realize that the software of electrical form can be by storing index different from form shown in user interface.For example, although single
First lattice can have the index " B4 " of user interface, but the index of cell internally can be stored as orderly ranks pair by software
(4,2), represent fourth line and secondary series.
In the user interface, the data included in each cell can be numeral, text string, formula or its combination
Form.Software can store the total data of text string, integer, floating number or its combining form.If electrical form
Cell B4 includes text string " Hello World (your the good world) " (here, the string do not include quotation marks), then character " W " can be with
By index set (4,2,7) quoting, indicate that the character is in the cell in the fourth line and secondary series of electrical form
Comprising string in the 7th character.
Other of index are represented and sorted also feasible.For example, indexing set can be from 0 rather than 1 open numbering, or unit
Position in lattice can be expert at and be positioned with before column index.In some instances, integer and floating number are only row and column index
It is cited and cited in the position in cell.The data of dissimilar types can be included in Single Electron form, is made
A cell of electrical form includes text string, a cell of electrical form includes integer, and electrical form
Another cell includes floating number.Formula can be stored as text string and according to ad hoc rules processing.For example, formula
"=A2+B2 " when being transfused in cell B4 application of instruction Cell display A2 and B2 in cell B4 content sum.
As used herein, the copy paste operation in electrical form be by Client-initiated, one from source range
Or multiple cells copy the operation of data to one or more cells in the scope of destination.The operation can be word
Replicate, and the cell in the scope of destination can after operation comprising with source range in corresponding unit lattice identical in
Hold.Copy and the formula pasted can include absolute or rdative quotation, such as give more detailed description with reference to Fig. 6.Copy-viscous
Patch operation can include piecing together, such as give more detailed description with reference to Figure 11.In tiled copy-paste operation, source model
Enclose the size with destination scope and differ.
Cooperation electrical form can be edited by multiple users of the document storage system based on cloud.When multiple users edit
During a same part for electrical form, in fact it could happen that problem.When this occurs, the scope of the cell edited may
Intersect, cause to quote the potential ambiguity of which cell with regard to each editor.Especially, that what is made at an equipment copies
Shellfish-stickup change can intersect with another change made at another equipment.For example, it may be possible in copy-paste operation
The intersecting position inserting line of destination scope.When this occurs, to cell index change can produce with regard to
Which cell should receive the potential ambiguity of pasting data.
This potential ambiguity is can solve the problem that with reference to the operational transformation of cooperation logic realization.In this way, each sets
It is standby that copy-stickup change can be converted by intersecting change so that copy-stickup change operates in adjusted cell
Scope.If be not effectively addressed, realize that this conversion can between devices produce substantial amounts of network traffics.For example, each
Equipment, can be by the other equipment in data is activation to network all to be pasted used as the part for sending paste command.Though
So easily realize, but if the destination scope pasted is very big, this will result in heavy network traffics.However, in some realities
In applying mode, the copy-stickup instruction of the index by only sending the cell that can include in source range and destination scope,
This flow can significantly be reduced.Each equipment and server can be held further according to cooperation logic to copy-stickup instruction
Row operational transformation.
Perform that copy-paste operation is highly beneficial in this way, reason is the data volume that transmits on network with imitating
Relatively low copy-the paste operation of rate is compared and reduced.Substantial amounts of data transfer can make cooperation electrical form because of the application of equipment
Slow down with network connection and cannot be efficiently used., to copy-paste operation execution operational transformation, can realize by effectively
The benefit of electrical form complex operations, while also realizing the benefit of collaborative document.

The "current" model of the revisions log, the list of change undetermined and document of shelves.State 304 include document model 309, its with
The current document model 307 of Alice is identical.In some instances, server does not preserve current document model, and only preserves undetermined
The list of change and revisions log.In these examples, the state of current document model can be by by revisions log
Whole entries are applied to blank spreadsheet and obtain.
Fig. 3 A to 3D depict Alice and Bob and the cooperation electrical form execution Cross compiling by trust server are operated
Situation.In Fig. 3 A to 3D, Alice performs copy-paste operation, but makes before its change and server sync, Bob insertions
OK, this intersects with the copy-stickup scope of Alice changes.Using operational transformation and coordination logic, the change intersect to these
Coordinate.
From the beginning of Fig. 3 A, Alice, server and Bob all from the same model of collaborative document, respectively such as state
302nd, shown in 304 and 306.In addition, Alice, server and Bob are all from the beginning of revisions number 0.In event 308, Alice
By scope B1:Copy content in B2 is to C1:C2.Used as the result of event 308, the equipment of Alice is in state 312, its bag
Include change 313a and document model 313b undetermined.Change 313a undetermined is corresponding to the change made in event 308.Because in thing
Received change in part 308 is not yet changed, therefore the range of cells in change 313a undetermined and the unit in event 308
Lattice scope is identical.The current document model 313b of Alice is updated to the result of the copy-paste operation for reflecting Alice.Unit
Lattice C1:The content of C2 now with cell B1:Content in B2 is identical.Last synchronous revisions numbers of the Alice in state 312 is still
So 0, reason be Alice change undetermined not yet with server sync.
Before the change to document produced by the copy-paste event 308 of Alice with server sync, Bob makes
Change, as shown in event 310.In event 310, Bob provides input and is inserted in the electrical form that cooperates with being expert between 1 and 2
Enter a profession.Used as the result of event 310, the equipment of Bob is in state 314, its do not have send change, with change undetermined
315a and with document model 315b.Change 315a undetermined is not yet changed corresponding to the change made in event 310.Shape
State 314 also includes document model 315b, and it is updated to reflect changes of the Bob in event 310.As in document model 315b
Shown, already inserted into row, and row 2 is now sky.The content of the row 2 of model 311 has been moved into the row 3 in model 315b.
In state 314, the last synchronous revisions number of Bob is still 0, reason be Bob change undetermined not yet with server sync.
Fig. 3 B are gone to, message 316 is depicted undetermined change of the equipment of Bob by Bob to state 314 and sent to server.
In this example, the Alice from event 308 change by before sending, the change from the Bob of event 310 is sent
To server.This situation may be caused by several factors.For example, before Alice makes its change, Bob may make
Go out its change.As an alternative, change generally may occur simultaneously, or the change of Bob may even occur the change in Alice
Afterwards, but the network connection of Alice may be interrupted or extremely slow.Either of which in these situations may cause server to connect
The change of Alice is received later than the change for receiving Bob.Now, the Bob of the change of the Alice of event 308 and event 310 is more
Change existing intersection, reason be Bob be expert at 1 time inserting line split Alice copy-paste operation scope.Message 316 is included
The content (order of 1 time inserting line of being expert at) of the change of Bob and revisions number.In some instances, each client is by one
It is secondary only to server send one change and will send another change before etc. confirmation to be received.It is such to confirm to pass on
Go out to apply at server and send change.The revisions number sent in message 316 is 0, and the last synchronization for indicating Bob is repaiied
The number of ordering is 0, thus sends change corresponding to the electrical form in the state of revisions number 0 in message 316.However, at some
In embodiment, the revisions number may instead correspond to the revisions number that the equipment intended application of the Bob change should be produced.
In these embodiments, this can be determined by the way that the last synchronous revisions number of the equipment of Bob is incremented by into 1.Send out in message 316
After sending change, the equipment of Bob is in state 320, and it includes sending change 321a and document model 321b.Send more
Change undetermined change 315as of the 321a corresponding to state 314.The current document 321b of Bob does not change from state 314.In addition,
The last synchronous revisions number of state 320 does not also change from state 314.
Server state 318 reflects state of the server after the message 316 for receiving Bob.State 318 does not include repaiies
The entry in daily record is ordered, comprising change 319a undetermined and comprising document model 319b.In state 318, change 319a undetermined
Corresponding to the change of the Bob in message 316.Change 319a is associated comprising instruction (1 time insertion a line of being expert at) with change
The identifier of revisions number (i.e. 0) and the client (Bob) of transmission change.Revisions log is not yet submitted to because changing 319a,
Therefore current document model 319b not yet changes from model 309.
In message 322, the equipment of Alice sends the copy of the Alice of event 308-stickup change to server.Disappear
Breath 322 (will cell B1 comprising change directive:B2 copies cell C1 to:C2 the revisions number) and with change being associated
(i.e. 0).Send in message 322 after change, Alice equipment is in state 324, it includes sending change 325a and text
Shelves model 325b.In state 324, the change 313a undetermined of the state 312 of Alice has been moved into and send change part simultaneously
And show as changing 325a.Model 313bs of the current document model 325b of Alice not from state 312 changes.State
324 last synchronous revisions number (i.e. 0) does not also change from state 312.
After the change of the Alice in message 322 is received, server is then in state 326.In state 326
In, without the entry in revisions log, with two change 327a and 327b undetermined and with document model 327c.Because undetermined
Change 327a was received before change 327b undetermined is received, therefore change 327a undetermined first occurs in lists.It is undetermined more
Change 327a not change from the change 319a undetermined of state 318.Because change 327b second undetermined is received, its second
Occur in lists.Change 327b undetermined is reflected in message 322 change and copying including Alice received from Alice
Shellfish-stickup instruction, it does not change from message 322.Change 327b is also initiated more comprising revisions number (i.e. 0) and client
Change (i.e. Alice).State 326 also depicts current document model 327c.Because being also applied to revisions log without change undetermined,
Therefore model 327c is identical with the model 319b in state 318.
Turning now to Fig. 3 C, state 328 reflect server oldest change undetermined using its (i.e. in state 326 it is undetermined more
Change 327a) after state.State 328 includes revision entry 329a, change 329b undetermined and document model 329c.Bob's
Row insertion is employed at server and is reflected in the first entry 329a of revisions log.Entry 329a includes Bob
The row insertion being expert under 1, and revisions number has been incremented to 1.Entry 329a is also comprising the client (i.e. Bob) for initiating change
Mark.In addition, current document model 329c is updated to reflect entry 329a.As the part for updating, it has been expert at 1 time and has inserted
Enter a profession, and the content of previous row 2 has been moved to row 3.In updated model 329c, row 2 is the blank line of insertion.It is undetermined
Change 329b is comprising the copy-paste operation of Alice and identical with the change 327b undetermined of state 326.
After the change using Bob, message 332 is sent to Alice and will confirm that 330 transmissions to Bob by server.
Instruction of the message 332 comprising applied change (1 time insertion a line of being expert at) and associated revisions number (i.e. 1).Send
Confirmation 330 to Bob is simply to confirm that the change that Bob finally sends has been employed and has carried revisions number 1.In some examples
In, just send another after waiting until receiving confirmation because of each client and change, therefore associated by the relevant confirmation more
Change and do not exist ambiguity.
The client state 326 of Bob illustrates that the equipment of Bob confirms the state after 330 and do not include receiving
Send change, do not include change undetermined and including document model 337.Since Bob receives confirmation 330, the change of Bob is just
Remove from the change of the transmission part of state 336.In state 336, current document model 337 and the previous state 320 of Bob
Model 321b it is identical, but last synchronization revisions number is updated to match the revisions number (i.e. 1) confirmed included in 330.
The equipment of Alice performs three steps shown in event 334 after message 332 is received from server.The
One step, the equipment of Alice converts change that is all undetermined and having sent for received incoming change in message 332.
The operational transformation can be performed using the method 600 of Fig. 6.In some instances, the equipment of Alice can determine that conversion is sent out
Change 339a is sent, reason is that confirmation is not yet received for it.In other examples, the equipment of Alice can determine conversion
Change 339a is sent, reason is the revisions number (i.e. 1) of the last synchronous revisions number (i.e. 0) less than incoming change of previous state 325.
Incoming change in message 332 is applied to second step, the equipment of Alice the document model of Alice.3rd step, Alice's sets
It is standby to be updated to match the revisions number included in incoming message 332 by its last synchronization revisions number.
After the equipment of Alice performs the operation of event 334, Alice equipment is in state 338, and it includes transformed
The change 339a of transmission, do not include change undetermined and including document model 339b.Send change 339a to have been directed towards disappearing
Cease the change in 332 and be transformed and be updated to operate scope B1, B3 and C1, C3.The current document mould of Alice
Type 339b has been updated to the change of application message 332.In model 339b, the original copy-stickup behaviour of document reflection Alice
Make and the row of Bob is inserted.Row 2 is blank, and the content of previous row 2 has been moved to row 3.Additionally, in 339b, unit
Lattice C1 and C3 distinguish matching unit lattice B1 and B3.Converted by the application operating in event 334, the change of transmission of Alice
Range of cells in 339a has been divided into 2 parts.The transformed change 339a of Alice is not to the row 2 of current document
In cell operated.Alternatively, the transformed change of Alice is only to the Operate Cell in row 1 and 3.Pass through
This mode conversion change, to retain the purpose of the change of Alice.When Alice initiates those changes, the insertion of document 339b
Blank line 2 there is not yet, thus Alice can not possibly be intended to change the row.In the state 338 of Alice, last synchronous revision
Number it is updated to 1 to match the revisions number that the change received with message 332 is associated.
Turning now to Fig. 3 D, in event 340, server for the Change All in revisions log since the revisions number 0 come
The change undetermined of conversion Alice.Server can determine change undetermined (the i.e. change of server state 328 of conversion Alice
329b), reason is revisions number (the i.e. entry of server state 328 of the revisions number less than newest revision entry of the change undetermined
Revisions number 1 in 329a).Additionally, in event 340, the change of Alice is applied to revisions log by server.Server makes
With the client by Alice is used in event 334 and the same logic that can be performed using the method 600 of Fig. 6 is become
Change the copy-paste operation of Alice.In both events 334 and 340, the copy-paste operation of Alice is inserted for the row of Bob
Enter operation and be transformed, and the source range and destination scope of the copy-paste operation of Alice is inserted by separate with accommodating Bob
The row for entering.The change caused by event 340 is reflected in server state 344.
Server state 344 includes two revision entries 345a and 345b, and including document model 345c.In state
In 344, the first revision entry 345a keeps not changing from revision entry 329a of server state 328, and revises bar
Mesh 345b has been added into revisions log.The change oldest undetermined of the previous state of revision entry 345b reflection server (takes
The change 329b undetermined of business device state 328).Revision entry 345b comprising Alice transformed copy-paste operation and its
Revisions number 2.Updated document model 345c illustrates the server that the copy-paste operation of Alice is applied to previous version
The result of document 329c so that the content of cell B1 and B3 has been copied into cell C1 and C3.Because of server and Alice
Equipment converts the copy-paste operation of Alice using same logic for the row insertion operation of Bob, therefore server and Alice
Equipment now have identical document model.After the copy-paste operation of Alice to be committed to revisions log, service
Device will confirm that 342 transmissions to Alice, and it simply confirms that the last change of Alice is submitted to revisions log and carrying is repaiied
The number of ordering 2.Again, because in some instances, client device does not send another change, until receiving really from server
Recognize, therefore there is no ambiguity about the change corresponding to the confirmation.
The End-Customer end state 348 of Alice includes document model 349 and reflects that the equipment of Alice is being received really
The state recognized after 342.In end-state 348, the equipment of Alice by the revisions number that it is finally preserved be updated to 2 with
Fit in confirming 342 received revisions number and remove from the list for sending change confirmed change.
Further, after the copy-paste operation of Alice to be committed to revisions log, server is by message 346
Deliver to Bob.The transformed change of message 346 including Alice, the finger of the copy-paste operation of specifically transformed Alice
Order and the revisions number being associated with the change of the submission.After message 346 is received, the equipment of Bob is performed in event 350
Three steps.The first step, because not existing in the change of Bob undetermined or having sent change, therefore will convert without change.If
There is change that is undetermined or having sent on the equipment of Bob, then these changes can by message 346 it is received it is incoming more
Change and be transformed.The operational transformation can be performed using the method 600 of Fig. 6.Second step, the equipment of Bob is by message 346
Incoming change is applied to document model.3rd step, the revisions number that the equipment of Bob finally preserves it is updated to matching in message
Received revisions number in 346.
The End-Customer end state 352 of Bob includes document model 353, not including change undetermined, and does not include sending
Change, and reflect state of the equipment of Bob after the operation of execution event 350.In end-state 352, the equipment of Bob
Its document model is updated to into model 353, it includes and for the incoming change in message 346 to be applied to previous client state
The result of the document 337 of the previous version of 336 Bob.The content of cell B1 and B3 has been copied into cell C1 and C3.
The last preservation revisions number of Bob has been updated to 2 to match the revisions number included in message 346.
In the end-state shown by Fig. 3 D, the copy-paste operation of Alice and the row insertion operation of Bob by
Propagate to the armamentarium in system, including server.Document model 349,345c and 353 all reflects the same of the document
State.In addition, the revisions number of the last change in last preservation revisions number match server revisions log 345b of Alice, Bob
Last preservation revisions number it is similarly such.Importantly, a small amount of information just these renewals of executed for being sent with cross-system.Because institute
The change for stating equipment application identical cooperation logic and operational transformation to coordinate to intersect, therefore each equipment can be answered optimally
Changed with its incoming user for possessing and any necessary conversion is performed to those users' changes and incoming change.That what is changed should
It is because that client device optimally assumes it with the model of latest edition come work with " optimization " is referred to as.However, being
Exempt to cause possible complication by the conflict or intersection change for currently occurring on another, client device is newest by its
Change be stored in send or the list of change undetermined in, until receive the confirmation to the change from server.Because of whole
Equipment is all currently in use the conversion of identical logical sum, therefore repeatedly need not send substantially the same information by cross-server, for example, leads to
Cross and send original change and transformed both changes.Only original change is sent to server, and confirms together with repairing
The number of ordering is received together.By the way that the revisions number is compared with estimated revisions number, each equipment can be performed as needed
Conversion.With reference to Fig. 4 to 6, illustrate and follow thin with the method for operational transformation for performing renewal by client device and server
Section.
Fig. 4 is by the stream of the performed method 400 when for server change to convert user's change of client device
Cheng Tu.As used herein, " user's change " include what is received from the user for directly interacting with local device by local device
Change, and " server change " includes the change that received from server by local device.In one example, server change can
Initially by another user to provide and be transferred into server in remote user equipment (it is away from local device), the clothes
Change is sent to local device by business device again.Although change may be initiated via user at remote equipment, because of realization side
The local device of method 400 receives the change from server, therefore the change is referred to as server change.Can be the step of Fig. 3 C
Method 400 is performed in the 350 of 334 and Fig. 3 D.
In step 402, model of the client device based on storage on a client device displays to the user that electrical form.
Step 404, equipment receives the user input to change electrical form.In step 406, equipment sends user input to service
Device.In step 408, equipment optimally changes its model based on received user input.In some instances, step 406
In reverse order or generally can occur simultaneously with 408.In step 410, client device is from server receives input.
The input for being received can include changing the instruction of electrical form.
At decision box 412, whether client device determines the user input sent in step 406 via server
Confirm.If not yet receiving confirmation, method 400 continues to 414, in this client device for being connect from server
Receipts input come convert sent user input and can using Fig. 6 method 600.Here, in step 414, if service
Device input intersects with user input, then brought by change and solve the conflict.If two are input into and do not intersect, generally do not have
There is change to be affected by the change of step 414.In step 416, user equipment is input into change its last synchronization based on server
Model.Because not yet receiving the confirmation to sending user input, therefore last synchronistic model does not reflect the user input.In step
Rapid 420, user equipment updates its revisions number to match the revisions number received from server in step 410.In step 424, visitor
Family end equipment changes last synchronistic model based on transformed user input.Although client device is based on transformed user
It is input into optimally to modify and show modified model, but because not yet receiving confirmation, therefore last synchronistic model is still
The user input that step 404 is received can not be reflected in.
As an alternative, if client device determine receive from server at decision box 412 it is defeated to sent user
The confirmation for entering, then methods described continue to 415.In step 415, since receiving the confirmation to user input, client
Equipment just updates its revisions number to match the revisions number included in confirming.In step 418, client device is based on from server
Received input is changing its model.In step 422, client updates revisions number to match in step 410 from server
Revisions number included in received input, and return to step 402, to display to the user that electricity based on updated model
Sub-table.
Fig. 5 is to be input into convert the method 500 of the user input at server based on what is received from client device
Flow chart.Can 340 the step of Fig. 3 D in perform method 500.In step 502, server is received to hosted electronic watch
The change of lattice.Change in step 502 is that the user from the client device via network with server communication is received.
At decision box 504, server determines whether change is derived from old revised edition.If change is initially contrast be committed on server
The electrical form of the electrical form older version of the latest edition of revisions log is made, then change may originate from old revised edition.
In some examples, server can be decision making by comparing revisions number.In these examples, server by with received
The associated revisions number of change is compared with the revisions number being associated with the entry of newest submission in its revisions log.If with institute
The associated revisions number of the change of reception is than the numeral less with the revisions number that the entry of the change of newest submission is associated, then
Server can determine that change is derived from old revised edition.If two revisions numbers are identical, server can determine that change is derived from and work as
Front revised edition.
If server determines that change is derived from old revised edition at decision box 504, methods described continues to 506.
In step 506, server has converted change for the Change All since the revised edition being associated with the revisions number of change, and
And can implement the method 600 of Fig. 6.In this way, server compensation has the effect of the distinct device of different revisions numbers.
As an alternative, if server determines that change is not originate from old revised edition at decision box 504, methods described is direct
508 are continued to, in the step, server will change the entry that is committed in revisions log and distribute new revisions number
Give the entry.Change is submitted to remove and based on the change come more in its change daily record undetermined from server at server
The model of new demand servicing device.In step 510, equipment sends a confirmation to once send the user of change.In step 512, server will
Change is sent to the other users for editing collaborative document.The change for being sent in step 512 is in the case of step 506 generation
Can be transformed change, or it can be the change as received in step 502, this depends on decision box 504
As a result.In this way, server converts received user input based on the order of receives input.By based on user
The order that input is received enters line translation to it, and server guarantees that multiple equipment can preserve the mould of similar cooperation electrical form
Type.Because armamentarium all uses the logical sum operational transformation that cooperates with server identical, therefore in the feelings without excessive network traffics
Under condition, similar model is preserved.
Fig. 6 is the flow chart of the method 600 that copy-stickup change is converted by intersecting change.Intersecting change may shadow
Ring the source range or destination scope of copy-stickup change or affect the two scopes.Copy-paste change from the first use
Family, and intersect change from second user.In some instances, the two changes are derived from identical user, but from not
Same equipment.If user logs on the cloud of the distinct device from such as laptop computer and Tablet PC simultaneously
Computing system, then may occur these examples.In some instances, the difference that the two changes are derived from identical device is used
Family.Intersecting scope can be operated because copying-pasting change and intersect change, therefore be there may be between two operations
Conflict.One or more in scope application operating can be become and bring this conflict of solution, so as to according to each user's
Purpose and to cooperate spreadsheet application change.Operational transformation can be by any one in client device and by coordinating more
The server for changing is performing.Can by method 600 be used in the event 334,340 and 352 of Fig. 3 any one, Fig. 4
Operational transformation is performed in the step of step 414, Fig. 5 506 or its any combinations.
In step 602, from user copy-stickup change is received.The change can be from the user of the equipment of implementation 600
Input module is received, or the change can be received from the equipment of another on network, such as from server or user equipment.
Step 604, another user from network receives intersects change.The change can be from the user of the equipment of implementation 600
Input module is received, or it can be received from the equipment of another on network, such as from the server of user equipment.Such as front institute
Discuss, when a same part for multiple user's editing electronic forms, it may occur however that intersect change.When this occurs, just
May intersect in the scope of the cell of editor, cause to quote the potential mould of which cell with regard to each editor in editor
Paste property.Especially, the change of the copy made at an equipment-stickup can with make at another equipment another more
Change intersection.For example, the position inserting line that can intersect in the destination scope of copy-paste operation.
At decision box 606, it is determined that intersecting the type of change.If it is determined that intersect be changed to insert or deletes it is capable or
Row, then methods described continues to 608, in this step, at the position for intersecting change, separates and copy-paste operation
Associated one or more scopes of scope.Separate scope can be the source range of copy-paste operation or destination
Scope.In some instances, source range and destination scope are all separated.Each separate scope is divided into into two parts,
With the impacted part of permission conversion or the index of some.In step 612, it is determined that insertion or the size deleted, this can
Can relate to determine and be inserted into the line number or row number either deleted.
At decision box 618, equipment determines that intersecting change inserts or delete.If it is determined that intersect that insertion is changed to,
Then methods described continues to 624.In step 624, determine that increment is positive quantity and the line number being inserted into is equal on value.
At decision box 618, if it is determined that intersection is changed to delete, then methods described continues to 626.In step 626, it is determined that increasing
Measure for negative quantity and on value be equal to line number to be deleted.In step 628, copy-paste change by step 624 or 626
Determined by increment converting.
Can include increment is added a portion into separate range section by increment transformation copy-stickup change
The index for dividing.Because increment can be for just or be negative, therefore impacted index can be increased or decreased accordingly.For example, if in step
Destination scope is divided into into two parts in rapid 608, a part has less than the index for intersecting the position changed, and another
Individual part has the index higher than the position for intersecting change, then can add increment to higher than the position for intersecting change
The index of the part of index.
If it is insertion to intersect change, the part with the index higher than the position for intersecting change increases can its index
Plus the size of insertion.If insertion is to go insertion, only line index may be affected by increment.If insertion is row insertion,
Only copying-paste the column index of scope may be affected by increment.
Deleting one or more row or columns can be by the side substantially the same with one or more row or columns are inserted
Formula realizing, except index is reduced and non-increasing.Addition negative increment causes the index of the part higher than the position for intersecting change to reduce
The size of deletion.
The index of the cell in adjustment copy-stickup scope has no effect on the content of cell itself, and it is nor affected on
The index of each character in cell included in included string.The index of positioning unit lattice is received only in electrical form
To the impact of this map function.
The index converted in step 628 can be absolute indices or relative indexing.Absolute indices refer to cell
Absolute position in electrical form, and relative indexing refers to relative position of the cell relative to another cell.Definitely
The example of index can be " A1 " or " D12 ".These can respectively refer to row " A ", row " 1 " and row " D ", row " 12 ".Relative datum
Example can be " R2C5”.This can refer to comprising benchmark downward two row of cell and to the right five row cell.With respect to base
Another accurate example can be " R-3C-2”.The relative datum can refer to comprising rdative quotation cell upwards three rows and
To the left two row cell.In step 628, can be by increasing amount adjustment absolute standard or relative datum.In step 630, when
When step 604 receives intersection change, using the intersection change.In step 632, using transformed copy-paste operation.
This, when copy-paste operation is converted in step 628, using the copy-paste operation.To describe with reference to Fig. 7 and 8 with
Copy-paste the intersecting insertion of change and delete the further detail below of row and column.
At decision box 606, if it is determined that it is the operation of setting unit lattice to intersect change, then methods described proceeds to decision box
610.The operation of setting unit lattice is usually to change the operation of one or more cells and can include setting unit lattice
Value, arrange or edit cell lattice formula and arrange or edit cell lattice form.The form of cell can include text
This formatting, such as runic or the frame with oblique font, the size of changing unit lattice and changing unit lattice.These arrange single
First lattice operation may not be needed to separate the scope of copy-paste operation as row or column as inserted or deleting.Sentencing
Determine at frame 610, with reference to the source range and destination scope of copy-paste operation, determine the position that setting unit lattice are operated.
If the position of setting unit lattice operation affects the source range of copy-paste operation, methods described to proceed to step
Rapid 614, in this step, the operation of setting unit lattice is applied to into the commanded part of source range.In step 620, do not having
In the case of conversion, using copy-stickup change.
In decision box 610, if it is determined that the position of setting unit lattice operation affects destination scope, then methods described continues
To step 616, in this step, copy-stickup change is applied by being received.In step 622, by the operation of setting unit lattice
It is applied to the part of the destination scope of its impact.In this way, setting unit lattice operation " is won victory " all the time and is arranged
Operate Cell will not be copied-and paste operation covers.The change of setting unit lattice is described with reference to Fig. 9 and 10 with copy-stickup
The intersecting further detail below of change.
In some instances, setting unit lattice operation can affect both source range and destination scope.Show at these
In example, as shown in fig. 6, each will be processed according to step 614 and 620 pairs of sources, and will be according to step 616 and 622 pairs of mesh
Ground scope processed.By applying the conversion according to method 600, can be by copy-paste operation and intersecting change
Operation is all applied to represent the model of cooperation electrical form, while still catching the purpose of each user.In addition, because with the electricity that cooperates
The change that all devices of sub-table communication are all intersected using the method 600, so reducing network traffics.
Fig. 7 illustrates the inserting line behaviour that how can coordinate according to system and method as herein described from a user
Make the intersecting copy paste operation from another user, while still catching the purpose of the two users.In the figure 7, user
Charlie and Dave are just each editing on different devices cooperation electrical form.State 710 is depicted and is making change
The state of front electrical form.State 720 illustrates cooperation electrical form and is applying the two changes and using herein
Described operational transformation method it is coordinated after state.Charlie initiates copy-paste operation 704, while Dave
Initiate row insertion operation 702.The operation of Charlie and Dave generally occurs simultaneously, so that just performing it at him without user
The change of other users is known during operation.If Charlie and Dave work completely simultaneously, this feelings just may occur
Condition, or if one or two in Charlie and Dave has the very slow network connection of height time delay, it is also possible to there is this
The situation of kind.In arbitrary situation, a user may be unaware that the newest change that can be made by other users.
704, Charlie initiate copy-paste operation with by the copy content of cell D2 to scope D3:D5.Therefore,
Copy-the paste operation of Charlie has source range 712 (cell D2) and (the cell D3 of destination scope 714:D5).
The inserting line 716 between row 3 and row 4 of 702, the Dave in the electrical form that cooperates.
As shown in state 720, original (the cell D3 of destination scope 714:D5) in cell D3 and scope D4:D5 it
Between intersection insertion position be divided into two parts.Next step, the range section with the index higher than separate place is moved down
A line.It is incremented by the index of the part by the size according to insertion, makes the transposition of partial.In this example, a line is inserted, therefore
By the initial protion D4 in state 710:The line index of D5 is incremented by 1, with the part D5 in 720 that must do well:D6.Because showing at this
Row are not inserted in example, so column index (being represented by " D ") is constant.Aforementioned operation conversion is applied to into copy-stickup change
Instruction, rather than electrical form itself.Next step, according to inserting line change and transformed copy-stickup change electricity is changed
Sub-table.
Using the row insertion change of Dave with 3 time insertion a line of being expert at, generation blank line at 4 of being expert at.Elder generation in state 710
The row 5 and 6 that 4 and 5 content that moves ahead has been moved in state 720.After such insertion using the transformed copy-viscous of Charlie

Enclose 1112 and destination scope 1114.As used herein, term " piecing together " description destination scope more than source range copy-
Paste operation.Tiled copy paste operation in, each in scope it is correspondingly sized, the content of source range is more
It is secondary to copy in the scope of destination.In piecing any one that can be used in copy-paste operation as herein described together.Piece together
The source range 1112 of formula copy-paste operation is made up of two cells, and the two cells are cell A1 and A2.Cell
A1 includes text " AA ", and cell A2 includes text " BB ".The destination scope 1114 of tiled copy-paste operation by
Scope C2:12 cells composition in E5.
After to the spreadsheet application tiled copy-paste operation that cooperates, state 1120 reflects the result of the operation.
State 1120 includes cell and the cell in scope 1124a-m of destination in source range 1122a-b.Cell
1122a-b does not change, because they are all the source unit lattice of operation.Cell 1124a-m now includes the cell pieced together
The content of 1122a-b.Because destination scope 1114 is more three times greater than source range 1112 in row size, will in row size
Source unit lattice piece three times together with generation state 1120.Additionally, because scope 1114 is expert at than the big twice of source range 112 in size,
So the cell in destination scope 1112 is expert in size piecing together twice with generation state 1120.If destination scope
1114 have included additional row (for example, if it is on the contrary by scope C2:E6 is constituted), then be expert in size still can be by for source range 1112
Only piece together twice with generation state 1120.Can be for piecing mesh together greater in size than the multiple of scope 1112 because scope 1114 is expert at
And be rounded up to immediate integer, so can this thing happens.
For a user, highly desirable may piece together, because user can be with the input of minimum time by minority source unit
Lattice are copied in very big destination scope.If however, imappropriate process is pieced together, when implementing to spell in cooperation electrical form
During patch, the excessive transmission data on network may be caused.If the data in the scope of destination are with some in its entirety or complete
Portion is transferred into the other equipment on network, such as server and other client devices, and just possible this thing happens.Such as
Fruit implements to piece together in this way to the cooperation electrical form shown in state 1120, then cell can be transmitted on network
Text in each in 1124a to m.Therefore, the data for transmitting on network are in proportion with destination scope, with
Just data transfer may be quite big.
If however, by the network only transmission instruction and range index and realize piecing together in cooperation electrical form,
And independently perform at each local device and piece together, then can reduce data transmission.Example shown in state 1120
In, it is only necessary to other equipment will be sent to the specified of source range and destination scope, no matter source range or purpose on network
How is the size of ground scope, only produces fixed data volume.In some instances, it is also possible to transmit the number included in source range
According to together with copy-stickup instruction.In these examples, the data volume for transmitting on network is in proportion with source range, its
The size of destination scope may be still much smaller than.These examples cause network traffics less than the data of destination scope with its entirety
