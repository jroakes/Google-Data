Background technology
Fig. 1 has illustrated the principle according to traditional cellular communication system 100 of prior art.The geographic area is divided into a plurality of sub-districts 101,103,105,107, and each sub-district provides service by base station 109,111,113,115.The base station interconnects by fixed network, its can be between base station 101,103,105,107 Data transmission.Base station by the residing sub-district of mobile radio station provides service by wireless communication link for this mobile radio station.In the example of Fig. 1, mobile radio station 117 provides service by base station 109 on Radio Link 119, and mobile radio station 121 provides service by base station 111 on Radio Link 123, or the like.
When mobile radio station moved, the overlay area that it can be moved to another base station by the overlay area of a base station promptly moved to another sub-district from a sub-district.For example, mobile radio station 125 initially provides service by base station 113 on Radio Link 127.When its when move base station 115, it enters the overlapping covered of two base stations 111 and 113, and in this overlapping region, it is changed into by base station 115 and supports on Radio Link 129.When mobile radio station 125 moved further into sub-district 107, it continued to be supported by base station 115.This is called as transfer (handover) or the switching (handoff) of mobile radio station between the sub-district.
Typical cellular communication system typically extends to whole country with the overlay area, and comprise hundreds of or even thousands of sub-district, it supports thousands of or even millions of mobile radio stations.Communication from the mobile radio station to the base station is called as up link, and the communication from the base station to the mobile radio station is called as down link.
The fixed network of interconnection base station can be operated and is used for route data between any two base stations, make thus in the sub-district mobile radio station can with the mobile station communicate in any other sub-district.In addition, fixed network comprises the gateway function that is used to be interconnected to external network (such as PSTN (PSTN)), allows mobile radio station to communicate with land line phone and by other communication terminals that land line is connected thus.And fixed network comprises the required many functions of cellular communications networks that are used for management legacy, comprises the function that is used for route data, access control, resource allocation, user's charging, mobile radio station authentication etc.Base station self can be considered to the part of fixed network.
The frequency range of distributing to cellular communication system typically is subjected to strict restriction, and therefore must be between mobile radio station divide resource effectively.The base attribute of cellular communication system is by being divided into different sub-districts, geographically resource to be divided.Like this, can give the sub-district of regulation with a certain amount of resource allocation, reduce resource allocation thus adjacent sub-district in the moment of regulation.In order to make the capacity optimization of cellular communication system, importantly be make the interference that causes by other mobile radio stations or to other mobile radio station interference influence minimum.The important advantage of cellular communication system is, because wireless signal is with range attenuation, therefore the interference that is caused by the communication in the adjacent sub-district is insignificant in distance sub-district enough far away, and so resource in this sub-district, can reuse.In addition, typically by in time domain, frequency domain and/or sign indicating number territory divide resource, in a sub-district or between the sub-district, resource is divided.Different communication systems is used the different principles that is used for this division.Depend on the current load of communication system, resource allocation can be static state or dynamic, and typically uses the combination of static resource allocation and Dynamic Resource Allocation for Multimedia.
First generation analog communication system is used frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system, and its frequency domain is used to the resource division between the sub-district.In these systems, frequency range is divided into the narrow band channel that typically has the 25kHz bandwidth.Give each base station with this channel allocation of some, and when conversation is set up, will distribute concrete narrow band channel that is used for uplink communication and the narrow band channel that is used for downlink communication to each mobile radio station.
Current, the most general cellular communication system is the second-generation system that is called as global system for mobile communications (GSM).Be similar to analogue system, frequency range is divided into the channel of narrow relatively 200kHz, and to one or more this frequency channels of each base station assigns.Yet than analogue system, each frequency channels is divided into 8 independently time slots, and it allows to reach 8 mobile radio stations and uses each frequency channels.This method of sharing available resource is called as time division multiple access (TDMA)." The GSMSystem for Mobile Communications " at Michel Mouly and Marie Bernadette Pautet, Bay Foreign B ooks, 1992, can find the further description of GSM tdma communication system among the ISBN2950719007.
In being called as the second generation communication system of IS95, and in third generation communication system, used another principle of resource distribution such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS).These systems are divided into one or several broad-band channels with frequency range, and for UTMS, it has the bandwidth of 5MHz.Typically, all using a wideband frequency channel to be used for up link in the sub-district, and using different wideband frequency channel to be used for down link.In this case, the separation between the sub-district realizes by using spread spectrum, the distinctive long user's spreading code in sub-district that wherein has been each cell allocation.
In these systems, signal and spreading code to be transmitted double, and it has typically the big a lot of spreading rate of data transfer rate than signal.Therefore, narrow band signal is expanded to wideband frequency channel.In receiver, received signal doubles by identical spreading code, causes producing again original narrow band signal thus.Yet, can not separate spread spectrum by the multiplication in the receiver from the signal of the sub-district of the different spreading code of having of other, and remain broadband signal.Therefore,, can remove most interference, separate the spread spectrum narrow band signal with receiving this from these signals by to separating the filtering of spread spectrum narrow band signal.
Use the consequence that spread spectrum brought to be,, and therefore will reduce the signal-to-jamming ratio of received signal by the interference signal amount in the removable bandwidth that is in narrow band signal of filtering.Therefore, the most far-reaching importance that it had is, makes the interference optimization between the base station, so that make the capacity maximum of system.At " the WCDMA for UMTS " of Harri Holma (editor), Antti Toskala (editor), Wiley﹠amp; Sons, 2001, can find the description of wideband CDMA (WCDMA) pattern of the further description, particularly UMTS of CDMA among the ISBN 0471486876.
Along with the rapid increase of the use of mobile communication system, particularly cellular communication system in recent years, the demand of resource is significantly increased.Therefore, additional frequency bands has been allocated for cellular communication, and making has a plurality of frequency ranges typically to can be used for mobile radio station at present.For example, present many GSM carriers have the permission that covers several frequency ranges, and these frequency ranges comprise:
PGSM: initial (main) is used for the frequency range of GSM, and its covering is used for 890～915MHz of up link and is used for 935～960MHz of down link.
GSM 1800: be also referred to as DCS or DCS 1800.This frequency range covers 1710～1785MHz that is used for up link and the 1805～1880MHz that is used for down link.Many operators have the permission of GSM 900 or GSM 1800 frequency ranges, and some operator has the permission that covers whole two frequency ranges, perhaps reaches common protocols with other operators, and allowing independently, network uses whole two frequency ranges.
EGSM: this is to be called as the additional frequency bands of expanding GSM.This frequency range has been added 880～890 frequency range that is used for up link and 925～935 frequency ranges that are used for down link for the PGSM frequency range.
In initial GSM standard, only specified GSM 900 frequency ranges, and therefore early stage GSM mobile radio station only has the single ability of using this frequency range.And, become more prevalent although have the mobile radio station of the ability of using whole or most of frequency range, for the cost reason, many mobile radio stations are manufactured to only has the use ability of the subclass of available frequency range in theory.Therefore for typical cellular communication system, the colony of mobile radio station has covered wide limit of power, and for resource management, importantly the ability at given mobile radio station distributes, and resource allocation is optimized.
The other method that is used to increase the cellular communication system capacity is to use floored community.Like this, the less sub-district that is called as Microcell or picocell is arranged in the bigger sub-district that is called as macrocell.Microcell and picocell have very little overlay area, allow reusing of very approaching frequency thus.Macrocell usually is used for providing additional capacity in the zone of dense distribution and hot spot region.Yet,, importantly, the resource allocation between the different districts is optimized in order to make the capability of communication system optimization.Therefore, resource allocation becomes very crucial and complicated process, particularly for having a plurality of frequency ranges, and wherein all or some frequency range have the system of floored community.
And many operators have had the permission of third generation cellular communication system, such as UMTS.Typically be island, overlay area (island of coverage) with these system configuration, wherein the overlay area is limited to typically less separate areas.Among these zones and the service between the zone will provide by second-generation system, therefore such as UMTS, and can expect that most of third generation mobile radio station will be a dual mode mobile station, it can be worked in the second generation and third generation communication system.Therefore in these systems, between the frequency range of different communication systems, must carry out further careful management to resource allocation.
Be clear that it is crucial and complicated day by day that resource management becomes, and importantly carry out optimized as far as possible management for resource allocation, so that make the capability of communication system maximum, and the optimal service to the user is provided.Therefore, a large amount of resource allocation algorithms, particularly handoff algorithms have been developed.Yet these algorithms tend to not consider middle resource allocation or the switching of different frequency range or system, perhaps tend to use very simple criterion.Particularly, when whole GSM mobile radio stations tends to have the PGSM ability, and when only having subclass to have the ability of using other frequency ranges in history, use simple standard, wherein all mobile radio stations with multiband ability switch to new frequency range.For example, in the PGSM and GSM 1800 systems of combination, when GSM 1800 base stations can be used for mobile radio station, all two-band mobile radio stations switched to GSM 1800.
Yet this very simple method is to lack very much flexibility, and in many cases, can not cause the optimized utilization of resources.For example, on GSM 1900, be used for the required transmitting power of two-band mobile radio station, caused the interference of remarkable increase thus apparently higher than the transmitting power on PGSM.Therefore, current method has caused the capacity that reduces of communication system and at the service of user's deterioration.Therefore, the improved system that is used for resource allocation is favourable.

Embodiment
Hereinafter, mainly the preferred embodiments of the present invention are described by reference GSM cellular communication system.Yet, it is evident that the present invention can be applicable to many other communication systems, comprise, for example, third generation cellular communication system.
In cellular communication system, fixing infrastructure typically comprises the function of the complexity that is used for the management resource distribution, especially for the function of leading subscriber unit switching.Subscriber unit typically can be wireless user equipment, mobile radio station, communication terminal, personal digital assistant, kneetop computer, embedded communication processor or any communication element that communicates by air interface.
Fig. 2 is the diagram of the simplification of gsm communication system structure.In typical GSM cellular communication system, a large amount of base station controller (BSC) 201 (not shown) are connected to main switching centre (MSC) 203.MSC is central switching center, and the communication between the exchange different B SC, and the subscriber unit that is thus connected a BSC can be communicated by letter with the subscriber unit relevant with other BSC.In addition, MSC is responsible for being connected to other networks, carries out authentication, certain mobile management etc.MSC 203, and BSC 201 typically, are connected to OMC operation and maintenance centre (OMC) 205, and it is the operation of Virtual network operator monitor network and the place of performance.Typically, multiple operational factor can be set at the OMC place, and it can be passed to other network element, such as BSC.Like this, the operation of network can manage by OMC 205.BSC is connected to a plurality of base station transceivers (BTS) 207, and it is responsible for communicating by letter with the subscriber unit in the related cell by air interface.
Typically, switching control function is distributed between the function of BSC and relevant BTS.Like this, in a preferred embodiment, cellular communication system is included in the switching controls subsystem that distributes between BSC and the BTS.In addition, this communication system comprises the subsystem that is used to set up about the physical channel of concrete logic channel, handles initial system's setting and renewable variation etc. is set.
For example, when the radio condition that needs switch appears in the identification of this switching controls subsystem, processing measurement report information and collection/provide channel interference level measured value.In database, it also stores the parameter of the timing of control survey value average treatment from the storage of these measurements.These data are used to carry out required measured value average treatment.Switching controls is handled and is also made the measured value that relates to the side frequency that is received from subscriber unit be mapped to the frequency of adjacent sub-district.When information of adjacent cells and network appearance variation, suitable modification is carried out in the relevant data storehouse.The switching controls subsystem can be determined, except measuring based on subscriber unit, needs for other reasons to switch.These reasons can comprise, the load of different districts, time trail etc.
This switching controls subsystem further comprises the handover evaluation subsystem, and its response needs the judgement of switching, assessment handoff candidate person.The judgement that needs to switch comprises the tabulation of determining candidate cell.Person's tabulation that this handover evaluation subsystem responsible rearranges the handoff candidate is so that select best candidate handover cell.If switch is inner (that is, switch to such BTS, it is identical with current service BTS, is in same BSC control down), and then this switching controls subsystem self is handled and switched.Otherwise, be outside if switch, then this handover evaluation subsystem sends handoff request message to fixed network.This message comprises the information of relevant selected candidate cell, and is delivered to target BTS.
This switching controls subsystem further comprises the conversation explorer, and it is responsible for selecting Radio Resource based on cell load and channel interference level.It also arranges the request to Radio Resource, selects linking number, dynamically changes the Traffic Channel setting, follows the tracks of the data on the idle channel interference level, and report resource indication rank.In addition, this switching controls subsystem depends on MSC priority, operator's priority and obtainable resource, selective channel voice rate and Speech version.
As previously mentioned, this switching controls subsystem responsible monitors the measurement report from subscriber unit in communication process.The GSM subscriber unit can monitor nearly 64 neighbours.This subscriber unit sends information to the switching controls subsystem, its relevant such signal level, the i.e. pilot signal of these subscriber unit reception neighbours' incoming level at this signal level place.In addition, it also sends such information, decoding of its relevant neighbours' base station identity code, incoming level, the quality of reception, time trail, the power level of Serving cell, whether has activated discontinuous transmission and which user list is used for this measurement.
At switching controls subsystem place, measured value is asked on average, and in this average treatment, used the database parameter that indicates number of measurements.The switching controls subsystem uses the parameter that subscriber unit is measured then, and switching is made decision, and changes power level and changes the time trail.Handover trigger is typically based on following standard (according to priority orders):
The quality of reception (up link)
The quality of reception (down link)
Interference level (up link and down link)
Received signal intensity (up link)
Received signal intensity (down link)
Distance (time trail)
Power budget (PBGT)
In communication process, for any reason listed above, it is necessary that switching becomes.In a preferred embodiment, communication system is utilized a plurality of frequency ranges, and subscriber unit is set in the database of switching controls subsystem allows the frequency range that switches to.The judgement that switches to which sub-district is usually based on the power budget algorithm.The example of the algorithm of a power budget is:
PBGT
(n)=adjacent sub-district received signal power-Serving cell received signal power
＝neighbour_rxlev_dl
(n)-[server_rxlev_dl+PWR_C_D]
Wherein:
● server_rxlev_dl and neighbour_rxlev_dl
(n)It is the signal level of the pilot signal of the signal level of the respectively service signal of Serving cell and the current adjacent sub-district measured by subscriber unit.
● PWR_C_D is the correction factor about Serving cell, and it is corresponding to the power level difference of measuring between service signal and the total power pilot signal.
Usually, switch to adjacent sub-district with peak power budget.
At present, the GSM user's in the current whole world 80～90% belong to slowly mobile and stable category.Dispose network layering or classification and mean, bigger spectrum efficiency, coverage and capacity can be provided.Yet introducing hierarchy needs careful resource management, and therefore existing handoff algorithms is revised by the calculating of customization power budget.In hierarchical system, typically used multiple different power budget algorithm simultaneously.The concrete example of a traditional handoff algorithms is such handoff algorithms, wherein only just allows Microcell to switch to macrocell where necessary.Therefore, carry out conventional power budget algorithm at adjacent Microcell, and subscriber unit switches to the Microcell with best power budget.Only when not having the Microcell that acceptable quality is provided, just consider macrocell.If do not determine acceptable Microcell, then carry out the power budget algorithm, and subscriber unit switches to the Target cell of confirming thus at adjacent macrocell.
Therefore, for performance and the service of optimizing cellular communication system, importantly, has the switching controls subsystem of the resource distribution of managing all available Resource TOCs effectively.The usefulness of handoff algorithms aspect resource management depends on the service distribution in the carrier network medium frequency and the concrete ability of the subscriber unit in this network.For example, in two-band (for example, PGSM/GSM1800) in the network, only there is the little subclass of subscriber unit to have the ability of using GSM 1800 frequency ranges in history, therefore, if feasible, then the handoff algorithms subscriber unit that makes all have GSM 1800 abilities switches to these frequency ranges.Yet present most of subscriber station can work in two frequency ranges, because most of subscriber unit is switched to GSM 1800, so this algorithm has caused uneven resource load.This has caused the increase of disturbing and has therefore reduced service quality and capability of communication system.For example, in the PGSM/EGSM/DCS1800 network, perhaps in the GSM-GPRS-UMTS network, it is complicated more that situation becomes, and be clear that, needs meticulousr algorithm.
Most recently used handoff algorithms tendency is designed to have and is no more than two frequency ranges, and when this algorithm of design, most of subscriber unit mainly only can work in a frequency range (that is, PGSM).Yet during this period, the ability of subscriber unit is greatly improved, and has the distribution of various subscriber units at present in network now.And, some network frequency range (PGSM, EGSM, GSM1800, PCS1900) of having multiple technologies (GSM, GPRS, UMTS, CDMA2000, IS95, IS136) and being disposed now.According to preferred embodiment, a kind of system more flexibly that is used to switch is provided, it has caused the capacity of increase and the service quality of improvement, has less call drop simultaneously.
According to preferred embodiment, the switching controls subsystem is determined suitable handoff candidate person based on the measurement result of subscriber unit.Particularly, be considered to effective switching target in order to make adjacent sub-district, must satisfy such standard, promptly it points out to obtain the acceptable performance about this neighbour sub-district.Therefore, this standard has guaranteed that at the power level place of the good conversation of the BTS support that enough makes this sub-district, subscriber unit receives potential switching target.If the subscriber unit place is higher than threshold value RXLEV_MIN about the incoming level of adjacent sub-district
(n), then should be considered to effectively the neighbour sub-district, be input in potential candidate's the tabulation, wherein threshold value RXLEV_MIN can be set in the switching controls database
(n)
Standard 1:rxlev_ncell
(n)＞rxlev_min
(n)
Wherein:
Rxlev_ncell is the handled nearest average received signal strength about these neighbours, and rxlev_min
(n)It is the threshold value of database definition.
According to preferred embodiment, the handoff candidate person who satisfies standard 1 is arranged in the potential handoff candidate person tabulation of classification.Usually, arrange the handoff candidate person, and initiate switching at adjacent sub-district with peak power budget according to power budget.Yet in a preferred embodiment, the priority of employed Resource TOC has been further considered in handoff candidate person's ordering.Like this, in a preferred embodiment, a plurality of Resource TOCs have been pointed out.For example, these catalogues can corresponding to the available different frequency range of the different layers of layered cell structure combination.Therefore, the two-band layering the layer in catalogue can be, for example:
Catalogue 1:PGSM microbedding
The grand layer of catalogue 2:PGSM
Catalogue 3:GSM 1800 microbeddings
Catalogue 4:GSM 1800 grand layers
In other embodiments, different catalogues can be limited to available frequency range.In this embodiment, can use and be used for traditional algorithm of between the Microcell of each frequency range and macrocell, selecting.In other embodiment, this catalogue can comprise other available resource, and it comprises other interworking communication systems, such as UMTS or other third generation system.
In a preferred embodiment, resource response catalogue priority is carried out handoff candidate person's ordering.In simple embodiment, handoff candidate person's ordering is such, and promptly all handoff candidate persons of preferred catalogue arrange the most highly, thereby are in the top of tabulation.This method has been described, the diagram of the example of this figure is handoff candidate person's formation in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3 shows first tabulation 301, and it is corresponding to the handoff candidate person's 305～321 who is arranged according to power budget by the switching controls subsystem formation.As can be seen, candidate 3305 has best power budget, and its back is candidate 6307 and candidate 4309.Therefore, the common switching of initiating at handoff candidate person 3305.Yet according to preferred embodiment, by considering the priority of different resource catalogue, the person tabulates to rearrange the handoff candidate.In example, Resource TOC simply is present in the different frequency ranges.One in these frequency ranges is preferred frequency range, and for example, it can be preferred for making subscriber unit as much as possible to switch to GSM 1800.Therefore, the person that rearranges the handoff candidate makes all handoff candidate persons of preferred frequency range move to the top, promptly arranges the most highly.Fig. 3 has illustrated the tabulation 303 that rearranges, and wherein because candidate 4309 is the handoff candidate persons with preferred frequency range of peak power budget, so it arranges the most highly.Its back is the candidate 7313 and 2319 that has used preferred frequency range equally.Candidate 3305 now is arranged as the 4th best candidate.Therefore, after rearrangement, initiate switching at candidate 4, rather than candidate 3.
According to preferred embodiment, by determining distribution configuration, determine random value, and respond this random value and random distribution configuration about the communication element of communication system about a plurality of Resource TOCs, a Resources allocation in a plurality of Resource TOCs is distributed resource.Particularly, in a preferred embodiment, communication element is a subscriber unit, and Resource TOC mainly comprises the Radio Resource catalogue.
Fig. 4 is the diagram of the element of switching controls subsystem 400 according to an embodiment of the invention.
Switching controls subsystem 400 comprises distribution configuration processor 401, and it determines communication element (such as subscriber unit) (such as different frequency ranges) suitable distribution on different Resource TOCs.For example, distribution configuration processor 401 can determine, in the communication system that comprises corresponding to two Resource TOCs of two different frequency ranges, subscriber unit should be an equal distribution.Therefore, for each catalogue, definite distribution configuration is 50%.In certain embodiments, the configuration that distributes is not to determine according to the distribution of subscriber station, but determine according to distribution of resource.This is particularly advantageous in such system, and promptly wherein resource requirement is changed significantly between subscriber unit.
Switching controls subsystem 400 further comprises generator, is used for definite random value about communication element.In a preferred embodiment, this generator is a randomizer 403, and it produces random number, is used to seek to switch to the subscriber unit of adjacent sub-district.Randomizer 403 and distribution configuration processor 401 are connected to catalogue priority processor 405, and it determines preferred Resource TOC based on this random number and the configuration that distributes.
In simple embodiment, between random value and at least one Resource TOC, used mapping.For example, in a preferred embodiment, the scope of the probable value of random number is divided into the interval corresponding to each Resource TOC.The probability of selecting interval size to be used in order to the relevant catalogue of correspondence.Therefore, if randomizer has produced equally distributed number between 0～100, and the probability that first frequency range is used is 30%, and the probability that second frequency range is used is 70%, then between the setting area, the interval that makes the frequency range of winning is 0～29, and the interval of second frequency range is 30～100.
Catalogue priority processor 405 is connected to the handoff candidate person sorts processor 407, its response is about the power budget of the adjacent sub-district of difference, and it is made amendment according to selected preferred resources catalogue, and handoff candidate person tabulation is sorted.Particularly, in a preferred embodiment, power budget handoff candidate person tabulates and resequenced, and makes the top that is arranged in tabulation corresponding to the neighbours of preferred resources catalogue, and is illustrated as the concrete example among Fig. 3.
The handoff candidate person processor 407 that sorts is connected to switch controller 409, and the handoff candidate person is selected in handoff candidate person tabulation of its response rearrangement.Typically, initiation is at five-star handoff candidate person's switching.Yet if this switching can not be carried out for some reason, for example, because therefore this handoff candidate person's overloaded base stations also refuses handoff request, switch controller 409 advances, and initiates the switching at next candidate in the tabulation.
Switch controller 409 shown in Fig. 4 is connected to the remainder of the fixed network that is used to control switching.Yet, it is evident that switching controls subsystem 400 can realize with any suitable form with in any suitable position, and in a preferred embodiment, the switching controls subsystem has formed the part of fixed network, and specifically is distributed between the BSC and BTS that supports Serving cell.
In another embodiment, distribution configuration processor 401 is connected to randomizer 403, and it is connected to catalogue priority processor 405.In this embodiment, random value is the weighted value that the Response Distribution configuration is weighted.Particularly, the mapping that catalogue priority processor 405 uses is fixed, and thus, for example, anyly be lower than 50 random number and will cause first frequency range to be chosen as preferred frequency range, and any random number of 50 of being higher than will cause second frequency range to be chosen as preferred frequency range.Yet in this case, randomizer 403 does not produce uniform random number, but produces the random number that reflects the configuration that distributes.For example, the selecteed probability of configuration regulation first frequency range is 30% if distribute, and the selecteed probability of second frequency range is 70%, and then randomizer 403 comprises the weighting operation, the number that make to produce 30% between 0～50, and should number 70% between 50～100.
Therefore, according to described embodiment, the priority approach by is at random determined the decision and the selection of switching, as by about the programmable weights of each Resource TOC or setover illustrated.For example, depending on (for example) is preferred frequency range in particular moment, by the randomness probability, selects the preferred resources catalogue.A concrete example is, if in network, there are three frequency ranges, then PGSM is that preferred probability can be set to 20%, the probability of EGSM is set to 40%, and the probability of DSC 1800 is set to 40%, and the subscriber unit of two frequencies is higher than working in addition to suppose to have the ratio of subscriber unit of PGSM ability.This allows the bigger biasing to latter two frequency range, the subscriber unit that has the ability that switches to these frequency ranges thus will may be operated more like this, has stayed those and can not be in subscriber unit on the PGSM frequency range.Therefore, this is provided with the uniform distribution that can cause subscriber unit, will cause required subscriber unit to distribute but can be set to make resource allocation.
And typically, the service conditions that the configuration that distributes can response communication system is dynamically upgraded.For example, if current service conditions has too high ratio on first frequency range, then the probability about this frequency range can be provided with very low, distribute until reaching more uniformly, raise this probability this moment once more.
Fig. 5 is the diagram of flow chart 500 of the method for resource allocation according to an embodiment of the invention.
In step 501, the beginning handoff procedure.The suitable method that can use any detection to switch comprises that the quality that detects current link is not enough.In addition, perhaps replacedly, can continuously carry out this method, and if the person that has the handoff candidate satisfy the certain conditions set, then can initiate to switch.These conditions can comprise, for example, about the threshold value of the power budget overshoot of adjacent sub-district, perhaps adjacent sub-district is available on the preferred frequency range of determining.Therefore, the method self according to described embodiment can trigger switching.
In step 503, determine whether changing method should comprise consideration preferred resources catalogue.Particularly, determine promptly to make and to use the frequency range priority mode about database is set whether has such parameter set of switching controls subsystem.If not, then this method advances to step 505, carries out handover evaluation and selection according to traditional changing method.
If be provided with the frequency range priority mode, then this method advances to step 507, wherein produces the configuration that distributes.This configuration that distributes is preferably disposed about the required switching distribution of subscriber unit, and is preferably such that this switching distribution will cause the required resource distribution on the resource requirement catalogue.
In step 509, produce random value.This random value is random number preferably.This method advances to step 511 then, wherein determines the preferred resources catalogue, such as preferred frequency range.This preferred resources catalogue is that the response random value and the configuration that distributes are determined, and is preferably such that, has obtained the required switching probability about each Resource TOC.In a preferred embodiment, select preferred frequency range in order to satisfy the probability that derives from the configuration that distributes.
In step 513, the handoff candidate person rearrangement of tabulating makes that the handoff candidate person corresponding to the preferred resources catalogue arranges the most highly.In step 515, the handoff candidate person who selects to arrange the most highly is as the handoff candidate person, and this method ends at step 517, begins suitable switching.
Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, Virtual network operator can be controlled the probability that subscriber unit switches to concrete Resource TOC.This will guarantee guiding service to all available resources, can control resource distribution thus and can be that all Resource TOCs flush.This provides system very flexibly, and wherein the whole resource distribution in the network can manage by very simple process, and this process only needs considerably less control input.Be provided with and easily upgrade, and therefore resource distribution is dynamically upgraded, adapt with the service conditions that changes.And at the current rank of Resource TOC, this system can upgrade and customize neatly.Therefore, it provides based on actual frequency range and layer expands the flexibility of random chance, and is disposed at the technology in the carrier network.Particularly, handoff algorithms not only needs to relate to the frequency range such as PGSM, EGSM and DCS 1800, and can expand considering other catalogue, such as, about PCS 1900, CDMA 2000, IS95, IS136, GPRS, UMTS and the GSM of grand layer and microbedding.
Therefore,, use the required random algorithm of the probability assignments that switches to layer or sub-district, the biasing about Resource TOC (perhaps away from Resource TOC) is provided based on configuration and the handover parameter values of distributing.This algorithm is easy to realize, and can realizes under the traffic load information prerequisite that does not require on other layers.
For example, according to preferred embodiment, do not need to be provided with permanent preferred frequency range to obtain the resource distribution of regulation.But can be provided with about using the random chance of different frequency range.For example, if they are set to 33.33%PGSM, 33.33%EGSM and 33.33%DCS 1800, then service distribution evenly distributes on whole frequency.Yet if also there is microbedding PGSM in network, this can cause the PGSM frequency range in the grand layer to have less load than other two frequency ranges in the grand layer.In this case, when selecting PGSM as preferred frequency range this moment, subscriber unit will tend to go to microbedding PGSM frequency range, some overcurrent by the service of grand layer PGSM frequency range occur.Yet,, can easily manage this situation by revising the configuration that distributes.Therefore, probability is set to reflect existing of macrocell layer, will causes, for example, probability is set to PGSM 46%, EGSM 27% and DCS 180027%.Being provided with by these, is uniformly on the whole frequency of service distribution in grand layer, full use the frequency range in the microbedding.Therefore, under the situation of not using special Microcell algorithm, realized the full use of microbedding.
The configuration that distributes can be that fix or semi-permanent.For example, it can be set to reflect available Resource TOC and the preferred distribution between them.Yet the configuration that distributes preferably dynamically updates, and in addition, perhaps replacedly, it depends on one or more and communication system setting and/or the relevant parameter of service conditions.
Therefore, distribution is disposed the distribution of the ability that preferably responds the subscriber equipment in the cellular communication system and is determined.Therefore, in certain embodiments, considered the ability of subscriber unit, particularly, considered that subscriber unit uses the ability of different Resource TOCs.
Therefore, in one embodiment, when probability is set, consider the distribution of the ability of subscriber unit in the network.This allows the efficient resource distribution in nonuniformity (non-homogenous) communication system, and to use multiple Resource TOC, wherein the ability of the subscriber unit of this nonuniformity communication system has big and variable variation.For example, service distribution still can be dispersed on the whole available frequency range equably, even only there is the certain user station to have GSM 1800 abilities, and all subscriber units have PGSM and EGSM ability.For example, if 50% subscriber unit has GSM 1800 abilities, and all subscriber units have PGSM and EGSM ability, in addition, have the PGSM microbedding, then the probability about the configuration that distributes is set to PGSM 25%, EGSM 10% and last DCS 180065%.This has caused on the professional whole frequency that is evenly distributed in the grand layer, and microbedding has obtained full use simultaneously.Therefore,, obtained the very effective utilization of resources, caused interference that reduces and the capacity that therefore increases by making the load in each grand layer even.
In certain embodiments, consider the network configuration strategy, particularly, use macrocell, Microcell and picocell to determine the configuration that distributes, realize required resource distribution thus.Therefore, a plurality of Resource TOCs can be corresponding to the different hierarchical layer of cellular communication system.Like this, by very simple control method, might realize the required distribution in the load of different layers.And, can have this load of control on the hierarchical layer of different frequency range.
In certain embodiments, the configuration that distributes is determined in the distribution that can respond cell load.For example, the load of monitoring communication system continuously.Therefore, if determined that the load of the sub-district of a Resource TOC is heavy, and the load of the sub-district of other Resource TOCs is not heavy, then changes the configuration that distributes, in order to the Resource TOC of further biasing light load.Therefore, if the load of GSM1800 sub-district is heavy, and GSM 900 is not like this, and then GSM 900 frequency ranges are selected as the probability increase of preferred frequency range.
In certain embodiments, at least one Resource TOC is corresponding to different communication systems.Therefore, switch the Resource TOC that not only can consider corresponding to (for example) different frequency range, but also comprised all available Resource TOCs.At present, many GSM carriers have disposed the third generation system with the gsm system synthetic operation.Particularly, third generation subscriber unit typically can switch between the second generation and third generation communication system, such as switching between GSM and UTMS.Therefore, in these situations, distributing, preferably the Resource TOC with two communication systems is relevant in configuration.In addition, in limit of consideration of the present invention, it can be applicable to have the communication system of a plurality of sub-communication systems.Particularly, the second generation and third generation communication system can be regarded as the independently sub-communication system of same communication system.
Need be at each independently definite switching selection of handover event according to the configuration that distributes.But, in one embodiment, official hour at interval in, fixedly install about the preferred resources catalogue of each Resource TOC.In this embodiment, the Response Distribution configuration is provided with the time interval about the priority of each Resource TOC, and resource allocation responds this time interval.In this embodiment, do not produce concrete random value or random number, but the moment of response handoff request is determined random value (perhaps in fact can be the moment of handoff request or triggering).Therefore, depend on the moment of handoff request, select the preferred resources catalogue.Because complexity and the unordered essence of radio condition, the switching instant in the network is at random, therefore will realize required random distribution.
Therefore, as concrete example, first frequency range is set, making it at the appointed time in (for example 5 minutes) is preferred frequency range.At the end in this time interval, second frequency range is set, making it is preferred frequency range at the appointed time.By changing the length in this time interval, can obtain required switching and distribute.For example,, then obtained uniform distribution if second time interval also was 5 minutes, if but it was set to 10 minutes, then realized strong biasing at second frequency range.
In another embodiment, this time interval is fixed, and for example 5 minutes, but at the end of each Fixed Time Interval, response probability distributes and random value is selected new frequency range.Therefore, in this embodiment, random value is not only to produce at a subscriber unit is special, but identical random value is used for all attempt switching in this time interval subscriber unit.In this embodiment, realized required resource distribution by such frequency, promptly each frequency range all is selected as preferred frequency range under this frequency.
In certain embodiments, resource allocation comprises, depends on the preferred resources catalogue and revises at least one handoff parameter.Particularly, in one embodiment, revise power budget, in order to reflect current preferred resources catalogue about each handoff candidate person.Particularly, at all handoff candidate persons of preferred resources catalogue, preferably make the predetermined amount of power budget skew.For example, for all adjacent sub-districts that utilize preferred frequency range, can make and measure power budget increase (for example) 6dB.
Fig. 6 illustrated according to this embodiment of the invention, to the rearrangement of the handoff candidate person's of Fig. 3 tabulation.
In this example, the handoff list of responding power budget 301 orderings has the candidate 3 that is arranged in highest point, and its back is candidate 6 and 4.Yet than the embodiment of Fig. 3, current embodiment does not move to the candidate of all preferred frequency ranges the top of this tabulation.But it makes the predetermined amount of power budget skew of the candidate of preferred frequency range.Like this, candidate 4,7 and 2 power budget have increased this amount.The power budget value that responds this skew then rearranges the candidate handoff list, tabulates 601 in order to the power budget handoff candidate person through compensation to be provided.As illustrated in fig. 6, the compensation of candidate 4 makes the power budget that is higher than candidate 3 and 6 about the power budget of this candidate, so candidate 4 is preferred handoff candidate persons.Yet the compensation of candidate 7 only causes this candidate to have the power budget that is better than candidate 6, and it still is inferior to candidate 3.Therefore, candidate 3 is second high handoff candidate persons, and its back is candidate 7 and 6.After rearrangement, tabulating through the power budget handoff candidate person of compensation 601 is used for initiate switching.
Therefore, this embodiment provides setovering more flexibly and accurately at the preferred resources catalogue.And it has guaranteed, when having better available Resource TOC, it is target that subscriber unit will can not be attempted with the Resource TOC with poor power budget value.It has stipulated that when carrying out the rearrangement of candidate list, the result can automatically consider whole preferred resources catalogue factor, Microcell factor and power budget factor together.Therefore, it has stipulated that when conditions permit, subscriber unit will remain on the microbedding, if perhaps it is on the grand layer, then attempts to switch to microbedding, as its first selection.Point out that as Fig. 6 when the candidate of preferred resources catalogue has the power budget value of appropriateness for other candidate, preferred catalogue candidate will tend to the skew of tabulation top.Yet if the candidate of preferred resources catalogue has unsuitable power budget value, another candidate is to select about first of switching target.Obviously, the level of biasing depends on the predetermined value that is used for this skew.
It is evident that the present invention can realize in any suitable manner or in any suitable position.Particularly, the present invention can realize in the subscriber unit of fixed network and/or cellular communication system.
For the implementation of subscriber unit, the present invention can, for example main in the process of idle pulley, realize the selection or the reselecting in the program of sub-district of the sub-district of subscriber unit.In this case, which frequency subscriber unit preferably can determine to select energetically or invest which frequency.Preferably, in this implementation, preferably send or broadcasting be used for determining the distributing multiple parameter of configuration, such as the distribution of the ability of the load of available Resource TOC, each sub-district and subscriber unit by fixed network.
The present invention can realize in any suitable manner, comprises hardware, software, firmware or their any combination.Yet the present invention preferably is embodied as the computer software that moves on one or more data processor.The element of embodiments of the invention and parts can be positioned at core network, Radio Access Network, subscriber unit or any suitable physics or functional position.In fact, can be in single unit, in a plurality of unit or as other the part of functional unit, realize this function.Therefore, the present invention can realize in single unit, perhaps can physically or functionally be distributed in the communication system.
