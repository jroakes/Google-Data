Definitions
- existing ranking techniques rank the academic events based on measures of cross-event paper citations. For example, if a paper at conference A and a paper at conference B both cite papers at conference C, the ranking of conference C will increase relative to other conferences being searched.
- This existing approach for ranking academic events does not take into account the importance of program or editorial committees at conferences/journals/workshops. This existing approach further cannot be used when there is not historical data of citations available for a conference. Many conferences may not have cited papers, and this existing ranking technique does not work when a conference does not have cited papers (i.e., all non-cited conferences will get the same ranking).
- a computer-implemented method may include determining members of a committee of an event and obtaining metrics associated with the committee members. The method may further include ranking documents associated with the event among other documents based on the obtained metrics. According to another aspect, a computer-implemented method may include obtaining parameters associated with committee members of multiple academic events. The method may further include determining scores for ranking results of a search for one or more of the multiple academic events based on the obtained parameters.
- a computer-implemented method may include determining multiple metrics associated with committee members of an academic event and assigning a score to the academic event based on the multiple metrics. The method may further include using the assigned score to rank a document associated with the academic event among other documents.
- a computer-implemented method may include receiving a search query related to an academic event of multiple academic events, the academic event having a committee with one or more members. The method may further include searching a corpus of documents associated with the multiple academic events based on the search query to produce a set of search result documents and ranking the set of search result documents based on metrics associated with the one or more committee members of the academic event.
- a computer-implemented method may include obtaining metrics directly associated with multiple events. The method may further include ranking the multiple events among one another based on the obtained metrics. According to yet another aspect, a computer-implemented method may include determining members of a committee of an event and obtaining metrics associated with the committee members. The method may further include ranking the event among other events based on the obtained metrics.

Abstract
A system receives a search query related to an academic event of multiple academic events, the academic event having a committee with one or more members. The system searches a corpus of documents associated with the multiple academic events based on the search query to produce a set of search result documents. The system ranks the set of search result documents based on metrics associated with the one or more committee members of the academic event.
Description
RANKING ACADEMIC EVENT RELATED SEARCH RESULTS USING EVENT MEMBER METRICS
BACKGROUND Field of the Invention Implementations described herein relate generally to data searching and, more particularly, to searching data related to academic events. Description of Related Art
Existing data aggregation services (e.g., Google) search out, and aggregate, content published on web pages throughout the Internet. In response to a search query from a user, the data aggregation service, using a search engine, searches the aggregated content and presents to the user web pages from the aggregated content relevant to the query. The web pages may be ranked using various existing ranking techniques.
When searching content related to academic events (e.g., academic conferences, workshops, journals), existing ranking techniques, for example, rank the academic events based on measures of cross-event paper citations. For example, if a paper at conference A and a paper at conference B both cite papers at conference C, the ranking of conference C will increase relative to other conferences being searched. This existing approach for ranking academic events does not take into account the importance of program or editorial committees at conferences/journals/workshops. This existing approach further cannot be used when there is not historical data of citations available for a conference. Many conferences may not have cited papers, and this existing ranking technique does not work when a conference does not have cited papers (i.e., all non-cited conferences will get the same ranking).
SUMMARY
According to one aspect, a computer-implemented method may include determining members of a committee of an event and obtaining metrics associated with the committee members. The method may further include ranking documents associated with the event among other documents based on the obtained metrics. According to another aspect, a computer-implemented method may include obtaining parameters associated with committee members of multiple academic events. The method may further include determining scores for ranking results of a search for one or more of the multiple academic events based on the obtained parameters.
According to a further aspect, a computer-implemented method may include determining multiple metrics associated with committee members of an academic event and assigning a score to the academic event based on the multiple metrics. The method may further include using the assigned score to rank a document associated with the academic event among other documents.
According to an additional aspect, a computer-implemented method may include receiving a search query related to an academic event of multiple academic events, the academic event having a committee with one or more members. The method may further include searching a corpus of documents associated with the multiple academic events based on the search query to produce a set of search result documents and ranking the set of search result documents based on metrics associated with the one or more committee members of the academic event.
According to a further aspect, a computer-implemented method may include obtaining metrics directly associated with multiple events. The method may further include ranking the multiple events among one another based on the obtained metrics.
According to yet another aspect, a computer-implemented method may include determining members of a committee of an event and obtaining metrics associated with the committee members. The method may further include ranking the event among other events based on the obtained metrics.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Consistent with aspects of the invention, metrics associated with program or editorial committees associated with academic events may be used for ranking documents and/or content associated with those academic events. The academic events may include, for example, conferences, workshops or journals. Program or editorial committees of academic events may typically be organized by senior researchers (e.g., researchers with PHDs). Committee members of academic events, thus, will typically have a number of citations to their credit. Citations of committee members of academic events, among other metrics, may be used for ranking search results of documents related to academic events.
A "document," as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may include, for example, an e-mail, a website, a business listing, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, a web advertisement, a digital map, etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page.
Documents often include textual information and may include embedded information (such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as Javascript, etc.). "Documents" as used herein may additionally include articles or papers published in journals, or with respect to conferences or workshops. A "link," as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any reference to/from a document from/to another document or another part of the same document.
OVERVIEW
HG. 1 illustrates an exemplary overview of an implementation of the invention that scores academic events based on metrics associated with program or editorial committee members of the academic events. The academic events may include, for example, conferences, workshops or journals. As illustrated, academic events 100-1 through 100-N (collectively referred to as "academic event 100") may each include a respective program/editorial committee 110-1 through 110-N (collectively referred to herein as "program/editorial committee 110"). Each program/editorial committee 110 may include one or more members 120. Various member metrics 130, as will be further described below, may be associated with each member 120 of a committee 110.
During a search of content or documents related to academic events, a set of documents 140 may be obtained. The set of documents 140 may be ranked 150 based on the committee member metrics 130 to produce a set of ranked documents 160 that are ordered based on the member metrics 130. Prior to ranking, member metrics 130 may be used to score each academic event 100-1 through 100-N, and the scores for each academic event 100-1 through 100-N may further be used in the ranking process. Other metrics (not shown), directly associated with the academic events, but not with committee members of the events may be used additionally, or alternatively, to member metrics 130, as further described below. EXEMPLARY NETWORK CONFIGURATION
FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a network 200 in which systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may be implemented. Network 200 may include multiple clients 210 connected to one or more servers 220-230 via a network 240. Two clients 210 and two servers 220-230 have been illustrated as connected to network 240 for simplicity. In practice, there may be more or fewer clients and servers. Also, in some instances, a client may perform one or more functions of a server and a server may perform one or more functions of a client.
Clients 210 may include client entities. An entity may be defined as a device, such as a personal computer, a wireless telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a lap top, or another type of computation or communication device, a thread or process running on one of these devices, and/or an object executable by one of these devices. Servers 220 and 230 may include server entities that access, fetch, aggregate, process, search, and/or maintain documents in a manner consistent with the principles of the invention. Clients 210 and servers 220 and 230 may connect to network 240 via wired, wireless, and/or optical connections.
In an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention, server 220 may include a search engine 225 usable by users at clients 210. Server 220 may implement a data aggregation service by crawling a corpus of documents (e.g., web pages) hosted on data server(s) 230, indexing the documents, and storing information associated with these documents in a repository of crawled documents. The aggregation service may be implemented in other ways, such as by agreement with the oρerator(s) of data server(s) 230 to distribute their documents via the data aggregation service. Search engine 225 may execute a search using a query, received from a user at a client 210, on the corpus of documents stored in the repository of crawled documents. The query may, for example, be directed at searching for documents related to one or more academic events, such as, for example, conferences, workshops, or journals. Server 220 may provide, to a user issuing a query, a ranked list of documents related to the one or more academic events. The list of documents may be ranked based on metrics of committee members of the one or more academic events, as described in more detail below.
Data server(s) 230 may store or maintain documents that may be crawled by server 220. Such documents may include data related to academic events, such as, for example, academic conferences, workshops, or journals. Such documents may further include data related to published news stories, products, images, user groups,
geographic areas, or any other type of data. For example, server(s) 230 may store or maintain news stories from any type of news source, such as, for example, the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time magazine, or Newsweek. As another example, server(s) 230 may store or maintain data related to specific products, such as product data provided by one or more product manufacturers. As yet another example, server(s) 230 may store or maintain data related to other types of web documents, such as pages of web sites.
While servers 220-230 are shown as separate entities, it may be possible for one of servers 220-230 to perform one or more of the functions of the other one of servers 220-230. For example, it may be possible that servers 220 and 230 are implemented as a single server. It may also be possible for a single one of servers 220 and 230 to be implemented as two or more separate (and possibly distributed) devices. Network 240 may include one or more networks of any type, including a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), an intranet, the Internet, a memory device, or a combination of networks. The PLMN(s) may further include a packet-switched sub-network, such as, for example, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD), or Mobile IP sub-network. EXEMPLARY CLIENT/SERVER ARCHITECTURE
FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of a client or server entity (hereinafter called "client/server entity"), which may correspond to one or more of clients 210 and/or servers 220-230, according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention. The client/server entity may include a bus 310, a processor 320, a main memory 330, a read only memory (ROM) 340, a storage device 350, an input device 360, an output device 370, and a communication interface 380. Bus 310 may include a path that permits communication among the elements of the client/server entity.
Processor 320 may include a processor, microprocessor, or processing logic that may interpret and execute instructions. Main memory 330 may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that may store information and instructions for execution by processor 320. ROM 340 may include a ROM device or another type of static storage device that may store static information and instructions for use by processor 320. Storage device 350 may include a magnetic and/or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive.
Input device 360 may include a mechanism that permits an operator to input information to the client/server entity, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and/or biometiic mechanisms, etc. Output device 370 may include a mechanism that outputs information to the operator, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc. Communication interface 380 may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables the client/server entity to communicate with other devices and/or systems. For example, communication interface 380 may include mechanisms for communicating with another device or system via a network, such as network 240.
The client/server entity, consistent with the principles of the invention, may perform certain operations or processes, as will be described in detail below. The client/server entity may perform these operations in response to processor 320 executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such as memory 330. A computer-readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device and/or carrier wave.
The software instructions may be read into memory 330 from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device 350, or from another device via communication interface 380. The software instructions contained in memory 330 may cause processor 320 to perform operations or processes that will be described later. Alternatively, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to
implement processes consistent with the principles of the invention. Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software. EXEMPLARY ACADEMIC EVENT SCORING PROCESS
FIGS.4A-4D is a flowchart of an exemplary process for scoring academic events based on event committee member metrics consistent with principles of the invention. The process exemplified by FIGS.4A-4D may be performed by server 220, or by another entity separate from, or in conjunction with, server 220. The exemplary process of FIGS. 4A-4D may be selectively repeated for each academic event of multiple academic events.
The exemplary process may begin with obtaining the names of members in the event committee of academic event j (block 400) . The event committee may include the program or editorial committee of the conference, workshop or journal. The names of members in the event committee of academic event j may be obtained by extracting the names from existing data sources, such as, for example, the Science Citation Index (SCI), CiteSeer or Scholar. FIG. 5 graphically illustrates obtaining multiple committee member names 500-1 through 500- z from program/editorial committee 110 of academic event 100. Citations and co-authors of the committee members of event j may be obtained (block 405). The citations and co-authors may be obtained from existing data sources, such as, for example, the Science Citation Index (SCI), CiteSeer or Scholar. The citations for each of the committee members may include a number of the citable instances of academic work for which each committee member is an author or contributor. The co-authors of each of the committee members may include the named co-authors on each of the citable instances of academic work on which each member is a named author. FIG. 6 graphically illustrates obtaining citations and co-authors for each committee member 600-1 through 600-x of program editorial committee 110 of academic event j 100. As shown in FIG. 6, citations 610-1 through 610-x and co-authors 620-1 through 620-x may be obtained from an existing data source for respective committee members 600-1 through 600-x.
The number (N1) of citations per committee member i of event j may be counted (block 410). Using the citation data obtained in block 405 above, the number (N1) of citations per committee member may be counted, as graphically illustrated in FIG. 7. As shown in FIG.7, the citations 700-1 through 700-x for respective committee members 600-1 through 600-x may be counted. Counts of respective citations 700-1 through 700-x results in a number (Nj) of citations 710-1 through 710-x for each respective committee member.
The number (E1) of committee members of event j may be counted (block 415). FIG. 8 illustrates the counting of program/editorial committee members 600-1 through 600-x of program/editorial committee of academic event j 100 to produce a count equaling the number (Ej) 800 of committee members of event j.
The average number (E2) of citations per committee member of event j may be determined (block 420) as follows:
where N; may refer to a number of citations for committee member i. FIG. 9 illustrates a determination of the average number of citations per committee member 900. As shown in FIG.9, the number of citations 710-1 through 710-x for each respective member may be summed and divided by the number of committee members (Ei) to produce the average number of citations (E2) per committee member 900.
The sum of citations (E3) for all committee members of event j may be determined (block 425). As shown in FIG. 10, the number of citations 710-1 through 710-x for all of the committee members 600-1 through 600-x of program/editorial committee 110 may be summed to produce the sum value E3 1000.
The number of years (E4) the event j has been arranged or published may be determined (block 430). As illustrated in FIG. 11 , each year 1100- 1 through 1100-z that academic event j has been arranged or published may be counted to determine the value E41100. Other metrics, directly associated with the academic event but not with the event committee members, may additionally, or alternatively, used. Such metrics may, for example, include:
1) important topics associated with the event (e.g., keywords in a list);
2) an identification of the publisher of the journal or conference/workshop proceedings; 3) dates associated with the event (e.g., submission deadlines, notification to authors dates, deadlines for camera-ready papers, event date(s));
4) other events corresponding to the event (e.g., a workshop belonging to a conference);
5) Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to the event home page and/or to pages associated with event committee members; 6) description/abstract describing the event and its scope;
7) registration fees and instructions for the event;
8) address of the event; and/or
9) an identification of a sponsoring institution (e.g., IEEE, ACM1 etc.)
Committee members of event j that have been co-authors may be grouped together, and the number of the groups (E5) whose members do not partially overlap with other of the groups may be counted (block 435). As shown in FIG. 12, papers 1200-1 through 1200-z may be identified that have authors and/or co-authors that are committee members. The co-authors for each paper 1200 maybe grouped together in respective groups 1210-1 through 1210-z. Each group 1210 maybe compared to count a number E5 1220 of the groups 1210-1 through 1210- z whose members do not partially overlap with other of the groups. Committee members of event j that have cited each other may be grouped together, and the number of groups (Eg) whose members do not partially overlap with other of the groups may be counted (block 440). As illustrated in FIG. 13, groups of committee members may be grouped together who have authored/co-authored papers that cite other committee members in the group. For example, in a first group 1300-1, paper 1310-1, authored by member_l, cites paper 1310-2, authored by member_2, and cites paper 1310-3, authored by member_3. Paper 1310-2, authored by member_2, cites paper 1310-1, authored by member_l, and cites paper 1310-3, authored by member_3. Paper 1310-3, authored by member_3, cites paper 1310-2, authored by member_2, and cites paper 1310-1, authored by member_l. In a second group, group 1300-x, paper 1310-4, authored by member_4, cites paper 1310-5, authored by member_5. Paper 1310-5, authored by member_5, in turn, cites paper 1310-4. Thus, in group 1300-1, papers authored by a first group of committee members all cite one another and, in group 1300-x, papers authored by a second group of committee members all cite one another, with no overlap of committee members between group 1300-1 and 1300-x. Based on the grouping, as shown in FIG. 13, a number of groups (Eg) 1320 whose members do not partially overlap with other of the groups may be counted.
The percentage of committee members (E7) that have written papers for past years of event j may be determined (block 445). As illustrated in. FIG. 14, members 1400 that have written papers for each past year of event j maybe determined, and the percentage of committee members (E7) 1410 for a current year of event j that have written papers for past years of event j may be determined.
The average number (E8) of papers written by committee members of event j may be determined (block 450) as follows:
where nk equals a number of papers written by committee member k. As illustrated in FIG. 15, each committee member 600-1 through 600-x has a respective group of papers 1500-1 through 1500-x that each member has written. A number (n^) of papers 1510-1 through 1510-x that each member has written can be counted, and an average number (E8) 1520 may be determined by summing the number (n^) of papers for the k committee members and dividing the sum by the number of committee members Ej.
A score (score_eventj) may then be determined for academic event j (block 455):
/=8 score _everc£y. = ^T w,.E/ Eqn. (3)
I=I
Each Ei in Eqn. (3) corresponds to a metric obtained in blocks 415-450 above that may further be normalized (e.g., between 0 and 1). Default weights Wi ...W8 may be set equal to 1. In some implementations, weights W2 (for average citations per member) and W4 (for number of years published/arranged) may be increased to a value greater than 1. In other implementations, weights W5, We and W7 may be set to negative values (e.g., to avoid increasing the scores of very tight research communities). FIG. 16 graphically illustrates the determination of the score (score_eventj) for academic event j 100 via the weighted sum of the normalized metrics.
A number (fj of academic events in which each committee member i of event j participates maybe determined (block 460). As shown in FIG. 17, a number of different academic events 1700-1 through 1700-x, including event j 100, that each committee member 600-1 through 600-x participates in may be determined. A total score (total_score_event,) for event j maybe determined (block 465) as follows: total_score_eventj = score_eventj + W9 *Navg Eqn. (4)
where Navg may refer to the normalized average of f, for all members in the committee for event j and W9 may be set equal to a default value of 1. In some implementations, weight W9 maybe adjusted downwards to account for committee members who may be members of many program/editorial committees even though they may not be highly ranked themselves. The total score (total_score_eventj) may subsequently used (see the exemplary process of FIG. 18 below) for ranking documents related to academic events among one another. The documents related to academic events may include, in some implementations, articles or papers published in journals or with respect to conferences of workshops. The total score, for example, may be used in a linear sum combination with existing search engine scoring techniques for ranking documents related to academic events among one another. Other metrics associated with event committee members may be used in addition to, or as alternatives to, those members described above with respect to blocks 415, 420, 425, 435, 440, 445, 450 and 460. These metrics associated with event committee members may include, for example, an identification of institutions or universities that individual committee members are associated with, contact information for individual committee members, or URLs to web pages associated with event committee members.
EXEMPLARY ACADEMIC EVENT RELATED DOCUMENTS RANKING PROCESS
HG. 18 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for ranking a set of search result documents that are related to one or more academic events based on the event committee member metrics consistent with principles of the invention. The process exemplified by HG. 18 may be performed by server 220, or by another entity separate from, or in conjunction with, server 220. The exemplary process may begin with the receipt of a search query related to one or more academic events (block 1800). A user at a client 210 may issue a search query related to the one or more academic events to search engine 225 via network 240. A corpus of documents may then be searched based on the received search query to obtain a set of search result documents related to the one or more academic events (block 1810). The search result documents may include, for example, web sites or web pages related to academic events, or articles or papers associated with the academic events (e.g., articles or papers published in journals, or with respect to conferences or workshops). Documents stored at data server(s) 230 may have been previously crawled, and indexed, by server 220, or by a crawling engine associated with server 220, to produce the corpus of documents searched by search engine 225. HG. 19 illustrates the set of search result documents 1900 obtained by search engine 225 based on the received search query. The set of search result documents may be ranked based on the scores for each academic event associated with each document of the set of search result documents (block 1820). The scores for each academic event may include the scores (total_score_eventj) obtained above with respect to the exemplary process of HGS. 4A-4D. As shown in FIG. 19, the document scores 1910, obtained in the exemplary process of FIGS.4A-4D, may be used to rank 1920 the set of search result documents 1900 and produce a set of ranked documents 1930. The document scores 1910 may be used (e.g., in a linear sum combination) with existing search engine scoring for ranking documents related to academic events among one another. In one implementation, for example, the search result documents may include articles or papers published in journals, or with respect to conferences or workshops, and the articles or papers may be ranked among one another. The score of their corresponding conference, journal or workshop may, thus, be used to rank each article or paper of a set of articles or papers among one another. CONCLUSION
The foregoing description of implementations consistent with principles of the invention provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings, or may be acquired from practice of the invention. For example, while series of acts have been described with regard to HGS.4A-4D and 18, the order of the acts may be modified in other implementations consistent with the principles of the invention. Further, non-dependent acts may be performed in parallel. In addition to ranking documents associated with academic events, aspects of the invention may be applied to ranking the academic events themselves among one another using the metrics directly associated with the academic events or using the metrics associated with the academic event committee members. Aspects of the invention may also be applied to ranking events other than academic events, or for ranking documents associated with events other than academic events. For example, metrics associated with events such as beauty pageants may be used for ranking documents associated with the beauty pageants, or for ranking the events themselves among one another. As another example, metrics associated with committee members of events (e.g., beauty pageants) may be used for ranking documents associated with the events, or for ranking the events themselves among one another. Any type of event may be ranked consistent with principles of the invention.
It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that aspects of the invention, as described above, may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures. The actual software code or specialized control hardware used to implement aspects consistent with the principles of the invention is not limiting of the invention. Thus, the operation and behavior of the aspects have been described without reference to the specific software code, it being understood that one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to design software and control hardware to implement the aspects based on the description herein.
No element, act, or instruction used in the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the invention unless explicitly described as such. Also, as used herein, the article "a" is intended to include one or more items. Where only one item is intended, the term "one" or similar language is used. Further, the phrase "based on" is intended to mean "based, at least in part, on" unless explicitly stated otherwise.
