Abstract
Improved methods for coding an ensemble of pulse vectors utilize statistical models (i.e., probability models) for the ensemble of pulse vectors, to more efficiently code each pulse vector of the ensemble. At least one pulse parameter describing the non-zero pulses of a given pulse vector is coded using the statistical models and the number of non-zero pulse positions for the given pulse vector. In some embodiments, the number of non-zero pulse positions are coded using range coding. The total number of unit magnitude pulses may be coded using conditional (state driven) bitwise arithmetic coding. The non-zero pulse position locations may be coded using adaptive arithmetic coding. The non-zero pulse position magnitudes may be coded using probability-based combinatorial coding, and the corresponding sign information may be coded using bitwise arithmetic coding. Such methods are well suited to coding non-independent-identically-distributed signals, such as coding video information.

Referring now to the accompanying drawing for wherein referring to identical element using same reference numerals all the time herein, illustrate and
Describe using the various views and embodiment of the method for statistics property coded pulse vector, and it is possible to describe other
Embodiment.These figures are not drawn necessarily to scale, and in some cases, exaggerate and/or simplify in some places
Accompanying drawing, this is for exemplary purposes.One of ordinary skill in the art should be based on the example below of possible embodiment and understand
Many possible applications and deformation.
In addition, before describing in detail according to embodiments of the invention, it should be observed that, embodiment mainly possesses and numeral
Video coding conciliates the method and step of code-phase pass and the combination of equipment, to reduce the institute in the communication of such digital video signal
The necessary bandwidth for needing.Therefore pass through to represent apparatus assembly and method and step, equipment in position with conventional symbols in the accompanying drawings
Component and method and step illustrate only those details of the understanding of embodiment for the present invention, not have with having benefited from
One of ordinary skill in the art of description provided herein and accompanying drawing is by the unnecessary details disclosure being readily apparent.
Used as the general introduction of factorial pulse code (FPC), FPC is the technology of application in coded audio sequence.Although
It is generally directed to meet any quantization independent same distribution of following basic constraint for audio compression application and development, but FPC
(i.i.d) Laplce (Laplacian) stochastic signal xiIt is operated：
Wherein, x={ x0, x1..., xn-1It is that comprising integer-valued quantized signal vector, n is vector length, and m is
The sum of unit value " pulse " in vector x so that all vector elements are in scope-m≤xiIn≤m.It has been found that being derived from side
The total N of peculiar pulse combined is in the frame of video of journey 1：
Wherein, F (n, k) is the quantity of the combination of k nonzero element of n vector position：
D (m, k) is the quantity that the pulse of m unit value can fall the combination on k non-zero element, (wherein, k≤
m)：
And 2kIt is the quantity of the peculiar symbol combination of k non-zero position.It is in the total N of given combination and N number of
In the case of each in combination is equiprobable, then the sum M of the position needed for coded vector sequence x is：
M=log2(N)。
Such as observable, quantity N (and corresponding digit M) of combination can become very big, even with n's and m
Most appropriate value.
The method that there is so-called pyramid vector quantization (PVQ), the method be in order that with equation 1 give form
Constrain to encode the method that Laplce's stochastic variable is recommended.Recently, the encoding and decoding of increasing income of CELT encoding and decoding are being based partially on
Occur in that in Opus and use PVQ in addition in audio compression.In addition, the coding and decoding video code of newly increasing income of entitled " Daala "
Using the variable on PVQ.
Although in Fig. 1 give basic constraint for both FPC and PVQ be general, it is important that understand FPC and
Main Differences between PVQ be enumerate algorithm and FPC while keeping for the minimum number of bits of coding with much higher m and
The ability that n values are operated.Thus, PVQ methods are usually used the scope of the m and n that can generally fit within 32 positional operands.Phase
Instead, and by more than do not understand, FPC can be extended to it is hundreds of or or even thousands of positions, while its computation complexity only line
Property increase.Inventor have been found that FPC be also in the system of very high-order it is useful, including for encode high-resolution conversion
Domain coefficient, wherein, code word domain can include hundreds of (or thousands of) positions.FPC has also been included in following audio industry standard：
3GPP2 EVRC-B and EVRC-WB and ITU-T are G.718.In these standards, low complex degree fixing point software is needed to realize
As the part of distribution bag.Therefore, important technical advantages of the FPC better than PVQ is：
1) the big value of n and m can be extended to, and
2) ability of low computation complexity is kept while do so.
FPC in order to evaluate video is used, and FPC bit rate estimators " slotting " (will be given) in equation 1 to 5 and is entered to now
In having Video Codec.Then, while keeping video quality constant, measurement FPC increases relative to default code method
Bit rate (for the default code method that Video Codec is used).Only the acquiescence to being performed equivalent FPC operations is regarded
The position that frequency codec is used is counted.By keeping video quality constant (that is, accurate for acquiescence coding-decoding operation
Position), bit rate aspect can be focused on, it is not relevant for attempting measurement relative mass difference.However, holding position degree of accuracy is not made
Into other encoding and decoding particular problems, below that will be discussed.
With reference to Fig. 1, depict mobile communications device, electronic plane device, video creation/playback reproducer or connect with user
The example of the other users equipment (UE) 1 of mouth (not specifically illustrated).UE 1 has video block 10, and video block 10 includes being suitable to coding
Or the hardware and/or software block of decoding digital video signals.As known in the art, digital video signal is divided into many
Individual frame.Generally, frame has different frame types, using these frames are come compensation campaign and while reduce the motion in frame region
Performance is sent to the bit rate of decoder.Typically, there are I, B and P of the data in digital video signal well known in the art
Encoding domain or frame.Embodiments of the present invention for various types of I, B and P data domain or Frame of video data in it is every
It is individual equally to work.
Here, in FIG, in video block 10 it is to represent that regarding for video FPC (FPC) can be incorporated to according to various embodiments
The block diagram of the high-order view of frequency codec.The substantially Frame 12 of the spatial domain snapshot of video pictures (single frame of video)
It is divided into multiple macro blocks 14 of grid or matrix form.The size of each macro block 14 can be such as 32 × 32 pixels.Each
In planting embodiment, each macro block can be divided into 64 × 64,32 × 32,16 × 16 or 8 × 8 pixels.Macro block 14 can also be thin
It is divided into the sub-block 16 that can be for example 8 × 8 or 4 × 4 pixels.
Each in sub-block 16 is provided to transform block 18 as array of data.In certain embodiments, transform block 18 pairs
Each in sub-block 16 performs discrete cosine transform (DCT) 19, and the XY coordinate systems of each sub-block are converted into space-frequency by sub-block 16
Domain.19 pieces of output transform coefficients of DCT.Then, the quantization transform coefficient in block 20 is quantified.
In other embodiments, different conversion can be performed to each in sub-block 16.For example, Walsh- can be used
The DCT that Hadamard conversion (WHT) comes in replacement block 19.When using WHT blocks 19, the conversion coefficient that transform block 19 is generated is
Jing is quantized, therefore need not quantify block 20 and can bypass quantization block 20, goes out as indicated by dashed line 21.In other embodiment
In, when the lossless coding using sub-block 16, impact of the quantization step to the conversion coefficient of generation in transform block 19 is minimum or does not have
Have an impact, irrespective of whether using DCT.
After transform block 18, in certain embodiments respectively, from the 4 × 4 or 8 × 8 of the quantization parameter of the output of transform block 18
Block is converted into the order string of quantization parameter from two-dimensional matrix.In various embodiments, this passes through to be scanned by such as zigzag pattern
2D matrixes are changed into the order string of quantization parameter by matrix performing (as in this area it is also known that), and the order string also may be used
It is referred to as quantification impulse vector.Subsequently, the order string of quantization parameter can be provided to loop filter block 24, loop filter block
24 can be due to adopting in the complexity and digital video frame depending on pictorial information (for example, the type of frame data I, B or P frame data)
The quantity of motion of collection and the variable bit rate of type and buffer the order string of quantization parameter, also other.
The output of loop filter 24 provides quantification impulse vector x, and quantification impulse vector x only includes video FPC encoders
The integer-valued value component that 26 embodiment needs.(quantification impulse vector x is also referred to as herein pulse vector) exists
In some embodiments, pulse vector x can also include the information of length n of marker pulse vector.Video FPC encoders 26 receive arteries and veins
Rush vector x and vector length n.It should be noted that pulse vector may also include or be attached with what is associated with frame or overall video data
Metadata 25.Encoder 26 is configurable to quantity m of the unit value pulse for having predetermined quantity for each pulse vector x
(as in various Video Applications), or can be from pulse vector x signal number of computations unit value pulse m itself.So
And, on the contrary, being either to be encoded by implicit expression or be indirectly by push away from it if m is not fixed in decoder-side
Derive the coding block energy of digit m, it is necessary to using it as side information transmission.Once digit is obtained, it becomes possible to from its determination amount
Quantity m of value pulse.
In various embodiments, video FPC encoders 26 combine statistics coding with vector quantization, and to provide ratio is needed
The encoded video of the little data of existing Video coding and coding/decoding method and bandwidth.Subsequently, the encoded video of video FPC encoders 26
Output can be stored in memorizer or data storage device 2, or carries out wireless transmission via transceiver 4 via antenna 5.
One or more processors 6 in UE 1 control the process of digital of digital video data via the instruction being stored in memorizer 2.
By experiment and arithmetic analysis, it is determined that using lossless coding and Walsh-Hadamard conversion (WHT) come generate from
WHT blocks 19 output coefficient be effectively configured to be used for the number with the non-zero position of the pulse vector in code vector
The associated statistical models of amount.Thus, embodiment uses the revision of FPC, the version to be referred to herein as used to regard
The video FPC of frequency, utilizes in new ways the probability being associated with video coding macroblocks and/or sub-block.Embodiment is with new side
Formula uses the macro block and/or sub-block (that is, pulse vector) of transform and quantization so that can use video FPC by heterogeneous fashion,
In the heterogeneous fashion, probability uneven distribution in different Frames, as described in more detail below.
Jing inventor determines that the FPC for having change in addition can be used to need other videos used before comparing to compile
Code encodes and decodes video data with the mode of the few bandwidth of decoding technique.
Fig. 2 is the flow chart of the art methods for encoding individual pulse vector x.The prior art method is using being referred to as
The coding techniques of factorial pulse code (FPC).Discuss to a certain extent in for the United States Patent (USP) 8,149,144 of audio coding
FPC.In this approach, single quantification impulse vector x is received in step 30.In the step 32, calculate and encode and be non-
Zero position npQuantity.Due to the quantity of unit value pulse in block 40 be fixed or the prior art method in
Know, therefore the information need not be calculated.In step 34, the position of each non-zero pulses in pulse vector is encoded as position arrow
Amount π.In step 36, the value of each non-zero pulses in pulse vector is encoded as value vector μ.Finally, in step 38,
The symbol of each non-zero pulses in coded pulse vector.Then, in step 42, in from step 32 to 40 each output and
Value/the vector of the coding parameter for representing original quantisation pulse vector x is combined into subsequently by as encoded signal (that is, bits of coded
Stream) send or store.It is important that, it is noted that if FPC is used for Video coding, FPC is not to quantification impulse vector xk's
Group performs statistical analysiss, wherein, k is whole between the quantity of the quantification impulse vector sub-block of 1 and one frame of video of expression
Number.The result of each in step 32 to 38 is substantially the coded number directly related with for calculating their pulse vector
Amount.For example, in the step 32, the quantity of the non-zero pulses in quantification impulse vector can be the pixel maximum in 0 and macro block
, in this illustration, there are 16 possible positions in 4 × 4 sub-blocks in the positive integer between quantity.In addition, for example, position arrow
Amount π for example, may indicate that the position 2,5,6,7 and 8 of quantification impulse quantity (having position 0 to 15) is nonzero value.Although coded quantization
The prior art method of pulse vector can save certain data space and can have the higher data for voice data fast
Rate, but existing method is restricted and is modified as will be discussed so that and it can be used the variable of video information
Length coding.
Other search is performed, example is studied with the new VFPC rate estimates in using VP9 Video Codecs and is implemented
Example.VP9 is the video encoding and decoding standard that Google is used, it is to be understood that various video coding-decoding methods and system can be used for
Embodiments of the invention.It was found that embodiment reduce referring again to video sub-block, macro block and final video frame institute necessary or desired for
Video data bandwidth or bit rate.Therefore, embodiment makes to send and receive bandwidth necessary to video signal or bit rate
Reduce, and the video image re-created after the decoding shown in UE1 or other display devices is not deteriorated.
Think over information in being included in the output quantization signal phasor of WHT or discrete cosine transform block 18 or pulse vector x
Type.Can be transform block 18 output quantization after quantization parameter order string be substantially in a frequency domain encoded video letter
Number a series of pulses or pulse vector.Each impulse smaple in this series of pulses or pulse vector has integer value and symbol
Number (+/-).Also there are multiple non-zero pulses in each pulse vector.That is, as discussed relative to equation (1), conversion
The quantization output x={ x of block 180,x1,K,xn-1It is that n is vector length, and m is vector x comprising integer-valued quantized signal vector

In for example studying the integration that the FPC bit rate in VP9 Video Codecs is estimated, wherein using VP9
The lossless mode of Video Codec and (WHT) is converted encoding scanned 4 × 4 pixel using Walsh-Hadamard
Block is forming one group of 16 element pulse vector.Scanned WHT coefficients are encoded using various FPC variables, below herein
One constructed embodiment of middle discussion FPC variables.
For VP9, inventor have found there are statistic biass in the pulse vector of gained.In addition, by other videos
Statistic biass are found in the pulse vector that codec is created.It is contemplated that in such as Daala, VP8, Indeo, Windows
Also deposit in other coding and decoding video outputs of Media Video (WMV), QuickTime H264 and other Video Codecs
In statistic biass.Therefore, it is possible to use show to be used for some in the identical VFPC methods of VP9 and these VFPC herein
Method will be applied to other kinds of Video Codec.It should be noted that " quantity of unit value pulse " can not be reused for
VP9, because for example it can be carried out in other Video Codecs such as Daala codecs.Therefore, when using such as
During the Video Codec of VP9, should be coded explicitly in arrow as parameter m of the unit value pulse sum in vector x
Amount with or together with explicitly encoding with vector.Using different coding configuration carry out for several times iteration experiment after, find according to
Embodiment extraordinary Video coding configuration include quantity 1 and at least one of the following or more：
1. use range encodes to encode the quantity of non-zero transform element；
2. by turn arithmetic coding carrys out the sum of coding units value pulse to use condition (state-driven)；
3. the position institute of encoding transform coefficients position is come using adaptivity arithmetic coding；
4. using the method for the assembly coding based on probability come encoding transform coefficients value；And
5. corresponding symbolic information is encoded using arithmetic coding by turn.
It was found that the video FPC coding configurations by using more than, it is included in statistical analysiss used in cataloged procedure, is better than
The coding gain of about 3.5% to about 4.0% of acquiescence VP9 methods (for lossless mode).In other words, by using bag

Portion.Hereinafter, the exemplary method of each encoded in these different pulse parameters is more fully described.
In step 72., send or store can also be considered coding stream, for each corresponding pulses arrow in entirety
Amount xkRespective vectors code word group (that is, for non-zero number of positions, unit value number of pulses, position vector, value vector,
With the statistical coding pulse parameter of sign bit).Subsequently this coding stream can be decoded by decoder, to reconstruct all pulse vectors
(for example, as the part of the video signal represented by decoding coding stream).Referring back to Fig. 1, this bit stream can be stored in interior
In depositing memorizer 2, and can be transmitted using transceiver 4 and antenna 5.Also suspect other memory blocks and transmission block.
Because decoding coded pulse parameter needs the knowledge for encoding the probabilistic model of these pulse parameters, therefore in step
To also be encoded into for all statistical model code word groups (i.e., for the probabilistic model of each all pulse vector in rapid 68
Coding possibilities model) it is one or more correspondence code words.In step 70, the statistical model code word group is sent or is stored, is supplied
Decoder is subsequently used for reconstructing each pulse vector in all pulse vectors.It should be noted that corresponding for each in entirety
Pulse vector (for example, video sub-block) generate, then send or store respective vectors code word group (that is, for non-zero number of positions,

Body generates statistical model code word group (that is, coding possibilities model), and only needs to each all (for example, frame of video) transmission or deposit
Storage is once.Because each frame of video generally includes a large amount of sub-blocks, and because coding possibilities model is compared to coded pulse parameter
Relatively infrequently send, thus be accordingly used in the sum of position of the ad hoc approach of coding possibilities model needed for encoding spatial redundancy of video in given frame
Have no significant effect, and this coding need not require significantly to compress.

Now, with reference to the pulse vector x for encoded video signalkSingle five steps in each, embodiment
Cataloged procedure the part in first step be for each vector xkQuantity n of coding nonzero elementp(k).For pin
To each vector xkQuantity n of coding nonzero elementp(k), in step 54 execution is following, wherein：
For this expression formula, n is pulse vector xkLength, be 16 for 4 × 4 block sizes.In order to np(k) carry out
Coverage information encodes (range code), calculates the specific nonzero element n for occurringpK the probability P of (), the calculating can be by table
Up to for：
Wherein, N is (for example, corresponding to the quantity of block in frame) number of the vector (block) in the vector entirety evaluated
Amount, npK () is the quantity of the non-zero position in k-th vector (block), and j is pulse vector xkPosition index.According to these tables
Up to formula, for encoding npEach block M of (k)pDigit can be estimated as：
In the step 68, use the information to carry out explicit code n using range information codingp(k)。
Now, another step will be discussed, i.e. coded pulse vector xkThe unit value arteries and veins included in each in 56
Punching.For encoding each vector xkIn this method use condition of the quantity of unit value pulse that includes by turn arithmetic is compiled
Code.Similar to other steps in the embodiment, first, the vector x of length nk(wherein, xkAll values be signed whole
Number) in unit value pulse mkQuantity be calculated as：
Next, calculating the m for being configured to 1kThe probability by turn of each.Broad sense by turn (in other words, two enter
System) in arithmetic coding (BAC) scheme, following formula produces probability by turn：
Wherein, NbIt is maximum number of digits to be encoded, j is position index, mkIt is the unit value arteries and veins for k-th vector (block)
The quantity of punching, and N is the sum of the vector (block) in frame or macro block for example to be encoded.In addition, " " symbol represent by turn with
(AND) operator.For above expression formula, Pm(j) expression value mkJ-th position be configured to 1 probability.Can use should
Probability carrys out lossless coding for the m in Signal CompressionkThe array of individual value.
However, since it is known that in xkIn quantity n that plants oneself that includespK () be how many (in steps discussed above
In 54), then the amount of redundancy between the two quantity can be utilized.For example, npK () can never be larger than mk, because if occupying
Only one of which pulse at each in position, then mk=np(k).So, if mkN is equal to alwaysp(k) and npK () is known
, then need not encode m for such casek, because mk=npK the probability of () is 100%.So, in order to using the property,
Then should initially encode " number of pulses deviation " m 'k=mk-np(k) so that eliminate mkAnd npIn dependency between (k)
Some.
Second, make use of m 'kAnd npThe more direct dependency existed between (k).That is, work as occupying less position
(that is, npK () is little relative to n) when, there is m 'kRelatively small probability is accordingly increased, and more multidigit is occupied on the contrary, working as
When putting, there is m 'kRelatively large probability is increased.Can be by for npK each of () should be worth generation binary arithmetic coding
(BAC) probability tables is utilizing the relation so that：
Wherein, c1(npK (), j) is number of pulses m 'kThe jth position of parameter is set (for given np(k)) number of times, np
K () is xkIn non-zero position quantity, and c2(np(k)) it is xkComprising npThe quantity of the example of (k) individual non-zero position.The table
N × N is limited up to formulabBig minor matrix, the matrix provides the n that plants oneself for given predetermined quantityp(k) and arrange m 'k(i)
Certain bits probability.For clarity, with flow-chart form above procedure is shown in the diagram.
In the diagram, frame 64 can be operated, with all pulses arrow added up from 0 k value for fading to N for value in given frame
Amount parameter.The value of k is started in frame 410 with invalid value, then continues to frame 412, receives k-th pulse vector xkIt is non-to calculate
Zero position, and frame 414 is then proceeded to, non-zero position is calculated, and frame 416 is proceeded to, calculate for the specific vector
The quantity of unit value pulse.Number with unit value pulse is put once having been directed towards certain pulses vectormeter and calculating nonzero digit
Amount, just tests the value of k, to determine whether to have completed the frame for the value of N.If it is not, then process is recycled to frame 412.If
Really thus, then process flows to next process with generating probability model from frame 64, this is the frame 66 in Fig. 3.
In process frame 66, using value from 0 k value for fading to N calculate whole frame in m 'kProbability by turn.For given arteries and veins
Rush vector xk, there is provided represent for given pulse vector xkUnit value number of pulses value of calculation m 'k.In frame 418,
The process is initialized when jth position is " 0 ", then process advances to test m 'kIn each position.Decision box 420 determines whether
Current test position is set.If it is, this indicates nonzero digit and process flows to frame 422, value of calculation c1(np(k), j), subsequently before
Decision box 424 is proceeded to, whether the value for determining j is less than the value of Nb.If it is not, then process flow back into the input of decision box 420.If
It is not provided with currently testing position, then process will bypass frame 422.So substantially to m 'kIn the digit of " setting " counted.
After determining the digit arranged in specific vector, program subsequently flows to frame 426, with for xkComprising npThe reality of (k) individual non-zero position
The quantity of example calculates c2(np(k)), frame 428 is then flowed to, with for all pulse vector x in framekPerform the test.Once
The process is performed in whole frame in, m ' is being which provideskProbability by turn, and process flows to frame 432, with according to the above
Equation 1.6 build table, then continue to frame 432, wherein, by table send or store in frame 434 with using be directed to all k, j
Probability tables encoding m 'kPosition.Then by m 'kBits of coded send or store together with other statistical coding positions, such as frame 436
Indicated.
3rd, it was observed that certain bits m 'kBetween dependency be heavily dependent on m 'kThe position of interior highest significant position
Put.If that is, bits of coded NbQuantity generally compared to pulse offsets amount m ' to be encodedkGreatly (i.e.,), then dependency is very high, because m 'kThe probability of former (highest is effective) positions be often 0.On the contrary, with
M 'kIt is worth big relative to the quantity change of bits of coded, i.e.Then position probability becomes more random in least significant bit.For
The property is utilized, state machine is introduced, the state machine allows to carry out highest significant position (be zero probability higher) and minimum effective
Make a distinction between position (there is bigger random chance).By calculating probability respectively for different conditions, entirety greatly improved
Performance.
Fig. 5 is provided in embodiment can a how example of the flow chart of adoption status machine.Here, pulse vector quilt
It is cumulative and as discussed above and perform m ' with figure 4 illustrateskProbability by turn.In Figure 5, there is provided two states, table
Show the state 0 for being not provided with position and indicate occur arranging primary state 1.Test position from MSB to LSB, so as to using with
The lower fact：m‘kBig value will have a large amount of positions for being not provided with the upper part of numeric word.Therefore, it is initial in frame 520
State is arranged to state 0 and is arranged to m ' in this condition by groundkHead j positions.Hereafter, process flows to the first decision box 522,
Whether state 0 is remained with determination state.The state will be state 0, until being provided with tested head j positions.As long as also not setting
Put the position, program just by along flowing from frame 522 to the path of frame 524, to determine whether to be provided with the test position.This is state
Become the point of state 1 from state 0.As long as no test position is arranged, process will remain in state 0 and process will only calculate c2
(np(k)), as pointed out in frame 526.If however, being provided with test position, this instruction state operation must become state 1.
This will cause process to flow to frame 528 from frame 524, to calculate c1(npK state is subsequently arranged to 1, Ran Houliu by (), value j)
To frame 526.Process will flow to decision box 532 and be possible to be circulated back to decision box 522.If state has changed into state 1,
Then program flows to another decision box 532 by for the process similar with the process of Fig. 4 from decision box 522.This will flow to frame
534 and carry out calculating c1(npK (), j), then flows to frame 536, if being provided with position, calculate c2(np(k)).If the
J positions are not set to state 1；Process will bypass frame 534.Subsequently, process flows to decision box 530 and proceeds, until
Have been directed towards j and test all positions.Then, program flow decision box 540, to be circulated back to the input of frame 524, until manipulating
All other pulse vector in frame, then continues to the identical function of performing with illustrated relative to frame 430-436.
From Fig. 5, it is noted that without as illustrating complete probability tables for state 1 for state 0.For state 0,
Table P (np(k), j) throughout 1≤n of scopep(k)≤n and 0≤j<Nb.For state 1, because intrinsic on the position of all states 1
Randomness, it is only necessary to N in additionb- 1 memory location.Therefore, by just with P (np(k), j) the 0th row of probability matrix
To access the other probability for state 1, P (npK (), j) probability matrix is now with 0≤n of sizep(k)≤n and 0≤j<Nb,
Wherein, the probability of state 1 be stored in P (0, j) in element.
Table 1 illustrates the described method compared to traditional scalar sum binary arithmetic coding (using known probability model)

The comparison of coded method
The step of encoded location information (the step of Fig. 3 58), is directed to use with radix-2 algorithm coding to pass on quantization vector xk
Element whether include nonzero information.The overall probability of the given element in quantization vector includes i-th position element of non-zero
Conditional probability, on condition that j remaining nonzero element is located at the scope of i to n -1.That is, due to previously known in length n
Vector xkIn there is npIndividual non-zero position, then it is known that np- j non-zero positions whether in i possible position of head, that
There is remaining j non-zero position to be encoded in remaining n-i position.This can significantly change quantification impulse vector xkIt is whole
Body probability, if especially probability distribution is uneven.Accordingly, it would be desirable to be suitable for based on position one by one carry out binary system calculation
Association probability needed for art coding.Description below is outlined for performing the task to calculate upper very effective mode
Low-complexity method.
With reference to Fig. 7, there is provided flow chart, the flow chart is provided for coded quantization pulse vector pulse position information
The details of instantiation procedure.In step 64, add up each k vector xkParameter, as discussed in the diagram.Then, in step
In rapid 72,74 and 76, for each vector xk, the input vector x for just being occupied by nonzero value is determined based on below equationkI-th
Position or the probability of element：
Wherein, N is the vector sum in probability entirety (for example a, part for frame or frame), and n is vector length.Next,
If falling vector xkThe probability of j nonzero value of remaining n-i position be configured to P (T (n-i, j)), then overall probability
May be expressed as P (xk(i)|T(n-i,j)).Equally, in given vector xkRemaining n-i position on j nonzero value element
In the case of, element xkI the probability of () is non-zero.In certain embodiments, by encoder determine via probability calculation just by
The input vector x that nonzero value is occupiedkI-th element probability, and in other embodiments, from the work(associated with coder block
Energy block receives these probability.
For design conditions probability, the code element based on before, the probabilistic combination of other code elements is checked, and gathered
Its association probability is closed, to adjust the probability of quantized residual vector element to be encoded.Here, probability matrix P (T) is defined as
Wherein, matrix element P (T (i, j)) is represented using in vector xkRemaining i position there is j nonzero element
The probability that trellis matrixes are obtained.In addition, matrix element can be defined as：
P (T (0,0))=1, (1.9a)
P (T (1,0))=1-P (xk(n-1)), (1.9b)
P (T (1,1))=P (xk(n-1)), (1.9c)
P (T (2,0))=(1-P (xk(n-1)))·(1-P(xk(n-2))), (1.9d)
P (T (2,1))=P (xk(n-1))·(1-P(xk(n-2)))+(1-P(xk(n-1)))·P(xk(n-2)), (1.9e)
P (T (2,2))=P (xk(n-1))·P(xk(n-2)), (1.9f)
Etc..Obviously, recurrence relation can be formed as follows：
P (T (2,0))=(1-P (xk(n-2))) P (T (1,0)), (1.10a)
P (T (2,1))=P (xk(n-2))·P(T(1,0))+(1-P(xk(n-2))) P (T (1,1)), (1.10b)
P (T (2,2))=P (xk(n-2)) P (T (1,1)), (1.10c)
The relation can be summarized as：
Recursive procedure is given above in order to visualize performance, is schemed referring to the trellis in Fig. 6.In step 80 and 82,
In certain embodiments, can in descending order and the trellis matrixes with matrix element P (T (i, j)) are sorting probability P (xk
(i)).In step 84, binary arithmetic coding is proceeded by from k=0.
Where it determines that joint probability：P(xk(i)≠0|T(n-i,j)).By to this expression formula application bayes rule
(Bayes ' Theorem), obtains：
Wherein, P (x are implyk(i) ≠ 0)=P (xk(i)).From this expression formula, derived using the trellis figures of Fig. 6
P(T(n-i,j)|xkI () ≠ 0)=P (T (n-i-1, j-1)), in then being substituted into previous equation, obtains：
Accordingly, it is appreciated that (T (n-i, j)) is solely dependent upon constant index offset to ratio P (T (n-i-1, j-1))/P, i.e. n-
I → n-i-1 and j → j-1, therefore, a large amount of calculating can be saved by precalculating ratio.
Thus each vector probability calculation is reduced to：
P(xk(i) ≠ 0 | T (n-i, j))=T ' (n-i, j) P (xk(i)) (1.15a)
And
P(xk(i)=0 | T (n-i, j))=1-T ' (n-i, j) P (xk(i)) (1.15b)
Then, by the binary arithmetic coding process that illustrates in the flow process loop between the step 84 in Fig. 7 and 86 come
Using these simple flat-footed equation 1.15a and 1.15b.
It should be noted that the flow chart of Fig. 7 illustrates that probability P (xk(i)) 80 sorting dotted line frame.Regardless of whether sorting
Probability, the digit encoded needed for non-zero position all will be constant.However, sorting probability has two advantages：A) trellis figures are shorter,
That is, starting position P (x can be removed from trellis figuresk(i))=1 and end position P (xk(i))=0, and b) sorting increases
The chance that the second circulation illustrated in Fig. 7 terminates ahead of time.

The comparison of the method for coding
For coded vector xk(Fig. 3, step 60,64,66 and purpose 68), by length npThe value vector definition of (k)
For：
x′≡{xk| ＞ 0 }, (1.16)
So thatIt is the vector x with length nkAll nonzero elements absolute value.
With reference to Fig. 8, description coding value vector x is shownkSimplify general introduction flow chart.In step 90, whole integer arteries and veins
Sequence of vectors is rushed (that is, for whole frame or the pulse vector x of framek) it is configured of length n.In step 92, calculate complete
Vector x in bodykMeansigma methodss vector μ={ μ0,μ1,μ2,…μn-1}.Then, in step 94, meansigma methodss vector μ is sorted, is made
Must be by the descending of meansigma methodss vector μ by vector xkComponent rearrange in the memorizer of such as UE or index again.
In step 96, for each vector in entirety, the quantity (n of nonzero value is determinedp) and from xkRemove in vector
All null values.Then, gained vector x ' is preserved.In addition, being repaiied by removing corresponding meansigma methodss in mean vector μ from sorting
Level off mean value vector μ and the result is saved as into μ '.Then, in step 98, it is based on amended meansigma methodss using VPFC
Vector μ ' is encoding the vector x ' for eliminating 0.
In order to be more fully understood from coded vector xkValue component exemplary method, using based on probability combination compile
Code, provides and illustrates in flow chart in fig .9 below.That is, in step 100, by length npThe value arrow of (k)
Amount is defined as：
x′≡{|xk| ＞ 0 } (1.16)
So that,It is the vector x with length nkAll nonzero elements absolute value.Then, exist
In embodiment using new VFPC methods, it is given by the following from k-th code word obtained from coding value vector x '：
Wherein, F (m, j) is the combined expression be given in Fig. 3.Then, it is given by the following (from equation 4) value
Corresponding length (the unit of code word：Position)
L=log2(F(mk-1,np(k)-1) (1.18)
Wherein, mkAnd npK () is respectively the quantity and non-zero element of the unit value pulse for vector index k
Quantity, it is as defined above and discussion.
It is noted that for the n for givingpK (), the length of code word is only dependent upon mk, and it is not dependent on each element of x '.
Average absolute vec is defined as：
Wherein, in the current example, N is the quantity of the vector (or scanned video block) of every frame, and n is vector
Length.Can derive from statistics, if all xkI () is all independent identically distributed (i.i.d), then their corresponding expections
Absolute value is equal, and average absolute value μ of their samplingsiIt is roughly equal.If however, for 0≤i of all values<N,
Average absolute value μiThere is difference greatly, then the combination that is possible to of value vector x ' (and then, code word (C)) can not possibly be equal.At this
In the case of kind, the position for encoding C is not made full use of, therefore these positions are not 100% effective.Ask to get around this
Topic, the length of combined codeword C should be less for most possible vector, should for less possible quantity
It is larger.Method for accomplishing this is below described.
In order to generate its length depending on value vector x ' construction combined codeword C, can by also depend on desired value or
Average value muiAssembly coding method generating code word.In the case of without loss of generality, value vector is arranged so that μiInto drop
Sequence, i.e. μ0≥μ1≥...≥μi≥…≥μn-1.If they can first sort μ without arranging in descending orderi, then
Rearrange or index again xk(i) component so that their meansigma methodss are into descending.Now, it is quite possible that xkJust
Beginning less component will be with high value, i.e. xk(0)、xk(1) it is etc. and higher more than the probability of past several components.In order to favourable
Ground uses this property, value is encoded using adaptivity assembly coding method, to generate variable length codeword.This method
It is new and variable factorial pulse code (VFPC) has been named as by inventor.
In new VFPC methods, the value code word for obtaining VPFC is：
Wherein, based on the absolute average after the sampling of code segment vector, a is adaptively obtainedj≤ m (is defined
For adaptivity step-by-step counting) and bj(being defined as adaptivity offset count).If aj=m and bj=0, then the expression formula
It is equal to equation 1.17.Because generally in j=npStart to encode and operate up when -1 to j=1, (subsequently rearrange the right side
The item on side), obtain：
So, will now be described using absolute average μ after samplingiCertain function adapting to ajAnd bjProcess, make
The average length for obtaining code word C reduces.
Here, in a step 101, these functions are defined as：
And
Wherein, s and t define the beginning component of sub-vector to be analyzed and terminate component.In following formula, use
These functions are by adaptivity step-by-step counting ajIt is generated as：
Wherein, Δ is fixed predetermined normal number.In above equation, μ 'jCorresponding to vector x ' j-th element it is flat
Equal absolute value.That is, being also determined and to be in step 100 arrow being input into from the accumu-late parameter for N number of pulse vector
Amount μ ' is included and vector xkThe corresponding vector μ of nonzero element value.In an experiment, Δ=3 are selected.The ordinary skill of this area
Personnel may be selected other values as the Δ in the various embodiments of VPFC.It should be noted that when all values of μ ' are equal, equation
A in 1.23jEqual to m- Δs.However, for the optimum performance of some embodiments, ajShould be m.In this example of embodiment
Under situation (when all meansigma methodss are equal), Δ=0 is preferably chosen.
Can be observed, if sorted definitely average, i.e. μ '0≥μ′1≥…≥μ′j, then：
Therefore, from equation 1.23, it can be seen that aj≤m-Δ.The result is it will be evident that because when the expection of position is definitely put down
When average is less than meansigma methodss, expect the mode to make the sum of unit value pulse seem less to encode value.
As shown in the flow chart of the Fig. 9 in step 102, in order to adapt to ajAnd bjValue, embodiment initialization β=0 and
bj=0.In addition, in this step, code word C is configured to 0 and position index j and is initialized in primary position.
In step 103, a is calculated using equation 1.23j.Then, at step 104, β is incremented by so that when β is in some predetermined values
When and/or ought β=a in step 106jDuring-j+1, ajAnd bjValue changed.When β is in some predetermined values, in step 107
In, now obtain amended value a 'jFor：
Can verify that a 'j≥aj。
In order to obtain modified values b 'j, minima is found in step 109 so that
F(aj-β,j)≥2-s·F(a′j-β,j) (1.26)
Here, b is setj=bj+ s, and a in step 110jAnd bjReplaced by their modified values, in step 110
Process is circulated back to step 104.It is noted that the condition such as not in the equation 1.26 of step 109 ensures that process is processed remaining
Peculiar codified, and select the minima of s to minimize the increase for minimizing coding digit.
When in step 106 β does not have predetermined value, then in step 112, it is determined whetherIf not being
Very, then process flow back into step 104, and β is incremented by.If true, then generating the combination contribution for value x ' (j) is：
In step 116, C is made to be equal to C+Cj.Also, until j=1, the value of j reduces and now by aj-1And bj-1Value
It is set equal to step 118 and a in 120jAnd bj.Then, for all successor values of j, still using equation 1.25 and equation
1.26 changing ajAnd bjValue.As j=1 in step 118, final combined codeword C is obtained from step 116 as corresponding
Combination contribution CjSum：
It is given by the following the length of final code word：
Due to b1It is not fixed and depending on coded sequence peace mean value vector, therefore the method generates variable-length
Code word.Corresponding decoder process is complementary with encoder process.
Now, it is important that understanding has been described with generating the assembly coding method of variable length codeword.Additionally it should manage
Solution, code word size and code word depend on the average absolute value of vector to be encoded.In addition, Figure 10 is provided illustrating according to the present invention's
The flow chart of the VFPC decoding steps of embodiment.One of ordinary skill in the art is easy to understand after the work for understanding Fig. 9
Figure 10.
When meansigma methodss are fixed and when being known priori, the method that Fig. 9 can be used directly.However, many true
In real world's application, in addition it is also necessary to calculate and send meansigma methodss.For example, in Video coding application, macro block (vector xk) be
Number xkI the meansigma methodss of () are for different frames can change or can be different according to the type of macro block (brightness or colourity).
In these cases, for the various embodiments of optimal use, meansigma methodss are calculated and can be sent in each frame of encoded video
Meansigma methodss.
In another embodiment, meansigma methodss are calculated and also uses following facts：To the defeated of VFPC encoders (referring to Fig. 9)
Enter is that its component is non-zero and therefore can preferably limit average vector than those components of the quantization vector of only non-zero.
Therefore, by xkI () is defined as vector xkI-th component, and by ciIt is defined as all vector x0To xN-1All it is non-zero
I-th component counting, i.e.
Wherein, IqIt is 1 target function otherwise for 0 if q is very to be, wherein, q is xkThe value of (i) ≠ 0.Now, may be used
Mean value calculation by i-th component is：
Absolute average μ can be calculated using equation 1.31 or equation 1.19i.Thus the meansigma methodss for calculating can be quantized
(scalar quantization) and each frame send or store once (referring to Fig. 3, step 70).
In order to the performance of the embodiment of variable-length FPC (VFPC) method is compared with conventional prior FPC methods
Compared with the VFPC methods for the macro block of Walsh-Hadamard conversion (WHT) coefficients of coded representation size 4 × 4 are integrated
In the VP9 codecs operated under lossless mode (referring to Fig. 1).
In addition, in order to VFPC Video codings embodiment is compared with the separate coding method for acting on coding value,
Random vector x={ the x of length n=16 of its component x (i) >=00,x1,…,xn-1It is independent, its absolute average is μi=
g0·γ(i-1), wherein, firstly generate γ≤1.It is noted that when γ=1, the important x (i) of institute all has identical average
Value.The value of the nonzero component of the pulse vector x that VFPC embodiments are used in coding simulation.In table 3, by VFPC values coding
The result of method is compared with routine FPC value coded methods.
Table 3：Illustrate for being μ with component meansigma methodssi=g0·γ(i-1)Coding value, needed for VFPC and routine FPC
Average digit compare
It can be seen that, the value of γ is less, absolute average μiMore deflection (away from equal), therefore when comparing with conventional FPC,
The percentage ratio code gain of VFPC is bigger (in table 3, for γ=0.70,9%).However, when γ～1 (that is, 0.99), then
Cause slightly to lose using VFPC.This is because, in this embodiment, meansigma methodss are almost equal, therefore routine FPC will be near
Optimum level is performed, so that VPFC is difficult to exceed it.Without the another of the fine VPFC for performing for γ=0.99
Individual reason is because that in equation (1.23) Δ is arranged to Δ=3, and this does not adjust what is encoded when being distributed identical
Embodiment.
