- the present disclosure is generally directed to methods, apparatus and computer-readable media (transitory and non-transitory) for determining suitability of textual statements associated with an entity for presentation as testimonials about the entity.
- a “textual statements associated with an entity,” or a “snippet,” may be a clause of a multi-clause sentence, an entire sentence, and/or a sequence of sentences (e.g., a paragraph).
- Textual statements associated with entities may be extracted from, for instance, entity descriptions provided by individuals or organizations associated with the entities (e.g., a description of an app by an app creator posted on an online marketplace or social network), ad creatives (e.g., presented as “sponsored search results” returned in response to a search engine query), reviews about entities (e.g., a review by a critic in an online magazine or on a social network), and so forth.
- a “textual statement associated with entity” may also include user comment associated with entity descriptions and/or textual reviews about entities. Of course, these are just examples; textual statements associated with entities may come from other sources as well, such as online forums, chat rooms, review clearinghouses, and so forth.
- a “testimonial” refers to a textual statement associated with an entity that may be relatively concise, informative, and/or self-contained.
- a testimonial often may be a sentence or two in length, although a short paragraph may serve as a suitable testimonial in some instances.
- textual statements associated with an entity may be analyzed to determine their suitability for presentation as testimonials about the entity (also referred to herein as “testimonial-ness”).
- measures or scores of testimonial-ness may be determined for one or more textual statements about an entity based on various criteria. Based on these measures or scores, textual statements associated with the entity may be selected for presentation in various scenarios, such as accompanying an advertisement for a particular entity, accompanying search results that are in some way relatable to the entity, and so forth.
- a computer implemented method includes the steps of: selecting, by one or more processors from one or more electronic data sources, a candidate textual statement associated with an entity; identifying, by one or more of the processors, one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement; and determining, by one or more of the processors based on the identified one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement, a measure of suitability of the candidate textual statement for presentation as a testimonial about the entity.
- identifying one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement may include determining, by one or more of the processors, a measure of sarcasm expressed by the candidate textual statement.
- identifying one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement may include determining, by one or more of the processors based on content of the candidate textual statement, an inferred sentiment orientation associated with the candidate textual statement.
- the method may include comparing the inferred sentiment orientation of the candidate textual statement to an explicit sentiment orientation associated with the candidate textual statement to determine a measure of sarcasm associated with the candidate textual statement.
- the identifying may include determining, by one or more of the processors, one or more structural details underlying the candidate textual statement. In various implementations, the identifying may include identifying, by one or more of the processors, one or more characteristics of the entity expressed in the candidate textual statement. In various implementations, the determining may include comparing, by one or more of the processors, the one or more identified characteristics of the entity expressed in the candidate textual statement with known characteristics of the entity.

- the portions of entity descriptions deemed likely to be suitable for presentation as a testimonial about the entity may include portions enclosed in quotations or having a particular format.
- the method may further include selecting, by one or more of the processors, the candidate textual statement for presentation as a testimonial about the entity based on the measure of suitability.
- the entity may be a product.
- the method may further include automatically generating training data for use in training the machine learning classifier.
- automatically generating training data may include evaluating one or more training textual statements using a language model.
- the method may further include comparing output of the language model to both an upper and lower threshold.
- the method may further include designating the one or more training textual statements as negative where output from the language model for those training textual statements indicates they are above the upper threshold or below the lower threshold.

- Various components illustrated in FIG. 1 may be implemented in one or more computers that communicate, for example, through one or more networks (not depicted).
- Various components illustrated in FIG. 1 may individually or collectively include memory for storage of data and software applications, one or more processors for accessing data and executing applications, and components that facilitate communication over a network. The operations performed by these components may be distributed across multiple computer systems.
- these components may be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- a graph engine 100 may be configured to build and maintain an index 101 of collections of “entities” and associated entity attributes.
- graph engine 100 may represent entities as nodes and relationships between entities as edges.
- graph engine 100 may represent collections of entities, entity attributes and entity relationships as directed or undirected graphs, hierarchal graphs (e.g., trees), and so forth.
- an “entity” may generally be any person, organization, place, and/or thing.
- An “organization” may include a company, partnership, nonprofit, government (or particular governmental entity), club, sports team, a product vendor, a product creator, a product distributor, etc.
- a “thing” may include tangible (and in some cases fungible) products such as a particular model of tool, a particular model of kitchen or other appliance, a particular model of toy, a particular electronic model (e.g., camera, printer, headphones, smart phone, set top box, video game system, etc.), and so forth.
- a “thing” additionally or alternatively may include an intangible (e.g., downloadable) product such as software (e.g., the apps described above).
- the term “database” and “index” will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data.
- the data of the database and/or the index does not need to be structured in any particular way and it can be stored on storage devices in one or more geographic locations.
- the indices 101 and/or 118 may include multiple collections of data, each of which may be organized and accessed differently.
- textual statements associated with entities may be obtained from various sources.
- a corpus of one or more entity reviews 102 and a corpus of one or more entity descriptions 104 are available.
- Textual statements associated with entities may of course be obtained from other sources (e.g., social networks, online forums, ad creatives), but for the sake of brevity, entity reviews and entity descriptions will be used as examples herein.
- entity reviews 102 and/or entity descriptions 104 may be accompanied by one or more user comments 106 and/or 108 , respectively.
- a candidate statement selection engine 110 may be in communication with graph engine 100 .
- Candidate statement selection engine 110 may be configured to utilize various techniques to select, from entity reviews 102 and/or entity descriptions 104 , one or more textual statements as candidate statements 112 about a particular entity documented in index 101 .
- the corpus of entity descriptions 104 may include descriptions of various apps available for download on an online marketplace.
- Candidate statement selection engine 110 may analyze each entity description using various techniques to identify a particular entity (or more than one entity) that the entity description is associated with. In some instances, candidate statement selection engine 110 may look at a title or metadata associated with the entity description 104 that indicates which entity it describes.
- candidate statement selection engine 110 may use more complex techniques, such as a rules-based approach and/or one or more machine learning classifiers, to determine which entity an entity description 104 describes. Once an entity (or more than one entity) described in an entity description 104 is identified, various clauses, sentences, paragraphs, or even the whole description, may be selected as candidate statements 112 associated with that entity. Comments associated with a particular entity description 104 may also be selected as candidate statements 112 associated with that entity. A similar approach may be used for entity reviews 102 and their associated comments 106 .
- complex techniques such as a rules-based approach and/or one or more machine learning classifiers
- An attribute identification engine 114 may be configured to identify one or more attributes of candidate statements 112 .
- attribute identification engine 114 may output versions of the candidate statements annotated with data indicative of these attributes, although this is not required.
- data indicative of the attributes may be output in other forms.
- Attribute identification engine 114 may identify a variety of attributes of a candidate statement 112 .
- an inferred “sentiment orientation” associated with the candidate textual statement 112 may be determined, e.g., by attribute identification engine 114 , based on content of the candidate textual statement 112 .
- a “sentiment orientation” may refer to a general tone, polarity, and/or “feeling” of a particular candidate textual statement, e.g., positive, negative, neutral, etc.
- a sentiment orientation of a candidate textual statement may be determined using various sentiment analysis techniques, such as natural language processing, statistics, and/or machine learning to extract, identify, or otherwise characterize sentiment expressed by content of a candidate textual statement.
- candidate textual statements laced with sarcasm may not be suitable for presentation as testimonials.
- a user comment e.g., 106 or 108
- This camera has an amazing battery life, NOT! may not be suitable for presentation as a testimonial if the goal is to provide testimonials that will encourage consumers to purchase the camera.
- attribute identification engine may determine a measure of sarcasm expressed by one or more candidate textual statements 112 .
- a measure of sarcasm expressed by a candidate textual statement 112 may be determined using various techniques.
- the sentiment orientation inferred from the content of the candidate textual statement may be compared to an explicit sentiment orientation associated with the candidate textual statement. For example, when leaving reviews or comments about an entity (e.g., an app or product on an online marketplace), users may assign a quantitative score to the entity, such as three of five stars, a letter grade, and so forth. That quantitative score may represent an explicit sentiment orientation associated with the candidate textual statement. If the explicit sentiment orientation is more or less aligned with the inferred sentiment orientation, then the candidate textual statement is not likely sarcastic. However, if the explicit and inferred sentiment orientations are at odds, then candidate textual statement may have a sarcastic tone.
- Attribute identification engine 114 may use other cues to detect sarcasm as well. For example, some users may tend to insert various punctuation clues for sarcasm, such as excessive capitalization. As another example, attribute identification engine 114 may compare inferred sentiment orientation associated with one candidate textual statement about an entity with an aggregate inferred sentiment orientation associated with that entity. If the lone and aggregate inferred sentiment orientations are vastly different, and especially if the sentiment orientation of the one candidate textual statement is positive and sentiment orientation of the rest of the candidate textual statements are negative, the one may be sarcastic. Other cues of sarcasm in a candidate textual statement may include, for instance, excessive hyperbole, or other tonal hints that may change as the nomenclature of the day evolves.
- attribute identification engine 114 may identify and/or annotate particular words or phrases as being particularly indicative of sarcasm or some other sentiment orientation. For example, attribute identification engine 114 may maintain a “blacklist” of terms that it may annotate. Presence of one or more of these terms may cause various downstream components, such as testimonial selection engine 120 , to essentially discard a candidate statement 112 .
- one or more of the following words, phrases, and/or emoticons may be included on a blacklist: “not,” “please,” “fix,” “sorry,” “couldn't,” “shouldn't,” “bad,” “ugly,” “can't,” “don't,” “update,” “but,” “previous,” “terrible,” “killed,” “?,” “waste,” “could,” “:(,” “:-(,” “refund,” “aren't,” “isn't,” “good good,” “love love,” “best best,” “work,” “otherwise,” “wouldn't,” “tablet,” and/or.
- Other words, phrases, and/or emoticons may be included on such a blacklist.
- Attribute identification engine 114 may identify other attributes of a candidate statement 112 . For example, in some implementations, attribute identification engine 114 may determine one or more structural details underlying the candidate textual statement. Structural details of a candidate textual statement 112 may include things like its metadata or its underlying HTML/XML. Metadata may include things like a source/author of the statement, the time the statement was made, and so forth.
- attribute identification engine 114 may identify one or more characteristics of an entity expressed in a candidate textual statement 112 .
- Various natural language processing techniques may be used, including but not limited to co-reference resolution, to identify characteristics of an entity expressed in a candidate. For example, suppose a candidate textual statement 112 associated with a particular product reads, “This product has a great feature X that I really like, and I also like how its custom battery is long lasting.” Attribute identification engine 114 may identify (and in some cases annotate the candidate textual statement 112 with) “feature X,” e.g., modified with “great,” as well as a “battery” modified by “custom” and “long-lasting.”
- Testimonial scoring engine 116 may be configured to determine, based on attributes of one or more candidate textual statements 112 identified by attribute identification engine 114 , a measure of suitability of the one or more candidate textual statements for presentation as one or more testimonials about the entity.
- a “measure of suitability for presentation as a testimonial,” or “testimonialness,” may be expressed in various quantitative ways, such as a numeric score, a percent, a ranking (if compared to other candidate textual statements), and so forth.
- Testimonial scoring engine 116 may determine the measure of testimonialness in various ways.
- testimonial scoring engine 116 may weight various attributes of candidate textual statements 112 identified by attribute identification engine 114 differently. For example, if a particular candidate textual statement 112 is annotated as having a positive inferred sentiment orientation, and positive testimonials are sought, then that candidate receive a relatively high measure of testimonialness.
- the fact that a particular candidate textual statement 112 is annotated as being sarcastic may weigh heavily against its being suitable for presentation as a testimonial (unless, of source, sarcastic testimonials are desired).
- One or more blacklisted terms in candidate textual statement 112 may also weigh against it being deemed suitable for presentation as a testimonial.
- Structural details of candidate textual statements 112 may also be weighted, e.g., based on various information. For example, suppose a product received generally negative reviews prior to an update, but after the update (which may have fixed a problem with the product), the reviews started being generally positive. Testimonial scoring engine 116 may assign more weight to candidate textual statements 112 that are dated after the update than before. Additionally or alternatively, testimonial scoring engine 116 may weight candidate textual statements 112 differently depending on their level of “staleness”; e.g., newer statements may be weighted more heavily.
- testimonial scoring engine 116 may compare one or more identified characteristics of the entity expressed in a candidate textual statement 112 with known characteristics of the entity. The more these identified and known characteristics match, the higher the measure of suitability for presentation as a testimonial may be. Conversely, if characteristics of an entity expressed in a candidate textual statement 112 are contradictory (e.g., candidate statement says product X has feature Y, whereas it is known that product X does not have feature Y), testimonial scoring engine 116 may determine a lower measure of suitability for presentation as a testimonial.
- Known characteristics about an entity may include various things, including but not limited to the entity's name, creator (e.g., if a product), one or more identifiers (e.g., serial numbers, model numbers), a type, a genre, a price, a rating, etc.
- the more words or phrases contained in a candidate textual statement 112 that are the same as, or similar to (e.g., synonymous with), words or phrases that constitute known characteristics of an entity in some implementations, the more suitable the candidate textual statement 112 may be for presentation as a testimonial.
- Some known characteristics may be weighed more heavily if found in a candidate textual statement 112 than others. For example, a product creator may receive less weight than, for instance, a product name, if testimonial scoring engine 116 is determining suitability for presentation as a testimonial about the product.
- testimonial scoring engine 116 may use one or more machine learning classifiers to determine what measures of suitability for presentation as testimonials to assign to candidate textual statements. These one or more machine learning classifiers may be trained using various techniques.
- a corpus of training data may include a corpus of entity descriptions 104 .
- the machine learning classifier may be trained using portions of entity descriptions 104 deemed likely to be suitable for presentation as a testimonial about the associated entity. For example, different weights may be assigned to different portions of the entity descriptions 104 based on locations of the different portions within the entity descriptions.
- the first sentence of the description tends to be well suited for presentation as a testimonial.
- the first sentence may summarize the app, describe its main features, and/or express other ideas that are of the type that might be usefully presented in testimonials.
- the predetermined locations within the entity descriptions 104 that are considered especially likely to be suitable for presentation as a testimonial may include first sentences of the entity descriptions 104 .
- more complex formulas may be employed.
- an equation such as the following may be employed to determine a weight to assign an ith sentence in an entity description:
- N + means positive integers and C may be an integer selected based on, for instance, empirical evidence suggesting that sentences i of an entity description 104 where i>C (e.g., after the Cth sentence) are unlikely to be suitable for presentation as testimonials, or at least should not be presumed suitable for presentation as a testimonial.
- the first sentence would be weighed more heavily than the second, the second more heavily than the third, and so forth.
- testimonial scoring engine 116 may analyze candidate textual statements 112 to determine how close they are to those sentences. The more a candidate textual statement 112 is like those sentences of entity descriptions 104 , the more suitable for presentation as a testimonial that candidate textual statement 112 may be.
- Machine learning classifiers utilized by testimonial scoring engine 116 may be trained in other ways as well.
- entity descriptions 104 may include sentences and/or phrases in quotations, such as quotes from critical reviews of the entity, and/or sentences or phrases having a particular format (e.g., bold, italic, larger font, colored, etc.). These sentences or phrases may be deemed more likely to be suitable for presentation as testimonials than other sentences or phrases not contained in quotes, and thus may be used to train the classifier as to what a testimonial looks like.
- techniques such as those depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5 may be used to automatically develop training data.
- testimonial scoring engine 116 may utilize other formulas to score candidate textual statement 112 .
- testimonial scoring engine 116 may utilize the following equation:
- NLP_SENTIMENT_POLARITY is a measure of sentiment orientation of candidate textual statement 112
- X is a value indicative of presence or absence of one or more categories of sentiment in candidate textual statement 112
- CS is a Cartesian similarity of candidate textual statement 112 to an entity description.
- testimonial scoring engine 116 may output candidate textual statements and measures of suitability for those candidate textual statements to be presented as testimonials.
- that data may be stored in an index 118 , e.g., so that it can be used by various other components as needed.
- a testimonial selection engine 120 may be configured to select one or more testimonials for presentation, e.g., as an accompaniment for an advertisement or search engine results.
- testimonial selection engine 120 may be informed of a particular entity for which an advertisement or search results will be displayed, and may select one or more candidate textual statements 112 associated with that entity that have the greatest measures of suitability for presentation as testimonials.
- testimonial selection engine 120 may be configured to provide feedback 122 or other data to other components such as testimonial scoring engine 116 . For example, suppose testimonial selection engine 120 determines that candidate textual statements 112 associated with a particular entity that are stored in index 118 are stale (e.g., more than n days/weeks/months/years old). Testimonial selection engine 120 may notify testimonial scoring engine 116 (or another component), and those components may collect new candidate textual statements for analysis and/or reevaluate existing candidate textual statements 112 .
- FIG. 2 depicts an example entity description 104 and accompanying user comments 108 for an app called “Big Racing Fun.”
- the first sentence which reads “Big Racing Fun is the latest and most popular arcade-style bike racing game today, brought to you from the creators of Speedboat Bonanza,” as well as other sentences/phrases from entity description 104 , may have be used in some implementations to train one or more machine learning classifiers.
- the first user comment reads “This is the most fun and easy-to-learn bike racing game I've ever played, with the best play control and graphics.”
- this comment which may be analyzed as a candidate textual statement 112 , may receive a relatively high measure of suitability for presentation as a testimonial. It describes some of the product's known features (e.g., bike racing, good play control, good graphics). It has a positive tone, which may lead to an inference that its sentiment orientation is positive. That matches its explicit sentiment orientation (five out of five stars), so it is not sarcastic. And it somewhat resembles the first sentence of the entity description 104 because, for instance, in mentions many of the same words.
- the second user comment “I'm gonna buy this game for my nephew!”, may receive a slightly lower score. It's not particularly informative, other than a general inference of positive sentiment orientation. If it said how old the nephew was, then it might be slightly more useful to other users with nieces/nephews of a similar age, but it doesn't. Depending on how many other more suitable candidate textual statements there are, this statement may or may not be selected for presentation as a testimonial.
- the third user comment “This game is AMAAAZING, said no one, ever,” may receive a lower score than the other two, for several reasons. While its inferred sentiment orientation could feasibly be positive based on the variation of the word “amazing,” its explicit sentiment orientation is very negative (zero of five stars), which is highly suggestive of sarcasm. It also includes capitalized hyperbole (“AMAAAZING”)—another potential sign of sarcasm. And, it includes a phrase, “said no one, ever,” that may be part of a modern vernacular known to intimate sarcasm.
- FIG. 3 an example method 300 of selecting textual statements for presentation as testimonials is described.
- the operations of the flow chart are described with reference to a system that performs the operations.
- This system may include various components of various computer systems.
- operations of method 300 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting.
- One or more operations may be reordered, omitted or added.
- the system may train one or more machine learning classifiers.
- Various training data may be used.
- entity descriptions may be used, with various phrases or sentences being weighted more or less heavily depending on, for instance, their locations within the entity descriptions, their fonts, and so forth.
- other training data such as collections of textual segments known to be suitable for use as testimonials, may be used instead.
- training data may be automatically developed, e.g., using techniques such as those depicted in FIGS. 4-5 .
- the system may select, from one or more electronic data sources (e.g., blogs, user review sources, social networks, comments associated therewith, etc.) a candidate textual statement associated with an entity.
- the system may identify one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement. For example, the system may annotate the candidate textual statement with various information, such as whether the textual statement contains sarcasm, one or more entity characteristics expressed in the statement, one or more facts about the structure (e.g., metadata) about the statement, and so forth.
- the system may determine, based on the identified one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement, a measure of suitability of the candidate textual statement for presentation as a testimonial about the entity. As noted above, this may be performed in various ways.
- one or more machine learning classifiers may be employed to analyze the candidate textual statement against, for instance, first sentences of a corpus of entity descriptions used as training data, or against training sets of statements for which testimonial suitability are known.
- entity characteristics expressed in a candidate textual statement may be compared to known entity characteristics to determine, for instance, an accuracy or descriptiveness of the candidate textual statement.
- one or more structural details of a candidate textual statement may be analyzed, for instance, to determine how stale the statement is.
- the system may select, e.g., based on the measure of suitability for presentation as a testimonial determined at block 308 , the candidate textual statement for presentation as a testimonial about the entity. For instance, suppose the system has selected an advertisement for presentation to a user, wherein the advertisement relates to a particular product. The system may select, based on measures of suitability for presentation as testimonials, one or more testimonials to present to the user, e.g., adjacent to the advertisement, or as part of an advertisement that is generated on the fly.
- FIGS. 4 and 5 For convenience, the operations of the FIGS. 4 and 5 are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. This system may include various components of various computer systems. Moreover, while operations of methods 400 and 500 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted or added.
- the system may obtain one or more training textual statements, e.g., from the various sources depicted in FIG. 1 or elsewhere.
- the system may determine, for each statement, whether the statement has a positive explicit sentiment. For example, does the statement come from a review with at least four out of five stars? If the answer at block 404 is no, then the system may determine at block 406 whether the statement has a negative explicit sentiment. For example, does the statement come from a review with less than three of five stars? If the answer at block 406 is yes, then method 400 proceed to block 408 , and the training textual statement may be rejected.
- “rejecting” a training textual statement may include classifying the statement as “negative,” so that it can be used as a negative training example for one or more machine learning classifiers. If the answer at block 406 is no, then the statement apparently is from a neutral or unknown source, and therefore is skipped at block 410 .
- “skipping” a statement may mean classifying the statement as “neutral,” so that it can be used (or ignored or discarded) as a neutral training example for one or more machine learning classifiers.
- the system determines whether the language of the statement is supported. For example, if the system is configured to analyze languages A, B, and C, but the training textual statement is not in any of these languages, then the system may reject the statement at block 408 . If, however, the training textual statement is in a supported language, then method 400 may proceed to block 414 .
- the system may determine whether a length of the training statement is “in bounds,” e.g., by determining whether its length satisfies one or more thresholds for word or character length. If the answer at block 414 is no, then method 400 may proceed to block 408 and the training statement may be rejected. However, if the answer at block 414 is yes, then method 400 may proceed to block 416 .
- the system may determine whether the training statement contains any sort of negation language (e.g., “not,” “contrary,” “couldn't,” “don't,” etc.). If the answer is yes, then the system may reject the statement at block 408 . However, if the answer is no, then method 400 may proceed to block 418 .
- the system may determine whether the training textual statement matches one or more negative predetermined patterns, such as a negative regular expression. These negative predetermined patterns may be configured to identify patterns found in training textual statements that are known (to a relatively high degree of confidence) not to be suitable for presentation as testimonials. If the answer is yes, then the statement may be rejected at block 408 . If the answer at block 418 is no, then method 400 may proceed to block 420 where it is determined whether the statement matches one or positive predetermined patterns, such as a positive regular expression. These positive predetermined patterns may be configured to identify patterns found in training textual statements that are known (to a relatively high degree of confidence) to be suitable for presentation as testimonials. If the answer at block 420 is yes, then the statement may be accepted at block 422 . In various implementations, “accepting” a statement may include classifying the statement as a positive training example for use by one or more machine learning classifiers.
- method 400 may proceed to block 424 , at which the system may determine whether a sentiment orientation of the statement (e.g., which may be inferred using various techniques described above) satisfies a particular threshold. If the answer is no, then method 400 may proceed to block 408 , and the statement may be rejected. If the answer at block 424 is yes, then method may proceed to block 422 , at which the statement is accepted. As shown at blocks 408 , 410 , and 422 , rejected, neutral, and accepted statements may be further processed using the various techniques employed in method 500 of FIG. 5 .
- the system may receive or otherwise obtain one or more training textual statements output and/or annotated (e.g., as “positive,” “neutral,” “negative”) by the first decision tree of FIG. 4 (i.e., method 400 ).
- the system may determine whether the statement was rejected (e.g., at block 408 ). If the answer is yes, then the statement may be further rejected at block 554 (e.g., classified as a negative training example) and/or may be assigned a probability score, p, of 0.06. This probability score may be utilized by one or more machine learning classifiers as a weighted negative or positive training example to facilitate more fine-tuned analysis training textual statements.
- the system may determine whether a resulting probability score satisfies one or more thresholds, such as 0.5. In some such embodiments, if the threshold is satisfied, the textual statement may be classified as a “positive” training example. If the threshold is not satisfied, the textual statement may be classified as a “negative” training example. At block 554 , p may be assigned a score of 0.06, which puts it far below a minimum threshold of 0.5.
- method 500 may proceed to block 556 .
- the system may determine whether the training textual statement, when used as input for one or more language models, yields an output that satisfies an upper threshold. For instance, various language models may be employed to determine a measure of how well-formed a training textual statement is. If the training textual statement is “too” well-formed, then it may be perceived as puffery (e.g., authored by or on behalf of an entity itself), rather than an honest human assessment. Puffery may not be suitable for use as a testimonial. If the answer at block 556 is yes, then method 500 may proceed to block 558 , at which the training textual statement may be rejected.
- puffery e.g., authored by or on behalf of an entity itself
- the system may system may determine whether the training textual statement, when used as input for one or more language models, yields an output that satisfies a lower threshold. For instance, if the training textual statement is not well-formed enough, then it may be perceived as uninformative and/or unintelligible. Uninformative or unintelligent-sounding statements may not be suitable for use as testimonials, or may be somewhat less useful than other statements, at any rate. If the answer at block 560 is yes, then method 500 may proceed to block 562 , at which the training textual statement may be rejected.
- probability score p may be assigned various values, such as 0.4, which is somewhat closer to the threshold (e.g., 0.5) than the probability scores assigned at blocks 554 and 558 . This may be because, for instance, an unintelligent sounding statement, while not ideal for use as a testimonial, may be more suitable than puffery. If the answer at block 560 is no, then method 500 may proceed to block 564 .
- the system may determine whether the statement has a negative sentiment orientation, e.g., using techniques described above. If the answer is yes, then method 500 may proceed to block 566 , at which the statement may be rejected. In some implementations, at block 566 , p may be assigned a value such as 0.323, which reflects that statements of negative sentiment are not likely suitable for use as testimonials. If the answer at block 564 is no, however, then method 500 may proceed to block 568 .
- the system may determine whether the statement has a neutral sentiment orientation, e.g., using techniques described above. If the answer is yes, then method 500 may proceed to block 570 , at which the statement may be rejected. In some implementations, at block 570 , p may be assigned a value such as 0.415. This reflects that while a neutral statement may not be ideal for use as a testimonial, it still be may better suited than, say, a negative statement as determined at block 566 . If the answer at block 568 is no, however, then method 500 may proceed to block 572 .
- the system may compare normalized output of one or more language models that results from input of the training textual statement to one or more normalized upper thresholds.
- language model computation may calculate “readability” using a formula such as the following:
- n is equal to a number of probabilities.
- the above formula may tend to score longer training textual statements as less readable than longer statements. Accordingly, normalizing lengths of training textual statements may yield a formula that may be used to compare phrases of different lengths, such as the following:
- candidate and/or training textual statements may be represented in various ways.
- a textual statement and/or statement selected for use as a testimonial may be represented as a “bag of words,” a “bag of tokens,” or even as a “bag of regular expressions.”
- a bag of parts of speech tags, categories, labels, and/or semantic frames may be associated with textual statements.
- Various other data may be associated with statements, including but not limited to information pertaining to a subject entity (e.g., application name, genre, creator), an indication of negation, one or more sentiment features (which may be discretized), text length, ill-formed ratio, punctuation ratio (which may be discretized), and/or a measure of how well-formed a statement is determined, for instance, from operation of a language model.
- a subject entity e.g., application name, genre, creator
- an indication of negation e.g., one or more sentiment features (which may be discretized)
- text length e.g., text length, ill-formed ratio, punctuation ratio (which may be discretized)

Abstract
Description
- Entities such as products, product creators, and/or product vendors may be discussed in various locations online by individuals associated with the entities and/or by other individuals that are exposed to the entity. For example, an online review of a particular product may be in text, audio, and/or video form. Oftentimes such reviews are accompanied by a comments section where users may leave comments about the product and/or the review. As another example, a creator of a downloadable product such as a software application for mobile computing devices (often referred to as “apps”) may prepare and post a description of the software application on an online marketplace of apps. Oftentimes such descriptions are accompanied by comments sections and/or user reviews. These various entity discussions may include information about entities that may not have been provided or generated, for instance, by individuals associated with the entities.
- The present disclosure is generally directed to methods, apparatus and computer-readable media (transitory and non-transitory) for determining suitability of textual statements associated with an entity for presentation as testimonials about the entity. As used herein, a “textual statements associated with an entity,” or a “snippet,” may be a clause of a multi-clause sentence, an entire sentence, and/or a sequence of sentences (e.g., a paragraph). Textual statements associated with entities may be extracted from, for instance, entity descriptions provided by individuals or organizations associated with the entities (e.g., a description of an app by an app creator posted on an online marketplace or social network), ad creatives (e.g., presented as “sponsored search results” returned in response to a search engine query), reviews about entities (e.g., a review by a critic in an online magazine or on a social network), and so forth. A “textual statement associated with entity” may also include user comment associated with entity descriptions and/or textual reviews about entities. Of course, these are just examples; textual statements associated with entities may come from other sources as well, such as online forums, chat rooms, review clearinghouses, and so forth.
- A “testimonial” refers to a textual statement associated with an entity that may be relatively concise, informative, and/or self-contained. A testimonial often may be a sentence or two in length, although a short paragraph may serve as a suitable testimonial in some instances. In various implementations, textual statements associated with an entity may be analyzed to determine their suitability for presentation as testimonials about the entity (also referred to herein as “testimonial-ness”). In some implementations, measures or scores of testimonial-ness may be determined for one or more textual statements about an entity based on various criteria. Based on these measures or scores, textual statements associated with the entity may be selected for presentation in various scenarios, such as accompanying an advertisement for a particular entity, accompanying search results that are in some way relatable to the entity, and so forth.
- In some implementations, a computer implemented method may be provided that includes the steps of: selecting, by one or more processors from one or more electronic data sources, a candidate textual statement associated with an entity; identifying, by one or more of the processors, one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement; and determining, by one or more of the processors based on the identified one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement, a measure of suitability of the candidate textual statement for presentation as a testimonial about the entity.
- This method and other implementations of technology disclosed herein may each optionally include one or more of the following features.
- In some implementations, identifying one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement may include determining, by one or more of the processors, a measure of sarcasm expressed by the candidate textual statement. In various implementations, identifying one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement may include determining, by one or more of the processors based on content of the candidate textual statement, an inferred sentiment orientation associated with the candidate textual statement. In some implementations, the method may include comparing the inferred sentiment orientation of the candidate textual statement to an explicit sentiment orientation associated with the candidate textual statement to determine a measure of sarcasm associated with the candidate textual statement.
- In various implementations, the identifying may include determining, by one or more of the processors, one or more structural details underlying the candidate textual statement. In various implementations, the identifying may include identifying, by one or more of the processors, one or more characteristics of the entity expressed in the candidate textual statement. In various implementations, the determining may include comparing, by one or more of the processors, the one or more identified characteristics of the entity expressed in the candidate textual statement with known characteristics of the entity.
- In various implementations, the determining may be performed using a machine learning classifier. In various implementations, the method may further include training the machine learning classifier using portions of entity descriptions deemed likely to be suitable for presentation as a testimonial about the entity. In various implementations, the portions of entity descriptions deemed likely to be suitable for presentation as a testimonial about the entity may include portions at predetermined locations within the entity descriptions. In various implementations, the predetermined locations within the entity descriptions include first sentences of the entity descriptions. In various implementations, training the machine learning classifier may include assigning different weights to different portions of the entity descriptions based on locations of the different portions within the entity descriptions. In various implementations, the portions of entity descriptions deemed likely to be suitable for presentation as a testimonial about the entity may include portions enclosed in quotations or having a particular format.
- In various implementations, the method may further include selecting, by one or more of the processors, the candidate textual statement for presentation as a testimonial about the entity based on the measure of suitability. In various implementations, the entity may be a product.
- In some implementations, the method may further include automatically generating training data for use in training the machine learning classifier. In some implementations, automatically generating training data may include evaluating one or more training textual statements using a language model. In some implementations, the method may further include comparing output of the language model to both an upper and lower threshold. In various implementations, the method may further include designating the one or more training textual statements as negative where output from the language model for those training textual statements indicates they are above the upper threshold or below the lower threshold.
- Other implementations may include a non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing instructions executable by a processor to perform a method such as one or more of the methods described above. Yet another implementation may include a system including memory and one or more processors operable to execute instructions, stored in the memory, to perform a method such as one or more of the methods described above.
- It should be appreciated that all combinations of the foregoing concepts and additional concepts described in greater detail herein are contemplated as being part of the subject matter disclosed herein. For example, all combinations of claimed subject matter appearing at the end of this disclosure are contemplated as being part of the subject matter disclosed herein.

FIG. 1 illustrates an example of how textual statements associated with one or more entities may be analyzed by various components of the present disclosure, so that one or more textual statements associated with the one or more entities may be selected for presentation as a testimonial about the one or more entities. Various components illustrated inFIG. 1 may be implemented in one or more computers that communicate, for example, through one or more networks (not depicted). Various components illustrated inFIG. 1 may individually or collectively include memory for storage of data and software applications, one or more processors for accessing data and executing applications, and components that facilitate communication over a network. The operations performed by these components may be distributed across multiple computer systems. In various implementations, these components may be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network. - In
FIG. 1 , agraph engine 100 may be configured to build and maintain anindex 101 of collections of “entities” and associated entity attributes. In various implementations,graph engine 100 may represent entities as nodes and relationships between entities as edges. In various implementations,graph engine 100 may represent collections of entities, entity attributes and entity relationships as directed or undirected graphs, hierarchal graphs (e.g., trees), and so forth. As used herein, an “entity” may generally be any person, organization, place, and/or thing. An “organization” may include a company, partnership, nonprofit, government (or particular governmental entity), club, sports team, a product vendor, a product creator, a product distributor, etc. A “thing” may include tangible (and in some cases fungible) products such as a particular model of tool, a particular model of kitchen or other appliance, a particular model of toy, a particular electronic model (e.g., camera, printer, headphones, smart phone, set top box, video game system, etc.), and so forth. A “thing” additionally or alternatively may include an intangible (e.g., downloadable) product such as software (e.g., the apps described above). - In this specification, the term “database” and “index” will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data. The data of the database and/or the index does not need to be structured in any particular way and it can be stored on storage devices in one or more geographic locations. Thus, for example, the
indices 101 and/or 118 may include multiple collections of data, each of which may be organized and accessed differently. - As noted above, textual statements associated with entities may be obtained from various sources. In
FIG. 1 , for instance, a corpus of one or more entity reviews 102 and a corpus of one ormore entity descriptions 104 are available. Textual statements associated with entities may of course be obtained from other sources (e.g., social networks, online forums, ad creatives), but for the sake of brevity, entity reviews and entity descriptions will be used as examples herein. In various implementations, entity reviews 102 and/orentity descriptions 104 may be accompanied by one ormore user comments 106 and/or 108, respectively. - A candidate
statement selection engine 110 may be in communication withgraph engine 100. Candidatestatement selection engine 110 may be configured to utilize various techniques to select, from entity reviews 102 and/orentity descriptions 104, one or more textual statements ascandidate statements 112 about a particular entity documented inindex 101. For example, the corpus ofentity descriptions 104 may include descriptions of various apps available for download on an online marketplace. Candidatestatement selection engine 110 may analyze each entity description using various techniques to identify a particular entity (or more than one entity) that the entity description is associated with. In some instances, candidatestatement selection engine 110 may look at a title or metadata associated with theentity description 104 that indicates which entity it describes. In other instances, candidatestatement selection engine 110 may use more complex techniques, such as a rules-based approach and/or one or more machine learning classifiers, to determine which entity anentity description 104 describes. Once an entity (or more than one entity) described in anentity description 104 is identified, various clauses, sentences, paragraphs, or even the whole description, may be selected ascandidate statements 112 associated with that entity. Comments associated with aparticular entity description 104 may also be selected ascandidate statements 112 associated with that entity. A similar approach may be used for entity reviews 102 and their associatedcomments 106. - An
attribute identification engine 114 may be configured to identify one or more attributes ofcandidate statements 112. In some implementations, such as inFIG. 1 , attributeidentification engine 114 may output versions of the candidate statements annotated with data indicative of these attributes, although this is not required. In other implementations, data indicative of the attributes may be output in other forms. -
Attribute identification engine 114 may identify a variety of attributes of acandidate statement 112. For example, in some implementations, an inferred “sentiment orientation” associated with the candidatetextual statement 112 may be determined, e.g., byattribute identification engine 114, based on content of the candidatetextual statement 112. A “sentiment orientation” may refer to a general tone, polarity, and/or “feeling” of a particular candidate textual statement, e.g., positive, negative, neutral, etc. A sentiment orientation of a candidate textual statement may be determined using various sentiment analysis techniques, such as natural language processing, statistics, and/or machine learning to extract, identify, or otherwise characterize sentiment expressed by content of a candidate textual statement. - In some scenarios, candidate textual statements laced with sarcasm may not be suitable for presentation as testimonials. For example, a user comment (e.g., 106 or 108) that reads, “This camera has an amazing battery life, NOT!!” may not be suitable for presentation as a testimonial if the goal is to provide testimonials that will encourage consumers to purchase the camera. On the other hand, if the goal is to present testimonials casting light on aspects of the camera that are subpar, then such a testimonial may be more suitable. Accordingly, in some implementations, attribute identification engine may determine a measure of sarcasm expressed by one or more candidate
textual statements 112. - A measure of sarcasm expressed by a candidate
textual statement 112 may be determined using various techniques. In some embodiments, the sentiment orientation inferred from the content of the candidate textual statement may be compared to an explicit sentiment orientation associated with the candidate textual statement. For example, when leaving reviews or comments about an entity (e.g., an app or product on an online marketplace), users may assign a quantitative score to the entity, such as three of five stars, a letter grade, and so forth. That quantitative score may represent an explicit sentiment orientation associated with the candidate textual statement. If the explicit sentiment orientation is more or less aligned with the inferred sentiment orientation, then the candidate textual statement is not likely sarcastic. However, if the explicit and inferred sentiment orientations are at odds, then candidate textual statement may have a sarcastic tone. - For example, suppose a candidate textual statement reads, “This product is SO RELIABLE, I just can't wait to buy one for EACH MEMBER OF MY FAMILY so that they, too, can experience the UNMITIGATED joy this product has brought me,” but that an associated explicit sentiment orientation is indisputably negative, e.g., zero of five stars. The conflict between the inferred and explicit sentiment orientations in this example may demonstrate sarcasm, which attribute
identification engine 114 may detect and/or annotate accordingly. -
Attribute identification engine 114 may use other cues to detect sarcasm as well. For example, some users may tend to insert various punctuation clues for sarcasm, such as excessive capitalization. As another example, attributeidentification engine 114 may compare inferred sentiment orientation associated with one candidate textual statement about an entity with an aggregate inferred sentiment orientation associated with that entity. If the lone and aggregate inferred sentiment orientations are vastly different, and especially if the sentiment orientation of the one candidate textual statement is positive and sentiment orientation of the rest of the candidate textual statements are negative, the one may be sarcastic. Other cues of sarcasm in a candidate textual statement may include, for instance, excessive hyperbole, or other tonal hints that may change as the nomenclature of the day evolves. - In some implementations, attribute
identification engine 114 may identify and/or annotate particular words or phrases as being particularly indicative of sarcasm or some other sentiment orientation. For example, attributeidentification engine 114 may maintain a “blacklist” of terms that it may annotate. Presence of one or more of these terms may cause various downstream components, such astestimonial selection engine 120, to essentially discard acandidate statement 112. For example, one or more of the following words, phrases, and/or emoticons may be included on a blacklist: “not,” “please,” “fix,” “sorry,” “couldn't,” “shouldn't,” “bad,” “ugly,” “can't,” “don't,” “update,” “but,” “previous,” “terrible,” “killed,” “?,” “waste,” “could,” “:(,” “:-(,” “refund,” “aren't,” “isn't,” “good good,” “love love,” “best best,” “work,” “otherwise,” “wouldn't,” “tablet,” and/or. Other words, phrases, and/or emoticons may be included on such a blacklist. -
Attribute identification engine 114 may identify other attributes of acandidate statement 112. For example, in some implementations, attributeidentification engine 114 may determine one or more structural details underlying the candidate textual statement. Structural details of a candidatetextual statement 112 may include things like its metadata or its underlying HTML/XML. Metadata may include things like a source/author of the statement, the time the statement was made, and so forth. - As another example, attribute
identification engine 114 may identify one or more characteristics of an entity expressed in a candidatetextual statement 112. Various natural language processing techniques may be used, including but not limited to co-reference resolution, to identify characteristics of an entity expressed in a candidate. For example, suppose a candidatetextual statement 112 associated with a particular product reads, “This product has a great feature X that I really like, and I also like how its custom battery is long lasting.”Attribute identification engine 114 may identify (and in some cases annotate the candidatetextual statement 112 with) “feature X,” e.g., modified with “great,” as well as a “battery” modified by “custom” and “long-lasting.” -
Testimonial scoring engine 116 may be configured to determine, based on attributes of one or more candidatetextual statements 112 identified byattribute identification engine 114, a measure of suitability of the one or more candidate textual statements for presentation as one or more testimonials about the entity. A “measure of suitability for presentation as a testimonial,” or “testimonialness,” may be expressed in various quantitative ways, such as a numeric score, a percent, a ranking (if compared to other candidate textual statements), and so forth. -
Testimonial scoring engine 116 may determine the measure of testimonialness in various ways. In some implementations,testimonial scoring engine 116 may weight various attributes of candidatetextual statements 112 identified byattribute identification engine 114 differently. For example, if a particular candidatetextual statement 112 is annotated as having a positive inferred sentiment orientation, and positive testimonials are sought, then that candidate receive a relatively high measure of testimonialness. On the other hand, the fact that a particular candidatetextual statement 112 is annotated as being sarcastic may weigh heavily against its being suitable for presentation as a testimonial (unless, of source, sarcastic testimonials are desired). One or more blacklisted terms in candidatetextual statement 112 may also weigh against it being deemed suitable for presentation as a testimonial. Structural details of candidatetextual statements 112 may also be weighted, e.g., based on various information. For example, suppose a product received generally negative reviews prior to an update, but after the update (which may have fixed a problem with the product), the reviews started being generally positive.Testimonial scoring engine 116 may assign more weight to candidatetextual statements 112 that are dated after the update than before. Additionally or alternatively,testimonial scoring engine 116 may weight candidatetextual statements 112 differently depending on their level of “staleness”; e.g., newer statements may be weighted more heavily. - In some implementations,
testimonial scoring engine 116 may compare one or more identified characteristics of the entity expressed in a candidatetextual statement 112 with known characteristics of the entity. The more these identified and known characteristics match, the higher the measure of suitability for presentation as a testimonial may be. Conversely, if characteristics of an entity expressed in a candidatetextual statement 112 are contradictory (e.g., candidate statement says product X has feature Y, whereas it is known that product X does not have feature Y),testimonial scoring engine 116 may determine a lower measure of suitability for presentation as a testimonial. - Known characteristics about an entity may include various things, including but not limited to the entity's name, creator (e.g., if a product), one or more identifiers (e.g., serial numbers, model numbers), a type, a genre, a price, a rating, etc. The more words or phrases contained in a candidate
textual statement 112 that are the same as, or similar to (e.g., synonymous with), words or phrases that constitute known characteristics of an entity, in some implementations, the more suitable the candidatetextual statement 112 may be for presentation as a testimonial. Some known characteristics may be weighed more heavily if found in a candidatetextual statement 112 than others. For example, a product creator may receive less weight than, for instance, a product name, iftestimonial scoring engine 116 is determining suitability for presentation as a testimonial about the product. - In some implementations,
testimonial scoring engine 116 may use one or more machine learning classifiers to determine what measures of suitability for presentation as testimonials to assign to candidate textual statements. These one or more machine learning classifiers may be trained using various techniques. In some implementations, a corpus of training data may include a corpus ofentity descriptions 104. The machine learning classifier may be trained using portions ofentity descriptions 104 deemed likely to be suitable for presentation as a testimonial about the associated entity. For example, different weights may be assigned to different portions of theentity descriptions 104 based on locations of the different portions within the entity descriptions. - For example, it may be the case that, in app descriptions on an online marketplace, the first sentence of the description tends to be well suited for presentation as a testimonial. The first sentence may summarize the app, describe its main features, and/or express other ideas that are of the type that might be usefully presented in testimonials. In such implementations, the predetermined locations within the
entity descriptions 104 that are considered especially likely to be suitable for presentation as a testimonial may include first sentences of theentity descriptions 104. - In some implementations, more complex formulas may be employed. For example, in some implementations, an equation such as the following may be employed to determine a weight to assign an ith sentence in an entity description:

∀i∈N + : i≤C,2−i - N+ means positive integers and C may be an integer selected based on, for instance, empirical evidence suggesting that sentences i of an
entity description 104 where i>C (e.g., after the Cth sentence) are unlikely to be suitable for presentation as testimonials, or at least should not be presumed suitable for presentation as a testimonial. Thus, using this formula, the first sentence would be weighed more heavily than the second, the second more heavily than the third, and so forth. - Once trained using sentences or phrases at locations deemed likely to contain textual statements with high testimonial-ness,
testimonial scoring engine 116 may analyze candidatetextual statements 112 to determine how close they are to those sentences. The more a candidatetextual statement 112 is like those sentences ofentity descriptions 104, the more suitable for presentation as a testimonial that candidatetextual statement 112 may be. - Machine learning classifiers utilized by
testimonial scoring engine 116 may be trained in other ways as well. For example,entity descriptions 104 may include sentences and/or phrases in quotations, such as quotes from critical reviews of the entity, and/or sentences or phrases having a particular format (e.g., bold, italic, larger font, colored, etc.). These sentences or phrases may be deemed more likely to be suitable for presentation as testimonials than other sentences or phrases not contained in quotes, and thus may be used to train the classifier as to what a testimonial looks like. In other implementations, techniques such as those depicted inFIGS. 4 and 5 may be used to automatically develop training data. - In some implementations,
testimonial scoring engine 116 may utilize other formulas to score candidatetextual statement 112. For example,testimonial scoring engine 116 may utilize the following equation: -
score=NLP SENTIMENT POLARITY+X+0.5×CS - wherein NLP_SENTIMENT_POLARITY is a measure of sentiment orientation of candidate
textual statement 112, “X” is a value indicative of presence or absence of one or more categories of sentiment in candidatetextual statement 112, and “CS” is a Cartesian similarity of candidatetextual statement 112 to an entity description. - In various implementations,
testimonial scoring engine 116 may output candidate textual statements and measures of suitability for those candidate textual statements to be presented as testimonials. In some implementations, that data may be stored in anindex 118, e.g., so that it can be used by various other components as needed. For example, atestimonial selection engine 120 may be configured to select one or more testimonials for presentation, e.g., as an accompaniment for an advertisement or search engine results. In some implementations,testimonial selection engine 120 may be informed of a particular entity for which an advertisement or search results will be displayed, and may select one or more candidatetextual statements 112 associated with that entity that have the greatest measures of suitability for presentation as testimonials. - In some implementations,
testimonial selection engine 120 may be configured to providefeedback 122 or other data to other components such astestimonial scoring engine 116. For example, supposetestimonial selection engine 120 determines that candidatetextual statements 112 associated with a particular entity that are stored inindex 118 are stale (e.g., more than n days/weeks/months/years old).Testimonial selection engine 120 may notify testimonial scoring engine 116 (or another component), and those components may collect new candidate textual statements for analysis and/or reevaluate existing candidatetextual statements 112. -
FIG. 2 depicts anexample entity description 104 and accompanyinguser comments 108 for an app called “Big Racing Fun.” The first sentence, which reads “Big Racing Fun is the latest and most popular arcade-style bike racing game today, brought to you from the creators of Speedboat Bonanza,” as well as other sentences/phrases fromentity description 104, may have be used in some implementations to train one or more machine learning classifiers. - The first user comment reads “This is the most fun and easy-to-learn bike racing game I've ever played, with the best play control and graphics.” In some implementations, this comment, which may be analyzed as a candidate
textual statement 112, may receive a relatively high measure of suitability for presentation as a testimonial. It describes some of the product's known features (e.g., bike racing, good play control, good graphics). It has a positive tone, which may lead to an inference that its sentiment orientation is positive. That matches its explicit sentiment orientation (five out of five stars), so it is not sarcastic. And it somewhat resembles the first sentence of theentity description 104 because, for instance, in mentions many of the same words. - The second user comment, “I'm gonna buy this game for my nephew!”, may receive a slightly lower score. It's not particularly informative, other than a general inference of positive sentiment orientation. If it said how old the nephew was, then it might be slightly more useful to other users with nieces/nephews of a similar age, but it doesn't. Depending on how many other more suitable candidate textual statements there are, this statement may or may not be selected for presentation as a testimonial.
- The third user comment, “This game is AMAAAZING, said no one, ever,” may receive a lower score than the other two, for several reasons. While its inferred sentiment orientation could feasibly be positive based on the variation of the word “amazing,” its explicit sentiment orientation is very negative (zero of five stars), which is highly suggestive of sarcasm. It also includes capitalized hyperbole (“AMAAAZING”)—another potential sign of sarcasm. And, it includes a phrase, “said no one, ever,” that may be part of a modern vernacular known to intimate sarcasm.
- Referring now to
FIG. 3 , anexample method 300 of selecting textual statements for presentation as testimonials is described. For convenience, the operations of the flow chart are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. This system may include various components of various computer systems. Moreover, while operations ofmethod 300 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted or added. - In some implementations, at
block 302, the system may train one or more machine learning classifiers. Various training data may be used. In some implementations, and as mentioned above, entity descriptions may be used, with various phrases or sentences being weighted more or less heavily depending on, for instance, their locations within the entity descriptions, their fonts, and so forth. In other implementations, other training data, such as collections of textual segments known to be suitable for use as testimonials, may be used instead. In some implementations, training data may be automatically developed, e.g., using techniques such as those depicted inFIGS. 4-5 . - At
block 304, the system may select, from one or more electronic data sources (e.g., blogs, user review sources, social networks, comments associated therewith, etc.) a candidate textual statement associated with an entity. Atblock 306, the system may identify one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement. For example, the system may annotate the candidate textual statement with various information, such as whether the textual statement contains sarcasm, one or more entity characteristics expressed in the statement, one or more facts about the structure (e.g., metadata) about the statement, and so forth. - At
block 308, the system may determine, based on the identified one or more attributes of the candidate textual statement, a measure of suitability of the candidate textual statement for presentation as a testimonial about the entity. As noted above, this may be performed in various ways. In some implementations, one or more machine learning classifiers may be employed to analyze the candidate textual statement against, for instance, first sentences of a corpus of entity descriptions used as training data, or against training sets of statements for which testimonial suitability are known. In some implementations, entity characteristics expressed in a candidate textual statement may be compared to known entity characteristics to determine, for instance, an accuracy or descriptiveness of the candidate textual statement. In some implementations, one or more structural details of a candidate textual statement may be analyzed, for instance, to determine how stale the statement is. - At
block 310, the system may select, e.g., based on the measure of suitability for presentation as a testimonial determined atblock 308, the candidate textual statement for presentation as a testimonial about the entity. For instance, suppose the system has selected an advertisement for presentation to a user, wherein the advertisement relates to a particular product. The system may select, based on measures of suitability for presentation as testimonials, one or more testimonials to present to the user, e.g., adjacent to the advertisement, or as part of an advertisement that is generated on the fly. - Determining whether candidate textual statements are suitable for use as testimonials may be trivial for a human being. However, developing clear guidelines or properties for use by one or more computers to identify suitable testimonials may be challenging given the unconstrained nature of written language, among other things. Accordingly, in various implementations, various techniques may be employed to automatically develop training data that may be used, for instance, to train one or more machine learning classifiers (e.g., at block 302). Examples of such techniques are depicted in
FIGS. 4 and 5 . For convenience, the operations of theFIGS. 4 and 5 are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. This system may include various components of various computer systems. Moreover, while operations ofmethods - Referring to
FIG. 4 , atblock 402, the system may obtain one or more training textual statements, e.g., from the various sources depicted inFIG. 1 or elsewhere. Atblock 404, the system may determine, for each statement, whether the statement has a positive explicit sentiment. For example, does the statement come from a review with at least four out of five stars? If the answer atblock 404 is no, then the system may determine atblock 406 whether the statement has a negative explicit sentiment. For example, does the statement come from a review with less than three of five stars? If the answer atblock 406 is yes, thenmethod 400 proceed to block 408, and the training textual statement may be rejected. In some implementations, “rejecting” a training textual statement may include classifying the statement as “negative,” so that it can be used as a negative training example for one or more machine learning classifiers. If the answer atblock 406 is no, then the statement apparently is from a neutral or unknown source, and therefore is skipped atblock 410. In various implementations, “skipping” a statement may mean classifying the statement as “neutral,” so that it can be used (or ignored or discarded) as a neutral training example for one or more machine learning classifiers. - Back at
block 404, if the answer is yes, then the system determines whether the language of the statement is supported. For example, if the system is configured to analyze languages A, B, and C, but the training textual statement is not in any of these languages, then the system may reject the statement atblock 408. If, however, the training textual statement is in a supported language, thenmethod 400 may proceed to block 414. - At
block 414, the system may determine whether a length of the training statement is “in bounds,” e.g., by determining whether its length satisfies one or more thresholds for word or character length. If the answer atblock 414 is no, thenmethod 400 may proceed to block 408 and the training statement may be rejected. However, if the answer atblock 414 is yes, thenmethod 400 may proceed to block 416. Atblock 416, the system may determine whether the training statement contains any sort of negation language (e.g., “not,” “contrary,” “couldn't,” “don't,” etc.). If the answer is yes, then the system may reject the statement atblock 408. However, if the answer is no, thenmethod 400 may proceed to block 418. - At
block 418, the system may determine whether the training textual statement matches one or more negative predetermined patterns, such as a negative regular expression. These negative predetermined patterns may be configured to identify patterns found in training textual statements that are known (to a relatively high degree of confidence) not to be suitable for presentation as testimonials. If the answer is yes, then the statement may be rejected atblock 408. If the answer atblock 418 is no, thenmethod 400 may proceed to block 420 where it is determined whether the statement matches one or positive predetermined patterns, such as a positive regular expression. These positive predetermined patterns may be configured to identify patterns found in training textual statements that are known (to a relatively high degree of confidence) to be suitable for presentation as testimonials. If the answer atblock 420 is yes, then the statement may be accepted atblock 422. In various implementations, “accepting” a statement may include classifying the statement as a positive training example for use by one or more machine learning classifiers. - If the answer at
block 420 is no, thenmethod 400 may proceed to block 424, at which the system may determine whether a sentiment orientation of the statement (e.g., which may be inferred using various techniques described above) satisfies a particular threshold. If the answer is no, thenmethod 400 may proceed to block 408, and the statement may be rejected. If the answer atblock 424 is yes, then method may proceed to block 422, at which the statement is accepted. As shown atblocks method 500 ofFIG. 5 . - Referring now to
FIG. 5 , atblock 550, the system may receive or otherwise obtain one or more training textual statements output and/or annotated (e.g., as “positive,” “neutral,” “negative”) by the first decision tree ofFIG. 4 (i.e., method 400). Atblock 552, the system may determine whether the statement was rejected (e.g., at block 408). If the answer is yes, then the statement may be further rejected at block 554 (e.g., classified as a negative training example) and/or may be assigned a probability score, p, of 0.06. This probability score may be utilized by one or more machine learning classifiers as a weighted negative or positive training example to facilitate more fine-tuned analysis training textual statements. In some implementations, the system may determine whether a resulting probability score satisfies one or more thresholds, such as 0.5. In some such embodiments, if the threshold is satisfied, the textual statement may be classified as a “positive” training example. If the threshold is not satisfied, the textual statement may be classified as a “negative” training example. Atblock 554, p may be assigned a score of 0.06, which puts it far below a minimum threshold of 0.5. - Back at
block 552, if the answer is no, thenmethod 500 may proceed to block 556. Atblock 556, the system may determine whether the training textual statement, when used as input for one or more language models, yields an output that satisfies an upper threshold. For instance, various language models may be employed to determine a measure of how well-formed a training textual statement is. If the training textual statement is “too” well-formed, then it may be perceived as puffery (e.g., authored by or on behalf of an entity itself), rather than an honest human assessment. Puffery may not be suitable for use as a testimonial. If the answer atblock 556 is yes, thenmethod 500 may proceed to block 558, at which the training textual statement may be rejected. In some implementations, probability score p may be assigned various values, such as 0.133, which is somewhat closer to the threshold (e.g., 0.5) than the probability score p=0.06 assigned atblock 554. If the answer atblock 556 is no, thenmethod 500 may proceed to block 560. - At
block 560, the system may system may determine whether the training textual statement, when used as input for one or more language models, yields an output that satisfies a lower threshold. For instance, if the training textual statement is not well-formed enough, then it may be perceived as uninformative and/or unintelligible. Uninformative or unintelligent-sounding statements may not be suitable for use as testimonials, or may be somewhat less useful than other statements, at any rate. If the answer atblock 560 is yes, thenmethod 500 may proceed to block 562, at which the training textual statement may be rejected. In some implementations, probability score p may be assigned various values, such as 0.4, which is somewhat closer to the threshold (e.g., 0.5) than the probability scores assigned atblocks block 560 is no, thenmethod 500 may proceed to block 564. - At
block 564, the system may determine whether the statement has a negative sentiment orientation, e.g., using techniques described above. If the answer is yes, thenmethod 500 may proceed to block 566, at which the statement may be rejected. In some implementations, atblock 566, p may be assigned a value such as 0.323, which reflects that statements of negative sentiment are not likely suitable for use as testimonials. If the answer atblock 564 is no, however, thenmethod 500 may proceed to block 568. - At
block 568, the system may determine whether the statement has a neutral sentiment orientation, e.g., using techniques described above. If the answer is yes, thenmethod 500 may proceed to block 570, at which the statement may be rejected. In some implementations, atblock 570, p may be assigned a value such as 0.415. This reflects that while a neutral statement may not be ideal for use as a testimonial, it still be may better suited than, say, a negative statement as determined atblock 566. If the answer atblock 568 is no, however, thenmethod 500 may proceed to block 572. - At
block 572, the system may compare normalized output of one or more language models that results from input of the training textual statement to one or more normalized upper thresholds. For example, language model computation may calculate “readability” using a formula such as the following: -
−log Πi=1 n Pr(X i|1, . . . , n-1) - where n is equal to a number of probabilities. However, the above formula may tend to score longer training textual statements as less readable than longer statements. Accordingly, normalizing lengths of training textual statements may yield a formula that may be used to compare phrases of different lengths, such as the following:
-
- At
block 572, if the normalized upper threshold is satisfied, thenmethod 500 may proceed to block 574, at which the training statement may be rejected and/or assigned a probability score p=0.347. If the answer atblock 572 is no, however, then atblock 576, the training statement may be accepted (e.g., classified as a positive training example). In some implementations, atblock 576, the system may assign the training statement a relatively high probability score, such as p=0.79. - In various implementations, candidate and/or training textual statements may be represented in various ways. In some implementations, a textual statement and/or statement selected for use as a testimonial may be represented as a “bag of words,” a “bag of tokens,” or even as a “bag of regular expressions.” Additionally or alternatively, a bag of parts of speech tags, categories, labels, and/or semantic frames may be associated with textual statements. Various other data may be associated with statements, including but not limited to information pertaining to a subject entity (e.g., application name, genre, creator), an indication of negation, one or more sentiment features (which may be discretized), text length, ill-formed ratio, punctuation ratio (which may be discretized), and/or a measure of how well-formed a statement is determined, for instance, from operation of a language model.
