- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of an example process 200 for providing a consolidated system tray.
- Process 200 begins and at block 202 , the system determines a plurality of menu items for displaying in a consolidated system tray of a computer operating system.
- the plurality of menu items correspond to settings for using the computer operating system.
- the settings for using the computer operating system may include, for example, user account settings, network settings, Bluetooth settings, and other general settings (e.g., settings for adjusting wall paper, language settings, keyboard settings, or sound settings) for using the operating system.
- the menu items determined at block 202 may be determined based on various factors such as, for example, default settings, system configuration, or user actions. For example, a set of menu items may be predetermined for displaying in an initial view of the consolidated system tray by default. Specifically, network settings and user account settings may be predetermined to be displayed by default in the initial view of the consolidated system tray.
- system configuration may be taken into account when determining the menu items to display in the initial view of the consolidated system tray.
- the computer system is equipped with a Bluetooth antenna
- the presence of the Bluetooth antenna may be detected and a menu item for Bluetooth settings may also be determined to be displayed in the initial view.
- a menu item for showing the current keyboard layout and switching between different keyboard layouts may also be determined for display.
- the menu items determined for display in the initial view of the consolidated system tray may also be determined based on user activity. Specifically, if the user has switched between different keyboard layouts five times within a predetermined amount of time, a menu item for changing the keyboard layout may be determined for display in the initial view, because it is likely the user will switch keyboard layout again soon. On the other hand, if the user has not switched keyboard layout for the past two days, the menu item for switching keyboard layout may no longer be determined for display in the initial view. When such menu item is not determined for display in the initial view, however, its functionality may be accessible in the sub-menus of other menu items shown in the initial view (e.g., a sub-menu of the general system settings menu item). The sub-menus of the various menu items will be discussed in more detail below.
- the system determines a status of at least one setting corresponding to each of the plurality of menu items that are determined at block 202 .
- the determined status may indicate, for example, signal strength of a Wi-Fi network to which the computer system is connected, names of Bluetooth devices that are paired and/or connected to the computer system, the name of an account that the user has logged into, or system volume.
- the system generates a first graphic user interface (“GUI”) for displaying an initial view of the consolidated system tray.
- GUI graphic user interface
- the first GUI combines the plurality of menu items determined at block 202 and the status of the at least one setting (corresponding to each of the plurality of determined menu items) determined at block 204 .
- the system provides the first graphic user interface generated at block 206 for display to the user.
- Each of the plurality of determined menu items displayed in the first graphic user interface is selectable by a user.
- the first GUI that is displayed at block 208 may be displayed in response to the user clicking on, or otherwise engaging, a single UI element.
- the single UI element may be, for example, an icon representing the system tray for the computer operating system.
- the system tray icon may display certain information regarding the status of the computer system.
- Information that is displayed on the system tray icon may include, for example, battery level, network status, or a thumbnail image representing the user who is currently signed in to the computer system. Regardless of the information displayed on the system tray icon, clicking on or otherwise engaging anywhere on the system tray icon causes the system to display the first GUI discussed above.
- the first GUI generated at block 206 and displayed at block 208 combines the menu items and the statuses of settings such that the menu items may show the statuses of the settings corresponding to the menu items.
- the first GUI may display menu items for user account settings, network settings, and Bluetooth settings.
- the first GUI may also display the user name of the current user account, Wi-Fi signal strength, and the name of Bluetooth devices that are connected to the computer system, next to the corresponding menu items. Therefore, the user may quickly view the statuses associated with each of the menu items that are displayed on the first GUI.
- the first GUI may display the statuses associated with all menu items, some of the menu items, or no menu items.
- the first GUI may also display messages associated with the menu items that are displayed in the first GUI.
- the messages may be in-line notifications that concern the status of at least one setting for the menu items.
- the network settings menu item may be replaced with a notification that reads “You have run out of your data allowance.” Clicking on the notification may bring up a view for connecting to a Wi-Fi network instead of the 3G or 4G network.
- the network settings menu item may be replaced with a notification which reads “A free Wi-Fi network is available.
- the first GUI may further include menu items for directly adjusting system or application settings.
- the first GUI may include a menu item for adjusting the system volume or adjusting the screen brightness.
- the system determines whether a user selection from among the plurality of determined menu items of the first GUI displayed at block 208 , is received. For example, the system determines whether a user selection is received on any one of the menu items for user account settings, network settings, or Bluetooth settings that are displayed on the first GUI. If, at block 210 , determination is made that no user selection is received, process 200 ends. If, at block 210 , determination is made that a user selection is received on a menu item, at block 212 , the system determines a sub-menu for displaying to the user. The sub-menu is determined based on selected menu item. The system also generates, at block 214 , a second GUI for displaying the sub-menu determined at block 212 , and at block 216 , provides the second GUI for display to the user.
- the second GUI generated at block 214 and displayed at block 216 displays one or more selectable options associated with the user-selected menu item selected from the first GUI.
- the system determines a sub-menu for the network settings, and generates a second GUI for displaying selectable options adjusting various network-related settings.
- the selectable options may include for example, options for turning Wi-Fi on/off, selecting a Wi-Fi network to which to connect, or turning airplane mode on/off.
- the system may display the generated second GUI to the user such that the second GUI replaces the first GUI that was displayed to the user.
- the system may also display the generated GUI next two the first GUI such that both the first GUI and the second GUI are visible to the user.

FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of an example process for providing a consolidated system tray for a computer operating system. -
FIG. 3 conceptually illustrates diagrams showing example graphic user interfaces for providing a consolidated system tray for a computer operating system. -
FIG. 4 conceptually illustrates an example of a system for providing a consolidated system tray for a computer operating system. -
FIG. 5 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some aspects of the subject technology are implemented. - In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a full understanding of the present disclosure. It will be apparent, however, that the implementations of the present disclosure may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the disclosure.
- Operating systems of computer systems typically have on their main user interface (UI) screen (e.g., a desktop screen) a system tray that includes icons representing various system or application settings for using the computer systems. For example, the system tray of the UI screen may include an icon showing Wi-Fi signal strength, an icon showing battery level, an icon showing indexing status of a system's search feature, or an icon for accessing a settings menu for an application. These icons are arranged randomly and each icon has its own menu and function. Therefore, the system tray quickly becomes very cluttered with icons and inefficient for accessing the functionalities provided by the icons.
- Methods and systems for providing a consolidated system tray are provided herein. A UI element is provided on the UI-end of an operating system, which the user may select by, for example, clicking, to access a consolidated system tray. The operating system may be installed on a computer system (e.g., laptop computer, smart phone, desktop computer, or tablet computer). The UI element for accessing the consolidated system tray may be an icon showing a select number of types of information regarding the status of a computer system. For example, the UI element may be an icon collectively displaying the battery level, network status and a thumbnail image representing the user who is currently signed in on the computer system. Regardless of the type of information displayed by the icon, selecting the icon by clicking or otherwise engaging the icon brings up another single UI element showing a more detailed view of the consolidated system tray.
- The initial view of the detailed consolidated system tray may include several menu items corresponding to different system or application settings. Selecting a menu item may provide in-line access to sub-menus for the selected menu item. The sub-menus for the selected menu item may include one or more selectable options for adjusting the system or application settings associated with the selected menu item. The initial view of the consolidated system may also include menu items for directly adjusting system or application settings.
- The menu items on the initial view and on other different views of the consolidated system tray may be determined based on various factors such as, for example, default settings, system configuration, or user actions. In addition, the menu items for the various settings may also show notifications that are associated with the menu items to the user as in-line notifications.
-
FIG. 1 illustrates an example client-server network that provides for a consolidated system tray. Anetwork display 100 includes a number ofelectronic devices server 110 by anetwork 108.Server 110 includes aprocessing device 112 and adata store 114.Processing device 112 executes computer instructions stored indata store 114, for example, instructions to determine a plurality of menu items for displaying in a system tray of a computer operating system, where the plurality of menu items correspond to settings for using the computer operating system, and determining a status of at least one setting corresponding to each of the plurality of determined menu items. The computer instructions may also include instructions for generating a first graphic user interface that combines the determined plurality of menu items and the determined status of the at least one setting corresponding to each of the plurality of determined menu items, and providing the generated first graphic user interface for display to the user, wherein each of the plurality of determined menu items displayed in the first graphic user interface is selectable by a user. -
Data store 114 may store information pertaining to, for example, the determined plurality of menu items or the status of at least one setting that correspond to each of the plurality of determined menu items.Server 110 may host an application within which some of the processes discussed herein are implemented. In some example aspects, electronic devices or client devices, as used interchangeably herein, 102, 104 and 106 can be computing devices such as smartphones, PDAs, portable media players, tablet computers, televisions or other displays with one or more processors coupled thereto or embedded therein, or other appropriate computing devices that can be used for running a mobile application. -
Electronic devices server 110. In the example ofFIG. 1 ,electronic device 102 is depicted as a smartphone,electronic device 104 is depicted as a television, andelectronic device 106 is depicted as a tablet computer. A client is an application or a system that accesses a service made available by a server which is often (but not always) located on another computer system accessible by a network. Some client applications may be hosted on a website, whereby a browser is a client. Such implementations are within the scope of the subject disclosure, and any reference to client may incorporate a browser and reference to server may incorporate a website. - The system (e.g., hosted at any of
electronic devices - The system may also receive a user selection from among the plurality of determined menu items of the displayed first graphic user interface, and determine a sub-menu for displaying to the user based on the selected menu item. The sub-menu comprises one or more selectable options associated with the selected menu item. The system may further generate a second user interface for displaying the determined sub-menu, and provide the generated second user interface for display to the user. The users may interact with the system with any of the
electronic devices data store 114. - Each
electronic device server 110 can be a single computing device such as a computer server. In other implementations,server 110 can represent more than one computing device working together to perform the actions of a server computer (e.g., cloud computing). Theserver 110 may host the web server communicationally coupled to the browser at the client device (e.g.,electronic devices network 108. - The
network 108 can include, for example, any one or more of a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a campus area network (CAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a broadband network (BBN), the Internet, and the like. Further, thenetwork 108 can include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like. -
FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of anexample process 200 for providing a consolidated system tray.Process 200 begins and atblock 202, the system determines a plurality of menu items for displaying in a consolidated system tray of a computer operating system. The plurality of menu items correspond to settings for using the computer operating system. The settings for using the computer operating system may include, for example, user account settings, network settings, Bluetooth settings, and other general settings (e.g., settings for adjusting wall paper, language settings, keyboard settings, or sound settings) for using the operating system. - The menu items determined at
block 202 may be determined based on various factors such as, for example, default settings, system configuration, or user actions. For example, a set of menu items may be predetermined for displaying in an initial view of the consolidated system tray by default. Specifically, network settings and user account settings may be predetermined to be displayed by default in the initial view of the consolidated system tray. - As another example, system configuration may be taken into account when determining the menu items to display in the initial view of the consolidated system tray. Specifically, if the computer system is equipped with a Bluetooth antenna, the presence of the Bluetooth antenna may be detected and a menu item for Bluetooth settings may also be determined to be displayed in the initial view. If the user has two keyboard layouts enabled in the operating system (e.g., a US keyboard and a Japanese keyboard layout), a menu item for showing the current keyboard layout and switching between different keyboard layouts may also be determined for display.
- As yet another example, the menu items determined for display in the initial view of the consolidated system tray may also be determined based on user activity. Specifically, if the user has switched between different keyboard layouts five times within a predetermined amount of time, a menu item for changing the keyboard layout may be determined for display in the initial view, because it is likely the user will switch keyboard layout again soon. On the other hand, if the user has not switched keyboard layout for the past two days, the menu item for switching keyboard layout may no longer be determined for display in the initial view. When such menu item is not determined for display in the initial view, however, its functionality may be accessible in the sub-menus of other menu items shown in the initial view (e.g., a sub-menu of the general system settings menu item). The sub-menus of the various menu items will be discussed in more detail below.
- At
block 204, the system determines a status of at least one setting corresponding to each of the plurality of menu items that are determined atblock 202. The determined status may indicate, for example, signal strength of a Wi-Fi network to which the computer system is connected, names of Bluetooth devices that are paired and/or connected to the computer system, the name of an account that the user has logged into, or system volume. - At
block 206, the system generates a first graphic user interface (“GUI”) for displaying an initial view of the consolidated system tray. The first GUI combines the plurality of menu items determined atblock 202 and the status of the at least one setting (corresponding to each of the plurality of determined menu items) determined atblock 204. Atblock 208, the system provides the first graphic user interface generated atblock 206 for display to the user. Each of the plurality of determined menu items displayed in the first graphic user interface is selectable by a user. - In an aspect of the subject technology, the first GUI that is displayed at
block 208 may be displayed in response to the user clicking on, or otherwise engaging, a single UI element. The single UI element may be, for example, an icon representing the system tray for the computer operating system. The system tray icon may display certain information regarding the status of the computer system. Information that is displayed on the system tray icon may include, for example, battery level, network status, or a thumbnail image representing the user who is currently signed in to the computer system. Regardless of the information displayed on the system tray icon, clicking on or otherwise engaging anywhere on the system tray icon causes the system to display the first GUI discussed above. - The first GUI generated at
block 206 and displayed atblock 208 combines the menu items and the statuses of settings such that the menu items may show the statuses of the settings corresponding to the menu items. For example, the first GUI may display menu items for user account settings, network settings, and Bluetooth settings. The first GUI may also display the user name of the current user account, Wi-Fi signal strength, and the name of Bluetooth devices that are connected to the computer system, next to the corresponding menu items. Therefore, the user may quickly view the statuses associated with each of the menu items that are displayed on the first GUI. The first GUI may display the statuses associated with all menu items, some of the menu items, or no menu items. - The first GUI may also display messages associated with the menu items that are displayed in the first GUI. The messages may be in-line notifications that concern the status of at least one setting for the menu items. In the example above, when the computer system is connected to the Internet using a 3G or 4G network, and the user's data allowance has run out, the network settings menu item may be replaced with a notification that reads “You have run out of your data allowance.” Clicking on the notification may bring up a view for connecting to a Wi-Fi network instead of the 3G or 4G network. As another example, when the computer system is in a public area and a free Wi-Fi network is available, the network settings menu item may be replaced with a notification which reads “A free Wi-Fi network is available. Would you like to connect?” Clicking on the notification may bring up a view for connecting to the free Wi-Fi network. Additionally, the first GUI may further include menu items for directly adjusting system or application settings. For example, the first GUI may include a menu item for adjusting the system volume or adjusting the screen brightness.
- At
block 210, the system determines whether a user selection from among the plurality of determined menu items of the first GUI displayed atblock 208, is received. For example, the system determines whether a user selection is received on any one of the menu items for user account settings, network settings, or Bluetooth settings that are displayed on the first GUI. If, atblock 210, determination is made that no user selection is received,process 200 ends. If, atblock 210, determination is made that a user selection is received on a menu item, atblock 212, the system determines a sub-menu for displaying to the user. The sub-menu is determined based on selected menu item. The system also generates, atblock 214, a second GUI for displaying the sub-menu determined atblock 212, and atblock 216, provides the second GUI for display to the user. - The second GUI generated at
block 214 and displayed atblock 216 displays one or more selectable options associated with the user-selected menu item selected from the first GUI. In the example above, if a user selection is received on the menu item for network settings, the system determines a sub-menu for the network settings, and generates a second GUI for displaying selectable options adjusting various network-related settings. The selectable options may include for example, options for turning Wi-Fi on/off, selecting a Wi-Fi network to which to connect, or turning airplane mode on/off. The system may display the generated second GUI to the user such that the second GUI replaces the first GUI that was displayed to the user. Alternatively, the system may also display the generated GUI next two the first GUI such that both the first GUI and the second GUI are visible to the user. -
FIG. 3 conceptually illustrates diagrams 300, 330 and 350 showing example graphic user interfaces (“GUI's”) for providing a consolidated system tray according to an aspect of the subject technology. - Diagram 300 shows a GUI for a computer operating system which displays a
system tray icon 302. While not shown, thesystem tray icon 302 may display certain information such as, for example, battery level, network status, or a thumbnail image representing the user who is currently signed in to the computer system. Diagram 300 shows that thesystem tray icon 302 is displayed on the lower right corner of the GUI for the computer operating system. However, thesystem tray icon 302 may be displayed anywhere on the GUI for the computer operating system. - If the user engages the
system tray icon 302 anywhere on the system tray icon 302 (e.g., clicks on or touches the system tray icon), the system displays thefirst GUI 332, as shown in diagram 330. Thefirst GUI 332displays menu items settings menu item 334 displays adescription 334 a which describes that themenu item 334 is for “Network Settings” and astatus 334 b which shows that the Wi-Fi signal is currently “strong.” - If the user selects a menu item from the
first GUI 332, the system displays a second GUI showing sub-menus for the selected menu item. Diagram 350 shows that the user has selected themenu item 334 for network settings. In diagram 350, thefirst GUI 332 is replaced with asecond GUI 352, which displays sub-menus for adjusting various settings related to network settings. Specifically, thesecond GUI 352 displays sub-menus 354 for turning Wi-Fi on/off, 356 for connecting to a different network, and 358 for turning airplane mode on/off. - Many of the above-described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable storage medium (also referred to as computer readable medium). When these instructions are executed by one or more processing unit(s) (e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units), they cause the processing unit(s) to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of computer readable media include, but are not limited to, CD-ROMs, flash drives, RAM chips, hard drives, EPROMs, etc. The computer readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.
- In this specification, the term “software” is meant to include firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage, which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also, in some implementations, multiple software aspects of the subject disclosure can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software aspects of the subject disclosure. In some implementations, multiple software aspects can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally, any combination of separate programs that together implement a software aspect described here is within the scope of the subject disclosure. In some implementations, the software programs, when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.
- A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing display. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

-
FIG. 5 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some aspects of the subject technology are implemented.Electronic system 500 can be a server, computer, phone, PDA, laptop, tablet computer, television with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, or any other sort of electronic device. Such an electronic system includes various types of computer readable media and interfaces for various other types of computer readable media.Electronic system 500 includes abus 508, processing unit(s) 512, asystem memory 504, a read-only memory (ROM) 510, apermanent storage device 502, aninput device interface 514, anoutput device interface 506, and anetwork interface 516. -
Bus 508 collectively represents all system, peripheral, and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices ofelectronic system 500. For instance,bus 508 communicatively connects processing unit(s) 512 withROM 510,system memory 504, andpermanent storage device 502. - From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 512 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the subject disclosure. The processing unit(s) can be a single processor or a multi-core processor in different implementations.
-
ROM 510 stores static data and instructions that are needed by processing unit(s) 512 and other modules of the electronic system.Permanent storage device 502, on the other hand, is a read-and-write memory device. This device is a non-volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even whenelectronic system 500 is off. Some implementations of the subject disclosure use a mass-storage device (such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive) aspermanent storage device 502. - Other implementations use a removable storage device (such as a floppy disk, flash drive, and its corresponding disk drive) as
permanent storage device 502. Likepermanent storage device 502,system memory 504 is a read-and-write memory device. However, unlikestorage device 502,system memory 504 is a volatile read-and-write memory, such a random access memory.System memory 504 stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some implementations, the processes of the subject disclosure are stored insystem memory 504,permanent storage device 502, and/orROM 510. From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 512 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some implementations. -
Bus 508 also connects to input and output device interfaces 514 and 506.Input device interface 514 enables the user to communicate information and select commands to the electronic system. Input devices used withinput device interface 514 include, for example, alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices (also called “cursor control devices”). Output device interfaces 506 enables, for example, the display of images generated by theelectronic system 500. Output devices used withoutput device interface 506 include, for example, printers and display devices, such as televisions or other displays with one or more processors coupled thereto or embedded therein, or other appropriate computing devices that can be used for running an application. Some implementations include devices such as a touch screen that functions as both input and output devices. - Finally, as shown in
FIG. 5 ,bus 508 also coupleselectronic system 500 to a network (not shown) through anetwork interface 516. In this manner, the computer can be a part of a network of computers (such as a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), or an Intranet, or a network of networks, such as the Internet. Any or all components ofelectronic system 500 can be used in conjunction with the subject disclosure. - These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in computer software, firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be included in or packaged as mobile devices. The processes and logic flows can be performed by one or more programmable processors and by one or more programmable logic circuitry. General and special purpose computing devices and storage devices can be interconnected through communication networks.
- Some implementations include electronic components, such as microprocessors, storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium (alternatively referred to as computer-readable storage media, machine-readable media, or machine-readable storage media). Some examples of such computer-readable media include RAM, ROM, read-only compact discs (CD-ROM), recordable compact discs (CD-R), rewritable compact discs (CD-RW), read-only digital versatile discs (e.g., DVD-ROM, dual-layer DVD-ROM), a variety of recordable/rewritable DVDs (e.g., DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.), flash memory (e.g., SD cards, mini-SD cards, micro-SD cards, etc.), magnetic and/or solid state hard drives, read-only and recordable Blu-Ray® discs, ultra density optical discs, any other optical or magnetic media, and floppy disks. The computer-readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code, such as is produced by a compiler, and files including higher-level code that are executed by a computer, an electronic component, or a microprocessor using an interpreter.
- While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessor or multi-core processors that execute software, some implementations are performed by one or more integrated circuits, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In some implementations, such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.
- As used in this specification and any claims of this application, the terms “computer”, “server”, “processor”, and “memory” all refer to electronic or other technological devices. These terms exclude people or groups of people. For the purposes of the specification, the terms display or displaying means displaying on an electronic device.
