High density, the map datum of higher level of zoom can be used for rendering the depth band 614 as prospect, wherein low data are close
Degree, level of zoom map datum are used for rendering the depth band 618 as background.Middle depth band 616 can have
Map datum contracting between the depth band 614 of top and the map datum level of zoom and density of the depth band 618 of lower section
Put rank and density.It should be noted that although Fig. 6 A and 6B respectively only illustrate two and three bands, but with it is described herein
The consistent other views of method and system can be related to more than three band.
Some mappings application can typically be directed to whole view (prospect and background) and take the constant map datum of reading
Rank (such as contour level of zoom map datum tile), regardless of whether the amount for the characteristic details that map datum rank is provided is
No is visually satisfactory and required for graphical user in all display depths for map details to be rendered into.No
These mapping applications are same as, procedure described above is looked into the multiple zoom levels data render comprising different pieces of information density
See window.This with using single (generally height) map density data come render entirely can show map surface region system
Bandwidth and the cost savings in terms of processing time are can be provided in when comparing.
Fig. 7 diagrams can be used for rendering map surface, than the method on map surface, routine or mistake as shown in figures 6 a-6b
The process flow diagram flow chart or flow chart of journey 700.In general, routine or process 700 may be implemented as including in the following example
One or more software routines of journey or application, these routines are the parts of map application 48.These routines, which can be used, appoints
Language needed for what, such as Javascript, C code etc. implement or write and can be in Fig. 2 processor 30a and 30b
In one or more processor on be performed.In addition, these routines can be using rasterizer 36 with display device 34
On render image.
Under any circumstance, block 702 can be determined on the map surface of display is checked into Window state.This is checked
Window state can include checking window size, check window positioning, check window direction and the view for map surface
Magnification level.This determination can be by receiving input to make from the user of computer equipment.For example, user can input spy
Determine longitude, latitude and height above sea level and with magnification level and checking the corresponding level of zoom of angle (checking direction).In some realities
Apply in example, the determination can be based on initial render (such as city terrestrial reference or the welcome urban characteristic for map location
Initial views) pre-stored values or can be made based on the prestoring setting based on user preference.
Block 704 then can determine it is determined that check displayable map surface on window check border and corresponding
Check the set of band.Border can be indicated as being the depth for the positioning for checking window.Border can be based on deep
Map surface is divided into and multiple checks band (region or volume) by degree dimensional extent.Near Range band can represent display
Map surface prospect, and Far Range band can represent the background of the map of display.
Then block 706 can determine and/or obtain each use for checking band checked in band for multiple determinations
In rendering each level of zoom data for checking band.Vector data and the ground of map datum tile are used on described above
Figure drawing system, block 706 can determine the level of zoom set of the map datum tile of the band for each determining.As more than
As discussion, the tile set for a level of zoom with the map datum tile in per unit region by with as weighed
Some density.Therefore, block 706 can determine the map datum tile density for each band.Can be without using discretely
In the embodiment of diagram data tile, block 706 can determine the data density map for each band.Block 708 will can determine
The map surface rendering for checking window, draw or be shown as that (or map is close using the level of zoom data determined in addition
Degrees of data) render each band check band set.
As discussed above, the map datum of higher level of zoom generally provides the map number for comparing level of zoom
According to higher resolution ratio and more characteristics.Therefore, prospect has and than each subsequently checks the higher contracting of band wherein
In the embodiment for putting rank data, each subsequent stripes can have gradually few map details and/or resolution ratio.It should be noted that point
Resolution refers in this meaning for checking that the specific magnifying power of window provides map datum (or the map of map feature
Data tile) amount or data density map.
Block 704 can determine to check bar by considering include the Multiple factors of first mapping situation or condition
Band.For example, in a mapping situation, map surface can be initially rendered on window is checked at zero incident angle
Perspective from top to bottom.This map view can correspond to the familiar views of two-dimensional map.In this case, from single
The data of level of zoom can be used for rendering the whole surface of the map of display, because checking depth without variable.In other words,
In zero incident angle, map surface is with checking that window is parallel.When map application allows to check the follow-up inclination in window direction, ground
The view in chart face changes, and so as to which prospect is at a perceived depth scope, and background is at different perceived depth scopes.
In one embodiment, exposed when checking window incident angle increase (or window incident angle will be checked
Shown during increase) additional maps surface can be delimited as the second depth band, wherein the first depth band is included in inclination
The map surface region originally rendered before.In this way, additional level of zoom data can be used (generally compared with low-shrinkage
Put rank data or relatively low density map data) only render the second depth band.Therefore map datum, which can be reduced, takes reading
And processing, because at least a portion of view has been pre-rendered the extention use with cache and view compared with low-shrinkage
Rank data are put to be rendered.
Fig. 6 A and 6B diagram increase with incident angle, can no longer show the map previously rendered existing part and
It can determine, take reading and processing additional zooming level data to be used for display foreground or background band.It should be noted that even in ground
In the case where not rendering formerly or formerly the map subregion of cache being rendered, the process still can carry figure view
Ribbon supply is wide and processor saving, because still having can entirely show using single (generally high) map density data to render
Map surface region with diagram data to high-density only show can show map surface part and shown with low-density map datum
Show the data difference between other parts.
In certain embodiments, block 706 can determine that prospect band is assigned with than using compared with level of zoom data
The higher level of zoom data (high density or High Resolution Ground Map data) of each subsequent stripes (there is bigger depth bounds).
Last band or background band can use the lowest scale rank data among the band set of display.In variable symbol
In expression, for each set in continuous strip B1 to Bn, wherein B1 is the prospect band and Bn for having depth dimension D1
It is the background band with depth bounds Dn, each set in band B1 to Bn can use corresponding data zooming rank Z1 extremely
Zn is rendered, and wherein Z1 is the maximum data level of zoom for having maximum data density map, so as to which B1 has level of zoom Z1,
B2 has level of zoom Z2, by that analogy until band Bn has corresponding level of zoom Zn.Correspondingly, D1 has relative to checking
The nearest depth bounds (checking that window depth localization is generally depth zero) of window depth localization, and Dn is relative to checking window
The farthest depth bounds of mouth positioning.
In another embodiment, block 704 can determine one or more additional range set between main band
Band is checked in transition.For example, in Fig. 6 A and 6B diagram, it is attached that additional range band can be arranged at border 602,610 and 612
Closely or it is arranged at border 602,610 and 612.These bands can be used for rendering between more big band (such as in band
Between 604 and 606 or between band 614,616 and 618) smoother transition with reduce map feature density suddenly change
Become.Alternatively, block 704 can determine multiple bands, wherein determining that each band only goes to background band from prospect band
Increment density changes the unexpected visual change of the map rendered to reduce.It is determined that check band and determine to check band for each
Any level of zoom data will be used to be based on multiple parameters.Some embodiments can discretely determine to check band and scaling
Rank, and other embodiments can make determination check that band is based on level of zoom or opposite.
For determining to check band and/or for each checking band by using a parameter of what level of zoom data
Can be based on the typically acceptable depth bounds perceived for the mankind to characteristic.This scope can use multiple different thresholds
Value, such as Johnson criteria determine, criterion description is used for resolution ratio needed for the minimum that the mankind differentiate in each depth.For
It is determined that another parameter for checking band can be the resolution ratio limitation of the display screen for display device.Fetch or handle use
Bandwidth can be represented in the map feature for the depth bounds that can not be physically shown on the monitor of display screen and processing is held
The waste of amount.Additionally, it should each depth band in across the depth band set of depth band dimension for paying attention to determining may not
It is constant size.Some depth bands can according to parameter, such as inclination angle either magnifying power and it is narrower or bigger.
In certain embodiments, intermediate strap (not being prospect band, nor background band) can have formerly or
The higher level of zoom data of person's subsequent stripes.This can be the feature for the centre that will be highlighted on map surface wherein
Situation in situation.In this case, band determines that map feature collection can be based on.It is special that this determination can be based on map again
Feature precedence, type or the positioning of sign.
In certain embodiments, can be fetched for prospect band previously more available than from formerly rendering for the part of band
The higher additional zooming level data of level of zoom data.This can for example the incident angle view of direct projection wherein zero provide on
Occur in the situation of the little information of foreground features collection.In one embodiment, due to checking that angle is tilted slightly, before institute
First depth bounds of scape needs the more details of details than being provided in the level of zoom view formerly rendered.In this feelings
(such as from database) under condition, can be fetched for prospect and renders additional higher scaling number of levels evidence.In some cases,
As angle is further tilted, can abandon and with compared with level of zoom data replace prospect initial highest zoom-level
Not.When compared with prospect band, this situation can occur when there is the sparse features data for prospect band.
Furthermore it is possible to depth band is split based on the feature in prospect or the sight of map object.For example, building
Thing is positioned in prospect band and checks the close enough building of window so that the mass part in the visual field of view is by building
During blocking, the part in the sight for checking window can be only rendered.It is used for it is alternatively possible to only be fetched from data repository
Check the map datum for the map area that can be checked in the visual line of sight of window.
, can be for active view correspondingly percentage regulation band dimensional extent when checking that window is inclined by.It is such as right
Window size, positioning and magnifying power are checked in constant, and the viewable regions on map surface can be changed and more next with inclination angle
Extend more remotely.In one embodiment, prospect band can deeper grow as inclination angle increases, wherein correspondingly adjusting
Each subsequent stripes.In general, the size of band can be correspondingly adjusted as inclination angle is changed.Furthermore it is possible to such as
Must as increase or reduce band number to provide visually gratifying image.
Each block in Fig. 7 block 702-708 can with various ways and performed by multiple different entities and keep and this
In the technology that describes it is consistent.In one embodiment, when the database comprising map datum is comprised in the first computer,
Block 702-708 can be performed completely on the first computer equipment.
In other embodiments, procedure block can be distributed among two or more computer equipment.Fig. 8 was illustrated

Sections below describes striping technology described above and determines image-region in display plane or display with being used for
The details of the possibility combination of the method for projection on screen.It is determined that the method for projection can be used for adjusting checking band.
The top view on the map surface 1100 at zero inclination angle that Figure 11 diagrams can render on the display device.This view
It is equivalent to planar map.In general, display device can use the two dimension of the referred to as discrete picture element 1101 of pixel
Grid (such as checking plane) renders image (such as map surface image).Pixel 1101 can represent the minimum of display device
The address of addressable element, wherein pixel corresponds generally to its coordinate on the screen of a display device.As discussed, may be used
So that set of map data is woven into map datum tile, wherein each map datum tile corresponds to the region on map surface.Figure 11
Implementation is illustrated as follows, wherein can be each to render using four pixels for being arranged as 2x2 pixel squares of display device
Map datum tile 1110.It is different from the diameter of two pixels 1120 other it is of course possible to implement in other embodiments
Map datum tile size.Such as in certain embodiments, 256x256 pixel squares can be used for rendering map datum tile.
In general, the map datum tile for (scale) each level of zoom that can stretch, so as to they with they
Level of zoom corresponding to magnifying power when being rendered, they are by with same display screen pixel size and zone rendering.Therefore, exist
, can be in the magnifying power and the level of zoom of each map datum tile for checking window or display screen in Figure 11 embodiment
Map datum tile is rendered into 2x2 display screen pixels squares during corresponding or matching.For example, in the map of level of zoom 10
Data tile when being rendered on the display screen with 10 corresponding magnifying power of level of zoom, in map datum tile each
Diagram data tile can be 2x2 display screen pixels.The flexible map datum for going for level of zoom 9 of identical.Tool
For body, the map datum tile of level of zoom 9 is also respectively 2x2 when being rendered with 9 corresponding magnifying power of level of zoom
Display screen pixels.Then Figure 11 is shown in display screen or checks that the magnifying power of window corresponds to the map datum watt of display
The layout of the map datum tile of any level of zoom during the level of zoom of piece (for example as 2x2 display screen pixels square).
Thus, the number of shown map datum tile can mainly be limited (such as 640x480 display by the physics size of display screen
It is laterally up to 320 map datum tiles and a height of 240 map datum tiles that screen, which can only have) or only indicated
A part for whole display screen checks window limit.
In some cases, the first contracting can be rendered in the magnifying power different from the magnifying power corresponding to the first level of zoom
Put the map datum tile of rank.In this case, can be with differently existing in the magnifying power corresponding to the first level of zoom
The display size (size for being used for rendering the display screen pixels of map datum tile) of setting map data tile in size.
Figure 12 illustrates the view of the map datum tile of the different zoom rank shown in same time according to one embodiment.In list
Individual magnifying power renders Figure 12 map datum tile, therefore the map of not all other different zoom rank on the display screen
Data tile can be formed objects in terms of display screen pixels.
For illustrative purposes, Figure 12 can be shown in the map surface 1208 that the magnifying power of level of zoom 10 renders, and
The map datum tile 1201 of first area 1210 is the map datum tile of level of zoom 10.Use multiple display screen pixels
1200 render map surface 1208.The first area 1210 on map surface is 2x2 display screen pixels including respective size
Multiple map datum tiles 1201 of (there is diameter 1205).The map datum tile 1202 compared with level of zoom 9 can be used
To render the second area 1220 on map surface 1208.Be consistent with present exemplary, if with 9 corresponding magnifying power of level of zoom
Render the map datum tile of level of zoom 9, then will render they in size be similar to region 1210 map datum tile,
Wherein each map datum tile will be 2x2 pixel squares.But Figure 13 view is rendered in the magnifying power of level of zoom 10.
Therefore, the map datum tile of level of zoom 9 can be rendered to the level of zoom 10 that must be more than in the magnifying power of level of zoom 10
Map datum tile.In this embodiment, each follow-up level of zoom corresponds to the 2X magnifying powers of previous level of zoom.Cause
This, putting in level of zoom 10 is rendered into by the map datum tile of the level of zoom 9 rendered in the magnifying power of level of zoom 10
4x4 square pixel of big rate.The map datum tile compared with level of zoom 8 can be used to render the of map surface 1208
Three regions 1230.Due to the 2X magnifying powers between level of zoom, on the ground for the level of zoom 8 that the magnifying power of level of zoom 10 renders
Diagram data tile 1203 is twice of (size of the 8x8 square pixel either size of the map datum tile of level of zoom 9
4 times).In general, relatively low magnifying power map datum tile can correspond to the higher scaling level map number on map surface
According to the bigger region of tile.Thus, it is possible to need the greater number of map datum tile of higher level of zoom with represent with compared with
The map datum tile identical of level of zoom practically figure surface region.It should be noted that while in fig. 12 by different zoom
The map datum of rank is disposed adjacent to each other, but is stretched and caused the distance along the plane on map surface even in different contractings
Remained in that when putting intersection between level map data tile identical.For example, pass through two different zooms even in map feature
During rank data tiling area (such as 1210 and 1220), keep proportional along the depth on map surface.
Figure 13 is shown in the map surface of Figure 11 at non-zero angle of incidence degree.In fig. 13, all map datum tiles are
Single level of zoom and it is rendered in magnifying power corresponding with level of zoom.For illustrative purposes, Figure 11 and 13 can be represented
The display of level of zoom 10.The directionally depth dimension (d) of the addition in chart face due to inclination angle.Rendering this depth dimension is
Map surface to by check window (or display screen) represent plane on two-dimensional projection.Figure 14 can preferably be illustrated and looked into
That sees window checks plane 1425 in the plane 1427 angled 1420 with representing map plane.Check that window can be to look at putting down
The part in face 1425.Angle 1420 can be proportional to incident angle.It it was zero (corresponding to zero incident angle) in angle 1420
And during two planar alignments, check plane 1425 check window then map plane can be rendered into it is similar to Figure 11
View.When angle 1420 is non-zero, that checks plane 1425 checks that window can provide the view similar to Figure 13.
, can be to checking in plane 1425 projectively when checking that plane 1425 and map plane 1427 are at an angle of (inclination)
The region 1428 of the formed objects of plan is different size of region.In general, to checking that (plane is checked in representative to window
A part) on projected map surface can to render map surface with checking that plane 1425 (or checks one of plane
Point) positioning closer to region be more than map surface away from the farther region of positioning for checking plane 1425.Specifically, Figure 13
Illustrate and check the neighbouring pixel 1321 of the positioning of plane by with than with showing from the positioning distal side (distal) for checking plane
Show that the bigger display screen height 1322 of the pixel 1324 of screen height 1325 is projected to checking in plane.
Figure 15 A-D are illustrated for different angle, but in Figure 14 two planes for rendering of magnifying power of level of zoom 10
1425th, 1427 part 1423.In contrast, the pixel of map plane is alternately coloured.Figure 15 A diagram two of which is put down
The situation at face 1425 and 1427 parallel and each comfortable zero inclination angles.In this case, that checks plane 1425 checks planar pixel
1541 match with the size of the map plane pixel 1542 of map plane 1427.Check planar pixel 1541 and map plane pixel
1542 are respectively provided with same depth 1543.Figure 15 B-15D pictorial images 15A same section but it is different cumulative between plane
Angle 1420.1420 different angle can be with checking that difference of the plane 1425 for the normal of map plane 1427 is inclined
Angle is proportional.Figure 15 B are shown in 15 degree of inclination angles (incident angle) from normal, and map plane picture is projected in plane 1425 to checking
The depth 1543 of element 1542 be less than the height 1544 for checking planar pixel 1541, wherein map plane pixel 1542 check it is flat
Face is in zero inclination interval scale and checks the region (as shown in figure 15 a) of the formed objects of planar pixel 1541.Figure 15 C are shown in
From 40 degree of tilting positions of normal, the depth 1543 of map plane pixel 1542 is projected as even less than Figure 15 B depth.Figure
15D is shown in 70 degree of tilting position, depth of the depth 1543 still less than Figure 15 C of map plane pixel 1542.Initially will
What the map plane pixel 1542 of map plane 1427 was rendered into the formed objects for checking plane 1425 checks planar pixel 1541
When (Figure 15 A), up to three map plane pixels 1542 can coordinate in more high inclination-angle checks that the single of plane check plane
In pixel 1541 (Figure 15 D).Importantly, map plane pixel relative to check window positioning outwards it is more remote, it check it is flat
Projection in the part in face is with regard to smaller.For example, the Projection Depth 1546 of distal side map plane pixel is less than neighbour's map plane
The Projection Depth 1547 of pixel.
It is zero and will be to check plane when the magnifying power of view corresponds to level of zoom 10 that Figure 15 A, which are shown in incident angle,
The height of 2 pixels on 1425 renders the ground of the level of zoom 10 of the length with 2 pixels on map plane 1427
Diagram data tile.(two pixels are the length of the map datum tile of level of zoom 10 that renders of magnifying power in level of zoom 10
Degree.) with checking window or checking that the incident angle of plane is increased, the vertical length of identical 2 pixels (is referred to as in non-zero
Inclined " depth ") projection become less than the height for being less than two pixels checked in plane.Figure 15 C and 15D are shown in certain
Individual inclination angle scope, two pixel depths of the map datum tile of map plane can be to look at only about picture in plane
Element.
The example of the map datum tile 1550 for the level of zoom 9 that the magnifying power that Figure 15 E are shown in level of zoom 10 renders
View, wherein to check on planar pixel 1541 project map datum tile a part.As discussed above, scaling
The size of the map datum tile 1550 for the level of zoom 9 that the magnifying power of rank 10 renders can be more than putting in level of zoom 10
The map datum tile for the level of zoom 10 that big rate renders.Figure 12 can be used for illustrating the pixel relationship between level of zoom.Such as
As discussion, 2x2 is rendered as in the map datum tile 1201 of magnifying power Figure 12 of level of zoom 10 level of zoom 10
Individual display screen pixels, and the map datum tile 1202 of level of zoom 9 is 4x4 display of the magnifying power of level of zoom 10
Screen pixels.The size contact of the screen pixels of magnifying power from different zoom rank is produced into ratio, wherein level of zoom 9
Magnifying power 1 display screen pixels contain (subsume) the magnifying power of level of zoom 10 2x2 screen pixels.Cause
This, the map datum tile of level of zoom 9 can be the 2x2 display screen pixels in the magnifying power of level of zoom 9 but
Contain four 2x2 display screen pixels when the magnifying power of level of zoom 10 is rendered.
Look back Figure 15 E, it is illustrated that the map datum tile 1550 of level of zoom 9 (is contracting for the pixel of four level of zoom 9
Put the pixel of the magnifying power of rank 9) 1552, wherein the pixel 1552 of each level of zoom 9 is the magnifying power in level of zoom 10
2x2 pixel 1553.Figure 15 E, which are shown in, checks that the angle of inclination of plane is sufficiently large and/or the depth of map datum tile is determined
When position is away from checking that plane is remote enough, can projecting the map plane pixel 1552 of magnifying power compared with level of zoom, (representative is compared
The bigger map plane region of the pixel of the magnifying power of high level of zoom) to be similar to check planar pixel 1541.
Generally, it is to check plane (also referred to as display screen) that can project along the depth increments (d) of map plane
The height gain (y) checked on window.In general, depth increments (d) away from check window positioning leave more remote, standoff height
(y) it is just smaller on window is checked.In addition, inclination angle is bigger, it is just smaller for the height projection (y) of same depth increment (d).It is deep
Degree increment can be the magnifying power of the area unit corresponding with the map datum of level of zoom in the level of zoom on map surface
Depth.Map surface region unit can be indicated as being to being tilted, in its corresponding level of zoom zero for map datum tile
The region that the display screen pixels that magnifying power renders represent.Plane no matter may be checked from inclination or changes level of zoom and produces
How is raw distortion, can fix the region that the pixel of map datum tile represents.Such as in fig. 12, on map surface
Whatsoever inclination angle and what level of zoom magnifying power all keep constant to the map area unit that pixel 1200 represents.If increase
Magnifying power (higher level of zoom), then pixel can be extended but still represent figure surface region in the same manner.Figure 12 also shows
Go out compared with level of zoom map datum tile 1202 be included in map area when the magnifying power compared with level of zoom is rendered with
Four map area units corresponding to four display screen pixels.Four map area units can be expanded, because they are put
The big current higher level of zoom to display.In embodiment explained below, it can be calculated to determine in map number
According to the magnifying power of magnification level render map datum when map area unit corresponding with the pixel of map datum projection.Ground
Graph region unit is properly termed as map the surface either pixel of map plane or map plane pixel.
In one embodiment, it can determine that first at the first depth bounds checks bar by depth approximately as described below
Band is put down with the second transition checked between band at the second depth bounds or border, the map from a level of zoom
Face pixel is projected in the threshold level relative to display screen pixels the depth.Start on this border and edge lands
