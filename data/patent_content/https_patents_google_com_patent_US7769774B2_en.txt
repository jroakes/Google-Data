Definitions
- the present invention is generally directed to an improved data processing system. More specifically, the present invention is directed to an improved data processing system and method for routing content to dynamically determined groups of reviewers. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a system and method for matching and subsequent routing of content and/or electronic forms requiring review and approval to dynamically formed groups of people with a set of attributes (skills, location, organization affiliation, expertise) that relates to the content/electronic forms.
- attributes kills, location, organization affiliation, expertise
- Review teams are currently formed around physical and/or organizational constructs, such as a research laboratory and/or line of business, e.g., software, services, etc. These same constructs come into play when a new invention disclosure is routed for evaluation. That is, invention disclosures are often routed to review teams based on physical and/or organizational constructs rather than the expertise of the particular review team.
- Routing approaches that rely on physical location or organizational affiliations have drawbacks. Many inventors develop ideas that can come from any technological and business area that are not necessarily aligned to the mission of the inventor's organization. For example, an International Business Machines (IBM) Global Services employee may submit a disclosure related to an advance in microchip technology. If the routing is performed based on organizational constructs, that invention disclosure would end up in an IBM Global Services review team which may lack the necessary expertise for a thorough evaluation.
- IBM International Business Machines
- Expertise mismatches may result in the positive evaluation of an invalid invention disclosure due to lack of knowledge about the state of the art and/or the invention's true business value, the negative evaluation of a valid disclosure due to lack of understanding and/or appreciation of the novelty, or the missed opportunity of further exploitation of an invention (beyond a patent application filing) due to its lack of visibility.
- the present invention provides a system and method for routing content, e.g., invention disclosures, to dynamically identified reviewers/review teams based on an expertise matching mechanism that favors reviewers/review teams that are experienced in the general knowledge area, e.g., technology or business knowledge area, covered by the content, e.g., invention disclosure.
- the preferred embodiments of the present invention are directed to use of the present invention with the submission and review of invention disclosures, although the present invention is not limited to such content.
- an invention disclosure is categorized using an established categorization taxonomy when it is created.
- each review team and/or reviewer registers himself/herself with the system as having expertise in certain categories of technology/business from the categorization taxonomy.
- This expertise categorization of the review teams and/or reviewers may be updated as the review team or reviewers expertise changes over time.
- the categorization of the invention disclosure may be performed manually by the creator of the invention disclosure or may be performed using an autocategorizing mechanism.
- the autocategorizing mechanism may make use of, for example, keyword searches or other word and/or pattern matching mechanisms against existing invention disclosures.
- an automated categorization may be performed such that the current invention disclosure is categorized into similar technology/business areas as those existing invention disclosures it most closely matches.
- the categories identified through this automated categorization may be presented to the creator of the invention disclosure, or other user, such that they may choose the categories to be applied to the invention disclosure.
- these categories are used to identify reviewers/review teams that have the necessary knowledge to provide a fair and accurate evaluation of the invention disclosure.
- Reviewer profiles are retrieved that indicate the areas of expertise of the various reviewers. For example, similar categories to those used to categorize the invention disclosure may be used to indicate the technology/business areas of expertise of the reviewers. This similarity in categories makes it possible to match reviewers having the same categories of expertise with invention disclosures that are categorized into the categories of expertise of the reviewer. In this way, reviewers may be matched up with invention disclosures.
- the categories of an invention disclosure may be ranked according to the most relevant category and less relevant categories. In this way, a more accurate routing of the invention disclosure to a dynamically assembled review team having appropriate expertise may be obtained.
- the inventors' organization is provided with credit for submission of the invention disclosure and the reviewing team/reviewer is provided with credit for performing the evaluation of the invention disclosure with regard to internal company accounting and incentive programs.
- the present invention provides a method, system and computer program product for routing content, such as an electronic document, an invention disclosure, an electronic form, or the like, to a person, e.g., a reviewer, for review and evaluation of the content.
- This method, system and computer program product involves receiving the content and analyzing the content to generate identifiers of subject matter of the content.
- One or more subject matter categories are then determined to be associated with the content based on the analysis and generation of identifiers.
- the method, system and computer program product then retrieves profiles for one or more people that are authorized to review and evaluate content. These profiles include identifiers of categories of knowledge of the one or more people such that the categories of knowledge indicate areas of knowledge held by the associated person, e.g., areas of expertise of the individual person.
- the present invention selects a person, from the one or more people, to review and evaluate the content based on the one or more subject matter categories and categories of knowledge of the one or more people.
- the content may then be routed to a client computing device associated with the selected person, e.g., a notification may be sent with a link to the content.

- the invention disclosure submission and routing system of the exemplary embodiment includes an invention disclosure system 400 through which an inventor may submit an invention disclosure and have the invention disclosure categorized for routing to an appropriate reviewer, set of reviewers, or review team.
- the inventor interfaces with an invention disclosure authoring tool 430 which provides one or more graphical user interfaces through which the inventor may submit information about the inventor and the inventor's invention.
- the inventor information may include, for example, the inventor's name, organization, department, manager information, contact information, and the like. Such information may be gathered for each inventor on an invention disclosure.
- the invention information may include a conception date, workable date, description of the problem solved, description of the invention, information regarding publication or sale of the invention, information regarding joint ventures to develop the invention, information regarding any product in which the invention is a part, and the like.
- Invention disclosure authoring tools are generally known in the art. The result of such an invention disclosure authoring tool is an electronic document that represents the invention disclosure and contains the invention disclosure data necessary for evaluation of the invention for patenting purposes.
- the invention disclosure is received in the invention disclosure system 400 and is analyzed by the invention disclosure categorizer 420 .
- the invention disclosure categorizer 420 parses the invention disclosure and extracts metadata of the invention disclosure.
- This meta data is a simplified version of the invention disclosure in which elements of the invention disclosure that are pertinent to categorization are stored. That is, keywords from the invention description and/or problem description, titles, inventor organization parameter values, other parameter values, and the like, that may be used to determine appropriate categories for the invention disclosure, are extracted by the invention disclosure categorizer 420 and stored as part of a metadata file in the invention disclosure metadata database 410 .
- the categorization of the invention disclosure may be performed manually by the creator of the invention disclosure, e.g., the inventor, or may be performed using an autocategorizing mechanism.
- the inventor may be presented with the technology/business categories taxonomy 405 via the invention disclosure authoring tool 430 .
- the creator of the invention disclosure may then select from the taxonomy those categories of technology/business that most accurately reflect the technology/business areas covered by the invention disclosure. This information may then be stored as part of the invention disclosure metadata in the invention disclosure metadata database 410 for later use.
- the invention disclosure may be provided to the invention disclosure categorizer 420 for automated or semi-automated classification of the invention disclosure.
- the invention disclosure categorizer 420 obtains information from both the technology/business categories taxonomy database 405 and the existing invention disclosure database 415 to determine appropriate categories of technology/business in which to classify the invention disclosure.
- the invention disclosure metadata in the invention disclosure metadata database 410 is used to match the technology/business coverage of the invention disclosure against categories in the technology/business category taxonomy 405 .
- keywords or patterns of keywords extracted from the invention disclosure may be matched against keywords of categories in the technology/business categories taxonomy 405 .
- the result is a list of potential categories for the invention disclosure.
- This initial list of potential categories may be further refined using the information obtained from the existing invention disclosure database 415 .
- the information obtained from the existing invention disclosure database 415 may include the invention disclosure itself, the invention disclosure metadata, the categories associated with the existing invention disclosures, the reviewers/review teams to which the invention disclosure was routed, and the like.
- the autocategorizing mechanism of the invention disclosure categorizer 420 may make use of, for example, keyword searches or other word and/or pattern matching mechanisms using the invention disclosure metadata for the invention disclosure stored in the invention disclosure metadata database 410 and match the metadata with existing invention disclosure information obtained from existing invention disclosure database 415 .
- the initial list of categories may be searched to identify those categories in the initial list of categories that match categories in which existing invention disclosures that are most like the current invention disclosure are categorized. That is, the most relevant categories from the initial list of categories are identified by determining the most closely related existing invention disclosures, identifying the categories associated with these most closely related existing invention disclosures, and matching these categories to categories in the initial list of categories. The matching categories in the initial list of categories are then returned as the suggested categories for the invention disclosure.
- the categories of an invention disclosure may be ranked according to the most relevant category and less relevant categories. This ranking may be performed based on how many existing invention disclosures that most closely match the current invention disclosure are classified in the category, a degree to which the invention disclosure metadata of the current invention disclosure matches the category, and the like. Thus, a ranking of categories of technology/business from the technology/business category taxonomy 405 may be generated for the invention disclosure.
- These categories may then be associated with the invention disclosure or may be provided to the creator of the invention disclosure via the invention disclosure authoring tool 430 . If presented to the creator of the invention disclosure, the categories may be presented via a graphical user interface that permits the creator of the invention disclosure to select, from the ranked listing of most relevant categories, those categories that the creator wishes to classify the invention disclosure in. Thereafter, the selected categories may be associated with the invention disclosure and stored in the existing invention disclosure database 415 . The category information and other necessary information for identifying the invention disclosure may then be provided to the invention disclosure routing engine 435 .
- the methodology employed by the invention disclosure categorizer 420 in extracting information from the invention disclosure to generate invention disclosure metadata, selecting categories from the technology/business categories taxonomy 405 , and matching of the invention disclosure to existing invention disclosures, and ranking of the categories selected for an invention disclosure are all performed in accordance with the policies and rules stored in the categorization policies and rules database 425 .
- This database 425 stores the necessary rules and policies that govern the operation of the invention disclosure categorizer 420 and are consulted by the invention disclosure categorizer 420 when making decisions on how to process the data from the various sources 405 , 410 and 415 .
- the invention disclosure routing engine 435 receives invention disclosure information including the selected categories for the invention disclosure from the invention disclosure system 400 .
- the invention disclosure routing engine 435 uses the categorization of the invention disclosure to select a review team/reviewers that are to receive the invention disclosure.
- the selection of a review team/reviewers involves retrieving information about the review team/reviewers from a centralized reviewer database 450 .
- This reviewer database 450 may include information about review teams and/or individual reviewers for use in matching the review teams/reviewers with invention disclosures that have technology and business subject matter coverage that overlaps the review team/reviewers' areas of expertise.
- the reviewer database 450 stores information regarding the work experience, title, job role, physical location, organizational location, and the like, for each review team and/or reviewer. If the reviewer database 450 operates from a review team level, then the data stored for each review team may be an aggregate of information obtained about each individual reviewer associated with that review team.
- the reviewer database 450 may store expertise profiles 455 for each review team/reviewer. These expertise profiles 455 may identify the categories of technology/business that the reviewer is considered to have sufficient knowledge in so that the reviewer is eligible to review invention disclosures in these categories of technology/business. For example, the reviewer, a manager of the reviewer, or some other individual within the business organization may evaluate the reviewer and select categories from the technology/business category taxonomy 405 that the reviewer is believed to be knowledgeable in. This list of categories may be maintained in a profile data structure within the reviewer database 450 in association with the reviewer and/or a review team that the reviewer is a member of.
- the centralized reviewer database 450 may include a review and invention disclosure history database 460 that stores information regarding the invention disclosures reviewed by, or submitted by, a reviewer. For example, an identification of invention disclosures reviewed by and submitted by the reviewer, along with the technology/business categories associated with these invention disclosures, may be maintained for each reviewer/review team. These categories may then be used to augment the expertise profiles 455 by adding categories to the expertise profiles 455 when a sufficient number of invention disclosures are reviewed and/or submitted by the reviewer. In this way, the reviewer's expertise profile may be dynamically updated as the reviewer submits new invention disclosures or reviews invention disclosures in various technology/business categories.
- the expertise profiles 455 may store a level of expertise for each technology/business category associated with the reviewer. This level of expertise may further be updated dynamically as the reviewer submits invention disclosures and/or reviews invention disclosures in that particular category of technology/business. Thus, for example, if the reviewer submits 10 invention disclosures in a particular category of technology and reviews 20 invention disclosures in the same category of technology, the reviewer's expertise in that particular category of technology may be increased to a next level within the expertise profile for that reviewer.
- the reviewer database 450 is preferably updated based on employee information maintained in a candidate directory 485 . That is, reviewers are selected from the employee pool of the business organization when the employee achieves a position within the organization and a level of expertise in a particular technology/business area that makes it desirable to add that employee as a reviewer of invention disclosures.
- the requirements for selection of individuals from the candidate directory 485 for inclusion in the reviewer database 450 is implementation specific and is governed by the eligibility rules 490 established by the particular business organization.
- the eligibility determination engine 480 applies these eligibility rules to the entries in the candidate directory 485 periodically, or upon request, to select additional reviewers to be added to the reviewer database 450 .
- the entries in the candidate directory 485 include similar information as that described for the reviewer database 450 with the reviewer database 450 being a specialized set of entries from the candidate directory 485 , i.e. those entries in the candidate directory 485 that have been selected to be reviewers of invention disclosures.
- the categories selected to be associated with the invention disclosure using the invention disclosure system 400 are used by the invention disclosure routing engine 435 , under application of the policies and rules 440 , to select a review team or predetermined number of reviewers from the centralized reviewer database 450 to review the invention disclosure to make decisions as to whether the invention described in the invention disclosure is of patentable significance and/or meets a business goal of the business organization.
- the invention disclosure routing engine 435 uses the categories and their rankings to select reviewers from the reviewer database 450 whose expertise profiles 455 indicate that they have expertise in the particular categories associated with the invention disclosure. The resulting list of reviewers may then be ranked based on their relative level of expertise and the ranking of the categories associated with the invention disclosure.
- reviewers that have expertise in the highest ranked category associated with the invention disclosure may appear first in the list in order of level of expertise, while reviewers with expertise in lower ranked categories may appear further down in the list of reviewers.
- a more complex method of ranking may involve looking at the various combinations of categories in which a reviewer has expertise and determining how many categories associated with the invention disclosure that the reviewer has expertise in along with the level of expertise and the ranking of the categories. Any ranking mechanism may be used that takes into account the expertise of the reviewers and the categories selected for association with the invention disclosure without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
- Availability and scheduling information 475 for the selected reviewers is then obtained from the distributed reviewer information 470 .
- This information may be distributed across a plurality of computing systems and may be part of each reviewer's own client computing device, for example.
- the availability and scheduling information 475 may indicate the reviewers time schedule with regard to scheduled business meetings, vacations, other invention disclosure review meetings, business travel, and the like. Basically, the availability and scheduling information 475 provides information regarding when the reviewer will not be able to engage in the review of the invention disclosure and when they will be able to.
- This information may be used along with review dates set by the invention disclosure system 400 to determine if the selected reviewers will be able to perform the review of the invention disclosure given their current schedules of availability.
- the invention disclosure routing engine 435 may check the availability and scheduling information for the reviewers to make sure that they have sufficient available time within the next two months to review the invention disclosure and schedule the review meeting.
- a next reviewer from the list of reviewers is selected and the process is repeated until a requisite number of reviewers is obtained.
- this process may be performed on a review team level such that it is determined whether the review team as a whole can review the invention disclosure and, if not, a next best review team is selected.
- Those reviewers 445 that are selected and whose schedules indicate that they are able to perform the review of the invention disclosure are then sent notifications of their assignment to review the invention disclosure.
- These notifications may include links to the invention disclosure information stored in the existing invention disclosure database 415 .
- the notification may include a graphical user interface through which the reviewer may accept, reject or delegate the review of the invention disclosure. If the reviewer accepts the invention disclosure, information about the reviewer and/or review team is stored in the existing invention disclosure database 415 in association with the invention disclosure.
- the invention disclosure routing engine 435 selects an alternative reviewer from the list of reviewers to assign to review the invention disclosure. If the reviewer delegates the review of the invention disclosure, the identification of the person to which the review task is delegated is checked against the reviewer database 450 to determine if the person is an authorized reviewer of invention disclosures. If the person is not an authorized reviewer, then an alternative reviewer is selected from the list of reviewers. If the person is an authorized reviewer, then the above notification process is repeated with the person to which the review task is delegated.
- the mechanism of the present invention favors the review team and/or reviewer based on a closeness of the review team or reviewer to the inventors identified in the invention disclosure in terms of organization and/or physical location.
- the present invention provides a mechanism for categorization of invention disclosures and routing of invention disclosures to reviewers/review teams with the necessary expertise to fairly evaluate the invention disclosures for patentability and ability to further business objectives.
- the business organization's failure to act on invention disclosures that are not completely appreciated as far as patentability and/or business objectives are concerned, is minimized.
- the business organization's expenditures on duplicative invention disclosures and invention disclosures that are not in line with the business objectives of the organization is also minimized.
- the present invention may be used to select review teams and/or individual reviewers, the present invention may be used to dynamically create review teams that have the requisite expertise for a particular invention disclosure, whether those reviewers are part of the same department in the organization, in the same location, or in distributed departments and locations.
- the present invention permits the formation and co-existence of two distinct types of review teams: (1) those that are broad in scope, where team members come from different disciplines; and (2) those that are focused in a specific area of business/technology.
- the present invention increases the visibility of ideas beyond the inventor's immediate physical location and/or organizational area as these novel concepts are exposed to expert individuals who know how best to leverage them in other areas of business.
- the present invention reduces the incidence of independently submitted disclosures that are alike but not yet in a searchable state as these would typically be routed to the same review team which is in a better position to recognize similarities.
- the present invention improves the overall quality of submissions through informed, insightful evaluations from review teams that have expertise in the particular technology areas.
- the present invention may be used to view the expertise of review teams/reviews with regard to the taxonomy of invention categories so that it can be determined where coverage gaps or excesses are present. This may trigger the formation of a new review team or re-balancing of existing review teams.
- FIG. 5 is an exemplary diagram of a technological/business category taxonomy that may be used to categorize invention disclosures and reviewer expertise in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- the taxonomy is a hierarchical category structure in which categories are set forth at a first level of the hierarchy and subcategories are provided at lower levels of the hierarchy.
- the category “Software/Services/Applications/Solutions” may have subcategories of “Image Processing,” “Human Language Processing,” “Data Compression for Image & Sound,” and the like.
- the subcategory “Image Processing” may have further subcategories, or sub-subcategories, of “Image manipulation; scaling; etc.,” “Image rendering & visualization,” “Image scanning,” and “Image recognition.”
- Each category and subcategory has an associated identifier that may be used to identify the category/subcategory.
- the identifier is the “Tech Tag” and is an alphanumeric identifier.
- the “Tech Tag” is a number such as “600” but in some instances related subcategories may be denoted by tech tags such as “810A.”
- tech tags such as “810A.”
- Other types of identifiers may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
- the identifiers are stored in relation to invention disclosures to thereby identify the categories associated with the invention disclosures.
- the same taxonomy and category identifiers may be used to represent a reviewer's expertise in a particular technology/business area.
- the category identifiers may be stored in a reviewer's expertise profile thereby identifying the reviewer as having knowledge in a particular category of technology/business.
- the reviewers may make use of a different taxonomy of technology/business categories as long as a mechanism is provided for mapping the taxonomy used to represent reviewer expertise with the taxonomy used to represent categories of technology/business for classifying invention disclosures.
- the present invention permits the inventor or creator of the invention disclosure to select categories from the depicted taxonomy to be associated with the inventor's/creator's invention disclosure for purposes of routing the invention to an appropriate review team.
- the inventor/creator may be provided with the taxonomy depicted and permitted to select from the hierarchical display of the taxonomy.
- selected categories may be presented to the inventor/creator based on an automated selection mechanism as described above, such that a list of possible categories from the depicted taxonomy are presented for the inventor/creator to choose from.
- the categorization based on the depicted taxonomy may be completely automated so that the classification of the invention disclosure is performed without the inventor/creator selecting any categories for the invention disclosure.
- a reviewer, manager, or other individual in the organization may use the depicted taxonomy to establish an expertise profile for a reviewer. Categories from the taxonomy may be selected and their identifiers stored in an expertise profile associated with a particular reviewer.
- the category identifiers associated with invention disclosures submitted and reviewed by the reviewer may be used to automatically update the reviewer's expertise profile by adding category identifiers to it, changing the level of expertise associated with a category identifier, or the like.
- FIG. 6 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a manner by which an invention disclosure routing mechanism may be used to determine a review team or set of reviewers to which an invention disclosure should be routed in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- the invention disclosure routing engine 610 receives categorized invention disclosure information 620 from the invention disclosure system.
- This invention disclosure information 620 includes an invention disclosure identifier 622 , a plurality of technology/business category identifiers 624 , and priorities 626 associated with the category identifiers 624 .
- the invention disclosure routing engine 610 retrieves reviewer profiles 630 , 640 and 650 from the reviewer database.
- Each profile includes a reviewer identifier 632 , 642 , 652 , identifiers 634 , 644 , 654 of the technology/business categories in which the reviewer has expertise, and a level of expertise 636 , 646 , 656 for each technology/business category. It is assumed for purposes of this explanation that each of the reviewer's availability and scheduling information indicates that they are available to review the invention disclosure 620 . It is further assumed that the required number of reviewers for the review team is two reviewers.
- the invention disclosure routing engine 610 looks at the category identifiers 624 associated with the invention disclosure 620 and their corresponding priorities 626 . The invention disclosure routing engine 610 then searches the reviewer database to retrieve reviewer profiles that include one or more of the category identifiers 624 .
- the reviewer profiles 640 - 660 are then ranked according to which reviewer profiles 630 , 640 , 650 have expertise categories 634 , 644 , 654 include more of the category identifiers 624 , which reviewer profiles 630 , 640 , 650 have higher priority category identifiers 624 in their expertise categories 634 , 644 , 654 , and the level of expertise with regard to those category identifiers 624 appearing in the expertise categories 634 , 644 , 654 .
- reviewer 2 and reviewer 3 are selected to be part of the review team 660 .
- Reviewer 3 has all three category identifiers 624 in its expertise categories 654 and reviewer 2 has two of the three category identifiers 624 in its expertise categories 644 .
- Reviewer 2 and reviewer 3 have the same level of expertise with regard to the highest priority category, i.e. category “ 646 .” While reviewer 2 has a higher level of expertise in the second highest priority category, i.e. category “ 600 ,” reviewer 3 has a good level of expertise in this category and furthermore, has expertise in the third highest priority category where reviewer 2 does not. Therefore, reviewer 3 is selected as a better choice than reviewer 2 to be included in the review team 660 . However, since two reviewers are required for the review team 660 , both reviewer 3 and reviewer 2 are selected for inclusion in the review team 660 .
- FIG. 8 is an exemplary diagram of the primary operational elements of an invention disclosure and routing mechanism in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention in which measurement mechanisms are provided for measuring the effectiveness of the invention disclosure categorization mechanism and the invention disclosure routing mechanism.
- the primary difference between this embodiment and the previous embodiments described in regard to FIG. 4 is that monitoring mechanisms are provided for gauging the effectiveness of the categorization and routing processes of the present invention.
- the invention disclosure system 400 includes a categorization monitoring system 810 that monitors the selection of categories for invention disclosures made by invention disclosure categorizer in relation to the final selections made by the inventor/creator. That is, the monitoring system 810 determines when the invention disclosure categorizer selects a category as a preferred category for the invention disclosure and the inventor/creator of the invention disclosure either selects that category or selects a different category that is not as preferred. This information may be used to determine the effectiveness of the invention disclosure categorizer so that reports of this effectiveness may be generated for use by a system administrator. Such reports may indicate areas where the categorization policies and rules need to be modified to achieve higher levels of effectiveness.
- this alternative embodiment includes a reviewer participation monitoring system 820 that monitors the routing performed by the invention disclosure routing engine.
- the reviewer participation monitoring system 820 monitors how often a reviewer is selected to review an invention disclosure and either accepts, rejects, or delegates the review task to another reviewer. This information may be used to generate reports as to whether a particular reviewer should be more or less favored than other reviewers in determining the routing of invention disclosures. For example, if a reviewer is often selected to review invention disclosures but rejects or delegates this review task, then the reviewer may be less favored over other reviewers when determining where to route invention disclosures, even though the reviewer may be more highly ranked with regard to his/her expertise. Thus, the information collected by the reviewer participation monitoring system 820 may be used to adjust the ranking of reviewers based on their willingness to participate in the invention disclosure review process.
- the alternative embodiment illustrated in FIG. 8 provides mechanisms for monitoring the effectiveness of the invention disclosure and routing system with regard to its categorization and routing functions.
- the information collected by this monitoring of effectiveness may be used to modify the categorization and routing operations performed so that a more effective system is developed.
- FIGS. 9 and 10 are flowcharts that illustrate exemplary operations of one exemplary embodiment of the present invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions which execute on the processor or other programmable data processing apparatus create means for implementing the functions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.
- These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory or storage medium that can direct a processor or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory or storage medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the functions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.
- blocks of the flowchart illustrations support combinations of means for performing the specified functions, combinations of steps for performing the specified functions and program instruction means for performing the specified functions. It will also be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based computer systems which perform the specified functions or steps, or by combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.
- FIG. 9 is an exemplary flowchart outlining an exemplary operation of the present invention when generating an invention disclosure in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- the operation starts by receiving an invention disclosure from an inventor/creator client computing device (step 910 ).
- the invention disclosure is then analyzed to extract invention disclosure metadata (step 920 ).
- the invention disclosure metadata is then used to match the invention disclosure with one or more technology/business categories in a technology/business category taxonomy (step 930 ). As described previously, this may be done manually by the inventor/creator, semi-automatically or fully automatically using the invention disclosure metadata and category information maintained for existing invention disclosures.
- the categories may be presented to the inventor/creator for confirmation, selection of certain categories to be associated with the invention disclosure, or the like (step 940 ).
- the inventor/creator's selection of categories from those presented may then be received (step 950 ).
- this step and the previous step may be eliminated since it is not necessary to get the inventor/creator's selection of categories.
- the selection of categories may include all of those presented or specific ones of those presented to the inventor/creator in step 940 .
- the previous step 940 may involve merely displaying the taxonomy of categories if the system is completely manual with regard to category selection.
- invention disclosure information along with the selected categories for the invention disclosure may then be sent to the invention disclosure routing engine for use in determining which reviewers should be assigned to review the invention disclosure (step 970 ). The operation then ends.
- FIG. 10 is an exemplary flowchart outlining an exemplary operation of the present invention when routing a categorized invention disclosure to a set of reviewers or review team.
- the operation starts by receiving invention disclosure and category information from an invention disclosure system (step 1010 ).
- a list of reviewers/review teams having expertise in the categories associated with the invention disclosure are then identified from the reviewer database (step 1020 ).
- the reviewer profiles for these reviewers are then ranked based on their degree of expertise in the various categories and the relative priority associated with each category in the categorization of the invention disclosure (step 1030 ).
- the availability and schedule information for a predetermined set of the reviewers in the ranked list of reviewers is evaluated to determine if they are able to review the invention disclosure (step 1040 ).
- a set of reviewers that are highly ranked in the list of reviewers and that are available to review the invention disclosure are then selected (step 1050 ) and notifications are sent to the selected reviewers' client computing devices (step 1060 ).
- Responses to the notifications are then received from the reviewers' client computing devices (step 1070 ).
- a determination is made as to whether all of the selected reviewers accepted the review task (step 1080 ). If not, for those reviewers that did not accept the review task, alternative reviewers are selected (step 1090 ). If the rejection of the review task involved the delegation of the review task to another specified reviewer, the selection of an alternative reviewer may involve determining if the specified delegate is an authorized reviewer and is available to review the invention disclosure. The operation returns to step 1060 where a notification is sent out to the selected alternative reviewers and the process is repeated until all of the selected reviewers accept the review task.
- the invention disclosures are submitted to the reviewers for their review (step 1095 ). This may involve sending notifications to the reviewers' client computing devices with links to the invention disclosure entry in the existing invention disclosure database, for example. Thereafter, the operation ends.
- the present invention provides a mechanism for the categorization of invention disclosures into technology/business categories in a taxonomy of categories such that the invention disclosures may be routed to reviewers/review teams having the necessary expertise to fairly evaluate the invention disclosure.
- the present invention provides a mechanism for specifying the expertise of the various reviewers/review teams so that they may be matched with invention disclosures that are in line with their expertise. As a result, a more efficient and accurate evaluation of invention disclosures is obtained when compared to the known organizational and physical location based methodologies in use today.
