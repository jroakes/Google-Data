Definitions
- the present disclosure is related to video animation systems, and more specifically to methods and apparatus for improved content creation within such systems.
- the internet has greatly simplified the sharing of descriptions, narratives, reports, impressions, and the like, whether written, audible, visual or a combination thereof, intended to tell some form of a story.
- Content created by one individual can easily be viewed by others (e.g., a video posted on YouTube.com or a photo album on Shutterfly.com), pushed out to others (e.g., by email or blog publishing), and so on.
- the content may be factual (such as a report of a newsworthy event), may be personal (such as a shared on-line vacation photo album), may be commercial (such as a description of a business's professional services at its website), may be artistic (such as music videos), and so on.
- video content is content comprising an assembly of a number of visual images forming a scene (such as camera-based digital movies) as well as a dynamically generated presentation of serial images such as real-time computer animation, each usually also including audio elements.
- scripted refers not only to pre-determined spoken word (such as dialog) but also to defined scene characteristics such as lighting, costume, prop description and placement, scene-to-scene transition, sound effects, etc.
- scenes of video content are formed by assembling a series of frames in a time-wise linear fashion.
- a movie or clip is a series of scenes assembled together in a time-wise fashion.
- a character is a representation of an animate participant in a scene.
- An object is a representation of something other than a character in the scene.
- a background is the context into which a character or an object may be placed. Characters, objects, and backgrounds are collectively referred to as elements, although elements may include additional items such as sounds, text, scene controls, etc.
- animation tools are available which can simplify the process of creating scripted animated content.
- Tools exists which allow a user to select from among an assortment of animated characters, insert those characters into a selected scene, select gestures the character may make, provide text for the character to speak, etc.
- Various user interfaces for creating content in this way are available. For example, characters may be placed in a scene by dragging then from a palette and dropping them at a desired location in the scene. Dragging and dropping may similarly set camera positions and camera movement. Dialog may be typed into a user interface window, causing the characters to recite the typed text. Scenes may be composed in this way within which scripted events may take place, with the user interface providing control of both dialog and certain scene characteristics. The relative ease and speed with which a user can create scripted animated content in this way suggests that it is certainly an alternative to, and could, in many cases, be a more desirable form of content creation when compared to camera-based scripted video content.
- drag-and-drop animated content creation tools are typically designed for a single creator (or editor). Only when the content is completed is it made available for general viewing. This precludes the ability to allow an undefined and changing population of contributors to co-create and/or edit content as it is being created.
- the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for animated content creation that addresses shortcomings of known systems and methods including but not limited to those identified above.
- the systems and methods provide a wide range of creative control, the ability to create more dynamic animated content, and the ability to increase the emotional and dramatic texture of that content through use of relatively simple and intuitive tools.
- a system in which a user may define attributes of a scene into which one or more characters, objects, backgrounds, and like, may be placed.
- the user is provide with a set of simple indirect scene characteristic control labels, such as “mood” labels (e.g., “romantic”, “tense”, “scary”), “localization” labels (e.g., language, accent, units of measure, customs, cultural norms), animation “style” (e.g., realistic, manga, Disney, South Park, etc.), and so on which define for that scene one or more indirect attributes (that is, attributes either not directly controlled, or not controlled collectively with a common intent) such as lighting, camera angles, focus, scene layout, audio characteristics, motion and response characteristics of a character or object in the scene, skinning of a character or object in the scene, etc.
- “mod” labels e.g., “romantic”, “tense”, “scary”
- localization” labels e.g., language, accent, units of measure
- Labels may also control direct attributes, but at least one indirect control is always part of a label control.
- Many examples of a scene's “look and feel” are in the repertoire of the feature filmmaker today that can be translated into the animated content creation process.
- tools are needed to simplify that process. These tools can provide predefined labels, as well as labels that the user may define and associated scene settings, and that may be added to the library of such indirect control labels.
- another set of indirect scene transition labels may be provided for transitions from scene to scene. For example, if characters travel from one room to another between scenes, a “smooth” transition may be selected, which provides for reverse camera angles, consistency of lighting, consistency of character and object placement in the view, appropriate audio processing, and so forth. As another example, if there is a jump in time between scenes, a “jump” transition can be selected which can provide a pause at the end of one scene, a very short transitional break, then begin the next scene. Such transitions are important to provide continuity from scene to scene, and support the emotional and dramatic components of a scene, which are commonly lacking in drag-and-drop animated content. The user is also provided with tools to define new transitions and associated settings that may be added to the library of such indirect control labels.
- spoken language segments e.g., words
- the language segments are converted to text representation within the system.
- Prosodic attributes of the spoken language segment intonations, rhythm, and other aspects of the speech—can be extracted and noted within the system.
- the text representation may then be used to generate synthesized speech in a voice provided by the system, including the prosodic attributes extracted from the original spoken language segments.
- language segments are quickly and easily input for synthesizing, and the synthesized computer voice can easily be provided with the prosodic attributes of the actual spoken language segment, imparting enhanced realism to the synthesized voice.
- multiple users may simultaneously and relatively independently participate in the content creation process.
- the multiple users may, for example, each access a server-based application, and add characters, objects in the scene setting, background details, character voice or language segments (as mentioned above), and so on. They may also comment in an associated dialog box about the content as it is being created to further provide collaborative content creation.
- the response of the collaborators can be tracked. If the response is positive, the change could remain part of the scene, whereas if the response is negative, the change might be rejected.
- This modification-feedback loop may repeat over time such that a scene is continuously being updated in response to collective feedback.
- Collaborators may be included in the content creation process by specific invitation, or may respond to an open invitation to contribute (crowd sourcing).
- animation characters and objects may be imported from a variety of sources and added to scenes. These may be relatively static, such as picture to be hung on a wall in a scene. Or, they may be dynamic, such as an animated character. Imported objects bring with them their behavior attributes. They may have defined characteristics which control how they interact with other characters or objects in a scene, such as a chair defined to respond differently to different characters in a scene (e.g., when sitting in the chair, a “heavier” character sinks further down than a “lighter” character).
- a warehouse of such characters and objects may be provided which are tailored for quick and simple integration into a scene. Similarly, a warehouse of backgrounds may be provided. The characters, objects, and backgrounds in the warehouse may be tagged (e.g., “wombat”, “1970s “couch”, “French restaurant scene”, etc.) to provide a simple organization and retrieval method.
- tags may be merely descriptions associated with some or all of a scene, or may be control labels with description(s) but not-yet-implemented functionality (essential name placeholders) with certain scene controls associated therewith, making execution of directorial intent relatively simple and quick (e.g., providing cues to a creator that in a scene tagged as “funny”, a character's movements may be animated to be jerky, exaggerated or slapstick, whereas in a scene tagged as serious animated character movements are slow and deliberate).
- the content creator may overwrite some or all of the attributes defined by scene tagging. Tagging may also be used by a system examining a plurality of similarly tagged scenes to extract common characteristics and determining characteristics common to those similarly tagged scenes, such as focus, camera position, lighting, and so on.

- FIG. 14 is an illustration of a mood map showing moods of various characters in terms of time, and permitting comparison of the mood of one character at a point in time with that of another character at that same point in time according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
- the systems and methods disclosed herein typically find applicability in networked computer devices and may be embodied as an application resident on such a networked computer device, as a server-resident application operated through a web browser interface, as a rich internet application, as a Flash (Adobe, Inc.) or Java (Oracle Corp.) applet, etc.
- a server-resident application operated through a web browser interface
- a rich internet application as a Flash (Adobe, Inc.) or Java (Oracle Corp.) applet, etc.
- Flash Adobe, Inc.
- Java Oracle Corp.
- existing animation platforms either provide too few or too many and too complex a set of controls for controlling the “mood” created by the various attributes defining a scene.
- such platforms do not provide a quick and convenient method for setting a plurality of controls to accomplish a common intent, such as quick and simple way to re-regionalizing a scene (e.g., take a scene from an American setting to a French setting).
- a set of “labels” are provided which permit a content creator to simply and efficiently select attributes such as lighting, camera angle, character animations, object attributes, etc. for a scene to impart a desired characteristic to the scene.
- mood is intended to mean the feelings and state of mind about a scene experienced by an average user when viewing a scene. Mood further includes the desired feelings and state of mind that the scene creator wishes the viewer to experience. That is, it is intended to be both subjective and objective. Other characteristics are discussed further below.
- Animation frame 22 may be one of a series of frames which, when displayed in a chronological order, form a scene of animated content.
- Animation editor interface 20 may be a user interface for an animation application running on the user's (content creator's) computer.
- the animation application may have many scene design controls, and the layouts illustrated herein do not limit in any way the scope of the present disclosure or the claims thereto.
- Shown in window 22 are two characters 24 , 26 , and various objects 28 (table), 30 (door), etc.
- the scene shows characters 24 , 26 at a restaurant or bar.
- the scene can be from one of many possible situations, each with a unique mood. While various terms may be used to refer to the feeling, emotional content, sensation, sentiment, state, and so forth a content creator wants to impart to a scene, for simplicity we use the term “mood” herein to represent this concept.
- characters 24 , 26 may be on a romantic date, such that the content creator wishes that the attributes of the scene convey a “romantic” mood.
- characters 24 , 26 may be having a business meeting, with a professional or workplace mood.
- characters 24 , 26 could be having an argument, such that the scene might be best provided with a “tense” mood. While multiple elements of the scene may be directly controlled and animated (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, dialog, etc.) to establish the mood of the scene, it is possible to provide a user with a sense of the scene's mood simply from indirect controls such as lighting, camera angles, video focus, camera steadiness (or bounce), audio focus, and so on. While in many cases the mood is established by both direct and indirect control, it may be set exclusively or primarily by indirect controls if appropriate or desired.
- a scene mood may be selected from a set of such moods, both predefined and user-defined, in an interface menu 32 .
- a user may simply move the cursor 34 of the computer running the animation application over a mood “label” such as the “Romantic” label 36 a , and click on label 36 a to impart the frame with the attributes associated with the Romantic label.
- these attributes may be relatively dim lighting, low camera angles, soft focus, slow zoom on speaking character, audio focus on speaking character, etc.
- a mood label can be selected for any point during a scene so that the mood of the scene may be easily and quickly changed. This may be done, for example, by dragging the label 36 a to a timeline 38 , and stretching it cover the length of the clip. Once set, the mood label may remain from frame to frame until a new label is selected, a new scene is started, and so on. In this way, consistency of mood may be provided from frame to frame throughout a scene. Furthermore, this mood consistency can stretch across different scenes, such as if characters 24 , 26 leave the restaurant shown in frame 22 , and resume in a new romantic setting such as an after-dinner walk.
- a second scene may be added to interface 20 , for example allowing the scene mood label 36 a to be extended to the width (time-wise) of all or part of both scenes.
- the mood settings may “auto-complete” in that certain assumptions can be built into mood label definitions, such as “unless set otherwise, the next scene's mood will match the current scene's mood.
- This auto-complete feature may form a control within the animation system and method (e.g., auto-complete is independent of which specific mood label is applied), or may form a control within individual mood labels (e.g., certain labels auto complete, others do not).
- an additional control 40 may be provided to refine the characteristic selection made from menu 32 a by selecting the intensity of the mood. While a “volume knob” embodiment is shown in FIG. 2 , sliders, radio buttons, rotating drums, and pull-down menus are just some of other forms an interface that this control may take. Similarly, while three levels of gradation labeled low, medium, and high are shown in FIG. 2A , other numbers levels and labels are clearly within the scope of the present disclosure. Thus, the form of the control, and levels of gradation are not critical. However, by providing control of the intensity level of the mood, the content creator can build to a desired mood level, such as slightly romantic, very romantic, passionate, etc. Given that compelling movies (indeed any form of compelling storytelling) often take the viewer through one or more emotional “arcs”, permitting the content creator to simply and easily control the rise and fall of the mood in the content provides a powerful tool for effective content creation.
- An animation application may be provided with a number of predefined scene mood labels, which may be locked or may be user-modifiable. Likewise, an animation application may be provided with tools to assist a user in creating custom mood labels.
- An interface window 44 is provided with a number of user-modifiable fields controlling scene attribute settings that define a scene mood label.
- a field 46 may be provided for a user to apply a text name to the scene mood label being defined, or to select an existing scene mood label for editing.
- the text name for the label can have a meaning associated with the desired scene mood such that scene attribute settings being set are in accordance with a meaning associated with the label text (e.g., romantic, scary, etc.)
- a great many different attributes may be associated with scene mood definitions, and controls permitting setting of the attributes may be provided in many different styles and forms, some of which being shown as settings 48 in FIG. 3 .
- the following is a partial list for the purpose of illustrating the general concepts of the present disclosure, and shall not be read as limiting the scope hereof: number of cameras, camera-to-camera shift rate, which-camera to which-camera (viewpoint) shifting, camera stability, camera pan, camera zoom, camera focus, camera depth of focus, camera cropping, camera field of view, image filters, color filters, image effects (e.g., re-rendering), image blending, number of light sources, intensity of light sources, positions of light sources, colors of light sources, modulation of light sources, audio intensity, audio focus, audio transition (e.g., from character to character), room acoustics, etc., and variations within a scene of any one or more of the above.
- attributes affecting one or more characters or objects in the scene can be set by the selection of a scene mood label. For example, in a romantic scene, character movement may be made to be smooth and deliberate, and objects may be more stable. Or, in a scene labeled “scary”, character movement may be made more jerky, and objects less stable and hence more likely to tip or fall. Individual characters or objects may be provided with the option of being affected by scene mood control labels or not, and labels themselves can be defined to affect or not affect the motion, interaction, etc. of characters and objects with each other or with the background.
- setting of a scene characteristic label can control other characteristics.
- setting a “region” label may set regionalization of a scene.
- a scene may initiate in the native language and with the native cultural icons and norms of the scene creator, such as American English. Currency is dollars, measurement units (length, weight, etc.) are English, characters are dressed as a typical American might dress for the scene, objects are what might be found in an American home, business, store or restaurant for the scene, etc.
- FIGS. 2A through 2C a selection among the various types of characteristics may be enabled by menu items such as 42 a , 42 b , etc. While FIG. 2A is an illustration of a user interface with the “mood” menu item 42 a selected, FIG. 2B is an illustration of a user interface with the “culture” menu item 42 b selected.
- the system may quickly and efficiently replace aspects of the scene with more traditional Japanese aspects.
- Language translation may take place, for example by translating text from English to Japanese, then using a Japanese speech synthesis to voice the text. (See below for additional details of the voice synthesis process).
- Currency may be converted to yen, measurement units (length, weight, etc.) are metric, characters are dressed as a typical Japanese might dress for the scene, objects are what might be found in a Japanese home, business, store or restaurant for the scene, etc. These changes may be more than simply re-skinning characters and object, and translating text. Dynamic elements of the scene may also be converted to be regionally appropriate, such as cars driving on the left versus right side of the road, etc. And, cultural norms may be changed, such as hand gestures, methods of greetings, etc. Indeed, individual aspects of the culture label may be enabled or disabled in menu 43 to enable, for example, a Japanese character to have Japanese attributes in an otherwise American setting, and so on.
- FIG. 3C is an illustration of a user interface which permits a user to select and control various attributes of the animation style.
- the user may select an animation style, such as “manga”, from menu 32 C, which will render a selected character, group of characters, or all characters in a scene according to that style.
- the user may also select a “copy from” function, and identify and source character or object form which the animation style and possibly other elements may be copied.
- a user may select an image or file of a character or object and transform that file into a character or object to be used in the system. For example, a user selects a “Use this” control in menu 32 e , and when prompted select a photograph of Abraham Lincoln then select “new”. This action will create a file for use in the animation system that may be manipulated and used in the animation system described herein.
- a user may select attributes tailored for a particular audience. It may, for example, be the case that a user anticipates that a particularly young or old audience will view the clip. Attributes of the clip may be changed wholesale to be appropriate for that target group.
- a user interface 32 f shown in FIG. 2 d may be used to control the intended age of a viewer, where the control ranges from “young” to “old”. This may produce many different results, such as the appearance of the character (as shown in FIG. 2D , from cartoon-like to more realistic), the rate of speech, the content of speech, the nature of humor, and so on.
- audience controls are also possible, such as location, cultural group, reason for viewing, capabilities of viewers, and so on. And while the audience control described above is in the context of content creation, this control may also be provided after the content is assembled, for example just prior to or during viewing of the content.
- Scene-to-scene continuity may be also be influenced by a selected label.
- a typical movie is comprised of a number of scenes, with transitions from one scene to the next. While the drag-and-drop style of animation discussed above can be used to produce multi-scene movies, the process involves building a first scene, ending that scene, then building a new scene that simply follows the prior scene in time. There is no control over continuity between scenes, and no tools to automate the transition from one scene to the next. This is true of the scene itself as well as the behavior of the characters, objects, and backgrounds comprising the scenes. This is more akin to conjoining two independent clips than creating a cohesive set of transitioned clips. In contrast, the system and methods disclosed herein provide transition control to the creation of sequential scenes by providing scene transition labels.
- the scene transition labels may have titles which are tied to a temporal or an emotional meaning (e.g., jump to represent time passing between scenes, tension increase or decrease to represent building or decreasing tension between scenes, warm or cold to control those aspects of the end of one scene and beginning of the next, etc.)
- An editor interface 50 for employing scene transition labels is illustrated in FIG. 4 .
- interface 50 comprises an interface menu 52 for selecting a scene transition label 54 from a set of such labels, both predefined and user-defined.
- a clip composition palette 56 includes a number of scenes, which may be organized by dragging and dropping from another portion 58 of interface 50 .
- a timeline 60 is provided allowing the content creator to organize the clips in a time-wise fashion.
- Menu 52 provides a number of transition labels 54 a , 54 b , 54 c , and so on, such as smooth, jump, tension—increasing, tension—decreasing, cold, warm, and so on.
- transition labels may, for example, be dragged from menu 52 into the regions between or overlap two adjacent clips. The width of the region between the end of one clip and start of the next clip may define the length of the transition.
- a transition item in from menu 52 may have associated with it a defined transition time.
- transition label can have the effect of setting various scene controls such as lighting, camera angles, video focus, camera steadiness (or bounce), audio focus independently for each of the two scenes in the transition in order to provide the desired transition effect. For example, if characters travel from one room to another between scenes, a “smooth” transition may be selected, which automatically provides for reverse camera angles, consistency of lighting, consistency of character and object placement in the view, appropriate audio processing, and so forth. Alternatively, if there is a jump in time between scenes, a “jump” transition can be selected which can provide a pause at the end of one scene, a very short transitional break, then begin the next scene, etc.
- scene controls such as lighting, camera angles, video focus, camera steadiness (or bounce), audio focus independently for each of the two scenes in the transition in order to provide the desired transition effect. For example, if characters travel from one room to another between scenes, a “smooth” transition may be selected, which automatically provides for reverse camera angles, consistency of lighting, consistency of character and object placement in the view, appropriate audio
- An interface quite similar to that shown and described with regard to FIG. 3 may be employed to defined and edit the set of scene transition labels. Again, the name of the label should give the user a general idea about the effect of the setting of the attributes and the nature of the resulting transition.
- a partial list illustrating the general concepts of the present disclosure, which shall not be read as limiting the scope hereof, includes: cameras tracking, camera-to-camera shift rate, camera pan, camera zoom, camera focus, camera depth of focus, camera cropping, camera field of view, image filters, color filters, image effects (e.g., re-rendering), image blending, light sources from one scene running into the other scene, positions of light sources, light transition from one scene to the next, audio focus, audio transition (e.g., blending from one scene to the next), object position and state continuity, background position and state continuity, etc.
- attributes affecting one or more characters or objects in the scene can be set by the selection of a scene transition label. For example, in a smooth transition, character movement may be made to be smooth and deliberate, and objects may be more stable. In a transition labeled “blend”, character movement in a first scene may be compared to character movement in a second scene, and the nature of those movements adjusted so that one blends into the next. Individual characters or objects may be provided with the option of being affected by scene transition labels or not, and labels themselves can be defined to affect or not affect the motion, interaction, etc. of characters and objects with each other or with the background.
- the system and methods disclosed herein enable a content creator to create language segments (e.g., words) to be spoken by animated characters by receiving language segments spoken by a human, input from a pre-recorded audio source, generated by a speech synthesizer, etc.
- the input language segments are converted to text representation within the system.
- Prosodic attributes of the spoken language segment intonations, rhythm, word lengths, accents, timbre, and other aspects of the speech—can be extracted and noted by an appropriate representation mechanism within the system.
- the text representation may then be used to generate synthesized speech in a voice provided by the system.
- the prosodic attributes extracted from the original spoken language segments may be factored into the synthesized speech, producing a more realistic and natural synthesized voice, a voice truer to the original speakers voice, and so on.
- System 70 for using spoken language segments to input those language segments for a synthesized voice is shown.
- System 70 comprises an audio input apparatus 72 , which may be a microphone, text-to-speech device, digital or analog audio input jack, or other similar device for receiving contemporaneously spoken or pre-recorded audio.
- the input audio will be in analog format, so analog-to-digital processing takes place, for example at digitizer 74 .
- the output of digitizer 74 is provided to speech-to-text processing apparatus 76 and to prosodic processing apparatus 78 .
- the audio input is purely digital, then that input may be provided directly to audio memory 82 , as indicated by the dashed line representing an optional connection.
- Speech-to-text processing apparatus 76 converts the spoken language segments to text form, and stores that text in text memory 80 .
- Prosodic processing apparatus 78 analyzes the digitized speech, and extracts intonation, rhythm, word length, accents, timbre, word and syllable separation, syllabic stress, and other aspects of the speech that are not simply converted into text by speech-to-text processing apparatus 76 , and stores those elements in prosodics memory 86 .
- a text editor 84 may be used to edit the text in text memory 80
- a prosodic elements editor may edit the prosodic elements in prosodics memory 86 .
- the text in text memory 80 may be spoken as synthesized voice by a text-to-speech processor 88 .
- the voice may be one provided by the system's voice synthesis apparatus 90 , which may be edited by a voice editor 92 .
- the speech may be output, by an audio output device 94 , such as an audio speaker.
- the content creator may have assembled a scene, with characters, objects, backgrounds, and interactions between those elements. This may be done in an interface such as shown at 100 of FIG. 6 .
- the content creator may drag the selected text from a menu 102 to a timeline 104 , and adjust it to fit into a portion of the scene indicated by frame 108 .
- the text elements shown in menu 102 represent spoken language segments from text memory 80 ( FIG. 5 ).
- the text elements have associated with them prosodic elements from prosodics memory 86 , as well as a selected synthesized voice and other user-selectable audio characteristics that may be accessed in an editor window 110 shown in FIG. 7 .
- window 110 indicates the voice being used 112 (which may be selected from synthesized voices provided by the system in a different interface), the text file 114 to be voiced by the character, and the source 116 of the intonation file that will modify the synthesized voice, such as that extracted by the prosodic processing apparatus 78 from the digitized human voice input to audio input 72 of FIG. 5 . If needed, the intonation, rhythm, etc. may be edited either by re-recording and re-digitizing the voice, or by other known interface and control 118 , 120 to these elements.
- voice input may be employed. For example, it is possible to input spoken text from audio recordings, from live orations, from spoken language received via the radio, Internet, etc. This may be a useful feature when wanting to replicate the spoken mannerisms of a celebrity, historical figure, or the like, while doing so with a synthesized voice, for example in an educational context. Another use may be utilizing stored language clips to synthesize a person's natural spoken voice following onset of an impairment that limits a person's ability to speak.
- While many different or additional methods of associating text, speaking voice, and prosodic elements may be employed, the general concept is that digitized voice is converted to text, the prosodic elements extracted from the digitized voice, the text and/or prosodic elements edited if necessary, then a synthesized voice, for example other than the original speaker's voice, reads the text with the prosodic elements overlaid to form more natural sounding synthesized speech.
- a synthesized voice for example other than the original speaker's voice
- Many cues may be obtained from the text to assist with the animation process, such as selecting the target with which a character interacts, selecting appropriate backgrounds, directing character motion, action or interaction, control of regionalization, identification of mood or transition characteristics for label identification or application, and so on.
- the system and methods described herein may be resident on a server 152 to which multiple client devices 154 a , 154 b , 154 c , etc. are communicatively connected via a local area network, wide area network, the Internet, etc. In such an arrangement, multiple users can simultaneously be contributing elements of scenes or whole scenes to a project.
- one contributor may author and contribute a scene relating to how two people first meet. Another to how these two people get to know one another. And still another to how the two people get along together after some time.
- the entire project may be scripted, and each contributor may create his or her scene following the script. Or, some or all of the project may be unscripted, and each contributor creates their vision of the slice of a slice of the project.
- the various scenes may then be assembled together in a simple manner as described above. Labels for scene moods and scene transitions may then be applied, as described above, to blend the various scenes into a consistent and cohesive product, if desired.
- contributors may contribute objects, backgrounds, behaviors of characters or objects, spoken language segments, titles or credits, sounds, music, and may contribute new mood labels and transition labels, as well as a wide array of additional elements to a project. There may be one individual or group individuals who have final editorial authority for the piece, or the piece may be a product of collective effort.
- creators may import elements to a scene that may originate outside of the animation system itself. Elements such as characters, objects, backgrounds, behaviors of characters or objects, spoken language segments, titles or credits, sounds, music and so on may be imported and placed in scenes.
- users of an animation system may share custom controls for the system, such as custom scene mood labels, scene transition labels, system-specific character or object behaviors, etc.
- Elements may be imported (or exported) by way of file transfer protocols, email of files, accessing a warehouse of elements, and so on.
- a warehouse of elements provides a searchable database of objects that may be downloaded, some for free, others for a fee.
- elements are provided with tags that indicate keywords, features, and other data, which allow for efficient categorizing and searching of elements.
- Some elements are sprite-like, and are simply rendered into a scene. Other elements are more dynamic, and have behaviors that are imported with the element and added to the content creator's palette of characters, objects, and backgrounds.
- FIG. 9 illustrates a hardware arrangement 150 enabling sharing of elements, scenes, clips, etc.
- System 150 comprises an elements memory 152 and database index 154 .
- Server 156 is communicatively coupled to both elements memory 152 and database index 154 .
- Server 156 may be accessed by local area network, wide area network, the Internet, etc., by one or more of a number of user computers 160 a , 160 b , 160 c , who may search and request downloading of elements, scenes, clips, etc., and who may also upload to elements memory 152 elements, scenes, clips, etc.
- FIG. 10 illustrates the steps of one embodiment 200 for sharing such elements, scenes, clips, etc.
- Embodiment 200 first comprises receiving a plurality of video elements for storage in an element memory 152 ( FIG. 9 ).
- Each video element has a content tag associated therewith that identifies the general content of the video element.
- Each video element may also have associated therewith a price tag indicating the price associated with downloading and using the video element, as well as an intellectual property (IP) rights tag identifying a statement of intellectual property rights limitations on use of the video element.
- IP intellectual property
- intellectual property refers not only to patents, copyrights, industrial design rights, and trademarks, but also contractual and license rights, and any other rights according to which use limitations, attribution, and/or direct or indirect compensation for use may be associated.
- a search of all tags is input at step 202 , and a search of index 154 ( FIG. 9 ) is performed at step 204 , permitting identification of a desired video element by tag. If no element is found at step 206 , an appropriate message such as “no scenes were found” is returned to the requester at step 208 . If an element is found, it is retrieved at step 210 . The price for downloading the element, if any, is determined at step 212 from said price tag associated with the video element. If the scene may be used free of charge, the scene may be provided to the requester at step 214 , where it is added to the appropriate palette of characters, objects, backgrounds, labels, text, sound etc.
- an optional additional limitation of an IP rights agreement at step 216 is performed prior to downloading the element to the user. If a fee is required, the requester is alerted at step 218 . If the fee is successfully collected at step 220 the scene may be provided to the requester at step 214 , subject to the optional IP rights agreement at step 216 . If the amount is not collected, the process stops or restarts so the requester can search for a different element.
- Element may be tagged with an indication of the form of license or other IP rights associated with that element.
- a statement may then be provided to the requester that the use of the element is subject to agreement to be bound to the IP rights statement associated with that element. The element is then delivered for use only if agreement to be so bound is received.
- step 224 it is possible to track, whether by tag, index, or otherwise, when and how much compensation to a submitter of an element is due for the downloading of that element, as shown at step 224 .
- the system may automatically initiate a method that results in appropriate payment to the submitter.
- characters, objects, and backgrounds may each carry an identifying URL and/or a link, similar to a hypertext link. This facilitates following a link to the characters, objects, and backgrounds, within the system, such as scene or clip navigation.
- a user may click on a character, object or background and be taken to a web page which provides metadata such as the “name”, history, ethnicity, “age”, cost to use, likes and dislikes, and other attributes of the character, object or background.
- metadata such as the “name”, history, ethnicity, “age”, cost to use, likes and dislikes, and other attributes of the character, object or background.
- a character represents an historical figure (such as Abraham Lincoln, 302 (which may for example be indicated as a linked element by the underlining 308 when the cursor hovers over the character)
- clicking the character may take the user to an on-line dictionary or Wikipedia entry, Google search, etc., about that figure.
- the character is speaking text, it can be possible to stop the clip and link by clicking on the character to an image or text file of the complete text (such as for a famous speech, class lecture notes, etc.).
- the user may click on the character 302 , an object 304 or a background 306 and be taken to a web page with similar additional characters, objects, and backgrounds, such as from the same creator or publisher.
- These links may be accessible during the authoring process, or may be accessible in the final scene or clip (as shown in FIG. 11 ).
- a character, object or background in an animated scene may be associated with a question (such as question 310 ), and the link associated with an answer to that question.
- An educational tool e.g., vocabulary, foreign language, history, math, etc. lesson or test
- game e.g., treasure hunt, hidden object, etc.
- other interactive animation may thereby be provided.
- elements of a scene may be tagged, for example using an interface 350 shown in FIG. 12 .
- the user interface 350 allows associating a number of different tags with a character, object or background, allowing for organizing, filtering, sharing, searching, and other meta-level manipulation of elements.
- a scene or clip may be augmented with data linked to the tag, for example using an interface 360 shown in FIG. 13 .
- Tags may link to a creator's comments about a scene 362 , similar to the “director's cut” found on certain digital video disk (DVD) versions of feature films. These comments may be text, audio 364 , links 366 to additional content (such as alternative scenes, characters, objects, backgrounds, etc.).
- the tags may be provided at a point in time in a scene inviting comments from a viewer, which may be appended to the tag or otherwise associated with the tagged point in time of the scene.
- Such comments may provide data to the creator to assist with the creation or distribution process (e.g., comments on quality, accuracy of setting, translation, objects, etc.)
- the tags may also be used to identify like portions of scenes, for example to determine common features of the scenes. For example, scenes tagged as “historical” might be collected using the tags. The collected scenes can then be treated as a group, for example analyzing the group of scenes to determine which elements the scenes have in common that may render the scene historical.
- a map or graph may be produced and used to visualize the moods or the like of various characters over the course of a scene or clip.
- a map 400 is shown. Along one axis is time. Along the other is a list of the characters (or even objects) in the scenes or clip of interest. Labels applied to the characters may be shown in the graph to illustrate moods in terms of time and to compare the moods of one character at a point in time with that of another character at that same point in time. While a simple key 402 is used in FIG.
- Labels may also be applied or changed in the map interface, for example by dragging the transition point between two moods from one location to another, by dragging and dropping labels onto the timeline for a character, etc. Inferences for how characters might act or react can be derived from the map, such as rebuffing of a romantic overture, laughing at what a character says or does, and so on. This may assist the creator in developing a scene script, and may in fact be the basis for automated animation of elements of a scene or clip.
- examples of applications include: entertainment (e.g., free/feature length, long/short formats); education (e.g., use in school, for children, use by children, for assignments, etc.); safety, industrial, training; modeling (e.g., construction, mechanical design, user interface); medical; legal (e.g., courtroom animated exhibits and reenactments); journalism; (living news feeds, periodicals); reference (e.g., product use guides, kiosks, interactive maps, animated on-line help desk with voice-to-voice hiding regionality of help desk; transportation (e.g., remote/pilotless operation), retail (e.g., on-line store fronts), advertising, etc.
- entertainment e.g., free/feature length, long/short formats
- education e.g., use in school, for children, use by children, for assignments, etc.
- safety industrial, training
- modeling e.g., construction, mechanical design, user interface
- medical e.g., courtroom animated exhibits and reenactments
- the systems and methods disclosed herein form the basis of an on-line animated help center product, which renders a live remote assistant as an animated video character.
- the system includes an interface for permitting a user, who may have a first regional dialect, to interact with the live remote assistant who has a second regional dialect that is different from said first regional dialect.
- An interface is provided for receiving an inquiry from the user and providing the inquiry to the remote assistant.
- An interface is also provided permitting the remote assistant to provide a response to the inquiry.
- the system accesses a database of prerecorded response phrases, each prerecorded response phrase having associated therewith specific language attributes extracted from a response voiced in the first regional dialect.
- An analyzer analyzes the response and determines whether the remote assistant's response matches a prerecorded response phrase in the database, and if so, it retrieves the specific language attributes extracted from the response voiced in the first regional dialect.
- a converter converts the assistant's response to text format, and a speech-synthesizer converts the text-formatted assistant's response into a speech-synthesized spoken language segment voiced in the first regional dialect.
- a modifier circuit modifies the speech-synthesized spoken language segment with the specific language attributes extracted from the response voiced in the first regional dialect.
- the speech-synthesized spoken language segment modified with the specific language attributes is associated with the animated character to simulate the animated character speaking the speech-synthesized spoken language segment.
- the animated character speaking the speech-synthesized spoken language segment is provided as a time-appropriate response to the user's inquiry.
- the final content created with the above system and methods is rendered as a digital data file in one of a variety of video formats.
- the digital data file may be played by an appropriate viewer such as Windows media player, may be posted to a sharing site such as YouTube, may be directly send to others such as by email, may be added to a user's website or blog for viewing through a browser interface, etc.
