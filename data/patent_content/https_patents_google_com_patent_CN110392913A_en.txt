Description
Cross reference to related applications
This application claims entitled " being called using voice control processing personal call " for submitting on May 16th, 2017
U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.62/506,805 priority are open to be incorporated herein by reference of text.
Technical field
This specification relates generally to natural-sounding processing.
Background technique
The device for enabling voice can execute movement in response to the language said from user.For example, user it may be said that
" OK computer, today can rain? ", and the device for enabling voice can respond " all day all will be fine day " with hearing.It uses
The device for enabling voice is had an advantage that, can generally discharge both hands with the device interaction for enabling voice.For example, when user mentions
When ging wrong, the device for enabling voice can provide the hand and anything object that the answer that can be heard uses them without user
Reason interaction.However, the device for commonly enabling voice is limited to the type of interaction supported.
Summary of the invention
The device for enabling voice can be used for dialing audio call.For example, John Doe is it may be said that " OK computer, calling
(555) 555-5555 ", so as to enable the device of voice to telephone number (555) 555-5555 place calls.Typically, it breathes out
It calls associated with can be used for identifying the caller number of caller.For example, when John Doe uses his call
(555) when 555-5555, the phone for receiving calling can indicate to call from phone number associated with the phone of John Doe
Code.
Caller number associated with calling can be it is useful because calling recipient caller ID number can be used
Code also uses caller number to decide whether to response calling if they need to dial callback.However, being different from
Conventional phone, some devices for enabling voices may not with the telephone number phase that can be used as the caller number for calling
Association.
In order to provide caller number in place calls, the device for enabling voice can attempt individual using speaker
Voice number is as caller number.Personal voice number can be for the number to user's place calls.For example, working as John
Say " OK computer, call (555) 555-5555 " when, enable voice device can be used John Doe phone phone number
Code (555) 999-9999 is as caller number.If the device for enabling voice not can determine that the personal voice number of speaker,
The device for then enabling voice can replace the anonymous place calls in ground so that calling not with the voice number that can be used for dialing callback
It is associated.For example, such calling can indicate " unknown number " or " personal number " as caller number.
In some instances, if it is to emergency service call, then temporary number place calls can be used, make recipient
It can be used for the device that callback enables voice.For example, such calling can indicate telephone number (555) 888-8888, it can
For dialing callback to the device for enabling voice within following several hours.
Additionally or alternatively, the identity of the speaker voice number to be called with determination can be used in the device for enabling voice
Code.For example, the device for enabling voice can identify or otherwise identify when John says " OK computer calls father "
Then John accesses the contact person record of John with the telephone number of determination " father ".In another example, when Jane is said
When " OK computer, call to father ", the device for enabling voice can be by speech recognition or other verification techniques by Jane and John
It distinguishes, and accesses the contact person record of Jane later with the telephone number of determination " father ".In yet another example, work as visitor
When saying " OK computer calls father ", the device for enabling voice will not be identified visitor by voice (or other verification techniques), and
And the contact person record of any user can not be accessed to determine the telephone number of " father ".Therefore, such as in these three examples
As it can be seen that " OK computer calls father " can have Different Results based on the identity of speaker.
Additionally or alternatively, during dialing audio call by the device of enabling voice, the device for enabling voice can be with
Language from the user is made a response.For example, during the call, enable voice device can to " OK computer, hang up ",
The order of " OK computer improves speaker volume ", " OK computer, today, how is weather " responds.In response in voice
At least part of sounding can be stopped to open by the language during calling, the device for enabling voice with recipient.For example, when user says
When " OK computer improves speaker volume ", the device for enabling voice can be improved speaker volume and stop " to improve loudspeaking
Device volume ", so that recipient is only hearing " OK computer ".In another example, the device for enabling voice can have to connecing
Receipts person provides the waiting time of audio, so the entire language person of being received can be stopped to listen when language starts from " OK computer "
See.
Therefore, in some implementations, advantage can be, and the device of the enabling voice shared by multiple users still makes
User can place calls, and the number as call number presented on the phone of recipient is made to be the movement of user
The voice number of computing device.Since people will not usually answer the calling from unidentified number, this can increase use
Enable a possibility that device call placed of voice is by response.In addition, because the called people that is positive may have been based on and use
The associated voice number in family use and know who is being called, therefore call can be more efficient.Meanwhile safety can be provided
Property, be to use the voice number to match with the voice of speaker due to the device for enabling voice, thus user can not so that
With the voice number of any other user in the device for enabling voice.
Another advantage in some implementations can be, allow to the contact person's on the device for enabling voice
Using place calls more quickly can be enabled a user to, because user can quickly say the name of contact person rather than say
The number of voice number out.The device for enabling voice can also eliminate the ambiguity of the contact person between multiple users.For example, different
The possibility of user has the corresponding contacts entries of same names " mother ", they are associated from different telephone numbers.May be used also
To provide safety, it is that the contact person used in the device for enabling voice ensures is matched with the voice of speaker
Contact person, thus user cannot use enable voice device in other users contact person.
Another advantage in some implementations can be, and permission is handled inquiry during audio call can
So that calling can have the experience of preferably liberation both hands.For example, in response to auto attendant request call person with specific
Number is keyed in respond, and user can virtually press number.Safety can also be provided, so that dialling when handling inquiry
Two-way waiting is played, and once solves inquiry and ends automatically.Additionally, two-way waiting may insure for from enabling voice
The response of the inquiry of virtual assistant will not be smudgy by the sound from other people.For example, in the feelings of no two-way waiting
Under condition, other people can speak while response of the output from the virtual assistant for enabling voice.

Transcription " the calling shop X " determines that text " the calling shop X " corresponds to the movement of place calls, and the telephone number in the shop X is
(555) 999-9999, and " mother " indicated should be by her VoIP account with the caller ID number of (555) 111-1111
Code dials her calling.Then server can send " calling (555) 999-9999 with VoIP account (555) 111-1111 "
Instruct the device 125 for enabling voice.In other implementations, the device 125 for enabling voice can be independently of remote service
Device act as described in remote server.
In some implementations, the device 125 for enabling voice can be based on other than audio-frequency information and visual information
Other information come language of classifying.Specifically, the device 125 for enabling voice can be based on speaker identification feature and from testing
The confirmation of the user of the identity of the user to speak is demonstrate,proved come language of classifying.Additionally, the device 125 for enabling voice can be based on speaking
The confirmation of the user of the received image of at least part of one or more of person and the identity of user spoken from verifying divides
Class language.For example, as mentioned above, the device 125 for enabling voice can receive one or more from the user to speak
A language.The device 125 for enabling voice can determine: the speaker identification feature in one or more received language is abundant
The speaker identification feature stored of " OK computer " is said in matching known users " father ".In response, the dress of voice is enabled
Set 125 can by put question to user " being that father is speaking? " confirm that the user that speaks is the judgement of " father ".Speaker can lead to
Answer "Yes" or "no" are crossed to respond, to verify the confirmation for the device 125 for enabling voice.If speaker answers " no
Be ", then the device 125 for enabling voice can ask additional problem, such as " what the name of speaker is? ", to determine name
Whether matching enables the known users name that is stored in the device 125 of voice.
Fig. 2 is the exemplary flow chart for illustrating the process 200 of place calls.It can be by the system 100 of such as Figure 1A -1D
One or more computing systems carry out the operation of process 200.Process 200 includes to receive language (210).For example, enabling voice
Device 125 can receive " OK computer, the language of calling (555) 999-9999 ".
Process 200 comprises determining whether call emergency services (212).For example, the device 125 for enabling voice can be determined and be exhaled
Code of calling out the numbers is not call emergency services, because (555) 999-9999 is not associated with any emergency services.In another example
In, the device 125 for enabling voice can determine that call number " 911 " is call emergency services, because 911 is related to emergency services
Connection.
If what process 200 determined calling is emergency services, process 200 includes to initiate calling with temporary number (214).
For example, the device 125 for enabling voice can be generated with request call supplier and twenty four hours can be used to the dress for enabling voice
The telephone number cried is put back into, and then initiates call emergency services, shows temporary number as caller number.
If what process 200 determined calling is not emergency services, process 200 include determine language speaker whether be
Known users (216).For example, the device 125 for enabling voice can be in response to being classified as known users " Matt " for speaker, really
It is fixed that " speaker of OK computer, calling (555) 999-9999 " is known users.In another example, the dress of voice is enabled
Setting 125 can determine that speaker is known users in response to speaker is classified as known users " father ".In another example
In, the device 125 for enabling voice can determine that speaker is not known users in response to speaker is classified as Guest User.
In some implementations, it includes to determine that the voice in language is that whether the speaker for determining language, which is known users,
It is no to match with voice that is corresponding to specific known users.For example, enabling the device 125 of voice can determine that speaker says " OK
How the mode of computer " says that " OK computer " matches with known users " Matt ", and in response, speaker is classified
For known users " Matt ".In another example, the device 125 for enabling voice can determine that speaker says " OK computer "
How mode says that " OK computer " matches with known users " father ", and in response, speaker is classified as known use
Family " father ".Additionally or alternatively, it includes to determine at least portion of speaker that whether the speaker for determining language, which is known users,
Whether the visual pattern divided matches with the visual information for corresponding to specific known users.
If process 200 determines that the speaker of language is known users, process 200 include determine known users whether with
Personal voice number is associated (218).For example, the device 125 for enabling voice can determine that known users " Matt " has account
Information, the calling that account information instruction known users are wanted to use in 125 place calls of device by enabling voice mention
Donor, and in response, determine that known users are associated with personal telephone number.In another example, the device of voice is enabled
125 can determine known users " father " without account information, and account information instruction known users are wanted by enabling language
The calling supplier used when 125 place calls of device of sound, and in response, determine that known users are not associated with personal electricity
Talk about number.
If process 200 determines that known users are associated with personal voice number, process 200 includes with personal voice number
Code initiates calling (220).For example, the calling as indicated by the account information of " Matt " can be contacted by enabling the device 125 of voice
Supplier, and request to be " Matt " to telephone number (555) 999-9999 place calls.
218 are returned to, if process 200 determines that known users are not associated with personal voice number, process includes hair
It rises anonymity call (222).For example, the device 125 for enabling voice can be dialed to (555) 999-9999 with request call supplier and be hidden
Name calling.
216 are returned to, if process 200 determines that the speaker of language is not known users, process 200 includes to initiate anonymity
It calls (222), as described above 222.
Although determining whether that call emergency services (212) are shown in process 200 first, process 200 be can be not
With.For example, process 200 determines that speaker is known users as described above first with can replace in (216), then as above
It is described to determine that known users are associated with individual's voice number in (218), and determined in (212) as described above
Calling is emergency services, and then uses the personal voice number of known users.
The personal voice number of known users is provided to urgent respondent, rather than the device 125 of enabling voice is interim
One reason of number, be no matter known users whether near the device 125 for enabling voice urgent respondent can join
It is known users.
Fig. 3 is the exemplary flow chart for illustrating the process 300 of the determination voice number to be called.It can be by such as Figure 1A-
One or more computing systems of the system 100 of 1D carry out the operation of process 300.
Process 300 includes the language (310) for receiving request call.For example, the device 125 for enabling voice can receive user
110 language, to request the language of such as " OK computer calls grandmother ".
Process 300 includes to determine whether the speaker of language is known users (312).For example, enabling the device 125 of voice
Speaker can be classified as to known users " mother ".
If process 300 determines that the speaker of language is known users, process 300 includes to determine the individual of known users
Whether contact person is available (314).For example, enabling the device 125 of voice can have been visited based on the device 125 for enabling voice is determined
It asks the contact person record of known users " mother ", and determines the personal contact person of known users " mother " and be available.Known use
Phone contacts' entry that the personal contact person at family can refer to for known users creation.For example, as it is known that user can be by such as
Phone contacts' entry of lower creation known users: the interface for creating new phone contacts' entry is opened, telephone number is keyed in
" (123) 456-7890 " and name of contact person " John Doe ", and then select to create the surname for being marked with " John Doe "
The telephone item of name and instruction telephone number " (123) 456-7890 ".It can be by all personal contact person of known users come shape
At the contacts list of known users.For example, as it is known that the contacts list of user may include contact person's item of " John Doe "
Mesh and other contacts entries created by known users.
If process 300 determines that personal contact person is available known users, process 300 includes using personal connection
People determines number (316) associated with recipient.For example, enabling the device 125 of voice from the connection of known users " mother "
Personal contacts list is scanned to recipient " grandmother " in people's record, and fetches number associated with " grandmother ".
314 are returned to, if process 300 instead determines that the personal contact person of known users is unavailable, process 300 includes
Recipient's number (318) are determined in the case where personal contact person not associated with known users.For example, enabling voice
Device 125 can be in internet hunt recipient's number.In this example, the device 125 for enabling voice can be searched in internet
Rope using geo-location service may multiple recipient's numbers corresponding to " grandmother " near known users, be unable to
It identifies recipient's number, and provides speech message to known users to illustrate " not finding contact number ".If not yet
Recipient's number is found, then the device 125 for enabling voice can promote speaker to say the voice number to be called and then exhale
It is the number.
312 are returned to, if process 300 instead determines that the speaker of language is not known users, process 300 includes such as
Recipient's number (318) are determined in the case where no personal contact person described in upper.
Fig. 4 is to illustrate the exemplary block diagram interacted during the call with the device for enabling voice.4, which illustrate the stage (A), arrives
(C) various operations, can in the sequence of instruction or another sequence carry out.
In some implementations, enable voice device 125 can in response to detect comprising such as hot word make a reservation for it is short
The language of language is acted, and user says the predetermined phrase during the call to call the device 125 for enabling voice.For example, Fig. 4
The reception of device 125 generation " OK computer calls the shop X " for enabling voice is illustrated, speaker is classified as known speak
Person " Matt ", and with the telephone number stored of " Matt " to the shop X place calls.Additionally, speaker " Matt " In
Recipient do not answer calling during to enable voice 125 communications command of device.In response to the order during call, enable
At least part of language can be stopped to open by the device 125 of voice with recipient.
During the stage (A), the device 125 for enabling voice receives language 120 " OK computer calls the shop X ".In response to
Language 120 is received, speaker is classified as known speaker using one of aforementioned method by the device 125 for enabling voice
" Matt ", and the response for stating " with your shop number call X " is returned to " Matt ".Response instruction to user 110: it opens
Pass through classification speaker with the device 125 of voice, take movement associated with order and use is associated with " Matt "
Number and understand language.During the stage (B), the device 125 for enabling voice initiates to exhale to the recipient 155 in such as shop X

In some implementations, secondary server 502 obtains request 516.For example, the device 125 for enabling voice can be with
Data are sent, which includes the searching request indicated from the audio representation of the received language of user 110.Data can indicate institute
The known speaker " Matt " of identification, the audio representation " OK computer calls the shop X " 120 of language, with the device for enabling voice
125 associated unique ID, and personal result position associated with known speaker " Matt " identified.With enabling voice
The associated unique ID of device 125 indicate secondary server 502 to where sending response.For example, unique ID can be and open
With the associated IP address of device 125, URL or the MAC Address of voice.
In some implementations, secondary server 502 handles request 516 obtained.Specifically, secondary server
502 parsings request 516 obtained, to determine order associated with language.For example, secondary server 502 can pass through by
The audio representation of language is converted to the text representation of language to handle request 516 obtained.In response to conversion, secondary server
The text representation " the calling shop X " of the 502 parsing subsequent orders of hot word.In some implementations, secondary server 502 determines
Movement associated with Text Command.For example, secondary server 502 by text is acted " calling " and storage text act into
Row relatively determines that the movement from request 516 obtained is " the calling shop X ".
Additionally, secondary server 502 solves the number in recipient " shop X " by access contact database 504.In
In some implementations, secondary server 502 accesses contact database 504 to fetch contact associated with known users
People.Storing contact and indexing contact person by known users name associated with contact person of contact database 504.
For example, contact database 504 includes the entry of " Matt ", personal contact person associated with " Matt " is further included.
Personal contact person includes name and associated number, such as " mother "-(555) 111-1111, " father "-(555) 222-
2222 and " shop X "-(555) 333-3333.
Additionally, when the personal result position received in request 516 obtained is activated, secondary server 502
The number of recipient can only be solved.If personal result position is not activated or is " 0 ", secondary server 502 disappears in movement
Identifier is sent in breath 518 to indicate that the device 125 for enabling voice relays statement to user 110 and " computer access please be allow
The message of people contact person ".If personal result position is activated or is " 1 ", the access of secondary server 502 is identified known
The contact database 504 of the personal contact person of speaker.In some implementations, secondary server 502 is being identified
Number associated with recipient is fetched in the personal contact person of known speaker.In this example, secondary server 502 is fetched
Number (555) 333-3333 in the shop X.In other implementations, the number of recipient may be embodied in the life after hot word
In the expression herein enabled.For example, order may include, " OK computer calls 555-333-3333 ".
In some implementations, secondary server 502 can identify request obtained in contact database 504
The recipient not found in the personal contact person of the known speaker identified in 516.For example, secondary server 502 can be with
The text representation for determining the order after the hot word from request 516 obtained includes " calling grandmother ".However, from
Personal contact person in " Matt " associated contact database 504 does not include the entry of " grandmother ".Conversely, contact person includes
" mother ", " father " and " shop X ".In order to solve the number of recipient " grandmother ", secondary server 502 may search for other numbers
The number of " grandmother " is found according to library and/or internet.
When searching for other databases and/or internet, secondary server 502 can be searched in knowledge graph.For example, auxiliary
Help server 502 possibly " X corporate client service " can not match with any record in the personal contact person of user, then
Search has the entity of name " X corporate client service " on knowledge graph, and identifies what the entity was stored in knowledge graph
Telephone number.
In some implementations, order may include calling geographically close to the business for the device 125 for enabling voice.It is auxiliary
Help server 502 that can search for voice number associated with the closest business of device 125 for enabling voice on the internet.
However, if secondary server 502 does not find the associated number of recipient with request, secondary server 502 can be with
Identifier is sent in action message 518 to indicate that the device 125 for enabling voice relays statement to user 110 and " not find connection
Be people " message.For example, if failing to find the telephone number in " shop X " in personal contact person record or knowledge graph, it is auxiliary
Help server 502 that can search for the local business near the title with " shop X " in map data base.
In some implementations, secondary server 502 can determine to include that number in order can be and not support
Voice number.For example, number can only include 7 digits, such as 123-4567.In response, secondary server 502 can be
Identifier is sent in action message 518, states that " telephone number does not prop up to indicate that the device 125 for enabling voice relays user 110
Hold " message.
In response to determining contact number associated with recipient, secondary server 502, which generates to go to, enables voice
The action message 518 of device 125.Specifically, action message 518 may include the movement of contact number and triggering calling.Example
Such as, action message 518 may include the telephone number in " shop X " of 555-333-3333 and the device of instruction enabling voice
125 call the movement in " shop X " immediately.In some implementations, secondary server 502 can be existed based on the context of order
It include outgoing call to be used in action message 518.For example, if order includes call emergency services, secondary server
502 can be used for the device 125 in special time period callback enabling voice comprising recipient 155 in action message 518
Number.It dials for example, telephone number (555) 888-8888 can be used for following several hours to the device 125 for enabling voice
Callback.
In some implementations, the device 125 for enabling voice obtains action message 518 from secondary server 502.Response
In obtaining action message 518, the device 125 for enabling voice takes action to action message 518.For example, action message instruction is opened
" shop X " is called using indicated telephone number 555-333-3333 with the device 125 of voice.
In some implementations, the device 125 for enabling voice can use voice server based on the preference of user 110
506 or associated client terminal device 510 call the recipient specified by secondary server 502.Specifically, user 110
Preference can be stored in the device 125 for enabling voice.For example, enabling the device 125 of voice can determine that user's 110 is inclined
It is using voice server 506 or ip voice (VoIP), to carry out any outgoing call well.In this way, enabling the device 125 of voice
Voice server 506 is sent an indication to call recipient.In some implementations, voice server 506 can be to exhaling
Calling uses associated number out.In some implementations, the device 125 for enabling voice can be enabled a user to from more
Selection uses VoIP supplier in a difference VoIP supplier, and the VoIP is then used when user initiates the calling in future
Supplier.
In some implementations, in response to determining that user 110 near the device 125 for enabling voice, enables voice
Number associated with voice server 506 can be used for call emergency services by device 125.For example, will be objective in response to determination
One of family end device 510 is connected to the device 125 for enabling voice, and the device 125 for enabling voice can be used and voice server
506 associated number call emergency services.By ensuring the company between client terminal device 510 and the device 125 for enabling voice
It connects, the device 125 for enabling voice may insure user 110 near the device 125 for enabling voice.
Alternatively, the device 125 for enabling voice can determine that the secondary preference of user 110 is by existing client terminal device
510 for dialing outgoing call to recipient.If enable voice device 125 determine user 110 secondary preference be using
Associated client terminal device 510 carrys out call recipient, then verifying is gone to client terminal device 510 by the device 125 for enabling voice
