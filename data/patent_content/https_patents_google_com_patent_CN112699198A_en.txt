Abstract
The present application relates to methods, systems, and storage media for generating a textual summary regarding a physical location. Methods and apparatus for determining aspects of location based on computing interactions of users related to the location. In some implementations, an aspect of a location may be determined based on comparing a first computed interaction metric for the location to a second metric. The first computational interaction metric may be determined based on a first set of computational interactions related to the location. In some implementations, the second metric may be determined based on a second group of interactions that includes additional interactions in addition to the interactions of the first group. In some implementations, a text summary can be automatically generated based on the first and/or second calculated interaction metrics and/or based on the determined aspect.
Description
Description of the cases
The application belongs to divisional application of Chinese patent application 201580035895.5 with application date of 2015, 7, month and 15.
Technical Field
The present application relates to methods, systems, and storage media for generating a textual summary regarding a physical location.
Background
Aspects of a physical location, such as a business, may be determined from internet documents relating to the physical location and/or explicit input from individuals relating to the physical location. For example, web pages related to a business may be analyzed to identify categories of the business, locations of the business, and so on. As another example, reviews submitted by users relating to businesses may be analyzed to determine an overall ranking of the businesses. As yet another example, the owner or another user of the enterprise may manually enter information into a service that maintains the enterprise information, such that the enterprise information is reflected by the service. For example, the owner may type in addresses, business hours, web pages, and other information related to the business. However, reliance solely on these aspects may have one or more disadvantages. For example, these aspects may not be available in many physical locations, may contain significant deviations, may be outdated, may not be based on reliable data, and/or may not include certain unique aspects.
Disclosure of Invention
The present application is generally directed to technical features for determining aspects of, and/or generating textual summaries about, a physical location (such as a business) through a user's computing interactions related to the physical location based on aggregation and analysis. In some implementations, the computational interactions related to the physical location by the user that may be utilized to determine aspects of the physical location include, for example, direction queries to find directions to the location (e.g., driving, walking, and/or public transportation directions), location-related searches (e.g., map-based searches and/or searches for internet documents), location data from the mobile device (e.g., based on GPS, Wi-Fi, and/or other sensors), location-related calendar entries, photos or other media items of the user having metadata related to the location (e.g., a geo-tag of the media item), check-ins to the location, comments on the location, and/or the location is marked with an asterisk or otherwise indicated with a flag on a map and/or other interface. The determined aspect of the physical location may be assigned to the physical location and stored as the assigned aspect of the physical location in one or more databases. The generated text summary may be presented to the user in various ways.
The one or more determined aspects assigned to the physical location may be used for various online services. For example, the determined aspects of the business may be included in a textual summary for display in conjunction with other information related to the business. Additionally, for example, the determined facet of the enterprise may be utilized to identify an identity of the enterprise in response to the user selection indicating the facet and provide the identity of the enterprise to the user. For example, a user selection of "restaurant in ascending trend near me" may be utilized to identify restaurants in the user's vicinity that are associated with the aspect of "in ascending trend". Additionally, for example, the determined aspects of the business may be utilized to rank information related to businesses identified as responses to a user's query or other request for information. For example, information related to a business may be promoted if the business is associated with a determined aspect of "being trending upward". Additionally, for example, a query may include one or more terms such as "popular with local people," and a business may be associated with a relevant facet indicating popular with local people, such that information related to the business may be ranked in search results provided in response to the query.
Determining aspects of a physical location and/or generating a textual summary about the physical location and utilizing these aspects and/or textual summaries in identifying and/or ranking information related to the physical location in response to a query yields various technical advantages. For example, in some implementations, identifying information related to a physical location based on a determined aspect increases the likelihood that information related to the physical location is provided in response to a query related to the aspect, thereby improving the accuracy of information identified as relevant to the query. Additionally, ranking the information related to the physical location based on the determined aspect increases a likelihood that the information related to the physical location is provided with an appropriate prominence, for example, thereby increasing a likelihood that the information will be consumed in response to the query. Identifying and/or ranking such information based on the determined aspects may reduce the likelihood that further searches will be needed to identify the information, thereby preventing consumption of network and computer resources in response to such subsequent queries. Further, the generated textual summary, which may be provided to the computing device for display to the user, may provide useful information regarding the physical location, thereby eliminating the need for the user to utilize resources of the computing device and/or network communication resources to perform further searches for useful information incorporated into the generated textual summary.
In some implementations, a first computational interaction metric for a physical location may be determined based on a first set of computational interactions associated with the location. For example, a first computational interaction metric may be determined for a location that indicates a quantity of computational interactions, and/or a duration of computational interactions with the location as indicated by a first set of computational interactions. The computed interaction metric may be compared to the second metric to determine an aspect of the location and/or to generate a textual summary about the location.
In some embodiments, the second metric may include one or more static or dynamic thresholds. For example, the first computed interaction metric may indicate a duration of interaction with the location and the second metric may be a static threshold duration. If the first computed interaction metric fails to meet the threshold duration, the aspect may indicate a "fast stop" business (e.g., a fast-food restaurant), while if it meets the threshold duration, the aspect may indicate a "long stop" business (e.g., a long-seated restaurant).
In some implementations, the second measure may additionally or alternatively include an additional computed interaction measure based on a second set of computing interactions other than the first set of computing interactions utilized to determine the first computed interaction measure. For example, the second set may include computing interactions associated with physical locations that are temporally different from the computing interactions of the first set. For example, the first computed interaction metric may indicate an amount of interaction with the location during one or more first time periods and the second metric may indicate an amount of interaction with the location during one or more second time periods. Additionally, for example, the second group may include computing interactions associated with one or more additional physical locations in addition to the location. For example, the first computing interaction may indicate a quantity of interactions with a location and the second metric may indicate a quantity of interactions with one or more locations (e.g., "peer groups" of physical locations) similar to the location. Additional descriptions of example aspects that may be determined and example techniques for determining such aspects are provided herein.
In some embodiments, there is provided a method comprising: a group of computing interactions is identified from the one or more databases based on the computing interactions of the group related to the physical location.

The aspect may indicate a difference in the amount of interaction and the second amount of interaction. The second time period may be a range of dates earlier in time than the first time period, and the aspect may indicate a positive trend when the difference indicates an increase that meets the threshold. The second time period may be a range of dates that are earlier in time than the first time period, and the aspect indicates a newly opened business when the difference satisfies a newly opened business threshold. The second time period may be a range of dates earlier in time than the first time period, and the aspect may indicate a closed business when the difference indicates a decrease in the closed business threshold is met. The first time period may be a first time range spanning multiple dates and the second time period may be a second time range spanning multiple dates, and the aspect may indicate a degree of awareness of the physical location during the first time range. The first time range and the second time range may each be one of: one or more segments of a day and one or more days of a week.
The first computational interaction metric may indicate a measure of repeated interactions with the physical location as indicated by the computational interactions of the group and the second computational interaction metric may indicate repeated interactions with the additional physical location as indicated by the additional computational interactions of the second group. The aspect may indicate customer loyalty. The step of determining a first calculated interaction metric may comprise: determining a measure of repetitive interaction based on determining a frequency of each of the one or more quantities of repetitive interaction; and determining a first computed interaction metric based on the metrics of the repeated interactions.

Detailed Description
FIG. 1 illustrates an example environment in which aspects of a physical location (also referred to herein simply as a "location") can be determined and/or a textual summary can be generated based on computing interactions (also referred to herein as "interactions") related to and/or associated with the physical location. The example environment includes a client device 105, an aspect determination system 120, and an information system 140. The aspect determination system 120 may be implemented in one or more computers that communicate, for example, over a network (not depicted). The aspect determination system 120 is an example of a system in which the systems, components, and techniques described herein may be implemented and/or interfaced with.
The client device 105, the aspect determination system 120, and the information system 140 each include one or more memories for storing data and software applications, one or more processors for accessing data and executing applications, and other components that facilitate communication over a network. The operations performed by the aspect determination system 120 and/or the information system 140 may be distributed across multiple computer systems.
The client device 105 may be a computer coupled to the aspect determination system 120, the information system 140, and/or other components (e.g., the interaction database 152 and/or components that manage the interaction database 152) over one or more networks 101, such as a Local Area Network (LAN) or a Wide Area Network (WAN) such as the internet. The client device 105 may be, for example, a desktop computing device, a laptop computing device, a tablet computing device, a mobile phone computing device, a computing device of a user's vehicle (e.g., an in-vehicle communication system, an in-vehicle entertainment system, an in-vehicle navigation system), or a wearable apparatus of a user that includes a computing device (e.g., a watch of a user with a computing device, glasses of a user with a computing device). Additional and/or alternative client devices may be provided.
As described herein, in determining aspects of physical location, the aspect determination system 120 may utilize interactions from the interaction database 152 that indicate computational interactions related to the physical location by the user. One or more of these computing interactions may be indicative of a user's activity via a computing device, such as client device 105. For the sake of brevity, only a single client device 105 is illustrated in fig. 1 and described in some examples herein. However, the activities of multiple users via multiple client devices may be utilized in determining aspects of physical location. Moreover, while a user will likely be operating multiple computing devices, and aspects of the physical location may be determined based on actions of the user via the multiple computing devices, for the sake of brevity, particular examples described in this disclosure will focus on the user operating client device 105.
Client device 105 may operate one or more applications and/or components, such as those that facilitate user selection and/or input that may indicate computing interaction related to a physical location, those that provide location data that may indicate user interaction related to a physical location, and/or those that facilitate providing search results, suggestions, and/or other information related to a physical location based on output of information system 140. These applications and/or components may include, but are not limited to, a browser 106, a location coordinate component, such as a global positioning system ("GPS") component 108 (other location coordinate techniques such as cellular or Wi-Fi based triangulation may be used), a mapping application 110 (e.g., to obtain driving directions to or from the location), and so forth. In some instances, one or more of these applications and/or components may be operated on multiple client devices operated by a user. Other components of the client device 105 that may provide an indication of user interaction with a physical location, not depicted in fig. 1, may include, but are not limited to, a calendar application (e.g., based on an entry identifying the location), a phone application (e.g., based on a call to or from a number associated with the location), an email (e.g., based on an email receipt from the location, an email save for the location), a social network application (e.g., based on a post related to the location, a check-in to the location, a comment on the location), a virtual wallet application (e.g., based on a purchase associated with the location), a search application (e.g., based on a search associated with the physical location), a camera application (e.g., based on a geo-tag included in a photograph captured via a camera), and so forth. Some of the foregoing example components may be stand-alone components or may alternatively be accessed via browser 106 or another component.
The interaction database 152 may store records of computing interactions related to physical locations by a plurality of users. Typically, the computational interactions of the interaction database 152 related to a physical location include an identifier of the physical location, such as an address (e.g., latitude/longitude, street address), alias, and/or entity identifier. Computing the interaction may optionally include additional information related to the interaction, such as, for example, a date of the interaction, a time associated with the interaction (e.g., a single time, a time range, and/or a time indicative of a duration of the interaction), a confidence metric (e.g., a confidence based on a source aspect of the interaction), and so forth. The computing interactions that may be recorded in the interaction database 152 include, for example, a way-directing query to find driving directions for a location, a search related to a location, location data from a mobile device, a check-in to a location, a review of a location, a calendar entry identifying a location, a media item including a geo-tag identifying a location, extracted saved or received information related to a location (e.g., extracted from an email), a user's browsing history related to a location (e.g., indicating one or more documents, such as web pages, visited by a user), and/or a location marked with an asterisk or otherwise denoted with a semaphore on a map and/or other interface.
Various components may provide indications of computing interactions for storage in interaction database 152, and individual components may optionally maintain interaction database 152. Examples of components that may provide interactions for storage in the interaction database 12 include, for example, the client device 105 and other computing devices of other users, the information system 140 and other systems, an email system executing on one or more computing devices, a navigation system, and/or a GPS-enabled device, and/or one or more other components that may identify interactions with a location. Although only a single interaction database 152 is illustrated, in various embodiments interaction database 152 may include multiple databases. For example, the first database may include location-related routing queries and the second database may include location-related location data from a user's mobile computing device. In some implementations, the interaction database 152 may include entries for multiple users, and access to the entries for the users in the database may be allowed for only the user and/or one or more other users or components authorized by the user, such as the aspect determination system 120.
Where the systems described herein collect personal information about a user or personal information may be utilized, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, the user's preferences, or the user's current geographic location) or to control whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used, such that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personally identifiable information cannot be determined for the user, or the geographic location of the user may be generalized where geographic location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level) such that a particular geographic location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may control how information is collected and/or used with respect to the user.
A point of interest ("POI") database 154 may include a collection of entities and, for each of one or more of the entities, a mapping to one or more attributes associated with the entity and/or one or more other entities related to the entity. For example, the POI database 154 may be a knowledge graph, such as a local knowledge graph that includes entities associated with businesses and/or other locations and includes attributes such as phone numbers, addresses, open times, most popular times, etc. for each of these entities.
In some implementations, the POI database 154 can be utilized to identify one or more locations associated with the computing interactions of the interactions database 152. For example, the physical locations identified in POI database 154 may be associated with addresses, longitudes, and latitudes, and/or other coordinates of interactions that may be utilized to map interaction database 152 by physical location. Additionally, for example, each of the one or more physical locations identified in the POI database 154 may be associated with one or more aliases of the physical location and/or aliases of attributes of the location, and those aliases may be utilized to map interactions of the interaction database 152 by physical location.
In various implementations, the grouping engine 122 can utilize information from the POI database 154 to determine the group of interactions from the interaction database 152. For example, the grouping engine 122 may identify points of interest in the POI database 154 that are associated with longitude and latitude coordinates and further determine groups of interactions associated with those same longitude and latitude coordinates and/or associated with coordinates within a threshold distance of those longitude and latitude coordinates. For example, the grouping engine 122 can identify restaurant 1 and the latitude and longitude of restaurant 1 from the POI database 154. Grouping engine 122 can also determine a group of interactions associated with a location within 50 codes of the latitude and longitude of the identified restaurant 1. Additionally, for example, restaurant 1 may be associated with a street address in the POI database 154 and the grouping engine 122 may identify one or more interactions from the interaction database 152 that include navigation directions to the street address of restaurant 1. Additionally, for example, the grouping engine 122 can identify one or more aliases of restaurant 1 in the POI database 154 and determine a group of interactions from the interaction database 152 that are associated with one or more of the aliases (and optionally with additional attributes such as an alias for a location near restaurant 1 or a category associated with restaurant 1).
In this specification, the term "database" will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data. The data of the database need not be structured in any particular way or completely, and it can be stored on a storage device in one or more locations. Thus, for example, databases 152, 154, and/or 158 may each include multiple collections of data, each of which may be organized and accessed differently. Additionally, for example, all or portions of databases 152, 154, and/or 158 may be combined into one database and/or may contain pointers and/or other links between entries in the database. In addition, in this specification, the term "item" will be used broadly to refer to any mapping of a plurality of associated information items. A single entry need not exist in a single storage device and may include pointers or other indications of information items that may exist on other storage devices. For example, an entry identifying a computing interaction in interaction database 152 may include multiple nodes mapped to one another, where each node includes an identifier of an entity, or other items of information that may be present in another data structure and/or another storage medium.
The aspect determination system 120 can determine one or more aspects to assign to the location based on the user's location-related computing interaction. In various embodiments, the aspect determination system 120 may include a grouping engine 122, an interaction metrics engine 124, an aspect engine 126, and/or a text summary generation engine 128. In some implementations, one or more of the engines 122, 124, 126, and/or 128 may be omitted. In some implementations, all or aspects of one or more of the engines 122, 124, 126, and/or 128 can be combined. In some implementations, one or more of the engines 122, 124, 126, and/or 128 may be implemented in a component separate from the aspect determination system 120.
In general, the grouping engine 122 determines groups of computing interactions that are each associated with a physical location or a group of physical locations. For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a group of computing interactions from an interaction database 152 that includes computing interactions of users related to a particular physical location, such as a business, landmark, tourist attraction, or park. As described herein, the grouping engine 122 can optionally consider one or more additional parameters in determining groups of user interactions other than groups associated with a physical location or groups of physical locations. For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a group of interactions associated with one or more physical locations and also associated with: one or more dates such as a particular date, a particular range of dates, and/or a particular day of the week; one or more times such as a single time, a time range, and/or a time indicating a duration of the interaction; at least a threshold confidence metric (e.g., based on confidence in the source aspect of the interaction); one or more user attributes such as attributes indicating a particular group of users; one or more specific sources (e.g., location-only data, driving-only directions); and so on.
For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a group of interactions of the user at a location for one or more time periods (e.g., interactions of the user at restaurant 1 between 11 am and 1 pm). Additionally, for example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a group of interactions that includes interactions of the user at multiple locations of a category of locations within a geographic area (e.g., interactions of the user with pizza restaurants within a particular neighborhood or even within a particular geofence). Which parameters are utilized by the grouping engine 122 in determining one or more groups of user interactions may be based at least in part on desired aspects to be determined with respect to location. Examples of example aspects that may be directed to location determination and parameters that may optionally be considered in determining one or more groups of interactions for utilization in determining the example aspects are provided herein.
In some implementations, the grouping engine 122 can determine a first set of interactions associated with a location and determine a second set of interactions (referred to herein as a "peer group") associated with one or more locations similar to the location. For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a first set of interactions associated with a restaurant and determine a second set of interactions that includes interactions associated with other locations having a type of cook, a price, a customer base, a geographic area, a category of location (e.g., restaurant), and/or other attributes similar to the attributes of the location. In some implementations, similarity can be defined as requiring an exact match between one or more attributes (e.g., restaurants and other locations must have a common type of cooking) and/or a soft match between one or more attributes (e.g., restaurants and other locations must be associated with an average price within a threshold of each other). The geographic region may be defined with various levels of granularity, such as zip code, neighborhood, city, region, area code, and so forth.
In some implementations where groups are determined, the grouping engine 122 can determine that one or more interactions are outliers and do not include those interactions in the group. Outlying interactions may be identified and removed from the group based on one or more techniques (such as truncation and/or tail-biting approaches) and/or interactions below a threshold duration and/or above a threshold duration may be discarded. For example, the grouping engine 122 may not include interactions associated with a duration of access greater than a threshold because they may indicate interactions by employees rather than customers. Additionally, for example, the grouping engine 122 can identify an open time and/or a closed time for a location and determine that interactions from a user that existed before the open time and/or after the closed time are likely employees. Additionally, for example, in some implementations, one or more interactions may be associated with a confidence level, and only interactions that meet a threshold confidence level may be included in the group of interactions by the grouping engine 122. For example, an interaction indicating multiple potential locations may be associated with a low confidence level if the exact location may not be accurately determined (e.g., the interaction may be based on inaccurate location data indicating an area containing multiple points of interest). In some implementations, the grouping engine 122 can determine the group of interactions associated with the physical location only if the count of indicated interactions that satisfy the parameters of the group satisfies a threshold. For example, the grouping engine 122 may determine the group of computing interactions only if the count of interactions indicated for the group is above 100 interactions. In some implementations, the grouping engine 122 can determine the group of computing interactions associated with the physical location only if the count of users having interactions that satisfy the parameters of the group satisfies a threshold. For example, the grouping engine 122 may determine the group of computing interactions only if the group includes interactions from at least X users. In some implementations, the set of interactions may be in accordance with a distribution, such as a lognormal distribution and/or a Weibull (Weibull) distribution, and parameters of the distribution may be utilized by one or more components.
In some implementations, the interaction metric engine 124 can determine an interaction metric based on an average of one or more of the interactions of the group of interactions. For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a group of location data interactions for a location between 11 am and 1 pm of a plurality of dates (i.e., lunch time) and the interaction metrics engine 124 can determine interaction metrics that indicate an average duration of interactions with the location that were initiated during that time. Additionally, for example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a group of location data interactions for a location between 5 pm and 9 pm of a plurality of dates (i.e., dinner time) and the interaction metrics engine 124 can determine interaction metrics that indicate an average duration of interactions with the location that occurred during that time.
In some implementations, the interaction metric engine 124 can determine one or more metrics indicative of the amount of interaction during a plurality of discrete intervals. For example, grouping engine 122 can determine a group of user interactions with restaurant 1, and interaction metrics engine 124 can determine interaction metrics that indicate a number of interactions that occurred between 11 am and 12 pm, between 12 pm and 1 pm, between 1 pm and 2 pm, and so on. Additionally, for example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a group of interactions for all restaurants in the same city as restaurant 1 and the interaction metric engine 124 can determine an interaction metric that indicates an average number of interactions per restaurant over the same discrete interval.
In some implementations, the interaction metric engine 124 can determine one or more interaction metrics based on a confidence value associated with the interaction. For example, as described herein, an interaction with a location may be associated with a confidence value indicating a confidence that the interaction indicates an actual interaction with the location. The interaction metric engine 124 may weight one or more of the interactions with the associated confidence values. As an example, the interaction metric engine 124 may weight online check-ins of users at a location more heavily than non-finger searches related to the location.
The aspect engine 126 can determine an aspect of the location based on the one or more interaction metrics determined by the interaction metrics engine 124 and can assign the aspect to the location. For example, the facet engine 126 can associate facets with locations in the POI database 154. As one example of determining an aspect, the interaction metric engine 124 can determine an interaction metric that indicates an average interaction time at a restaurant location, and the aspect engine 126 can compare the interaction metric to a second metric to determine whether the restaurant location is a "quick snack" location or a longer "sitting" location. For example, the second measure may be a threshold value, such as 30 minutes, and if the interaction measure is less than the threshold value, an aspect of the restaurant may indicate a "quick snack" location. Additionally, for example, the second measure can be based on average interaction times of other similar locations (e.g., other restaurants in the area and/or other restaurants of the same type), and an aspect of a restaurant can indicate a "quick snack" location if the interaction measure is less than the average or exceeds a threshold that is less than the average. As another example of a determining aspect, the interaction metric engine 124 may determine a first calculated interaction metric indicative of an average amount of interaction with the daily dinner time of the restaurant during the past 6 months and a second calculated interaction metric indicative of an average amount of interaction with the daily dinner time of the restaurant during the past week. The facet engine 126 can determine, relative to the first calculated interaction metric, that the second calculated interaction metric indicates an increase in interaction and determine a facet of the restaurant "trending upward".
In some implementations, the aspect engine 126 can optionally utilize one or more rules in determining aspects for a location. For example, a first rule may be utilized to determine a first aspect for all locations or a class of locations, and a second rule may be utilized to determine a second aspect for all locations or a class of locations. As one example of a rule that may be utilized, the aspect engine 126 may identify an aspect that a location has an indication of "being in an ascending trend" based on determining that a difference between a first measure indicative of a quantity of interactions that are more recent in time and a second measure indicative of a quantity of interactions that are less recent in time satisfies a threshold, a percentage, and/or a ratio. For example, the aspect engine 126 can determine that the restaurant is trending upward if the first and second calculated interaction metrics indicate an increase in interaction of at least 20% (e.g., the restaurant can have an aspect of "trending upward" if the first metric indicating an average amount of daily interactions during the past interest is 50% greater than the second calculated interaction metric indicating an average amount of interactions during the past six months). As another example of a rule that may be utilized, the aspect engine 126 may identify that a location has an aspect indicating "slightly trending up" based on determining that a difference between a first measure indicative of a quantity of interactions that are more recent in time and a second measure indicative of a quantity of interactions that are less recent in time satisfies a first threshold, and has an aspect "significantly trending up" if the difference satisfies a second threshold. Which techniques are employed by the aspect engine 126 to determine aspects may be based at least in part on the desired aspect to be determined, the group determined by the grouping engine 122, and/or on interaction metrics determined by the interaction metrics engine 124. Examples of example aspects that may be directed to location determination and one or more example techniques that may optionally be utilized in determining such aspects are provided herein.
In some implementations, the aspect engine 126 can determine aspects of the location based on multiple sets of interactions for the location. As one example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a first set of interactions for a location during lunch time and a second set of interactions for the location during dinner time. Interaction metrics engine 124 may determine a first metric (based on the first group) indicative of an average user interaction at lunch and a second metric (based on the second group) indicative of an average interaction at dinner. The aspect engine 126 can determine an aspect indicating that the location is "more popular for lunch than dinner" based on determining that the first metric is greater than the second metric and/or based on determining that a proportion of interactions that occurred during lunch (i.e., the first metric) indicates that the location has more traffic during lunch than during dinner. As another example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a first set of interactions for a location associated with a weekday and a second set of interactions associated with a weekend. The interaction metric engine 124 may determine a first metric (based on the first group) indicative of average daily interactions on weekdays and a second metric (based on the second group) indicative of average daily interactions on weekends. The facet engine 126 can determine facets that indicate whether a location is more popular on weekdays or weekends. For example, the facets engine 126 may determine facets of "popular weekday locations" where the interaction metrics determined by the interaction metrics engine 124 indicate more average daily weekday interactions than weekend interactions. As yet another example, the aspect engine 126 can determine that a location has recently been opened or closed based on comparing a first calculated interaction metric indicative of an amount of interaction with the location during a recent period of time (e.g., the last 5 days) to a second calculated interaction metric indicative of an amount of interaction during a period of time (e.g., the last 3 months, optionally including the last 5 days) that includes less recent interactions. For example, if the comparison indicates a significant increase in interaction, then a "recently opened" aspect may be determined for the location. Additionally, for example, if the comparison indicates a significant reduction in interactions and the first calculated interaction metric indicates relatively fewer or no recent interactions, an aspect of "recent shutdown" may be determined for the location.
In some implementations, the aspect engine 126 can determine the aspect of the location based on comparing a first calculated interaction metric determined based on the group including only interactions with the location to a second calculated interaction metric determined based on the group including interactions with one or more other locations other than the location. For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a first group of interactions for all italian restaurants in the geographic area and the interaction metric engine 124 can determine a first calculated interaction metric based on the group that indicates an average amount of daily interactions per restaurant. Additionally, the grouping engine 122 can determine a second set of interactions for a particular italian restaurant in the geographic area and the interaction metrics engine 124 can determine a second calculated interaction metric based on the second set that indicates an average amount of daily interactions with the particular italian restaurant. Based on comparing the first measure to the second measure, the facet engine 126 can determine facets that indicate the popularity of a particular italian restaurant. For example, the facet may indicate that a restaurant is a popular italian restaurant if the average amount of daily interactions for the restaurant is greater than the average amount of daily interactions for all italian restaurants in the geographic area.
The text summary generation engine 128 may be configured to automatically generate one or more text summaries for a physical location based on signals provided by various components, such as the interaction metrics engine 124 and/or the aspect engine 126. For example, in some implementations, the text summary generation engine 128 can be configured to automatically generate a textual description of the physical location based on a comparison of two or more interaction metrics. This comparison may be the same comparison that produced one or more aspects assigned to the physical location, and indeed, in some embodiments, text summary generation engine 128 may additionally or alternatively automatically generate a text description of the physical location based on the one or more aspects assigned to the physical location. The textual summaries may fall into a variety of categories, including textual summaries describing the physical location (a peer group may also include the location itself) as compared to a similarly located "peer group," as well as textual summaries describing the absolute nature of the physical location.
The textual summary comparing the physical location to the peer group may include a textual summary comparing the physical location to other physical locations (i.e., peer groups) that satisfy one or more criteria. For example, the text summary "Italian restaurants most searched in Silicorn" compares the physical location (Indian restaurants in Silicorn) with a peer group of Italian restaurants in Silicorn. "dierpike's most popular bakery" compares the physical location (dierpike's bakery) with a peer group of dierpike's bakery. The "cheapest french restaurant with a full bar in the queen zone" compares the physical location (french restaurant in the queen zone) with the peer group of french restaurants with a full bar in the queen zone.
The peer group to which the physical location is compared may be selected based on one or more criteria. These criteria may include, but are not limited to, being located within a particular geographic area, having a particular category (e.g., indian restaurants, italian restaurants, mexican restaurants, bars, bakeries, coffee shops, etc.), selling goods/services within a particular price range, having one or more characteristics (quiet environment, outdoor seating, full bars, seaside scenery, live music, etc.), and so forth.
One or more criteria for including the physical location in the peer group may be selected, for example, by the grouping engine 122 based on various signals. These signals may come from various sources (such as client device 105) (either directly or indirectly), or from information system 140. One such signal is a particular location of potential interest to the user. If the user indicates (explicitly or implicitly) that there is a potential interest in booking a room at a particular luxury hotel, the criteria for selecting a peer group of hotels may include hotels having a similar price range as the particular hotel, or other hotels that best match the user's particular preferences (e.g., hotels with a particular star count, hotels with gyms, etc.).
Another signal for determining one or more criteria for including the physical location in the peer group is context data associated with the user computing device. Contextual data associated with a user's computing device (e.g., smartphone, smart watch, smart glasses, etc.) may include, but is not limited to, location coordinates (e.g., obtained using GPS 108 or other means such as cellular triangulation), search engine queries performed using browser 106, road directions queries performed using mapping application 110, and so forth. Assume that the user is located in a particular neighborhood (e.g., as determined by her GPS coordinates) and uses her cell phone to search for "cheap italian restaurants". Based on the user's context, the grouping engine 122 can obtain, for example, from the interaction database 152, computing interactions relating to italian restaurants that satisfy a particular price range (e.g., "$" or "$") within a geographic area (e.g., determined based on her location coordinates). If a particular Italian restaurant that fits these criteria is determined, for example, by the interaction metrics engine 124 and/or the facets engine 126 to be more popular than its remainder of peers, the text summary generation engine 128 may generate a text summary for that restaurant, such as "the most popular cheap Italian restaurant in the neighborhood" or something to do so. If another Italian restaurant that fits these criteria is determined, for example, by the interaction metrics engine 124 and/or the facets engine 126 to have a better outdoor seat than its counterpart, the text summary generation engine 128 may generate a text summary for that restaurant, such as "best outdoor seat for inexpensive Italian restaurants in the neighborhood" or something to do so.
Another signal for selecting one or more criteria for including a physical location in a peer group may additionally or alternatively be context data associated with a user (as opposed to the user's computing device). Assume that an online calendar entry associated with a user indicates that the user is scheduled in a particular geographic area shortly after lunch. Further assume that the user uses her cell phone to search for "fast food spots". The grouping engine 122 can select interactions from the interaction database 152, for example, that relate to locations at or near the geographic location known to provide relatively fast lunch options. Other user-related context data that may be used to determine criteria for selecting a peer group of physical locations may include user preferences, user budgets, user social network status updates, and so forth.
Another signal for selecting one or more criteria for including a physical location in a peer group may additionally or alternatively be non-user related information such as a degree of awareness or size of a geographic area. For example, assume that the user is in hollywood and searches for "indian food". A textual summary describing a particular search result as "best indian restaurants in california" would not be as useful as, for example, "best indian restaurants in las vegas". Thus, the size and/or popularity of the geographic area associated with the user's location may be used, for example, by the grouping engine 122 to determine criteria for selecting interactions from the interaction database 152. In some implementations, if a particular physical location is unique within a geographic area (or more generally, a single member of a particular peer group), a special text summary, such as "unique neighborhood bar of san majews," may be generated, for example, by a text summary generation engine.
Another category of textual summaries includes textual summaries that describe a physical location by its own absolute terms rather than by comparison with peer groups of other physical locations. As described above, computing interactions relating to physical location may be analyzed, for example, in terms of different time periods (e.g., lunch time versus dinner time). Examples of absolute summaries include, but are not limited to, "a large number of visitors to revisit this location," "this place is increasingly busy," "this point is more popular for early lunch than for dinner," and so forth. In various implementations, these text summaries may be generated, for example, by text summary generation engine 128 based on one or more aspects assigned to the physical location by aspect engine 126.
Generally, the information system 140 utilizes the facets that have been determined by the facet determination system 120 and/or the text summaries generated by the text summary generation engine 128 when providing information to the user. The information system 140 can utilize the aspects and/or the textual summary, for example, in determining information to provide (e.g., the aspects can be included in the information) and/or determining when or how to provide the information (e.g., the aspects can be utilized to select and/or rank the information relative to other information). For example, the information system 140 may identify that a user is interested in one or more locations and provide information related to the one or more locations based on the determined aspects of the locations. In some implementations, the text summary generation engine 128 may be integral with the information system 140 rather than the aspect determination system 120. In other implementations, the text summary generation engine 128 may be a separate component from the aspect determination system 120 and the information system 140.
The information system 140 can be, for example, a search engine, a notification and/or suggestion system, and/or one or more other systems that can provide location-related information to a user's computing device based on implicit and/or explicit indications from the computing device (e.g., based on queries to re-compute the device, selections of the user via the computing device, access to applications via the computing device such as access to a suggestion system). The information system 140 may optionally be in communication with an information database 158. The information database 158 may include information that may be utilized by the information system 140 to provide information to users. For example, the information database 158 may include an index of documents, web pages, and/or other information items that may be utilized to identify information to be provided to a user. As one example, the information system 140 may be a search engine and the information database 158 may be a search index that is utilized to identify documents in response to search queries. As described herein, documents may optionally be ranked for a search query based on a determined aspect associated with the documents. In some implementations, the information system 140 and/or another component can optionally update the information database 158 based on the aspects determined by the aspect engine 126 and/or the text summaries generated by the text summary generation engine 128. For example, when information database 158 is an index of web pages and other documents, the index may be updated to include information related to aspects determined herein (e.g., web pages associated with a location may be indexed based on the determined aspects of the location).
In some implementations, the information system 140 can select and/or rank the search results in response to the submitted search query based on the determined aspect. For example, a user may provide a search query for "trendy lunch places" and the information system 140 may identify information in the information database 158 relating to one or more nearby locations as restaurants. Based on the inclusion of "try" in the search query, the information system 140 may also identify that one or more of the identified locations are associated with a determined aspect that indicates a lunch service and/or that indicates a recent "trend up" in popularity. The information system 140 may select these identified locations for provision in response to the search query and/or promote a ranking of these locations in search results provided in response to the search query. As another example, a user may provide a query of "new restaurants" and the information system 140 may identify one or more locations in the POI database 154 that are associated with an aspect indicating that the restaurant has recently been opened (e.g., based on the presence of "new" in the search query) and select information related to those locations for providing in response to the query and/or for providing more prominently in response to the query.
In some implementations, one or more search results may be selected and/or ranked based on the determined aspect even when the terms of the query do not indicate interest in the determined aspect. For example, a user may provide a search query for "Italian restaurants" and the information system 140 may identify one or more web pages responsive to the query via the information database 158. The information system 140 may identify one or more locations associated with the web pages in the POI database 154 and further identify one or more aspects associated with the locations. The information system 140 may provide search results that include local italian restaurants and restaurants that have been associated with the "trend up" aspect may be promoted and/or otherwise displayed more prominently than one or more other search results.
As described, in some implementations, the information system 140 can provide location-related information independent of any query submissions by the user. For example, the information system 140 may be a notification or suggestion system that may provide information to a user about locations with "highly popular" or "trending up" aspects without requiring the user to submit queries related to the location. For example, information may be "pushed" to a user and/or provided in response to the user accessing or selecting an interface element in a suggestion system. Additionally, for example, the information system 140 may provide one or more suggestions in response to a user's selection of a user who is not explicitly typing, speaking, or otherwise entering a query. For example, the user may select a user interface element for requesting a nearby "popular restaurant" and the information system 140 may select information related to one or more restaurants based on a determined aspect indicating that the restaurant is "popular". Additionally, for example, the information system 140 may be a mapping application that may provide various points of interest to a map for display on a user's computing device. The information system 140 may determine to include one or more of the points of interest based on the association of the points of interest with the one or more determined aspects and/or may determine to display one or more of the points of interest more prominently and/or with additional description based on the association of the points of interest with the one or more determined aspects and/or based on the associated text summary generated by the text summary generation engine 128. Additionally, for example, the "most recently open" position may be promoted in the ranking of the information provided to the user. For example, the user may not be provided with a restaurant in the location if the user is familiar with the area. Even restaurants that the user is familiar with the area associated with the "recently opened" aspect may be provided to the user and will not otherwise provide restaurants in the area.
Although depicted as separate components in fig. 1, all or a portion of aspect determination system 120 and/or information system 140 may optionally be combined in various embodiments. Additionally, in some embodiments, the information system 140 may be omitted.
FIG. 2 shows an example of how aspects of a physical location may be determined and assigned to the physical location and how one or more textual summaries may be generated and provided to the information system 140 based on computing interactions relating to the physical location. The computed interactions associated with the location are stored in the interaction database 152. The grouping engine 122 may be configured to determine groups of interactions that include interactions for a particular location for a peer-to-peer group of locations, for a category of users, for one or more particular moments, and/or based on one or more other criteria. In some implementations, the grouping engine 122 can identify the physical location based at least in part on information in the POI database 154. For example, the grouping engine 122 can identify locations in the POI database 154 and determine a group of interactions related to the identified locations (e.g., all interactions with the location, interactions at one or more times, and/or during a certain period of time). Additionally, for example, the grouping engine 122 can determine the computed interactions of the interaction database 152 related to a particular location based on other information in the POI database 154 (e.g., based on aliases, addresses, or other information that map the interactions to locations in the POI database 154).
As an example, the grouping engine 122 can identify the location of restaurant 1 italian restaurant and the coordinates and/or address of the location. The grouping engine 122 can also determine a group of computing interactions from the interaction database 152 that includes computing interactions related to restaurant 1 during the past month. The grouping engine 122 may provide one or more groups of computing interactions to the interaction metrics engine 124 to determine one or more interaction metrics for each group. For example, for each of these groups, the interaction metric engine 124 may determine an interaction metric that indicates an average number of interactions per day. Additionally, for example, the interaction metric engine 124 may determine an interaction metric that indicates an average number of interactions per hour per day during the period of interactions for each group. The interaction metrics engine 124 may provide these interaction metrics to the facet engine 126.
In some implementations, only one group of interactions may be determined and only one interaction metric may be determined for a location, as represented by the dashed line of the second group of interactions and the second calculated interaction metric in fig. 2 (indicating that those aspects are optional). For example, the first calculated interaction metric may be a percentage of total interactions occurring every hour at the location (e.g., 5% of total average interactions occurring between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., 15% of total average interactions occurring between 11 a.m. and 12 a.m., etc.). The second metric may not be determined from the set of interactions, but may instead be a threshold. For example, the second metric may be a threshold of 85% of interactions during lunch time, and the aspect engine 126 may determine that the location is a lunch restaurant by comparing the threshold to a percentage of total interactions per hour during lunch time.
The facet engine 126 can determine one or more facets for the location based on the interaction metrics and associate the facets with the location in the POI database 154. For example, the interaction metric engine 124 may determine a first calculated interaction metric indicative of an average interaction during lunch time in the most recent month in time and a second calculated interaction metric indicative of an average interaction during lunch time in the past six months. The aspect engine 126 may determine the aspect of "trending upward in popularity for lunch" by comparing the interaction metrics and determining that the average lunch time interaction has increased by at least a threshold amount.
As another example of an aspect that may be determined for a location, the aspect engine 126 may determine an aspect (and optionally a degree of loyalty) that indicates whether customers of the location are loyal to the location. For example, grouping engine 122 can determine a group of user interactions with restaurant 1. Interaction metrics engine 124 may determine interaction metrics that indicate a number of users that have interacted with the location once, a number of users that have interacted with the location twice, three times, etc., based on the group. Additionally, for example, the interaction metrics engine 124 may determine a second metric that indicates an average number of times the group of users has interacted with other locations once, twice, three times, etc. (e.g., based on the group of interactions including additional locations of other restaurants of similar price ranges, such as the same region). The aspect engine 126 can determine an aspect indicating that the restaurant has a loyal customer base (e.g., more repeat customers, more loyalty) by comparing the repeat customer count (or ratio) for a location with the repeat customer count (or ratio) for one or more other locations
As another example of determining customer loyalty aspects of italian restaurant a, a group of interactions associated with italian restaurant a may be determined. If loyalty is desired among users having particular attributes, the set of interactions may optionally be selected by the grouping engine 122 in some embodiments based on an association with one or more of those attributes. Interaction metrics, which indicate a measure of repeated interactions with italian restaurant a, may be determined by the interaction metrics engine 124 based on the group of interactions. For example, the interaction metric may be an average amount of interactions by the user, a median amount of interactions by the user, and/or a continuous or discrete distribution of the amount of interactions (e.g., a median with a standard deviation, a vector including a raw count or frequency for each of a plurality of amounts of interactions, such as one interaction, two interactions, three interactions, etc.).
As another example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a group of computing interactions for restaurant 1 and additionally determine a group of computing interactions for groups of other italian restaurants. Interaction metrics engine 124 can determine metrics for interactions for restaurant 1 and other italian restaurants. The facet engine 126 can determine facets of restaurants that are relevant to the popularity of restaurant 1 based on the interaction metrics. For example, the facet engine 126 can determine that restaurant 1 is a popular location for dinner to eat Italian meals by determining that the interaction with restaurant 1 at dinner is greater than the average number of interactions with other Italian restaurants at dinner.
As an example of determining an aspect of italian restaurant a that indicates a trend of italian restaurant a, the group of computing interactions associated with italian restaurant a and associated with the most recent period of time (e.g., the most recent X days) may be determined by the grouping engine 122. If it is desired to determine trends among users having particular attributes, the set of interactions may optionally be selected by the grouping engine 122 in some embodiments based on associations with one or more of those attributes. An interaction metric indicating an amount of interaction with italian restaurant a may be determined by interaction metric engine 124 based on the group of interactions. For example, the interaction metric may be an average amount of interaction per day during the last X days. A second calculated interaction metric may be determined from a second group of interactions that includes interactions during the next most recent X days. The aspect engine 126 can determine an aspect for the location based on comparing the first computed interaction metric and the second computed interaction metric. For example, if the interaction metric indicates that the average interaction over the past X days is greater than the average interaction over the previous X days, the aspect engine 126 may determine an aspect in which the location is trending upward.
As shown in FIG. 2, the text summary generation engine 128 may generate a text summary for a physical location based on the computed interaction metrics obtained from the interaction metrics engine 124 and/or based on one or more aspects obtained from the aspects engine 126. In some implementations, the text summary generation engine 128 can obtain the aspects from the POS database 154, for example, when those aspects have been assigned to physical locations in the POI database 154 by the aspects engine 126. In some implementations, the text summary generation engine 128 can provide (or otherwise provide) one or more text summaries to the information system 140. The information system 140 may then cause the text summary to be presented to the user in various ways (e.g., adjacent to the search results, as a pop-up window, on a card, etc.).
As represented by the arrow from the information system 140 to the packet engine 122, in various embodiments, the packet engine 122 may receive context data from the information system 140, e.g., relating to the user or the user's computing device. The packet engine 122 may use this textual information for various purposes. For example, the grouping engine 122 can use the context data to determine one or more criteria for selecting a peer group for a particular physical location (e.g., a destination of a user's routing query). As another example, the grouping engine 122 can determine potential implicit user interest in a particular location using the context data as a starting point (e.g., when the user has not provided a search) and select one or more criteria for a peer group to the particular location based on the potential interest.
Assume that the packet engine 122 receives a GPS signal indicating that the user is passing through a mexican restaurant. The grouping engine 122 can identify a group of computing interactions in the interaction database 152 that are related to the mexican restaurant. The grouping engine 122 can also identify peer groups of Mexico restaurants, for example, in the same spoken language area (e.g., "Pacific highland," "Buttertown," etc.). The interaction metric engine 124 can obtain an interaction metric that indicates how often a mexican restaurant of the peer group is searched as compared to how often the mexican restaurant is searched, which the facet engine 126 can use to assign one or more facets to mexican restaurants that the user is passing. The text summary generation engine 128 can produce a text summary (e.g., "Mexico restaurants most searched in the area"), and the information system 140 can provide the summary to the user at the client device 105, e.g., as a "card" or other similar notification.
As indicated by the arrow between the information database 158 and the grouping engine 122, in some implementations, the grouping engine 122 can determine one or more criteria for selecting a peer group for a particular physical location based on other information in addition to contextual information. For example, in some implementations, the grouping engine 122 can select a geographic area that should contain peer-to-peer physical locations based on the physical size and/or population of the particular geographic area. For example, assume that a user who has gone through Brooklin searches for "good Chinese restaurants". The grouping engine 122 can determine, for example, based on information from the information database 158, the physical size/population of the new york state making it an unsuitable (too large) geographic area for selecting chinese restaurants for inclusion in the peer group. This determination may be based on one or more adjustable thresholds (e.g., less than 50,000 people, less than 10 miles of geographic size, etc.). Depending on how the one or more thresholds are adjusted, the grouping engine 122 can make the same determination with respect to new york city. However, if the grouping engine 122 is focused on a spoken region within Brooklin or perhaps even Brooklin, one or more thresholds may be met, and the grouping engine 122 may select computing interactions related to peer Chinese restaurants in the region.
FIG. 3 illustrates a flow diagram of an example method of assigning an aspect to a physical location based on an interaction associated with the physical location. For convenience, the operations of the flow diagrams are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. This system may include various components of various computer systems. For example, some operations may be performed by one or more components of the aspect determination system 120, such as the grouping engine 122, the interaction metric engine 124, and the aspect engine 126. Also, while the operations of the method of fig. 3 are shown in a particular order, this is not intended to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted, or added.
At step 300, a group of interactions associated with a physical location is determined. In some implementations, the group of interactions may be determined by a component that shares one or more aspects with the grouping engine 122. In some implementations, the group of interactions that includes the user's interactions may be determined based on one or more characteristics of the user. For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine groups of interactions associated with particular user attributes and/or particular groups of users. In some implementations, the grouping engine 122 can determine a group of interactions that occur during a period of time. For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine groups of interactions that occur during a particular week, month, day of week, and/or during a particular moment during a certain period of time (e.g., interactions during lunch time during a past month).
At step 305, a first interaction metric for a physical location is determined based on the group interactions. The first interaction metric may be determined by a component that shares one or more characteristics with the interaction metric engine 124. In some implementations, the interaction metric can be an interaction-based statistic. For example, the interaction metrics for a group of interactions may include an average of interactions over a period of time, an average number of interactions per hour over a period of time, and/or a proportion of average daily interactions occurring per hour over a period of time (e.g., a percentage of customers with lunch customers on the day, a percentage of customers with dinner customers on the day).
At step 310, a second interaction metric for the physical location is determined. In some implementations, the second interaction metric can be one or more static or dynamic thresholds. For example, the first interaction metric may indicate a duration of interaction with the location and the second metric may be a static threshold duration. In some implementations, the second measure may additionally or alternatively include an additional interaction measure based on a second group of interactions that includes additional interactions other than the group of interactions utilized to determine the first interaction measure. For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine a second set of interactions at one or more different times for one or more different locations and/or for one or more different groups of users from the interactions included in the first set of interactions (step 300). For example, the set of interactions of step 300 may include interactions with italian restaurant 1, and the second metric may be based on interactions with all italian restaurants in the geographic area near italian restaurant 1 (optionally including interactions with italian restaurant 1).
At step 315, an aspect of the physical location is determined based on a comparison of the first interaction metric and the second interaction metric, and the aspect is assigned to the physical location. The aspect of the physical location may be determined by a component that shares one or more characteristics with the aspect engine 126 and may be assigned to the location based on an association with the location in one or more databases, such as POI database 154. In some implementations, the facet engine 126 can determine, for a location, facets related to trending awareness of the location. For example, the facet engine 126 can determine that a restaurant is trending upward in popularity based on a first interaction metric determined based on recent interactions and a second interaction metric based on less recent interactions, and determine that the interaction metrics indicate a recent increase in popularity. Additionally, for example, the facet engine 126 can determine that a restaurant has recently been closed based on interaction metrics indicating a location with few or no current interactions with the location. In some implementations, the aspect engine 126 can determine an aspect based on a first interaction metric related to a location and a second interaction metric related to one or more other locations (including or not including the location). For example, the first interaction metric may be based on interactions with restaurants and the second interaction metric may be based on a second group of interactions with other restaurants similar to the first restaurant. For example, the facet engine 126 may compare the interaction metrics and determine that a first restaurant is more popular than the average interactions of other restaurants that are of similar type of cooking service, have similar price ranges, and/or are in similar geographic areas.
FIG. 4 illustrates a flow diagram of an example method 400 of generating a textual summary for a physical location based on a computing interaction relating to the physical location. For convenience, the operations of the flow diagrams are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. This system may include various components of various computer systems. For example, some operations may be performed by one or more components of the aspect determination system 120, such as the grouping engine 122, the interaction metric engine 124, the aspect engine 126, and/or the text summary generation engine 128. Also, while the operations of the method of fig. 4 are shown in a particular order, this is not intended to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted, or added.
At block 402, the system may identify a first set of computing interactions that relate to a particular physical location. In some implementations, the system may select a particular physical location based on a user's explicit activity, such as the user searching for comments about a particular hotel or searching for directions to the hotel. In some instances, the system may select a particular physical location based on the user's implicit activity (e.g., context), such as the user coupling meetings scheduled in a particular area during lunch with the user's general preferences for particular cooking. Suppose Sue is scheduled to attend a meeting in a neighborhood called dierpick immediately after lunch and suppose Sue generally prefers indian cooking that costs less than $ 20. The system may identify the indian restaurant closest to the location of the meeting of Sue, and may then identify one or more computing interactions related to that indian restaurant.
In some implementations, the first group of computing interactions can be identified by a component that shares one or more aspects with the grouping engine 122. In some implementations, the group of interactions that includes the user's interactions may be determined based on one or more characteristics of the user. For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine groups of interactions associated with particular user attributes and/or particular groups of users. In some implementations, the grouping engine 122 can determine a group of interactions that occur during a period of time. For example, the grouping engine 122 can determine groups of interactions that occur during a particular week, month, day of week, and/or during a particular moment during a certain period of time (e.g., interactions during lunch time during a past month).
At block 404, the system may determine one or more criteria for selecting one or more other physical locations as a peer group for the particular physical location. For example, contextual information associated with Sue and/or Sue's smartphone may indicate that Sue is located in dierpick, likes indian food, and has a specific budget for food. For example, other information from the information database 158 may indicate that dierpik has a size that is too small (geographic size or population) to select a satisfactory peer group for a physical location, but the city in which dierpik is located is appropriately sized for selecting a peer group.
At block 406, the system may identify a second set of computing interactions relating to one or more additional physical locations that satisfy the one or more criteria determined at block 404. For example, the system may select a computing interaction associated with an indian restaurant within the city where dierpik is located that also meets one or more of Sue's budget needs.
At block 408, the system may determine a first calculated interaction metric for the particular physical location based on the interactions of the first group identified at block 402. The first computed interaction metric may be determined by a component that shares one or more characteristics with the interaction metric engine 124. In some implementations, the interaction metric can be an interaction-based statistic. For example, the interaction metrics for a group of interactions may include an average of interactions over a period of time, an average number of interactions per hour over a period of time, and/or a proportion of average daily interactions occurring per hour over a period of time (e.g., a percentage of customers with lunch customers on the day, a percentage of customers with dinner customers on the day). For example, the system may determine that indian restaurants near meetings of Sue have been searched a particular number of times in the past month.
At block 410, the system may determine a second computational interaction metric based on the second set of one or more computational interactions determined at block 406. For example, the system may determine the number of times other indian restaurants in the city have been searched by the user in the past month. In other embodiments, rather than being related to a peer group of physical locations, the second computed interaction metric may be one or more static or dynamic thresholds. For example, the first computed interaction metric may indicate a duration of interaction with the location and the second metric may be a static threshold duration.
At block 412, the system may determine an aspect of the physical location based on a comparison of the first calculated interaction metric and the second calculated interaction metric. In some implementations, the aspect may be assigned to a physical location. The aspect of the physical location may be determined by a component that shares one or more characteristics with the aspect engine 126 and may be assigned to the location based on an association with the location in one or more databases, such as POI database 154.
At block 414, the system may generate one or more text summaries relating to the particular physical location. The text summary may be generated by a component that shares one or more characteristics with the text summary generation engine 128. The one or more text summaries may be generated based on a comparison of two or more calculated interaction metrics (e.g., determined at blocks 408 and 410), or may be based on one or more aspects determined at 412.
In some implementations, the system can generate the text summary using one or more of the plurality of template text summaries. The system may select a template text summary based at least in part on the type of computing interaction used to determine the computing interaction metrics at blocks 408 and 410. Table 1 below provides non-limiting examples of peer-based lookup tables that may be used to select a template text summary, including the type of computing interaction being analyzed and example thresholds that may be used to select from a plurality of potentially applicable template text summaries.

Referring to fig. 5, an example interface 500 is provided that includes information for aspects of location-based determinations. In some implementations, the information system 140 can determine the information included in the interface 500 of fig. 5 and provide the interface 500 (or information such as HTML or XML that facilitates rendering of the interface 500) to the client device 105 for presentation to the user. For example, the information system 140 may be a search engine and may provide the interface 500 (or information for facilitating the rendering thereof) to a user via the browser 106 in response to the user providing a search query. For another example, the information system 140 may be a suggestion system and the interface 500 may be provided via a suggestion application of the client device 105. In some implementations, only a portion of the interface 500 of fig. 5 may be provided to a user and/or information may be provided via one or more alternative interfaces.
Search results 506 may be provided in interface 500 along with other information as shown in FIG. 5 and/or may be provided as a separate interface. For example, the information system 140 may be a search engine and the search results 506 may be provided to the user via the client device 105 in response to a query provided by the user. In some implementations, information provided with the search results can be identified via the information database 158, and the results can be selected and/or ranked based on aspects associated with locations related to the search results, as described herein.
In this example, search engine results 506 are accompanied by text summaries generated by, for example, text summary generation engine 128. For example, the first result is accompanied by the text "Italian restaurants in the vicinity that are most frequently searched". This italian restaurant has apparently been compared to a peer group of italian restaurants in a particular neighborhood. The second result is accompanied by the text "italian restaurant with dinner more popular than lunch". The computational interactions associated with this italian restaurant have been compared across time periods (lunch and dinner intervals). The third result is accompanied by the text "only italian restaurants in the city with live music". This italian restaurant has been compared to a peer group of italian restaurants in the "city" and is apparently unique among the peer group when having live music.
