DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0014] The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology.
However, it will be clear and apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.
[0015] A person who purchases online offers may have difficulty remembering which offers he has purchased and may additionally have difficulty remembering to redeem an offer before it
expires. That person may wish to be notified when he is near a business at which he has purchased an offer or when viewing a map that includes the business.
[0016] The disclosed subject matter describes systems and techniques for indicating an unredeemed offer for a user on a map. The phrase "unredeemed offer" as used herein
encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to an offer that a user has received that provides the recipient of the offer with a benefit that has not yet been received. The recipient of the unredeemed offer may have received the unredeemed offer for free or may have provided some sort of payment for the unredeemed offer. For example, an unredeemed offer may include a coupon, a ticket, a discount amount, a prepaid purchase amount, a free-gift with purchase, a special offer, a free product or service, or the like. The unredeemed offer is associated with data that may include a business location, expiration date of the offer, details of the offer, and the like. The business location is determined from the unredeemed offer data. An indicator is displayed on a map at the business location and may be enhanced to indicate that the user has an unredeemed offer that may be redeemed at that business location.
[0017] A user may have a single unredeemed offer for a single location represented by the indicator. The indicator may also reflect multiple unredeemed offers for a single location. The multiple unredeemed offers may be multiple coupons for the same offer, or a variety of different offers at the same location. Indicators at multiple business locations may reflect a single offer that may be redeemed at multiple business locations. Indicators may additionally indicate multiple offers for multiple business locations.
[0018] Turning to the drawings, FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 indicating an unredeemed offer on a map. The system 100 includes clients 110 and servers 130 connected over a network 150.
[0019] The system 100 is comprised of client(s) 110, server(s) 130 and the network 150 in any combination or configuration that permits the indication of an unredeemed offer on a map, including implementations with multiple servers 130. Each of the clients 1 10 can be, for example, desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile devices (e.g., a smartphone, tablet computer, or PDA), set top boxes (e.g., for a television), video game consoles, or any other devices having a processor, a memory, and communications capabilities. In certain instances, different versions and/or configurations of the system that include subject technology as disclosed herein are available for download from a server 130 and subsequent installation on client 1 10. The servers 130 can be any device having a processor, memory, and communications capability for hosting the data for installing and hosting the system. The network 150 can include, for example, any one or more of a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a campus area network (CAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a broadband network (BBN), the Internet, and the like. Further, the network 150 can include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like.
[0020] FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example client and server from the system 100 of FIG. 1 according to certain aspects of the subject technology. The client 110 and the server 130 are connected over the network 150 via respective communications modules 218 and 238 and are configured to interface with the network 150 to send and receive information, such as data, requests, responses, and commands to other devices on the network. The
communications modules 218 and 238 can be, for example, modems or Ethernet cards.
[0021] The client 1 10 includes a processor 212, a communications module 218, and a memory 220 that may include an offer reminder module 224.
[0022] The processor 212 of the client 1 10 is configured to execute instructions, such as instructions physically coded into the processor 212, instructions received from software in memory 220, or a combination of both. For example, the input device 216 may provide textual information to processor 212 which is processed by an offer reminder module 224 stored in memory 220. The textual information may then be sent through network 150 via
communications module 218 to server 130, which receives the information through
communications module 238. Server 130 includes a processor 236, a communications module 238, and a memory 232 that may include an offer reminder module 234.
[0023] Processor 236 is configured to execute instructions, such as instructions physically coded into the processor 236, instructions received from software in memory 232, or a combination of both.
[0024] Processor 236 processes information from offer reminder module 234 and sends information through communications module 238, through network 150, to client 110 to be displayed on output device 214.
[0025] FIG. 3 illustrates an example process 300 for indicating an unredeemed offer on a map as shown by the example client 1 10 and server 130 of FIG. 2 that can provide for indicating an unredeemed offer on a map.
[0026] The process begins with step S310, in which a request to display a map is received by the server. A user may request a map through a client application such as a mapping application or navigation application. The user may have a user profile associated with the client application. The user may request the display of a map based on a search inquiry such as a
current address, a destination address, or any other geographic location. The user's search query may not be associated with any unredeemed offer of the user, providing an ambient indication of unredeemed offers on a map.
[0027] In step S320, unredeemed offer data associated with an unredeemed offer for a user is received by the server. This step may follow the purchase of an offer by the user or the receipt of an unredeemed offer as a gift or prize or other action by the user or by a service providing the offers. The unredeemed offer may be associated with the user's profile.
[0028] Unredeemed offer data that is associated with each unredeemed offer may include: details of the offer; the expiration date of the offer; terms of the offer that change over time; the business(es) associated with the offer; the business locations at which the offer may be redeemed; location information of the business(es) such as a street address; contact information of the business including telephone numbers, fax numbers, website address, and email addresses; operating hours; special terms of the offer that apply to individual locations; price paid for the offer; directions to the business location; public transportation near the business location; special operating hours; and the like.
[0029] In step S330, a business location associated with the unredeemed offer based on the unredeemed offer data is determined. Business location information may be contained in the unredeemed offer data. Unredeemed offer data may include some or all business location information. The unredeemed offer data may contain some business location information such as the business name. The business location may then be inferred from other sources such as websites, databases, directories, or other information that is available on-line based on the business name or other associated information. The business location may include a street address, latitude and longitude coordinates, or any other geographically descriptive information.
An unredeemed offer may have multiple businesses at which the offer may be redeemed (e.g., a coupon for a particular item that is sold at a variety of different types of stores), multiple locations of one business at which the offer may be redeemed (e.g., dance lessons at a dance studio with several locations in one city), or a single business with a single location at which the offer may be redeemed (e.g., a ticket to a specific sporting event). An unredeemed offer may be redeemable on-line in addition to at a business location. An unredeemed offer that is only redeemable on-line nonetheless may be associated with a related business location.
[0030] In step S340, if the determined business location is represented by an indicator on the requested display of the map, the server provides for the enhancement of the indicator on the map based on the associated unredeemed offer. Accordingly, unredeemed offers that are associated with the user may not appear on the displayed map, even if the user has an
unredeemed offer in the geographic area depicted in the map. This may occur if the business location associated with the unredeemed offer is not displayed on the map. The business location may appear on the map if the map changes zoom level, and thus, the indicator of the business location will also appear enhanced when the indicator is displayed. The enhancement of existing indicators contributes to the achievement of a goal of the invention of providing an ambient indication of unredeemed offers on the map. The map may be a vector map, an image map, or the like. A map that is associated with the user may automatically display enhanced indicators as a part of the base map that is updated in real time, periodically, or upon command by the user.
[0031] An indicator displayed on the map may be an icon, text box, point of interest, or any other identifier or combination of identifiers. The indicator may be a portion of the base map or may be a separate map layer. An individual indicator may represent each unredeemed offer,
each unredeemed offer at a separate location, a number of offers at the same location, a number of different offers at the same location, and the like. The indicator may appear on the map at the location of the business at which the offer may be redeemed. The indicator may include business location information and any other unredeemed offer data that is associated with the unredeemed offer.
[0032] An enhanced indicator may indicate a single unredeemed offer at a single determined business location (e.g., the enhanced indicator may be displayed at the location of a team's baseball field on the map, indicating an unredeemed offer of the user that is a coupon for a single, discounted baseball ticket for a home game). An enhanced indicator may indicate multiple offers for a single location (e.g., the enhanced indicator may be displayed at the location of a unique restaurant on the map and indicate that the user has four gift certificates for one hundred dollars each that have not been redeemed; the enhanced indicator may be displayed at the location of a landmark skyscraper, and indicate that the user has an unredeemed offer for fifty percent off at the skyscraper's gift shop, an unredeemed offer for two free admission tickets to the observation deck of the skyscraper, and an unredeemed offer for a free group photo in front of the skyscraper). Multiple enhanced indicators may indicate a single or multiple unredeemed offer(s) that may be redeemed at any one of multiple places (e.g., an enhanced indicator may be displayed at each location of a chain of gourmet grocery stores indicating a single unredeemed offer of the user for a free pound of shrimp that may be redeemed at any of the locations of that chain; or an enhanced indicator may be displayed at each location of the chain of gourmet grocery stores indicating an unredeemed offer of the user for a free pound of shrimp, an unredeemed offer of the user for a half price bottle of wine, and an unredeemed offer
of the user for free grocery delivery, each of which may be redeemed at any location of the chain of gourmet grocery stores).
[0033] A text box that is included as part of the enhanced indicator may include business information associated with each business location associated with the indicator. Business information may include any business location information including street address, latitude and longitude coordinates, or other geographically identifying information. Business location information may additionally include contact information of the business, directions to the business location, public transportation near the business location; operating hours, and the like. The text box may include any other information related to the unredeemed offer such as the expiration date, the details of the offer, and the like.
[0034] The enhancement of the indicator on the map may be removed from display on the map once an offer expires, if the offer is transferred to another user, or if the offer is redeemed. Removal of the enhanced indicators may be performed by a user or may be automated.
[0035] In some aspects of the subject technology, business locations and/or unredeemed offers may be used as a form of ranking in addition to any preexisting ranking to allow for prioritized display of the enhanced indicators. Ranking may be conducted on the basis of an expiration date of each of the unredeemed offers, the number of unredeemed offers for each business location, preexisting rank information associated with the business location, and the like. Prioritized display of the enhanced indicators may be associated with zoom levels of the map.
[0036] FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example computer system as it relates to aspects of the subject technology.
[0037] Example computer system 400 is representative of one of many possible
implementations of the example system of FIG. 1. Offer server 434 includes a processor 435, a memory 439 for storing unredeemed offer data and business location data, and may include a communications module (not shown), and a portion of an offer reminder module (not shown). Map server 432 includes a processor 433, a memory 437 including map data, a communications module (not shown), and a portion of an offer reminder module (not shown). Offer server 434, map server 432, and client 410 may be connected over a network (not shown).
[0038] Unredeemed offer data and business location information associated with an unredeemed offer may be stored in memory 434. The offer server 434, through processor 435, may determine the business location associated with the unredeemed offer based on the unredeemed offer data or inferred through unredeemed offer data in combination with business location information from other sources. The business location associated with the unredeemed offer, along with other unredeemed offer data and business location information may then be sent to map server 432.
[0039] The map server 432, through processor 433, may provide an indicator of the unredeemed offer based on the determined business location and the associated unredeemed offer so that it may be displayed as a portion of a map, whose map data is stored in memory 437. Map data may include map data associated with the user.
[0040] The map with integrated unredeemed offer indicators may then be provided for display on client 410.
[0041] Many of the above-described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable storage medium (also referred to as computer readable medium). When these instructions are executed
by one or more processing unit(s) (e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units), they cause the processing unit(s) to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of computer readable media include, but are not limited to, CD-ROMs, flash drives, RAM chips, hard drives, EPROMs, etc. The computer readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.
[0042] In this specification, the term "software" is meant to include firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage, which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also, in some implementations, multiple software aspects of the subject technology can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software aspects of the subject technology. In some implementations, multiple software aspects can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally, any combination of separate programs that together implement a software aspect described here is within the scope of the subject technology. In some implementations, the software programs, when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.
[0043] A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that
store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
[0044] FIG. 5 is an illustration of an example graphical user interface (GUI) of the subject technology and conceptually illustrates a graphical user interface (GUI) 500 in which some configurations of the subject technology can be implemented. The GUI 500 can include different sets of graphical elements for displaying businesses, landmarks, traffic, photographs, weather, and points of interest (POIs). A graphical element can include, but is not limited to, a button, check box, radio button, slider, list box, drop-down list, menu, combo box, icon, text box, scroll bar, etc. In one example, the GUI 500 is displayed in a client application such as a web browser, mobile application, or desktop application. The GUI 500 is provided by an online social networking service and/or online map service in some configurations.
[0045] The illustration of FIG. 5 provides an example in which a user has previously entered a search query in a client application 505 using an address 510. The map 530 is displayed in the GUI 500 with an indicator 535 identifying the requested address 510. Search queries may be entered in the search box 540. Points of interest indicators 520 and 525 are displayed on the map. The selection of points of interest indicators 520 and 525 may be determined based on the current zoom level of map 530, a rank of the point of interest, and the search query.
[0046] Using the subject technology, points of interest indicators on the map that have unredeemed offers associated with the user 545 of the application are enhanced, such as the enhanced indicator of point of interest 520, which is shaded differently from point of interest indicators 525, which do not have unredeemed offers associated with them. Types of
enhancements for an indicator of a point of interest also include changing the color, size, or
shape of the indicator of the point of interest in the display of the map. Multiple enhancements may be made to a single indicator. Text box 515 is associated with point of interest 520, which displays information associated with the user's unredeemed offer and point of interest 520. User 545 may have unredeemed offers within the geographic area displayed that are not displayed on map 530 based on the associated point of interest's ranking and the map 530's current zoom level.
[0047] FIG. 6 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some
implementations of the subject technology are implemented. Electronic system 600 can be a computer, phone, PDA, or any other sort of electronic device. Such an electronic system includes various types of computer readable media and interfaces for various other types of computer readable media. Electronic system 600 includes a bus 608, processing unit(s) 612, a system memory 604, a read-only memory (ROM) 610, a permanent storage device 602, an input device interface 614, an output device interface 606, and a network interface 616.
[0048] Bus 608 collectively represents all system, peripheral, and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices of electronic system 600. For instance, bus 608 communicatively connects processing unit(s) 612 with ROM 610, system memory 604, and permanent storage device 602.
[0049] From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 612 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the subject technology. The processing unit(s) can be a single processor or a multi-core processor in different
implementations.
[0050] ROM 610 stores static data and instructions that are needed by processing unit(s) 612 and other modules of the electronic system. Permanent storage device 602, on the other hand, is
a read-and-write memory device. This device is a non-volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when electronic system 600 is off. Some implementations of the subject technology use a mass-storage device (such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive) as permanent storage device 602.
[00511 Other implementations use a removable storage device (such as a floppy disk, flash drive, and its corresponding disk drive) as permanent storage device 602. Like permanent storage device 602, system memory 604 is a read-and-write memory device. However, unlike storage device 602, system memory 604 is a volatile read-and-write memory, such as a random access memory. System memory 604 stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some implementations, the processes of the subject technology are stored in system memory 604, permanent storage device 602, and/or ROM 610. For example, the various memory units include instructions for indicating an unredeemed offer on a map in accordance with some implementations. From these various memory units, processing unit(s) 612 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some
implementations.
[0052] Bus 608 also connects to input and output device interfaces 614 and 606. Input device interface 614 enables the user to communicate information and select commands to the electronic system. Input devices used with input device interface 614 include, for example, alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices (also called "cursor control devices")- Output device interface 606 enables, for example, the display of images generated by the electronic system 600. Output devices used with output device interface 606 include, for example, printers and display devices, such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) or liquid crystal displays (LCD). Some
implementations include devices such as a touchscreen that functions as both input and output devices.
[0053] Finally, as shown in FIG. 6, bus 608 also couples electronic system 600 to a network (not shown) through a network interface 616. In this manner, the computer can be a part of a network of computers such as a local area network ("LAN"), a wide area network ("WAN"), or an Intranet, or a network of networks, such as the Internet. Any or all components of electronic system 600 can be used in conjunction with the subject technology.
[0054] These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in computer software, firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be included in or packaged as mobile devices. The processes and logic flows can be performed by one or more programmable processors and by one or more programmable logic circuitry. General and special purpose computing devices and storage devices can be interconnected through communication networks.
[0055] Some implementations include electronic components, such as microprocessors, storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium (alternatively referred to as computer-readable storage media, machine-readable media, or machine-readable storage media). Some examples of such computer-readable media include RAM, ROM, read-only compact discs (CD-ROM), recordable compact discs (CD-R), rewritable compact discs (CD-RW), read-only digital versatile discs (e.g., DVD-ROM, dual-layer DVD-ROM), a variety of recordable/rewritable DVDs (e.g., DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.), flash memory (e.g., SD cards, mini-SD cards, micro-SD cards, etc.), magnetic and/or solid state hard drives, read-only and recordable Blu-Ray® discs, ultra density
optical discs, any other optical or magnetic media, and floppy disks. The computer-readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code, such as is produced by a compiler, and files including higher-level code that are executed by a computer, an electronic component, or a microprocessor using an interpreter.
[0056] While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessors or multi-core processors that execute software, some implementations are performed by one or more integrated circuits, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In some implementations, such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.
[0057] As used in this specification and any claims of this application, the terms
"computer", "server", "processor", and "memory" all refer to electronic or other technological devices. These terms exclude people or groups of people. For the purposes of the specification, the terms display or displaying means displaying on an electronic device. As used in this specification and any claims of this application, the terms "computer readable medium" and "computer readable media" are entirely restricted to tangible, physical objects that store information in a form that is readable by a computer. These terms exclude any wireless signals, wired download signals, and any other ephemeral signals.
[0058] To provide for interaction with a user, implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can
provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
[0059] Aspects of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network ("LAN") and a wide area network ("WAN"), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
[0060] The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some aspects, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the
client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.
[0061] It is understood that any specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes disclosed is an illustration of example approaches. Based upon design preferences, it is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps in the processes may be rearranged, or that all illustrated steps be performed. Some of the steps may be performed simultaneously. For example, in certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the aspects described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all aspects, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
[0062] The previous description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to practice the various aspects described herein. Various modifications to these aspects will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other aspects. Thus, the claims are not intended to be limited to the aspects shown herein, but are to be accorded the full scope consistent with the language claims, wherein reference to an element in the singular is not intended to mean "one and only one" unless specifically so stated, but rather "one or more." Unless specifically stated otherwise, the term "some" refers to one or more. Pronouns in the masculine (e.g., his) include the feminine and neuter gender (e.g., her and its) and vice versa. Headings and subheadings, if any, are used for convenience only and do not limit the subject technology.
