At selling wireless during the time spot, if radio station is the part of radio station's network, then this radio station may be only can sell them oneself the radio station or the time of radio station group.In addition, single radio platform or the radio station's network radio that usually may only cater to given age colony, education degree, income level or H/S is listened to the crowd.Because radio station and radio station's network can be according to the features of colony, only cater to specific audience colony, therefore be chosen in and carry out the importance that advertisement is advertising campaign on which radio station and the wireless network.Therefore, in order to reach the listenership of expectation target, advertiser may need to buy the Wireless Advertisement time from a plurality of radio stations or network.This just makes advertiser study radio station and/or chooses the suitable radio station that operates its propaganda activity thereon, and this advertiser for the advertising campaign that has huge and/or high target is very difficult and/or expensive.
And advertiser can determine on particular radio station the running propaganda activity and not have the knowledge or the information of too many audience types about radio station.This can cause advertiser optionally to select radio station or network to carry out advertisement, and/or unwise and spend the advertisement fund lavishly.
Therefore, need a kind of organized special method to select to buy the radio station of Wireless Advertisement time to it.Advertiser also needs to determine audience's feature of radio station and network, so that needn't study in person.In addition, need a kind of like this method, this method allows advertiser to make the selection of specialty according to their desirable target audience type, allow advertiser with other features of given age colony, education degree, income level, family's feature or the audience of radio station as target.
Equally, the frequent spended time negotiation of advertiser is to strive for better Wireless Advertisement rate or price.Though the price of Wireless Advertisement and rate are very important for advertiser, negotiating mission also may be heavy for advertiser, and its possibility of result is unpredictable in the past along with the time.Therefore, need reduce or eliminate about the rate of Wireless Advertisement time and predictable and/or stable Wireless Advertisement and the negotiating mission of price.
In addition, unsold advertisement stock every day often operates in radio station, such as public service ads, advertisement with lottery, unsold and/or remaining advertisement and preemption advertisement, these stocks are for example owing to MDF, lower audience rating, radio station inefficiency, transaction flow guarantee, program guarantee and third-party variable factor etc. cause.These every days, unsold advertisement stock on average through calculating may be up to 30% of advertisement every day radix.
Especially, local station can be packed advertisement in proper order in business process system, when these advertisement arrangements conflict with the timetable daily record, will produce neutral gear and room.This may be owing to do not arrange advertisement to cause during a certain period.Usually system utilizes public service ads, advertisement and/or other advertisement of low priority are filled these neutral gears to arrange full timetable with lottery.
Up to now, those skilled in the art do not know that also a kind of effective monitoring and monetization do not sell stock's mechanism.Therefore, need a kind ofly use schedule file and utilize charges paid advertisement replacement not sell the stock does not sell the stock with monetization system and method.
A lot of broadcaster and advertiser manage broadcasting and advertising campaign difficultly, and try hard to discern which broadcasting and advertisement is effectively, and which is broadcasted and advertisement is not effective may to the more important thing is identification.Very unfortunately, advertiser does not also have accurately a kind of and machine-processed timely input or the broadcast of monitoring and follow the tracks of their advertising campaign at present, says nothing of the reaction to their propaganda activity.This problem may worsen in broadcast radio, and wherein the affirmation that advertising campaign is thrown in or broadcasted may can not received in several weeks by advertiser after arranging its propaganda activity of running.So far those skilled in the art also do not know a kind of can for advertiser provide real-time, customizable and accurately the report automated system, which Wireless Advertisement propaganda activity these reports relate to and program or is thrown in, in which radio station and when play.
Up to the present, in order to discern and to follow the tracks of where and when by aerial Wireless Advertisement propaganda activity and the radio program of selecting that broadcast, its effort of doing comprises using and is deployed in the computer automation of geographic market or manually listens to the post and write down, do daily record and analyze by aerial radio broadcasting, thus the program of discerning song, advertisement and selecting.Advertiser can get in touch to receive about playing the report of what advertisement and radio program with broadcasting monitoring company.This mechanism is easy to make mistakes, efficient is low and untimely.Often not free wait of concern increase sales volume, the marketer that drives product and demand for services and advertisers reported generation, even especially after report by the time, when this report but may comprise deviation and mistake.
By seeking optional advertisement opportunity, advertiser may implement expensive advertising campaign in the timetable of arranging very fullly, and may need to experience in certain radio station or the input or the broadcasting of certain market failure.If whether advertiser can examine its propaganda activity at once and be thrown in, this method perhaps can realize.Mensal recitation or report often are not enough to satisfy gray needs.The key message that report does not often catch advertiser to need, the scale information of adding up the overall audience who classifies with geographic factor per capita in the time of all can not providing advertisement putting usually in these reports at least.Listen to or the service of reporting all can't obtain this information usually by any existing Wireless Advertisement and program.But this information may have key very valuable and very much for advertiser.Advertiser may be more prone to discern the audience that listens to advertisement and potential consumer, and with these results directly and reaction and sales volume compare.Up to now, those skilled in the art also do not know a kind of effective mechanism for advertiser's monitoring and the input of tracking Wireless Advertisement.Therefore, need a kind ofly can provide system and method real-time, customizable and that report accurately for broadcaster/advertiser, these reports relate to has thrown in which broadcasting and advertising campaign and program, comprise station information, make broadcaster/advertiser can discern the audience of broadcast listening or advertisement and those potential consumers, and can with these results directly and reaction and sales volume compare.

In addition, mixed-media network modules mixed-media can be designed to make the influence to the existing network configuration to minimize.For example, present ubiquity two complete equipments: Scott Studios and Maestro are arranged in the industry.It is favourable not needing when being connected to each in these original systems to redesign arbitrary system.
Can use such as local agent or the local any network model that connects a class.Use the connection of local agent needn't require the internet to connect, and instead may only require and be connected to Local Area Network.A computer on this LAN can have two network interface cards, and one of them is communicated by letter with described local agent, and local agent is in turn communicated by letter with described data center via encrypting only departures connection.On the other hand, directly connection may require ONU On-Air Workstation to have the internet to connect, and can provide only to set off and be connected to data center.
As can be seen from Figure 3, the local agent encryption that can be provided to data center connects and reduces the flow of whole network.Described local agent can use Scott Studios to be connected in company with the encryption safe that local agent is established to data center together with Maestro.In order to connect, Scott Studios or Maestro can be present in together with the home agent module in the network in each automation of broadcast continuity work station.Be connected in order to set up with the encryption of data center, these modules can rely on work station to obtain special-purpose inside automated system LAN and be connected the corporate lan that separates with the internet.Also can have a multi-homed host device, also be that this machine has two network interface cards and can two networks of perception.In major part was installed, described multi-homed host device is scheduler or server normally.This configuration can be the hardware configuration of Scott Studios.Along with module and hardware/network configuration put in place, Scott Studios and Maestro can attempt being connected to described local agent automatically.This local agent can in turn be attempted setting up encryption with data center and be connected.Local agent can be designed so that to be provided for automated system LAN and corporate lan with the default network of this multi-homed host device.Therefore, these network settings can most ofly keep constant.In addition, local agent can rely on Hostname and be to use the IP address to be connected to data center.Therefore do not need the DNS configuration.If any described default setting is stoped from the departures Internet traffic of described multi-homed host device by corporate lan instead, if perhaps stop to come from entering the station of automated system LAN and be communicated to this multihomed computer, can revise the network settings of this local agent so.If revised these default settings, may need extra change so, such as: multihomed computer is for example gone up departures at port 443 (HTTPS) by corporate lan and is connected to the internet; Multihomed computer for example sets off on port one 0,000 by corporate lan and is connected to the internet; Multihomed computer for example sets off on port 80 by corporate lan and is connected to the internet; The on-air work station for example sets off on port one 0,000 by inner automated system LAN and is connected to multihomed computer; Multihomed computer is for example accepted the communication of entering the station from inner automated system LAN on port one 0,000.In this configuration, home agent module can be used the outbound data of designated port guiding by the encryption of internet.For example, port 443 (HTTPS) and 10,000 station information that can be used to transmit encryption is communicated by letter with module controls.The selection that can optimize between these ports comes conserve system resources.Port 80 can be used for downloading the unencrypted media file from data center.Disposed after the network in radio station, described automation of broadcast continuity work station can be connected to data center automatically by home agent module.
As can be seen from Figure 4, directly connection can be used for not following the radio station and the radio station cluster of the automated system hardware configuration of recommending ScottStudios and Maestro equipment, had the radio station that the internet connects in each ONU On-Air Workstation, perhaps be used for can not or the radio station of non-selected configuration of home agent model.Directly connection can use the Scott Studios in each ONU On-Air Workstation to be connected with the safety that the Maestro module is established to data center.For the safety of setting up described and data center is connected, the direct connection that each automation of broadcast continuity work station can use the internet has the inlet to network.When suitable communication module being installed and exist the internet to connect, described module can attempt outwards being connected to data center automatically.Directly connection can be designed so that the default network setting with ONU On-Air Workstation, and can rely on Hostname and be to use the IP address to be connected to described data center.For those of ordinary skill in the related art, clearly use the IP address needing can avoid the DNS configuration.ONU On-Air Workstation can for example set off on port one 0,000 by corporate lan and be connected to the internet.ONU On-Air Workstation can for example set off on port 80 by corporate lan and be connected to the internet.Directly connection can use these designated ports to guide a unencryption outbound data by the internet.For example, http communication can send on port 80 and be used for transmission radio station information and from data center's downloads of media file.Port one 0,000 can be used for transport communication information.In case be configured the network in described radio station, described automation of broadcast continuity work station just can automatically be directly connected to data center.
Another aspect of the present invention is an advertisement purchasing environment shown in Figure 5, comprise local, country with network on the advertisement buyer.Notice that the local buyer can buy single advertisement in particular radio station.The buyer of country can spell out the advertisement that will buy in specific associated wireless radio station group.The network buyer can buy the advertisement in all the associating radio station in the network, such as in wireless syndication show surroundings.In giving embodiment, the advertisement buyer can buy the insertion order, adds " operation flow " corresponding to purchase order advertiser request.Wireless traffic can come the arrangement progress by traffic software.For example, based on gray request, traffic software can be arranged in distributes three periods in period to play a certain particular advertisement three of the week every days on working day.Obviously, in case the advertisement stock sets up, for example, will produce conflict between the ad-request at peak period or extremely desirable playtime.
In order to handle these conflicts, traffic software can change the position of the advertisement of these requests, with the income (certainly, in valuable time and the advertisement on valuable date can bring value higher income) of maximization from the generation of special time particular advertisement.Traffic software can be edited the bulleted list that will broadcast, and each project in wherein tabulating can be assigned with a montage that is used for the broadcast in the tabulation is linked and number.In typical embodiment, can carry out manual coordination at least one time to the text of forming by traffic log every day.
Another aspect of the present invention is a radio play environment shown in Figure 6.The environment of Fig. 6 can comprise traffic log (such as above-mentioned), program log, merging application, play application, main timetable, trace log and remote application automatically, and described remote application for example comprises the outside input of tone tracking, satellite and FTP one class.Shown traffic log, program log and main timetable can preferably include the broadcast sign corresponding to each imminent broadcast.
Traffic log can for example be handled by traffic software previously discussed.Program log can comprise being about to by broadcasting the program of broadcast such as song one class.Main timetable can comprise the affirmation to the medium that are about to play, and for example confirms that the identification number that is included in traffic log and the program log is effective playitems playitem.Among the typical embodiment, can merge traffic log, program log and for example create described main timetable by any neutral gear of automatic application filling thereby merge to use.This main timetable can be directed to automatic application, and automatically use the input that monitors radio station and from the output of radio station so that broadcast by broadcasting channel.When generating output by broadcasting channel, playing daily record can generate based on the output of automatic application.Before charge advertisers, can monitor the output of this broadcast daily record and correctly play by automatic application to guarantee advertisement.
Among the embodiment discussed above, application can be controlled the final output of passing through broadcasting channel of radio play automatically.For example automatically application can switch to local channel or the Internet channel from satellite channel, thereby and then switches back the broadcast that obtains from diverse location so that it is incorporated in the automatic broadcast.This broadcast that is received by automatic application can comprise and not comprise radio play but comprise metadata channel about the information of the radio play in the traffic log.For example, metadata channel can infer that " the hard interruption " will appear in the long distance wireless source still is " soft interruption ".Soft interruption can be the option of radio characteristics for example, and hard the interruption can not be selected.Similarly, in illustrative examples, the wireless displaying of syndication can obtain local the broadcast with the form of compact disk, and perhaps arrival is used automatically and can be comprised the metadata channel that comprises about satellite play information via satellite.Therefore, from the embodiment that remote spots initiate to be play, it is that specific project is inserted in the broadcast of other long-range generation that this metadata channel can allow local station.Among this embodiment, application can be switched back one section limited setting-up time of this this locality broadcast generation point automatically, and described in the meantime local broadcast point can be generated to local playitems playitem the broadcast of described long-range generation in addition.In case finish the local playback period of metadata indication, application for example can be switched back satellite channel so that the recovery remote playing automatically.Like this, in the modal embodiment of this radio application, can be from all broadcasts of all positions by automatic application controls, and also application can provide all to play all correctly affirmations of broadcast by playing daily record automatically.
Among some embodiment, the traffic log that feeds back to automatic application can comprise one or more " puppet " file.The position of this " puppet " file can comprise the placeholder that allows map information, for example by the internet and/or by FTP mapping remote information.This mapping can be included in the boundling of telefile and/or local file a mapping position.To play and so on the fact although can not know position that this locality is applied in described " puppet " file automatically exactly, this mapping position cannot stay open, and can keep closing.
And, can rely on the channel of presenting by one or more metadata channel to switch indication and insert advertisement.For example, many region advertisements, wherein every region advertisement is exclusively used in one or more areas of this country's appointment, can play simultaneously introducing on a series of channels of using automatically, such as at channel 4 to 8.Syndication's radio programming for example can introduced broadcast simultaneously on the channel of using automatically 3.When take place interrupting, according to traffic log and metadata channel, metadata channel can comprise at each area and switches to its corresponding indication of introducing by the advertisement channel of regional classification at intercourse on channel 3.For example, be positioned at philadelphia, pa, can be instructed to switch to channel 4 so that on channel 4, play the region advertisement by metadata channel during the interruption program of channel 3 in the radio station that channel 3 is play syndication's program.Simultaneously, at the same intercourse of the program of channel 3, the radio station that is positioned at Los Angeles can be instructed to switch to channel 8 so that be that this area plays the region advertisement then by metadata on channel 8.Among this embodiment, when the interruption of channel 3 was finished, all radio station that participate in channel 3 broadcast syndication programs can be instructed to automatic switchover is returned channel 3 to continue to play described syndication program by metadata.Similarly, advertisement can be sold by playing with certain order at specific channel, and when on the channel of playing at that time, taking place to interrupt, thus the advertisement channel that can switch to this sale allow to play any amount that between the interruption window phase that this broadcasting channel distributes, can play sell advertisement.In case the EOI of this broadcasting channel, automatically application can be instructed to switch back described broadcasting channel from the advertisement channel of selling, and can when switch to this advertisement channel next time, follow the broadcast next one definite sell advertisement.
In one embodiment, metadata can be uploaded at specific channel and send, and program can transmit on a plurality of other channels.Among this embodiment, can the modulation element data channel broadcast to another channel, and when the interruption of soft interruption one class took place according to metadata channel, this metadata self can require the data on metadata channel or another channel are inserted into current broadcasting channel.When according to metadata channel this interruption having taken place, local source can for example be inserted into local advertising current broadcasting channel, for example by switching to local channel at the intercourse according to metadata channel.
The switching of automatic application according to switchover policy mentioned above can allow the radio play preemption.In existing broadcast embodiment, if the special time of this class requires to interrupt at noon on Friday, the channel that will take place so to interrupt must be monitored continuously, and the metadata that the channel of interruption takes place also must should be monitored continuously, thereby guarantees to interrupt at the appointed time taking place.Among the embodiment described herein, can carry out in real time, like this, no longer need to distribute the broadcast of time, especially the broadcast of advertisement or information bit channel monitoring such as metadata channel one class.Especially, even during the broadcast of long-range introducing on the channel that separates, the monitoring of metadata channel also can provide sufficient information to make and switch to advertisement or optional broadcasting channel according to the metadata that arrives.Therefore, among the embodiment formerly, must be pre-existing in the understanding that the centering broken hair is given birth to, any action of this interruption all must be monitored.And among the embodiment that discusses herein, do not need to be pre-existing in understanding to interrupting.More properly, discuss herein among the ground embodiment, system of the present invention can learn and obtain when the understanding of preemption taking place, and can select correct preemption in real time when it takes place based on the interruption that took place at that time during playing.Like this, prior art is only inserted in preset time, and the present invention can preempt in real time in the study based on to playing programs the time.
In order to allow correctly to learn and preempt, the present invention can comprise study module and preemption module, and these modules can be arranged on any one some place of the intrasystem a plurality of points of aforementioned radio play.For example, these modules can be arranged on traffic log place, main log place, merge and answer use or answer use automatically.But, be to utilize the position of more making money to replace position unsold or that profit is low excessively because use the purpose of these modules, so the regular operation of setting in the module must be available on the set-point of these modules.Therefore, although these modules can be arranged in traffic log or the main log, the advertising rate data are all unavailable at this two place usually, and all can not be used for operation under the situation about influencing not merged to use at this two place.In addition, answer use that these modules are set in merging and may allow to merge rule and replace the broadcast position that some is unsold or other are empty, thereby cancelled module is replaced unsold or other empty positions with the advertisement of more making money function with song or other information.Therefore, in order to allow to use automatically a series of metadata rules of obeying about the traffic log of the replacement and the merging of reappraising, described module is arranged in the automatic application or unites with automatic application will be very useful.
The module that is arranged in the automatic application can allow the long-range automatic broadcast of checking that this is real-time, make it possible in real time current broadcast be reappraised, thereby and with the assessment of current broadcast with local or be arranged in long-range rate and the rate timetable compares the information of revising or replacing this real-time playlist by the preemption mode.This preemption can be based on realizing to one-tenth this rule or other rules in the automatic application by an ad-in module or a plurality of module application.
But, because the evaluation time of in merge using broadcast being assessed can change according to the inherent delay in the radio play, so these modules just can not be assessed or play to identify evaluate correct occupying in advance service time.Therefore, these modules can preferably have the second available source, and this second source is presented at current broadcast on the wireless position and by the real time output data of described module monitors.Like this, described module just can be the correct play position of preemption assessment, and can monitor with true newspaper this then and occupy in advance and receive preemption at correct point.This shows that second information source of playing in real time can receive from a plurality of positions.For example, playing output journal can be by monitoring in real time with the evaluation broadcast of generation at that time.But, even this output journal also may suffer some delay or defective, and can not provide real play instruction in real time equally.Alternatively, when taking place to play stock's request in real time, these modules can be from using self these broadcast stock request in real time of interior examination automatically.For example, automatically application can preset time from the specific broadcast of given position request, and should the time and the position can be checked by these modules and itself and playlist compared so that accurately evaluate the comparison of described playlist and the broadcast that took place at that time in real time, and can revise any preemption according to any delay or the unsuitable situation of evaluation.
In a further embodiment,, merging can eliminate most of any available not selling or the empty broadcast period because using, thus preferably answer use to insert described module in merging, rather than wait should be used for finding automatically.But, in such an embodiment, in addition, merge the rate of using the broadcast that also can require available rate tabulation and current distribution.In addition, owing to be not to play from merging to use, but play from automatic application, therefore may need to estimate to get back to and merge the inherent delay of using from automatic application, answer use to carry out the module of preemption so that allow to answer automatically the real-time monitoring of stock's request of use to be applied to described merging.In addition, these modules can be arranged by the Local or Remote rule of any amount no matter answer use still answering use automatically in merging.This merging answer use can with rule allow to merge the preemption rate of answering use and change, thereby allowing to merge uses the quantity of using the unsold or empty period of filling by merging such as changing by the dependence with time or date.For example, high more in the how unsold more or empty period possibility cost efficiency of filling peak period for given radio station with respect to all the other times in one day, because can bring higher rate from advertiser peak period.Like this, based on answer use to carry out the control of the module of preemption in merging, wishing to see from the visual angle of radio station in the quantity that merging answers use to be filled into the unsold or empty period of peak period can be higher, perhaps sees still less from gray visual angle.
Another aspect of the present invention is a media play function shown in Figure 7, and wherein the medium of Bo Fanging can change based on the action of the one or more receivers that receive the medium play at once.Herein term wireless content of Shi Yonging and broadcasting or broadcasted content can comprise any kind pass through the sense of hearing, vision or computer output present to one or more these output contents receiver medium and in current layout or layout in advance the medium to play.The non-wireless content of the term of Shi Yonging, non-broadcasting herein or broadcast non-given content can comprise any medium and current layout or the medium of layout in advance to play of presenting to the receiver of one or more these contents by the sense of hearing, vision or computer output.
As shown in Figure 7, network center also can visit plurality of kinds of contents, comprises non-wireless and wireless content.This content can be local concerning network center, be can be from any one acquisition of multiple source to network center perhaps, these sources include but not limited to Intranet, the Internet, satellite channel, FTP or the compressed file that can be visited by this network center according to one or more orders relevant with network center guiding media play.Can there be a plurality of parts in described network center, especially this network center can be the module of any amount that resides in the position of any amount, is visited as long as all these positions can reside in locational at least one module that is about to carry out this media play.
Further, described network center can visit a plurality of second information, and the success or the failure of media play can be obtained and be indicated according to pre-defined rule to some information in these information in real time.Media play like this, subsequently can change according to the success or the failure of before radio play.
In certain exemplary embodiments, described network center can visit the playlist of at least one radio studio that is arranged at least one city's Performance Area.A plurality of radio stations can be used for the single network center, and city's Performance Area can be any geographic zone that includes but not limited to such as city, country or state one class.In this embodiment, described network center can partly guide the playlist of described one or more radio stations, will be by the position of this radio station's broadcast according to playlist such as preempting than the content of the more possible gamble pays off of the play content that is preempted on the playlist according to pre-defined rule by the intelligence insertion.
In this example, the described playlist of radio station can comprise advertisement broadcast and music usually.It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that listenership reduces when beginning to play advertisement usually, and listenership increases during continuous playing back music in the radio station.Certainly, exception is arranged also, the listenership of radio station descends when wherein playing non-popular song.In addition, very interesting or the audience is very interested if advertisement is popular such as advertisement wherein, even so during playing advertisement listenership can not descend yet.Similarly, the audience of radio station can come by the behavior of taking advertisement to advise this advertisement is made a response, and for example stops to buy the food of food company or buys in particular retail company.
According to all these information and other information available, such as the vehicle that well known to a person skilled in the art the crossroad that content that real-time audio monitoring radio platform audience is listening to, Voice Surveillance are crowded, described network center can be according to the playlist of some this radio station of pre-defined rule real time modifying.For example, if the listenership of particular radio station begins to descend, then network center can determine the advertisement with the original plan broadcast of pop music preemption.Therefore, the listenership of this radio station will rise.When audience's number reaches specified level, owing to a large amount of audiences, for advertiser, can be suitable for extra advertisement rate, and can use the more advertisement of high price to preempt described music in this stage in order to maximize the described network center of ad revenue.Therefore, when the needs of position and advertisement rate were very high, radio station can create more advertisement position increased ad revenue.And, only be ready to pay can be in the time period to greatest extent that this advertiser can pay than the advertiser of cheap rate advertisement delivery.
As just nonrestrictive example, advertiser may wish that their advertisement need not consider the period in one day, only surpasses at 100,000 o'clock in listenership and plays.By using some pre-defined rule, for example in case satisfy or surpass 100,000 audiences' that advertiser sets thresholding, thereby the playlist that described network center can this radio station of real time modifying preempts music intelligently.In case play this advertisement, network center will turn back to music or continue to play advertisement.
Can obviously find out according to foregoing description, for the change of visiting any hope in the playlist can be excavated various sources.For example, the pop music download by some internet site assessment can provide about what is the fabulous guidance that most popular wireless music is play in the given time.Obviously, not playing back music but play most popular music and can increase in this given time listenership that is radio station and bring huge repayment simply in the given time.And the preemption of this intelligence and the embodiment of insertion make network center make decision more accurately.For example, can collect higher advertising rate to the advertisement that is close to the popular song that this radio station can play.Described network center also can limit some content with the control advertising rates, for example by only play the pop music of limited quantity in cycle preset time.By further example, both can according to real-time measurement or set advertising rate based on the actual audience number that broadcasted content is estimated.
According to the present invention, can in comprising any media play environment in any wireless source, implement the insertion of intelligence.For example, can be inserted in the conditions of similarities such as cellular telephone environment, SMS environment, WiMax environment, radio station's environment, iPod environment.This media play is inserted and can be comprised such as song, message, news, traffic conditions, motion or weather renewal, one or more reward voucher (coupons) or instant message.
For being made on the playlist preemption and/or inserting feedback and the available information that decision provides, also make it possible to create the project templet that is arranged on this media play list.For example, can follow the tracks of reaction, in fact can in a large amount of varying environments, follow the tracks of some media play on the playlist.For example, it is better that the reaction of the advertisement with particular form that radio station is thrown in may be compared the reaction with multi-form advertisement that radio station throws in.In this situation, for example, may be better in the response in old-fashioned radio station for the advertisement putting that is positioned at the travelling in spring vacation than throwing in preceding 40 radio station.And the reaction for some adline in some environment may be relatively good, such as under some weather condition or some traffic conditions.Equally, some advertiser may wish that their advertisement only broadcasts under certain weather pattern condition, such as the rainy day condition, perhaps only broadcast under certain traffic, during such as traffic jam.
As mentioned above, use the reaction feedback can be the media play development goal template of particular type under the specific existing environmental condition that when media play, exists.For example, can be used for To Template for wish advertiser's foundation that advertisement is achieved success in specific crowd.These To Templates for example can be used for maximizing the repayment of advertisement and market value, and for example also can be used for assessing provides the best per minute objective cost of repaying etc. for the advertisement expenditure.Can sell advertiser with this template then, make those advertisers can create targeted advertisements to greatest extent.
Another aspect of the present invention is the same parallel architecture that is used for media play shown in Figure 7.In the figure, all can obtain media play synchronization arbitrary from a plurality of positions, similarly, identical or other a plurality of positions all can obtain the indication of media play at those at this synchronization.Like this, such as in radio station's environment based on playlist generation radio play, media play list can comprise the reference point in token, label or the media play list, and this reference point can be indicated other positions the outgoing position that takes place except media play.
Described position reference can be indicated any point except that playing output, such as the position of the streaming medium content of song or advertisement one class or can comprise the position of the rule that is used for follow-up play or can serve as go to second external position intermediate to obtain the position of media play.Can provide with any way well known by persons skilled in the art for choosing of external reference point, such as linking the external reference that provides in the metatag data of media play of a class to follow such as HTML, FTP or VXML, can be as guiding this media play output to the popular label of desired locations.For example, can be in playlist one or more parts at grid of reference center, and the memory access of media play subsequently can serve as in described network center.Described reference also helps aforesaid insertion.Therefore, although looking like at the media play output point, the position of playlist is filled into merging application or application automatically, and in fact filler is the reference point of indication network center, and can making decision immediately, what content the position of reference point can obtain and play on playlist.
For example can generate the single reference point that is used for a plurality of positions, and these reference points are provided for a plurality of media play or non-media play position.For example, the metatag data may be incorporated in the reference point of a plurality of positions generation and can be assigned to any position more then.As just nonrestrictive example, described metatag data can comprise that real-time listenership and described metatag data can point to a network center with the control media play and point to second network center to create the information of indication occupation rate of market and/or advertising rate.
As just nonrestrictive example, position reference can generate by the action that the audience taked of this media play.For example, this audience can transfer to a handset call to come in response to these medium, and the external reference of communicating by letter with the broadcast output point by the VXML server has been created in this calling.Other action example can comprise that using smart card to buy commodity, audience's broadcast listening media play and use SMS enters match.
Another aspect of the present invention is the information flow in the communication system shown in Fig. 1 and 2 300 shown in Figure 8.Information flow 300 comprises two principle zones, RAS 230 and flow process 310.RAS 230 can comprise timetable file 320 and audio file 330.Flow process 310 can comprise audio advertisement files 340, distributor 350 and master controller 360.The numeral of the arrow of reference sign represent message flow is described described information flow.
Reside in first chain agency 370 among the RAS 230 can transmission information to flow process 310.The retrieval of this schedule file 320 can be referring to the link 4 by Fig. 8.This information can be sent to parsing and the storing step that is positioned at flow process 310.Because the chain of RAS agency 370 can read schedule file 320, so described file can be transferred to flow process 310.Can from schedule file 320, parse dB can preempt advertisement benefit (dB benefit) and with its storage with further processing.Original schedule file 320 can be stored and be used to the purpose of charging, keeping accounts and auditing.Illustrating and describe this parsing and the storage that occur in the flow process 310 can realize at broadcasting studio 140 places.
After parsing and memory scheduling file, described information can be transferred to IMS, and advertising campaign is assigned in the schedule file 320 in IMS.This transmission can have label 5 to illustrate and cut can to occur in the flow process 310.This represents that described dB benefit is sent to IMS.Not only collect in central position and not sell stock report, this middle position of tracking advertising effectiveness can be published to the result each radio station, and the software of local station can use this information to carry out intelligence in not selling the stock to insert.Available advertisement may need to be published or to be sent to radio station 140, and radio station 140 may need to receive about the just local according to this engine of the actual figure of these propaganda activities and can make decision.
Similarly, after resolving and storing described schedule file, validator is checked possible scheduling mistake.Information to described validator transmits by mark 6 expressions.At in the label construction, the label frequency, should use up the wrong and known mistake of other persons of ordinary skill in the relevant of contractual obligation such as the radio station of each issue minimum advertisement position quantity one class, described validator can be imported this information and analyze schedule file 320.This checking that occurs in the flow process 310 is shown can be network center's 150 local generations.Described validator can be with whether effective information is exported to IMS about this schedule file 320.This validity feedback is by mark 23 expressions.In case IMS receives suitable response from validator, IMS can be by distributing the dB advertisement and specify intention to handle this new dB benefit for the dB benefit of appointment.This IMS that betides in the flow process 310 is shown can be network center's 150 local generations.
After described IMS is assigned to schedule file with propaganda activity, can finish processing, and the information that sends to distributor in the timetable is by mark 25 expressions.The result of dB benefit can be the dB timetable of specifying each radio station.Illustrate and occur in the flow process 310 this and be created in network center's 150 local generations.
Issue after the described timetable, shown in mark 7, information can be sent to master controller.This master controller is used for the control centre that does not sell advertisement position behind that preempts at described dB calendar file as " transaction ".This master controller can receive about the radio station is current and just originate in the song that comprises advertisement of play content.This master controller can use this source to determine that at the current scheduling file where the radio station.This master controller can be managed the replacement advertisement, in case and this position allowed just to gain original advertisement.The appearance that the master controller that appears in the flow process 310 can network center 150 this locality is shown.
Shown in mark 8,9 and 2, can create reponse system and create new timetable.This transmission paths can transmit information (mark 8) to distributor from master controller, transmits (mark 9) from distributor to second chain agency 380, and transmits to first chain agency 370 from second chain agency 380.Therefore, may have the timetable in given radio station, the master controller indication occupies in advance and the master controller indication recovers it after broadcast the position of this preemption.This master controller can be inquired about the dB timetable in given radio station, identification the title of intention of planned operation, and pass course 8-9-2 is published to this radio station with these intention.The buffer of stores advertisements was creative to determine that this buffer has been stored institute before chain agency can check.Prepare to be preempted if master controller is determined the position, it sends to notify with regard to pass course 8-9-2 and indicates the chain agency that intention one is changed to intention two so.Described chain agency can confirm to receive this message by pass course 2-30.
Described chain agency manages the physics preemption procedures.The indication of preemption advertisement can be sent to audio file 330 by pass course 18.Chain agency can be by preserving original audio file X with original audio file X rename or the mode that moves to different directories in this document system.The preemption of described original audio file, dB position and arrangement can be copied in the catalogue with same file name.Although filename can be identical, being used to form the header information that RAS shows in the file can the inequality and actual advertisement with running of reflection.This header information can be discerned the content that is used to charge that writes in the RAS journal file, and described radio station can be known and preempts.In case this preemption is finished or failed for some reason, its state just can pass course 2-30 issue.Responsible transmission is called the chain agency about the song of radio station actual play content source of daily record, such as monitoring this source to understand the running that occupies in advance by being labeled as 22 route.In case this occupies in advance and operates, this chain agency can gain original advertisement and notify described master controller.
The feedback path of mark 2,31 makes the chain agency can determine whether audio file is available.The chain agency can pass course 30 request distributor give oneself transmission appointment intention.Distributor is by sending files and confirming this document unspoiled verification and make response in transmission course via route 9,2.
If validator can determine to exist mistake, then information can send so that notice makes a mistake by pass course 16.If in schedule file, find mistake,, can set up set of rule based on the type of mistake and the wrong radio station that produces and notify system and the personnel that eliminate wrong task that bear for example because the result that breach of contract or technical problem cause.
