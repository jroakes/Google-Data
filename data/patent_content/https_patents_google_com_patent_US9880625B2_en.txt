Definitions
- Devices of the type described above are used in a variety of applications.
- One example is the provision of haptic feedback in touch sensitive devices.
- the transducers are controlled to cause the panel to vibrate in order to provide haptic feedback to a user in response to the device being touched.
- the same panel may be used in the detection of touch.
- the same transducers may be used for sensing touch as the transducers used for generating the haptic feedback.
- separate transducers may be provided for touch sensing and haptic feedback generation respectively.
- Vibratory panels i.e. panels capable of producing or detecting vibrations, are also used in the generation and/or sensing of audio signals.
- devices comprising such panels may be used as, or form part of, speakers and/or microphones.
- a common use of haptic feedback is in hand held electronic devices such as phones and other communications devices having touch sensitive screens.
- the haptic feedback is provided to the user to confirm that a touch has been detected.
- a typical device capable of providing haptic feedback comprises a vibratory panel and two transducers mounted with respect to the panel so as to cause the panel to vibrate when energised. Electrical signals to be applied to the transducers are typically generated by a control chip providing signals on respective channels.
- the use of two transducers allows the possibility of “steering” the feedback in one dimension, i.e. to control to some degree the point on the screen where the haptic feedback vibration peaks. This can be done by using the relative strengths of signals applied to the two transducers to control the point on the screen at which the peak of the vibration occurs.
- haptic feedback In some situations it is desired for haptic feedback to be silent. In principle, with a two channel system, this could be achieved by ensuring that the signals on the two channels are out of phase. However, no steering would then be possible. It would therefore be advantageous to be able to reduce acoustic output in a haptic feedback system whilst still being able to steer the haptic feedback. Analogous problems occur with touch sensing and the generation or sensing of audio or acoustic signals.
- a panel for use in a vibratory panel device comprising a substrate, a layer of electroactive material applied to the substrate and a layer of material applied to the electroactive material forming separate active areas whereby signals may be applied to or received from respective areas of the electroactive material, wherein the layer of material forming the active areas forms at least three active areas comprising at least two primary active areas and at least one secondary active area, the secondary active area being positioned relative to the two primary active areas such that one or both of the following conditions is provided: at least one secondary active area can be driven to at least partially offset any net displacement of the panel caused by driving two of the primary active areas; and the at least one secondary active area can sense vibrations of the panel affecting both of the two primary active areas.

- Such responses may be:
- the number of degrees of freedom is related to the number of actuators or actuators provided for a vibratory panel device. If there are n actuators or active areas, it follows that there are n ⁇ 1 degrees of freedom.
- An example is a one actuator system that has zero degrees of freedom so you get what you get.
- a two actuator system has one degree of freedom, allowing different signals or adjustments to the level, phase and delay to manipulate the modal behaviour of the substrate. It is usual to spend the one degree of freedom to maximise haptic or acoustic response.
- the beam is provided with two transducers.
- the transducers can be energised to cause the beam to bend in a number of ways.
- the principle bending modes are monopole as shown in FIG. 1( b ) where the transducers are driven in the same direction, i.e. in phase and dipole as shown in FIG. 1( c ) where the transducers are driven in opposite directions or out of phase.
- the beam may be caused to vibrate in either mode, for example to provide haptic feedback e.g. in response to being touched. It is clear that the monopole mode results in the maximum displacement of the beam and hence the strongest haptic feedback.
- the large displacement of the beam occurs in the monopole mode and this can result in one or more side effects to the haptic feedback, otherwise referred to herein as an additional or secondary effect. For example this may result in an audible vibration, which is undesirable if silent operation is required.
- an audible vibration which is undesirable if silent operation is required.
- there are other possible common mode effects such as the vibration being transmitted through to the device housing. This can cause the device to vibrate audibly when placed on a surface.
- any acoustic effect accompanying haptic feedback is undesirable.
- haptics One way to avoid an acoustic effect in a device where haptic feedback is required (referred to below as “silent haptics”) is not to use the monopole mode. This can be achieved by ensuring that the signal channels controlling the transducers are always out of phase. However this has the drawback of resulting in a dead area or node where no haptic feedback can be provided. Also, where the channels are in phase it is possible to control the magnitudes of the signals to the respective transducers to vary where the displacement is at a maximum. Thus a degree of “steering” of the response is possible along the length of the beam. If the channels have to be out of phase this possibility of steering is lost.
- FIG. 1( d ) Another way to avoid the acoustic effect is through the use of an additional transducer, as shown in FIG. 1( d ) .
- the additional transducer is placed in the centre of the beam symmetrically between the transducers illustrated in FIG. 1( a ) .
- This symmetrical placement is preferred but not essential as will become clear in the following.
- haptic feedback and audio signal generation are two examples of the principle where the transducers are driven to cause the beam to vibrate.
- the principle can also be used in reverse, where the transducers sense vibration of the beam, for example due to touch or acoustic vibration (as in a microphone).
- an additional transducer can be used to eliminate unwanted signals such as common mode vibrations from a wanted signal.
- FIG. 2 shows schematically the basic components of a vibratory panel device.
- a vibratory panel device could be any device comprising a touch sensitive panel such as a hand held mobile communication device, e.g. smart phone, a larger device with a touch screen such as a tablet computing device, or any other device comprising a touch sensitive screen.
- the vibratory panel could be used to provide haptic feedback and/or for touch sensing.
- the vibratory panel device could also be designed to sense or generate audio signals and thus function as a speaker or microphone. Two or more of the functions described above could be incorporated into a single device.
- the device illustrated in FIG. 2 comprises a vibratory panel or member 20 .
- the panel 20 supports vibrations, such as bending wave vibrations or surface acoustic waves.
- the vibratory panel 10 has a number of actuators, transducers or exciters 21 , 22 , 23 , hereinafter referred to as transducers, attached, coupled, connected or mounted to it.
- the transducers are able to vibrate the panel 20 in response to applied electrical signals.
- the transducers may be able to detect vibrations of the panel in response to an outside stimulus such as touch or sound.
- signals may be applied to or detected by the transducers in order to provide one or more of a haptics sensation, touch sensitivity, audio generation or audio sensing (e.g. as in a microphone).
- the illustrated device further comprises circuitry comprising components 24 , 25 , 26 and 27 .
- the illustrated device is configured to provide an appropriate response to an input stimulus.
- the components 24 , 25 , 26 are provided for, respectively:
- Components 24 , 25 and 26 could be implemented in hardware, software or a combination of the two.
- step of generating appropriate signals for controlling one or more of the transducers could include consulting one or more look-up tables for the signals necessary to provide the appropriate response.
- component 24 receives touch information from the vibratory panel. For convenience this is illustrated as a single output from the panel. However in practice component 24 will typically receive touch information from one or more transducers coupled to the vibratory panel 20 . These may be one or more of the illustrated transducers 21 , 22 , 23 or they could be separate transducers, not shown. For example the device may have one or more transducers dedicated to sensing and one or more transducers dedicated to providing an output such as haptic feedback.
- Circuit component 24 sends touch information to component 25 which determines the appropriate response and requests an appropriate output from the panel.
- component 25 processes the touch information and provides haptics request information to haptics control circuit 26 .
- Control circuit 26 then generates appropriate signals for one or more of the transducers 21 , 22 and 23 .
- This may be achieved by the haptics controller being configured to apply appropriate algorithms to the haptics request information to generate signals comprising the haptic response information. These signals are sent to appropriate ones of the transducers to provide haptic feedback.
- the haptics controller may consult one or more look-up tables to determine what signal should be generated. Look up tables may be used in all embodiments of the invention instead of otherwise determining appropriate responses from transducers.
- control circuit 26 is configured to provide haptic response signals to two of the transducers 21 and 23 . This is schematically illustrated by the two signal lines output from control circuit 26 to signal processing circuitry 27 . These may be considered the primary signals.
- the signal processing circuitry 27 is configured to obtain the signals from the haptics control circuit 26 and to process them to provide an additional signal to be applied to transducer 22 in order to produce a secondary or side effect.
- the functions of the signal processing circuitry 27 could be incorporated into the controller 26 , for example as an additional digital signal processor.
- the signal processing circuitry 27 is shown as a separate item. It could be incorporated into another part of the circuitry of the device.
- the additional channel is to provide acoustic cancellation, and the device additionally has circuitry for generating audio signals (e.g. an audio block), the function of signal processing circuitry 27 could be incorporated into that circuitry.
- FIG. 2 shows an example with two transducers 21 and 23 dedicated to the primary or desired effect and one transducer 22 for the side effect. This can be scaled up and N transducers can be dedicated to the primary effect with M transducers being provided for the secondary effect, N and M being greater than or equal to 1.
- FIG. 3 is an enlarged view showing schematically only the control circuit 26 , signal processing circuitry 27 and three transducers 21 , 22 and 23 , receiving respective control signals designated L, R and C for left, right and centre.
- Circuitry 27 receives as inputs signals L and R intended to control transducers 21 and 23 , and these are processed in circuitry 27 to generate three signals L, R and C to control transducers 21 , 22 and 23 respectively.
- circuitry 27 receives inputs on two channels and provides outputs on three channels for respective transducers.
- the extra channel can be used for audio balancing whilst avoiding any additional load on the haptics control circuit 26 .
- transducers 21 and 23 are provided equidistant from and near to respective edges of the vibratory panel and receive drive signals for providing haptic feedback.
- the vibratory panel is rectangular and the transducers are centred between the transverse edges of the panel, so that for the purpose of this explanation only one dimension needs to be considered.
- the transducers 21 , 23 receive respective signals from the haptics control circuit 26 via the signal processing circuitry 27 . These signals cause the transducers to generate surface waves or bending waves in the panel 20 .
- the phases of the signals applied to the transducers are controlled in order to influence the point on the panel where the waves constructively interfere and hence the point at which the haptic feedback is “felt”.
- signals are applied to the additional transducer 22 in order to cancel or at least reduce any acoustic output accompanying the haptic feedback.
- the additional transducer should be controlled to reduce the net displacement of the panel.
- the matrix decoding function of circuitry 27 can be as simple as a summing amplifier. This is shown in FIG. 4 where the same reference numerals as in FIGS. 2 and 3 are used to denote the same items.
- signal processing circuitry 27 receives signals L and R for transducers 21 and 23 . These are subject to straight through processing and also fed to summing amplifier 40 which generates signal C for transducer 22 .
- transducers 21 , 22 and 23 can be identical in construction, which results in simple and cost effective circuitry.
- the above principle could be used in reverse if the purpose of the transducers 21 and 23 was to generate audio signals.
- the C channel could then be used to reduce any unwanted haptics effects that might result from audio signals generated by signals applied to transducers 21 and 23 .
- the relationship between the signals would be governed by equation (1) above, with L, R and C representing haptic signals rather than audio signals.
- the signal C could be used to make the overall sound louder.
- the result of applying the signal C would be more amplification at low frequencies, especially for stereo. This could be particularly useful.
- the signal C could be passed through a low pass filter so that it would apply at low frequencies only. This would not harm the haptics effects since these are low frequency anyway.
- the vibratory panel device is controlled to provide haptic feedback or audio signals.
- the vibratory panel device shown in FIG. 2 can be configured to provide audio signals as well as haptic feedback. This can be achieved using separate transducers dedicated to the purpose of audio signal generation. However it is possible for the same transducers to be used for both audio signal generation and the provision of haptic feedback.
- FIG. 5 illustrates the provision of signals to transducers in this situation.
- FIG. 5 three transducers 521 , 522 and 523 are controlled by signals denoted L, R and C for left, right and centre.
- Haptics control circuit 516 operates in the same way as circuit 26 in the previous examples providing signals denoted H L , H R , for the left and right transducers 521 and 523 respectively. These signals are supplied to modified signal processing circuitry 517 . This is similar to signal processing circuitry 27 but is configured to process additional signals.
- FIG. 5 shows an audio control block 518 which operates to generate signals A L , and A R for respective transducers 521 and 523 for use in the generation of audio signals from the panel 20 . These signals A L and A R are additionally supplied to signal processing circuitry 517 .
- signals A L and H L are passed straight through to summing amplifier 540 .
- signals A R and H R are passed straight through to summing amplifier 541 .
- Signals H L and H R are supplied to a first matrix decoder 543 which generates signal H c .
- Signals A L and A R are supplied to a second matrix decoder 544 which generates signal A c .
- Signals H C and A C are supplied to summing amplifier 546 .
- Signals H L and A L may be simply summed in summing amplifier 540 to form signal L to be applied to transducer 521 .
- Signals H R and A R may be simply summed in summing amplifier 541 to form signal R to be applied to transducer 523 .
- Signals H C and A C may be simply summed in summing amplifier 546 to form signal C to be applied to transducer 522 .
- circuit 517 This formula is appropriate if the intention of circuit 517 is to reduce any haptic effect that may result as a side effect of the audio signal generation.
- the matrix decoder 544 as well as the matrix decoder 543 may be a simple summing amplifier.
- the inputs for the transducer 522 can be derived from a simple circuit using push-pull amplifiers as shown in FIG. 6 .
- This figure shows an audio circuit where transducers 604 and 605 function similarly to right and left speakers in a stereo system.
- the signals L and R for the right and left transducers respectively are supplied to respective push-pull amplifiers 601 and 602 which output signals +L/2, ⁇ L/2, +R/2 and ⁇ R/2. These signals are supplied to respective inputs of a transducer 603 according to the desired output C.
- the signals +L/2, ⁇ L/2, +R/2 and ⁇ R/2 are supplied directly to the respective transducers 604 , 605 .
- FIG. 7 shows one example.
- signals L, C and R from respective transducers 701 , 702 and 703 are supplied to differential amplifiers 704 and 705 to output signals L-C and R-C respectively.
- This arrangement can be used in touch sensing for example to reduce common mode effects such as whole body vibrations, of the kind a device might experience when travelling on a train. The signal from the centre channel is effectively eliminated.
- FIG. 8 A possible arrangement of transducers is shown in FIG. 8 .
- a panel 820 has transducers 821 and 823 positioned at opposite ends of one of the longitudinal edges and a further transducer 822 positioned at the centre of the opposite edge.
- Transducer 822 may be used to reduce or compensate for any audible vibrations that result from haptics signals applied to transducers 821 and 823 . More generally, a signal applied to transducer 822 may be derived from signals applied to transducers 821 and 823 to produce an effect that is secondary to the effect produced by transducers 821 and 823 .
- FIG. 9 An arrangement including six transducers is shown in FIG. 9 .
- a signal to be applied to transducer 922 is derived from signals applied to transducers 921 and 923 which are at the opposite edge of the panel 920 .
- a signal to be applied to transducer 926 is derived from signals applied to transducers 924 and 925 .
- the two central transducers 926 and 922 of FIG. 9 may be replaced with a single transducer at the centre of the panel midway between the positions of transducers 926 and 922 .
- a panel with transducers at its corners having drive strengths L U , R U , L L , and R L .
- the design of the device in which transducers are used constrains their placement. However when the designer has a choice of where to place them the performance of the panel can be enhanced by suitable placement. Possible goals in device design are to maximise the deflection over the entire panel and to avoid dead spots. Others are to simplify the drive circuitry, for example by driving all exciters with the same or similar voltage amplitudes.
- An alternative statistic that may be used to characterise the displacement field is the dB ratio of maximum displacement to minimum displacement over a set of test points.
- the panel adopts a sinusoidal shape.
- the overall displacement of the panel may be minimised when the transducers are driven appropriately.
- the transducers driven by the L. R, and C control signals are positioned distances x L , x C and x R from one end of the beam, where the additional transducer is positioned in the middle of the beam.
- the transducers shown at the corners of the panels should be placed one sixth of the distance along the longitudinal edges of the panels with the additional transducer in the centre.
- the currently separate LCD and touch screen may be replaced with a combined touch sensitive OLED (organic light emitting display). It may then be possible to vibrate the whole combined touch screen and display.
- the exciters could then be positioned behind the OLED where they are not visible. The designer then has more freedom of choice of position and size of exciters.
- the inertial transducer as exciter may be replaced with a layer of piezoelectric material that is fully attached to and optionally covers the whole of the surface of the composite panel. Such a transducer is in effect grounded rather than inertial.
- FIG. 10 shows a model of a unimorph structure on a panel.
- the structure comprises the panel as substrate 100 (typically polycarbonate, or glass such as “gorilla glass” from Corning, or any other suitable material), PET layer 101 (a type of plastics material forming part of the panel), shim 102 . PZT (or any other electrically active) layer 103 and foil layer 104 .
- the substrate 100 may include an OLED layer. This construction relies on the stiffness of the substrate to provide a resisting force, which results in the panel bending.
- FIG. 11 shows a bimorph structure in which a shim is sandwiched between two layers of piezoelectric material.
- the structure comprises substrate 110 (which may include OLED layer), PET layer 111 , first foil protective layer 112 , first piezoelectric layer 113 , shim 114 , second piezoelectric layer 115 and second foil protective layer 116 .
- substrate 110 which may include OLED layer
- PET layer 111 first foil protective layer 112
- first piezoelectric layer 113 first piezoelectric layer 113
- shim 114 second piezoelectric layer 115
- second foil protective layer 116 second piezoelectric layer
- the attachment of the piezoelectric material to the substrate including forming piezoelectric layer and electrodes in a separate assembly that is attached to the substrate, for example with appropriate adhesive.
- the piezo assembly could be co-formed with the substrate. This would require elevated temperatures and would require glass or metal for the substrate. A lower temperature process might be available for non-ceramic layers such as electrically active polymers.
- the layered structure of the exciter will need to be chosen to match the properties of the panel to which it is laminated and the foregoing are simple examples. However they are useful for modelling the possible responses of the panel to various shapes of exciter.
- Implicit drive of a beam introduces a predictable distribution of moments that allows explicit solution of the static bending equation.
- a simply-supported beam with 3 electrodes symmetrically energised as (1, ⁇ 1, 1), and assume that the moment generated is directly proportional to the length of the electrode. If the length of the beam is normalised to 1, and the three electrodes are positioned such that the gaps between the electrodes are at positions along the beam equal to a, and 1 ⁇ a, then the model suggests:
- a similar function of x may also be formulated that satisfies the antisymmetric (1, 0, ⁇ 1) drive arrangement.
- the mean displacement of this will always be zero whatever the value of a.
- the symmetric and antisymmetric shapes are shown in FIGS. 1 ( d ) and ( c ) respectively.
- za ⁇ ( x ) x 6 ⁇ ( x 2 + a 2 - a ) ⁇ ⁇ 0 ⁇ x ⁇ a ( 8 )
- za ⁇ ( x ) a 6 ⁇ 2 ⁇ x - 1 2 ⁇ a - 1 ⁇ ( x 2 + a 2 - x ) ⁇ ⁇ a ⁇ x ⁇ 1 / 2 ( 9 )
- Integral (14) may be partially evaluated, thus
- a finite element (FE) model of a typical system was produced.
- the model had a 0.8 mm glass panel of 120 mm by 80 mm, laminated to a 38 um layer of ceramic piezoelectric material, a Poron® sealing gasket, and an internal air-space that was only 0.5 mm thick over the majority of the panel area.
- the model was bi-laterally symmetrical, which means that the model was 2D, symmetrical in both X and Y axes, as shown for example in FIG. 12 . Although the panel is not simply-supported, it is approximately so at low frequencies.
- Electrodes A and C formed a symmetrical pair, and electrode B was the centred electrode, as shown for example in FIG. 12 ( 2 ).
- the condition of zero net displacement was determined by looking for zero simulated internal pressure at a node located at the centre of the panel.
- the value of the first gap between electrodes a was found to be 0.341, which is very close to the estimated value of 1 ⁇ 3.
- FIG. 12 shows three possible shapes that span the range of available shapes for three electrodes on a rectangular panel.
- Shapes 2 and 3 were the objects of study in the earlier paragraphs, whilst shape 1 is based on the simple observation of symmetry. It is clear that whilst each arrangement supports the two modes of operation discussed in the introduction and shown in FIGS. 1 ( c ) and ( d ) , the relative areas of the electrodes vary dramatically.
- shape 1 the area of the B electrode is effectively divided into two electrodes that meet at a point at the centre of the panel.
- the area of the B is 1 ⁇ 2 of the panel area, i.e. double the areas of the A or C electrodes; in shape 2 the areas are all the same (B is 1 ⁇ 3 of the panel area); and in shape 3, the area of B is about 1 ⁇ 4 of the panel area, i.e. about 2 ⁇ 3 of the area of A or C.
- FIG. 13 a a systematically related family of shapes defined by circular arcs (in the normalize co-ordinate system) as shown in FIG. 13 a .
- the arcs have radius, r, and are centred a distance, c, from the symmetry line.
- the distance, d is that of a straight line-pair that divides the area in the same ratio as the arcs.
- the illustration below shows a positive example.
- c ( r 2 - 1 4 ) + 2 ⁇ r 2 ⁇ a ⁇ ⁇ sin ⁇ ( 1 2 ⁇ r ) + 2 ⁇ d
- x c - ( r 2 - y 2 ) , 1 / r > 0 ( r 2 - 1 4 ) + 2 ⁇ r 2 ⁇ a ⁇ ⁇ sin ⁇ ( 1 2 ⁇ r ) - 2 ⁇ d
- x c + ( r 2 - y 2 ) , 1 / r ⁇ 0 ( 16 )
- Case 4 ( FIG. 13 b ) has the minimum area for B, at 0.279, the maximum central separation of the electrodes, at 0.406 and the zero peripheral separation of the electrodes. The convergence of the electrodes at the symmetry line will result in a pair of nodal points.
- Case 5 has the maximum area for B, at 0.437, the minimum central separation of the electrodes, at 0.238, and the maximum peripheral separation of the electrodes, at 0.5.
- the optimum shape for the electrodes probably lies between cases 2 (equal area rectangular electrodes) and 5 (outer electrodes with arcuate facing surfaces with maximum distance apart at the panel edge or peripheral separation), and may well depend practical aspects of the device not taken into account in these hypothetical examples.
- the simplicity and effectiveness of three electrodes of equal area is appealing although there is clearly scope for further exploration of three electrode arrangements.
- the three electrode examples all used two input signals to generate a third signal, although this was not essential and the third signal could be separately derived.
- the foregoing shows that having determined the number of transducers or exciters to be used, and any other constraints on a panel assembly, it is possible to determine the behaviour of a panel assembly as described above and determine values for the electrode shapes, divisions and areas based on optimising either the range of potentials to be applied (so as to simplify the drive circuitry) or the displacement field, or a combination of the two. Having determined values for the electrode parameters, it is possible to choose the drive signals for the electrodes to further improve the displacement field of the panel.
- the signals for the respective electrodes may be represented as a drive matrix. Thus, the drive matrix for the electrodes may be finely adjusted for best performance of the panel after appropriate parameters for the electrodes have been determined.
- each electrode has an equal effect on the average displacement, then anything added at the centre must be removed from the other electrodes, as shown in FIG. 15 .
- the four-channel system has the four MDQ combinations.
- each electrode is the same size and has the same activity (net displacement per volt applied). Activity can be calculated and/or modeled by integrating the displacement over the area of the electrode. However it is often sufficient simply to consider the relative activity of one electrode compared to another. Equal areas and equal activities are unlikely to be present in practice. For a mounted panel, in an arrangement in which electrodes have equal areas it is unlikely that the electrodes will have equal activities. As noted above at the very least the centre electrode is likely to be more active than those at the edges.
- each electrode patch has a different area, for example as a result of being arranged for all patches to be equally active, then we may want to reconsider the optimum choice for X. If our device is piezoelectric, it is likely that the capacitance, and hence the current, is proportional to the area. The non-uniformity of current means that the energy sum changes.

- the desired effect of cancelling the monopole can be achieved with the side electrodes being driven in common.
- First Y can be chosen such that the mean displacement is zero.
- the electrodes have equal areas and different activities and provides a formula for determining appropriate drive strengths for the side and centre electrodes.
- the activities of the electrodes can be determined and then the drive strengths for the side and centre electrodes can be derived from the drive signals applied to the corner electrodes.
- a suitable processing circuit can be designed to derive the drive signals X 2 , X 3 , Y from the applied signals A,B,C,D.
- the areas of the electrodes are different, then if the energy drain depends on area, the areas have to be taken into account as well as activities in order to determine appropriate drive strengths. It is then necessary to determine the extent to which the energy drain depends on voltage and/or current (i.e. electrode area). It is useful to assign a value to this dependence, given below as n.
- E is proportional to V ⁇ 2 ⁇ Area, as the current is V ⁇ capacitance (assuming V is alternating), and capacitance is proportional to area.
- a circuit may have any value of n between 0 and 2.
- n is referred to as the energy/area exponent.
- This relationship between electrode activities may be achieved by suitable choice of electrode area and/or positioning. For example there may be scope to vary the positioning of the electrodes if they do not take up the whole area of the panel. It will be appreciated that there may be other ways of controlling the activities of electrodes such as constraining their freedom of movement by external means.
- n 0 for V 2 , 1 for I ⁇ V, and 2 for I 2
- FIG. 20 show variations of ⁇ for a 4:3 aspect ratio panel.
- ⁇ for a 4:3 aspect ratio panel.
- a finite element model was used to verify the above results.
- the model followed the theoretical system, but added the realism of real panel thickness, an offset piezoelectric layer, and an acoustic cavity.
- the electrodes were separated by a 0.5 mm gap to avoid short-circuits.
- the panel had a 4:3 aspect ratio.
- the geometry is parametrised via c and d, which represent fractions of a and b respectively, where a is half of Lx (the width) and b is half of Ly (the height). Further, the aspect ratio a/b is referred to by the parameter ⁇ , which by convention is considered to be greater than or equal to unity (every case for which ⁇ 1 has a dual in which the x and y axes swap roles to give ⁇ >1).
- Two methods of analysis are applied; an analytical model of a simply-supported plate with the appropriate anisotropic layer combination, and a finite element model.
- the former is faster, but cannot include the effects of acoustic cavities or non-engineering boundary conditions.
- the acoustic cavity would be formed between the panel and any containing box. In FIGS. 10 and 11 the cavity would most likely be on the piezo side as the transducers would be inside the box. The mean displacement is directly accessible from the model.
- the latter is more flexible, and allows modelling of such things as gaps between electrodes in addition to acoustic cavities or non-engineering boundary conditions. Calculation of mean displacement is achieved by observing the net pressurisation of the cavity at its centre. The cavity is made reasonably deep, and the boundary conditions kept simple so that meaningful comparisons may be made between the results of the two analyses.
- FIG. 27 shows the values of d1 and d2 for most of the allowable c1 and c2 combinations (i.e. those that result in values of d1 and d2 that lie between 0 and 1)—the white areas are not allowable.
- S symmetrical
- A anti-symmetrical
- first letter refers to x, second letter to y.
- the displacements at a sample point for unit excitation of each case be, u1, u2, u3 and u4, respectively.
- u1c complex conjugate of u1, etc.;
- FIG. 32 shows the values of d1 for most of the allowable c1 and c2 combinations (i.e. those that result in a value of d1 lies between 0 and 1—the white areas are not allowable) for two aspect ratios, and the result seem less affected by the aspect ratio.
- FIG. 34 Compare FIG. 34 with FIGS. 9, 14 and 15 .
- the same effect as is achieved with FIG. 34 was also suggested in connection with FIG. 9 .
- Comparing FIG. 34 with FIGS. 14 and 15 it will be seen that in FIGS. 14 and 15 the signal for each “extra” electrode was to compensate for the effect of its immediate neighbours.
- the signal for each “extra” electrode is chosen to compensate for the effect (on the displacement) of the pair of electrodes at the opposite edge, specifically the opposite corners.
- FIG. 34 preserves the integrity of the two dipoles, but improves their drive-strengths.
- all the additional signals vanish, so again the balance is not affected.
- all the additional signals are equal in value, so we have the same constraints as for the 5-input options (4+1). This means we may re-use all our earlier results regarding geometrical constraints.
- FIG. 35 shows the two figures of merit for the 4+4 case.
- the mean values are typically about 4.3 to 4.4 for the (4+4) system, or around 25% (2 dB) higher than for the (4+1) system.
- corner-drive systems were generally to be preferred.
- the 4+4 system was shown to provide a useful gain in sensitivity, with similar or improved cost in terms of the ratio of mean to standard deviation.
- the ability to sense the deflection of the panel is possibly desirable—either to provide electrical feedback as part of a closed-loop control system, or to refine aspects of the user interface. It is electrically simpler if the sense circuit is entirely separate from the drive circuit but, in direct-bender applications, this reduces the active area for driving. Consequentially, if sense electrodes are to be provided, the geometry or the drive matrix or other parameters of the system must be modified to retain balance for quiet haptics or whatever other effect the drive channels are desired to achieve.
- sensing electrodes With grounded exciters as discussed above the possibilities for providing sensing electrodes and their positions can be explored to the same extent as the possibilities for driving electrodes. Initial considerations might focus on where the greatest response is likely to be obtained, but this will involve a trade off in terms of the ability to drive a panel. One possibility would be to provide sensing electrodes within the area of the driven electrodes. It would usually be practical to place them at the boundary between drive electrodes for ease of getting electrical connections to them.

It follows from the above that for only three transducers in total, the matrix decoding function of

A C=−(A R +A L)/2
A C=+(A R +A L)/2.
C=(L+R)/2

C=−(L+R)/2
is required, e.g. for cancellation, −L/2 is supplied to the non-inverting input of
C=−¼(L U +R U +L L +R L).
Optimisation of Transducer Parameters
General Considerations
C=−(L+R)/2
is applicable, suitable positioning of the transducers is required. This is partly because in practice the panel will usually be mounted at its edges and therefore greater displacement is possible at the centre of the panel than at the edges. Consider again the one dimensional example of a beam supported at its ends.
where Lx is the length of the beam, and k is a characteristic stiffness of the panel which is here assumed independent of x or F.
Where xL, xC and xR represent the locations of the L, C and R exciters, respectively.
so with the L and R transducers positioned one sixth of the length of the beam from the end with the C transducer positioned at the centre of the beam, it can be arranged that the amplitudes of the signals (i.e. drive strengths) for the three transducers in order to cancel the monopole and hence achieve acoustic reduction could be equal. As noted above this is particularly desired since it simplifies the circuit design required for implementation of the acoustic reduction. The foregoing does not take account of the constraints on beam displacement caused by the mounting. However if the beam is simply constrained at each of its ends it will still adopt a sinusoidal shape and therefore the above formula still applies.
where zs represents the symmetric displacement field due the (1, −1, 1) energising of the electrodes.
zs(x)=x3/6+a·(2·a2−4·a+1)·x/2 0≦x≦a (5)
zs(x)=(a−½)·x·(1−x)+a4−17/6·a3+2−a2−a/2a≦x≦½ (6)
the result of which is a=⅓.
So again, a=⅓ is the solution.
M=A+B+C+D+X−(2·A+2·B+X)/4−(2·A+2·C+X)/4−(2·B+2·D+X)/4−(2·C+2·D+X)/4
i.e. M=0. (19)
- M=monopole=A+B+C+D;
- D=dipole, of which there are 2, =A+B−C−D and A−B+C−D;
- Q=quadrupole=A−B−C+D.
X=−(A+B+C+D)/5
0=T1*(A+B+C+D)+T4*X−T2*(2·A+2·B+X)/4−T3*(2·A+2·C+X)/4−T3*(2·B+2·D+X)/4−T2*(2·C+2·D+X)/4 (26)
substitute Y from above gives:
then re-using the formula for Y gives
i.e. in terms of the four-channel input.
