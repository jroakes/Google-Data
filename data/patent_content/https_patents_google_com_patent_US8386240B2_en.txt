Definitions
- This disclosure relates to dictionaries for natural language processing applications, such as machine translation, non-Roman language word segmentation, speech recognition and input method editors.
- natural language processing techniques are used in data processing systems, such as speech processing systems, handwriting/optical character recognition systems, automatic translation systems, or for spelling/grammar checking in word processing systems.
- These natural language processing techniques can include automatic updating of dictionaries for natural language applications related to, e.g., non-Roman language word segmentation, machine translation, automatic proofreading, speech recognition, input method editors, etc.
- Non-Roman languages that use a logographic script in which one or two characters, e.g., glyphs, correspond to one word or meaning have more characters than keys on a standard input device, such as a computer keyboard on a mobile device keypad.
- a standard input device such as a computer keyboard on a mobile device keypad.
- the Chinese language contains tens of thousands of ideographic characters defined by base phonetic or Pinyin characters and five tones.
- the mapping of these many to one associations can be implemented by input methods that facilitate entry of characters and symbols not found on input devices. Accordingly, a Western style keyboard can be used to input Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters.
- An input method editor can be used to realize an input method.
- Such input method editors can include or access dictionaries of words and/or phrases. Lexicons of languages are constantly evolving, however, and thus the dictionaries for the input method editors can require frequent updates. For example, a new word may be rapidly introduced into a language, e.g., a pop-culture reference or a new trade name for a product may be introduced into a lexicon. Failure to update an input method editor dictionary in a timely manner can thus degrade the user experience, as the user may be unable to utilize or have difficulty utilizing the input method editor to input the new word into an input field.
- a user may desire to submit a new word, e.g., a new trade name, as a search query to a search engine. If the input method editor does not recognize the new word, however, the user may experience difficulty in inputting the new word into the search engine.
- a new word e.g., a new trade name
- a method includes determining a topic divergence value, the topic divergence value proportional to a ratio of a first topic word distribution in a first collection of documents to a second topic word distribution in a second collection of documents, wherein the first collection of documents is a collection of topic documents related to a particular topic, and the second collection of documents is a collection of documents that includes other documents related to other topics; determining a candidate topic word divergence value for a candidate topic word, the candidate topic word divergence value proportional to a ratio of a first distribution of the candidate topic word in the first collection of documents to a second distribution of the candidate topic word in the second collection of documents, wherein the candidate topic word is a candidate for being identified as a new topic word for the particular topic; and determining whether the candidate topic word is a new topic word for the particular topic based on the candidate topic word divergence value and the topic diverg
- a method includes selecting a topic dictionary comprising topic words related to a particular topic; determining a topic word divergence value based on a topic word, a second collection of documents and a first collection of documents, wherein the first collection of documents is a collection of topic documents related to the topic, and the second collection of documents is a collection of documents that includes documents related to a plurality of topics, and the topic word is a word that is related to the topic; determining a candidate topic word divergence value for a candidate topic word based on the second collection of documents and the first collection of documents, wherein the candidate topic word is a candidate for being identified as a new topic word for the particular topic; and determining whether the candidate topic word is a new topic word for the particular topic based on the candidate topic word divergence value and the topic word divergence value.
- a method in another implementation, includes determining a divergence threshold for a first collection of documents, the divergence threshold proportional to the ratio of a first topic word probability for a topic word in the first collection of documents to a second topic word probability for the topic word in the second collection of documents, wherein the first collection of documents is a first collection of topic documents related to a topic, the topic word is a word in a topic dictionary related to the topic, and the second collection of documents is a collection of documents related to a plurality of topics; determining a candidate word divergence value for a candidate word that is not a word in the topic dictionary, the candidate word divergence value proportional to the ratio of a first candidate word probability for the candidate word with reference to the first collection of documents to a second candidate word probability for the candidate word with reference to the second collection of documents; and determining that the candidate word is a topic word for the topic if the candidate word divergence value exceeds the divergence threshold.
- the data processing performance of a system using a language model may be improved.
- the system or device may have improved performance in speech processing, handwriting/optical character recognition, automatic translation, automatic classification, automatic abstracting, and/or spell/grammar checking in word processing systems by use of automatically updated topic dictionaries.

- the entropy-related values are thus a close approximation of the actual entropy values.
- the new word analyzer module 208 can use the entropy-related values as the entropy values of the training corpus and/or the development corpus.

- the word processing module 206 can identify a candidate word (x, y) by combining two existing words x and y.
- the system 200 can utilize word data from the word corpus 204 , e.g., web page data in the training corpus 232 and the development corpus 234 , to determine whether the candidate word is a new word.
- the word processing module 206 can generate an n-gram language model from data stored in the training corpus 232 to include an identified candidate word (x, y).
- the unigram model can include the probabilities of the candidate word, P(x, y), and the word processing module 206 can also determine the corresponding probabilities P(x) and P(y) of the words x and y that constitute the candidate word xy.
- the word processing module 206 generates a word count value of the candidate word, D(x, y), and word count values of constituent words, D(x) and D(y) from the development corpus 234 .
- D(x), D(y), and D(x, y) may be the number of occurrences of x, y, and (x, y), respectively in the development corpus 234 .
- the system 200 can determine probabilities of x, y, and (x, y) in the development corpus 234 .
- the probability of (x, y) in the development corpus 234 can be determined by
- the new word analyzer module 208 determines whether the candidate word is a new word. In some implementations, the new word analyzer module 208 can determine that the candidate word is a new word if the uncertainty of the development corpus 234 decreases by including the candidate word as a new word. In some examples, an entropy value can be used to measure an uncertainty in the development corpus 234 . For example, the entropy value of the development corpus 234 can be determined by
- V the entire set of words considered to compute the entropy H
- w is a word in the development corpus 234
- p(w) is the probability of the word in the development corpus
- D(w) is the number of occurrences of w in the development corpus.
- the new word analyzer module 208 can generate entropy values H and H′ for the development corpus 234 , where H and H′ are the entropy values of the development corpus 234 without and with, respectively, including the candidate word in the language models. In some implementations, the new word analyzer module 208 generates the actual entropy values H and H′ using the actual sizes of a corpus without and with the candidate word, respectively. In some implementations, the new word analyzer module 208 can also use one or more entropy-related values that can approximate the actual entropy values. For example, the new word analyzer module 208 can generate H′ using the size of the corpora 232 , 234 without the candidate word.
- the size of the training and development corpora 232 , 234 may decrease after including (x, y) as a new word in the vocabulary, the difference may be negligible for computing the entropy of the corpora 232 , 234 with the candidate word (x, y). For example, if a sequence of n constituent words W1W2 . . . Wn is considered a potentially new word, the size of the corpus decreases only by the number of occurrences of W1W2 . . . Wn, e.g., m, multiplied by n ⁇ 1, e.g., m*(n ⁇ 1).
- the new word analyzer module 208 can determine whether the candidate word is a new word. For example, if H′ ⁇ H ⁇ 0, then the new word analyzer module 208 may determine that the candidate word is a new word because the entropy value of the development corpus 234 is reduced by including the candidate word.
- the new word analyzer module 208 compares the entropy values H and H′ using the probabilities p(x), p(y), and p(x, y), and the word count values D(x), D(y), and D(x, y). Because the word frequencies of words other than the candidate word and the constituent words are not affected by the addition of the candidate word, the formula for generating a difference between H and H′ can be generated using a simplified formula.
