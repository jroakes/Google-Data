Outside, some well known structure or functions can not be shown or described in detail below, be described to avoid unnecessarily fuzzy correlation.
Data compression method in many existing physical computer memories is based entirely on software.Although some are existing
Method is hardware based, but such method is typically simple, and attempts by wherein storing compressed data
The size of one or more available buffers avoids fragment problems using fixed ratio (for example, half of page-size).Such as
There are a large amount of not used spaces in fruit, then this significantly limits from the data pressure in physical computer memory after storing
Contract the amount of space obtained, and a large amount of not used spaces are the fixed space amounts for being not filled by distributing to buffering area in compressed data
When generate.As used herein, spatial references memory storage capabilities, such as can be measured with byte.It is not used

Embodiment of the disclosure be related to for manage the data in physical computer memory hardware auxiliary compression it is broken
The method, apparatus and system of piece.As will be described in more detail, disclosed method, equipment and system provide a kind of pressure
The mode that contracting hardware and memory manager program work together, to minimize memory fragmentation, minimum hardware complexity and permit
Perhaps compression hardware operates in the case of the participation for reducing memory manager program.
As described above, it is difficult to the specific piece (for example, part, amount etc.) of the data in physical computer memory is known in advance
What whether can be compressed and if it is then can be with compressed data to degree.But certain before compression is completed
A time point, it is necessary to determine specific compression data block will occupy how many space.According to one or more other embodiments of the present disclosure, carry
For compression hardware (for brevity, be referred to alternatively as " memory compression unloading engine " sometimes or be simply referred as " engine " or
" hardware "), thus compression hardware is designed to very quick and efficient, and corresponding because among other features
Memory manager program has limited interaction.Memory manager program can be the form of software or firmware, and can be
The module of operating system.Fig. 5 and the related open additional detail included about the embodiment of compression hardware in example embodiment.
The simplification example of the hardware auxiliary compression of data in physical computer memory can be as follows：(i) memory pipe

And the size of compressed data is notified into memory manager program；(iii) memory manager program is based on about the big of compressed data
Small information determines the position (for example, position in physical computer memory) of storage compressed data；And (iv) storage
Compressed data is stored in determined position by device management program instruction compression hardware.From the example, it is easy to find out, at this
Under the existing method of sample, in view of a large amount of interactions between memory manager program and compression hardware, communication overhead and associated
Time delay becomes fairly expensive.
Compression hardware is allowed, which to make more decisions, will provide faster interface.Difficulty is all physics meters in management system
Calculation machine memory is not compression hardware.Therefore, according to one or more other embodiments of the present disclosure, can give compression hardware some
Alternatively (choice), and allow compression hardware from provided it is alternative in select one or more optimal or near optimal buffering area
Set.According to one or more embodiments described here, it is more that compression hardware can determine that optimal or near optimal selection is related to
A buffering area.For example, in order to be suitble to compressed data, while also minimize or closely minimize any loss/waste/not used
Space, compression hardware can select memory manager program provide (for example, present or provide) buffering area it is alternative in be more than
One alternative.For example, compression hardware can determine to use the combination of smaller buffering area more advantageous than using one big buffering area, it should
Big buffering area may not enough accommodate greatly compressed data or may be than necessary bigger.
Once one or more of (for example, determining, selection, decision etc.) available buffer has been selected in compression hardware,
Then compression hardware can be selected notice memory manager program.It should be noted that compression hardware can be in compression hardware pressure
Buffering area selected by time announcement memory manager program before contracting buffering area or after compression is completed.Although that is, compression
Hardware may not know the size of the compressed data before compression definitely, but before it may can estimate or infer compression
The size of compressed data.Memory manager program can be before the compression or later from information as compression hardware request.
For example, according to one or more embodiments, method described herein, equipment and system are designed to make memory
Management program uses the data block of the fixed size in the asynchronous compression physical computer memory (such as page) of compression hardware, and
And attempt minimum or approximate minimum fragment and realize advantageous compression ratio or effective compression ratio.Disclosed method, equipment
It is designed to make compression hardware can be so that compressed data moves quickly into one or more new positions, without coming with system
From any direct auxiliary of memory manager program.Therefore, compression hardware can be moved in the case of no any delay
Next uncompressed data, so as to minimize fragment, while still maintain high speed compression.

Data 155, it is blocking without compressed data 155 is divided.Therefore, it is remaining in buffering area 1110 in this first situation
The unused storage space of 1048 bytes.The unused storage space is the example of internal fragmentation 1140.Herein under the first situation, ratio is to use
In compressed data 155 1000 bytes space than 2048 bytes in selected buffering area space.
In the second situation, memory manager program 110 to compression hardware 120 provide three available buffers 1160,
1170 and 1180 list.In second situation, buffering area 1160,1170 and 1180 is 1 kilobytes, 2 kilobytes and 4 respectively
Kilobytes.Compression hardware 120 stores compressed data 155, and do not need to compressed data by 1150 buffering areas 1160 are selected
155 segmentations are blocking.Therefore, in second situation, the unused storage space of remaining 24 bytes in buffering area 1160.This is not used
Space is the example of internal fragmentation 1195.Under second situation, ratio is the 1000 byte space ratios for compressed data 155
1024 byte spaces in selected buffering area.In this case, such as by selecting size big from the list of available buffer
Internal fragmentation is reduced and minimizes in or equal to the minimal buffering area of size of compressed data.
Two situations in Fig. 1 C are only two examples.In the situation for being related to different size of multiple available buffers
Under, compression hardware 120 can based on after storage compressed data 155 in available buffer remaining amount of space come from available buffer
It is selected in list.Therefore, different size of multiple available buffers are provided to compression hardware 120 in memory manager program 110
