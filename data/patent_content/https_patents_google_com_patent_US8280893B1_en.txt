Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to information extraction and, more particularly, to methods and systems for identifying paraphrases from an index of information items and associated sentence fragments.
- Different words and phrases can be used in documents and search queries that have the same or similar meaning. Such words and phases can be referred to as paraphrases.
- Identified or known paraphrases can be useful in document summarization, information retrieval, and information extraction.
- Conventional methods for identifying paraphrases include compiling potential paraphrases by a user or users and then mining text to determine if the potential paraphrases are actual paraphrases. Such methods are time consuming and rely on users to compile the initial list of potential paraphrases.
- Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for identifying paraphrases from an index of information items and associated sentence fragments.
- One aspect of one embodiment of the present invention comprises identifying a pair of sentence fragments.
- the sentence fragments may each be related to the same information item, such as a date or entity name.
- the sentence fragments may be identified from an index that comprises a plurality of information items and associated sentence fragments.
- a paraphrase pair is identified from the pair of sentence fragments.
- FIG. 1 shows a diagram of a system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention
- FIG. 2 shows one embodiment of an illustrative method according to one embodiment of the present invention
- FIG. 3 shows one embodiment of another illustrative method according to one embodiment of the present invention
- FIG. 4 shows an illustrative index of information item—sentence fragment pairs according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 5 shows an illustrative paraphrase index according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for identifying paraphrases from an index of information items and associated sentence fragments.
- an index of information items such as dates and entity names
- associated sentence fragments to identify paraphrases.
- the index includes a number of information items, such as dates, entity names, or concepts, and each information item in the index has an associated sentence fragment.
- the index may be created by extracting information items and associated sentence fragments from documents indexed by a search engine.
- An entry in the index can include an information item, such as a date, “1989”, and an associated sentence fragment, “Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan.”
- the date may be a date in close proximity to the associated sentence fragment in a document or a date determined to be associated with the sentence fragment in another suitable manner.
- the method utilizes the index to identify paraphrases.
- the index can include multiple entries, such as the following two entries: “1989—Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan” and “1989—Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan.” As shown, each entry contains an information item (date) and an associated sentence fragment.
- the method aligns pairs of sentence fragments associated with the same information item to identify paraphrase pairs. For the two entries above, for example, an alignment of the two sentence fragments leads to the identification of the paraphrase pair “pulled out of” and “withdrew from.”
- Various alignment methods and rules can be used to identify paraphrase pairs. Multiple paraphrase pairs can be identified using the index and the paraphrase pairs can be ranked based on the frequency in which the paraphrase pair occurs. Paraphrase pairs occurring less than a threshold number of times can be discarded.
- An index of paraphrase pairs can be created and used in the summarization of documents, web search, and information extraction.
- An information item may include a date, a name, such as of a person, place, or entity, and a concept.
- a sentence fragment may include a syntactic clause containing factual information.
- a sentence fragment may or may not be part of or associated with a complete sentence.
- a document may include web pages of various formats, such as HTML, XML, and XHTML, Portable Document Format (PDF) files, electronic mail messages, instant messenger messages, and word processor, database, and application program document files, audio, video, or any other documents or information of any suitable type whatsoever made available on a network, a personal computer, or other computing or storage means.

- the present invention may comprise systems having different architecture than that which is shown in FIG. 1 .
- the paraphrase engine 168 may be contained in the extraction engine 152 or the search engine 120 .
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely illustrative, and is used to help explain the illustrative systems and processes discussed below.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an illustrative method 200 for identifying paraphrases from an index of information items and associated sentence fragments that may be implemented by the paraphrase engine 168 shown in FIG. 1 .
- This illustrative method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention.
- the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 can be executed or otherwise performed by one or a combination of various systems.
- the system shown in FIG. 1 and described above is used for illustration purposes.
- the illustrative method 200 begins in block 202 where potential paraphrase pairs are identified.
- potential paraphrase pairs are identified by the paraphrase engine 168 from an information item index of information item—sentence fragment pairs.
- An example of a portion an illustrative information item index is shown in FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 4 illustrates an information item index 400 that includes entries 402 . Each entry includes an information item—sentence fragment pair.
- the extraction engine 152 can create the information item index by accessing documents indexed by the search engine 120 or another corpus of documents to identify and extract information item—sentence fragment pairs.
- the extraction engine 152 may use a lightweight extraction method to identify and extract an information item and associated sentence fragment from a document previously indexed by a search engine 120 , for example.
- the extraction method can identify an information item, such as a date, in the text of a document and match a pattern to identify a sentence fragment in close proximity to the date.
- One or more of a set of lexico-syntactic patterns can be used to identify a sentence fragment associated with the information item.
- the sentence fragment may be filtered to exclude ambiguous or otherwise unhelpful sentence fragments.
- An identified sentence fragment that is not filtered is extracted with its corresponding information item and the information item—sentence fragment pair is indexed together.
- the extraction method can be used on all or most of the documents in a corpus of documents to create an index of information item—sentence fragment pairs.
- the extraction of information item—sentence fragment pairs to create an index is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/087,447, filed herewith, entitled “Methods and Systems for Extracting an Information Item and Associated Sentence Fragment from a Document,” which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
- the paraphrase engine 168 may utilize the structure of the information item index to identify potential paraphrase pairs. In one embodiment, the paraphrase engine 168 identifies potential paraphrase pairs by identifying matches of tokens in sentence fragments having like information items.
- FIG. 3 provides an illustrative method for identifying a potential paraphrase pair. Illustrative method 202 shown in FIG. 3 begins in block 302 by identifying a pair of sentence fragments.
- the paraphrase processor 168 identifies a pair of sentence fragments from entries in an information item index having the same information item. For example, the extraction processor 168 may identify the sentence fragments 404 , 406 from the information item index 400 shown in FIG. 4 . The sentence fragments 404 , 406 are associated with the same information item—the date 1989.
- the sentence fragments identified in block 302 are aligned.
- the sentence fragments in the information item index have been previously tokenized.
- Tokenization can include parsing the string of characters that makes up the sentence fragment into known tokens, such as words, punctuation marks, and special characters, based on a lexicon.
- the paraphrase processor 168 can align the sentence fragment by matching the tokens in the sentence fragments. Table 1 below provides an illustration of a possible alignment of the sentence fragments 404 , 406 .
- the paraphrase engine 168 aligns like tokens in the pair of sentence fragments. For example, the word tokens “Soviet troops” and “Afghanistan” are aligned. By aligning the like tokens, the paraphrase engine 168 identifies a paraphrase pair from the dissimilar tokens of the sentence fragments. For the example shown in Table 1 above, the potential paraphrase pair is the two groups of dissimilar word tokens—“pulled out of” and “withdrew from”.
- the paraphrase engine 168 determines whether the alignment of the sentence fragments meets a minimum threshold.
- a threshold may be used to determine the likelihood that the identified dissimilar tokens are a potential paraphrase pair.
- the minimum threshold may be that at least three non-stop words in each of the two sentence fragments are aligned and that there is a minimum of five tokens in each group of dissimilar tokens. Examples of stop words are determiners, conjunctions, and words (relative adverbs) beginning with the letters “wh”.
- Table 1 meets this minimum threshold.
- the number of non-stop words that aligned equals three, because the three non-stop word tokens “Soviet”, “troops”, and “Afghanistan” aligned.
- the number of tokens in the dissimilar group of tokens was less than five for both sentence fragments. For example, “pulled out of” is three tokens and “withdrew from” is two tokens.
- the potential paraphrase pair is discarded in block 308 . If the alignment of the sentence fragments does meet the minimum threshold, then the identified potential paraphrase pair is extracted in block 310 . In one embodiment, the extracted potential paraphrase pair is added to a list of potential paraphrase pairs by the paraphrase engine 168 . While FIG. 3 illustrates extracting one potential paraphrase pair from a single pair of sentence fragments, the paraphrase processor 168 , in one embodiment, similarly processes pairs of sentence fragments for all or a portion of the information item index.
- a group may contain a single paraphrase pair or multiple paraphrase pairs.
- the potential paraphrase pairs may be grouped by the paraphrase engine 168 into groups of like potential paraphrase pairs. For example, all of the potential paraphrase pairs “pulled out of—withdrew from” are grouped together.
- a group of potential paraphrase pairs is identified for processing by the paraphrase engine 168 in block 206 .
- An identified group is then compared with a minimum threshold in block 208 .
- the minimum threshold is based on the frequency of occurrence of the potential paraphrase pair. The frequency of occurrence can be determined by the number of paraphrase pairs in the group. In one embodiment, the minimum frequency for a potential paraphrase pair may be three. In this example, the paraphrase engine 168 determines whether the number of potential paraphrase pairs in a group is three or greater.
- the group is discarded in block 210 . If the group of potential paraphrase pairs does meet the minimum threshold, then the group is indexed in block 212 .
- the paraphrase engine 168 adds the potential paraphrase pair from the group to a paraphrase index.
- the paraphrase index is located on storage device 180 . A frequency of occurrence value can be associated with the paraphrase pair in the index.
- a single entry for the paraphrase pair “pulled out of—withdrew from” may be included in the paraphrase index with the associated frequency value of ten.
- the paraphrase engine 168 determines if any more groups of potential paraphrase pairs need to be processed. If no more groups require processing, then method 200 stops at block 216 . If more groups require processing, then method 200 returns to block 206 where another group of potential paraphrase pairs is identified for processing.
- the paraphrase processor 168 may determine which potential paraphrase pairs to index based on the list of potential paraphrase pairs.
- the paraphrase engine 168 may determine a frequency of occurrence value for all potential paraphrase pairs. The frequency value can be the number of times a potential paraphrase pair occurs in the list. The paraphrase engine 168 may then discard all paraphrase pairs that do not meet a minimum frequency value and extract and index all paraphrase pairs that meet the minimum frequency value. Similar to the example above, the frequency value can be associated with the paraphrase pair in the index. Alternatively, the paraphrase pair entries in the paraphrase index can be ranked based on their associated frequency value.
- FIG. 5 shows an illustrative portion of a paraphrase index 500 according to one embodiment of the invention.
- the paraphrase index 500 contains a ranked list of paraphrase pairs.
- the paraphrase index may have a variety of different uses, such as in information retrieval, information extraction, automated question answering, and document summarization.
- the paraphrase index may be used to associate a paraphrase in the search request with matching paraphrases in the text of documents sought for retrieval. For example, if a web search query includes the phrase “withdrew from” a search engine 120 can access the paraphrase index and determine that “withdrew from” has an associated paraphrase “pulled out of”. The search engine 120 can use this information to search for documents that match both “withdrew from” and “pulled out of” and the rest of the search terms.
- a question may be a natural language search query. It is helpful to identify any paraphrases of words or phrases in the question to more fully identify the answer.
- extraction patterns may be set up around certain types of tokens, such as verbs. It is therefore useful to identify paraphrases containing verbs so that useful information is not missed and is extracted.
- the paraphrase index may be used to identify paraphrases during the extraction of information.
- key sentences can be identified as being useful in summarizing the content of the document or text.
- paraphrase index may also be used in other suitable ways.
