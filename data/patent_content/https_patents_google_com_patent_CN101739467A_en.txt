Fig. 3 is a process flow diagram of carrying out the method for web search in the explanation one embodiment of the invention.Embodiments of the invention can utilize general networks search and (for example) by the individualized search of user's information prior or that provide together with submitting search to combined.In the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, search engine 120 receives request signal 130 (302) from client computer 102a.Search engine 120 is responded described request signal 130 by carrying out search.In an illustrated embodiment, search comprises three son processing can parallelly carrying out.These three processing comprise: search global index (304), search are stored as the URL (306) and the search of bookmark and explain (308).Other embodiment can utilize son littler or more big figure to handle.For instance, in one embodiment, the URL that is presented in the navigation history of browser is searched.
The shared ferret out of routine search engine search, for example shared search index.Embodiments of the invention can also be searched for the personal search target, for example bookmark, note, grade and other target.In one embodiment, this type of search comprises from bookmark database 140 reads url list, and for each page, the various piece that the search inquiry 114 that use is submitted to by user 112a comes searched page.In another embodiment, the search of the Agent operated on client computer 102a is stored on the client computer 102a or is stored in personal search target in the thesaurus (repository) that client computer 102a can have access to via network 106.
The note that comprises by using the search inquiry of being submitted to by user 112a 114 to come search subscriber to key in is explained in search.For instance, user 112a can key in lexical item " ship ", as the note to the page that comprises sea-freight supply.If user 112a keys in " ship ", as the part of the search inquiry 114 that is utilized by search engine 120, search is explained assembly and will be returned the page with " ship " note so.Another embodiment of the present invention is the search subscriber page of mark or note not only, and search and the user page or the page with similar note like the classes of pages of mark.
In an illustrated embodiment, shown son handle in 304,306 and 308 each all can produce independently group as a result.In other embodiments, son handle 304,306 and 308 can be through combination and/or be configured to provide automatically group as a result through combination.Described group as a result can be overlapping to a certain extent.In an illustrated embodiment, search engine 120 becomes a tabulation (310) with the Search Results merger.Then, search engine 120 is with described page rank (312).Can utilize the whole bag of tricks with page rank.For instance, search engine 120 can be with via the classification of returning based on the note of user's grade (if there is) as a result based on them, then through the standard grading algorithm.Hereinafter state several examples.The user 112a that search engine 120 is then searched for to request provides the group as a result 134 (314) through ordering.
In another embodiment, the user supplies the note that is associated with URL.The described note of storage is to replenish Search Results and further to improve scoring on each user base.Other user who has similar interest with the user that note is provided can use described note.
Embodiments of the invention can further utilize described note.For instance, in one embodiment, search engine 120 search in the note of user's supply is provided at the key word in the search inquiry 114, for example those notes is regarded as the user's particular anchor text that relates to the URL through explaining.In this type of embodiment, the reflection of group as a result global index that produces by search engine and associating from the result who explains keyword search.
Embodiment also can utilize other data (for example user's scoring) to come the grade of result of determination, come the mark result or be used for other purpose.For instance, in one embodiment, the page grade that search engine 120 provides is not subjected to the level affects of each page that the user supplies, but designator (for example asterisk or other little image) identification based on being stored in level data in the bookmark database 140 particular result of classification.
The result's of embodiments of the invention several types capable of being combined result maybe can present described result respectively.For instance, in one embodiment, user 112a submits search inquiry 114 to.The search engine 120 shared ferret outs of search also present the result in a tabulation.Search engine 120 is also searched for the personal search target and present the result of search in second tabulation.
In another embodiment of the present invention, search engine 120 also uses grade that the user uses with described page rank.For instance, user 112a is applied to each bookmark that is stored in the bookmark database 140 with grade (for example, between 0.0 and 10.0).The grade that search engine 120 is used the user is used for judging where specific project should be presented at as a result group 134.For instance, grade 0.5 can be represented unimportant, and lower grade can make the result unfavorable, and more high-grade its mark that then can make is higher.In another embodiment, like the content class of 120 pairs of search engines and high-grade URL not the classification page provide higher score.In an embodiment who stores a big group different user grade and note, search engine 120 can (for example) provides the additional correlation feature, for example page suggestion via simple clustering method (clustering approach) based on similar user's grade.
Lexical item that is associated with main URL or standby URL are the obvious marks in the individualized search, its indication user does not wish to search for described lexical item or navigates to described standby URL (as the situation in conventional browser application), is used for the lexical item of user 112a or the specific webpage that standby URL is correlated with but instead wish directly to forward to immediately one.
In one embodiment, user 112a is associated a specific lexical item or standby URL and a main URL (for example with bookmark database 140 in the relevant URL of bookmark of storage in advance).For instance, user 112a can key in lexical item and key in URL in another text box in a text box, and then button click so that described both be associated.Then, in the computer-readable medium of described association store on client computer 102a or be stored in can computer-readable medium by server 104 visit in, for example in the bookmark database 140.Lexical item or standby URL become " speed dialling " navigation link to URL.In one embodiment, user 112a keys in lexical item in the query search frame, and clickthrough or control, for example standard search links or button, and the application that browser or browser start is not by using search engine to carry out search to lexical item, but the URL that retrieval is associated with lexical item in advance, and jump to the website that is associated with URL immediately.In another embodiment, the keyboard binding causes browser to jump to the website that is associated with URL.In either case, the order of user 112a causes a behavior to take place, and described behavior is the individualized behavior at described user, but not the routine inquiry behavior that has with all users of search engine.In other words, do not carry out search; As carrying out substituting of search, browser just navigates to the URL that is associated with lexical item.
In another embodiment, user 112a keys in standby URL in the browser's address bar, and clicks " forwarding to " control or cause browser to estimate standby URL.Browser is not to navigate to URL, but at first with url list that bookmark is associated in the standby URL of search.If find standby URL, browser navigates directly to the main URL that is associated with standby URL so.
For instance, in one embodiment, user 112a makes lexical item " master " be associated with intra-company's web page of user.User 112a keys in lexical item " master " in the text box, and the URL of intra-company's web page is keyed in another text box, and click control so that described both be associated.Perhaps, the user clicks control during the demonstration of intra-company's web page, and this provides the chance that lexical item is associated with the page for user 112a.Subsequently, user 112a keys in lexical item " master " in the search column and clicks the search control.Because lexical item " master " is associated with the intra-company net home page, so browser navigates to intra-company's net home page of user immediately, rather than execution is to lexical item " master's " search.User 112a may be intended for being used for the association selection lexical item or the phrase of standard search.For instance, user 112a may use individual digit (for example " 1 ") to be associated with URL.
In another embodiment, user 112a make standby URL "
Www.myhome.com" be associated with the actual or main URL of the personal homepage of user 112a.When user 112a with URL "
Www.myhome.com" when keying in the browser's address bar of carrying out on client computer 102a, browser is positioned at described association between the standby and main URL, and navigate to the page by main URL sign, i.e. user's personal homepage.
