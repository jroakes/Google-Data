Abstract
In response to a query for information in a geographic region or at a location, ranked ads may be plotted on, or in association with, a map (e.g., as a list beside the map), satellite photo, or any other form of visual representation of geographic information (referred to generally as ''maps''). Sponsored ads might be shown in a dedicated place and/or might be elevated above other non-sponsored search results (e.g., Yellow Page listings). The number of ads shown in the list and/or plotted on the map could vary as a function of the resolution of the map or geographic image. The ads could be ranked or scored, and attributes or features of various ads may be a function of such a score or ranking. The plots on the map might be selectable to provide a pop-up with further information and possibly sponsored information (such as images, further ads, etc).

Fig. 2 shows can use environment 200 of the present invention therein.User's set (being also referred to as " client " or " client terminal device ") 250 can comprise browser equipment (for example the Navigator browser of the Opera Web browser of the Explorer browser of Microsoft, Norway Opera software, AOL/TimeWarner, Firefox browser of Mozilla or the like), electronic mail equipment (for example Outlook of Microsoft) or the like.Search engine 220 can allow the set of user's set 250 searching documents (for example webpage).Content server 230 can allow user's set 250 access document and out of Memory.The example of content server 230 comprises the map server such as Google Maps and Google Earth.E-mail server 240 (such as Hotmail, Yahoo Mail of GMail, the Microsoft Network of Google or the like) can be used to provide e-mail function to user's set 250.Advertisement Server 210 can be used to user's set 250 serve ads.Can with the Search Results that provides by search engine 220 serve ads explicitly.Yet, can distribute the advertisement relevant explicitly with the content that provides by content server 230 and/or by the Email that e-mail server 240 and/or user's set electronic mail equipment are supported with content.Similarly, can distribute explicitly and information-related advertisement with the information that provides by content server (for example cartographic information).Thereby content server 230 can be distributed the content such as article predetermined and that stored, and such as the information that dynamically generates that with the certain location is center and the map with specific scope.
As in ' 900 applications, discussing, advertisement can be directed to the document of distributing by content server.Thereby, an example of ad consumer 130 is general content server 230, it receives the request to document (for example article, clue, music, video, figure, Search Results, webpage are discussed include (1isting), map or the like), and in response to or serve this request and retrieve the document or the information of being asked.Content server 230 can be submitted to the request to advertisement Advertisement Server 120/210.This kind ad-request can comprise a plurality of advertisements of wanting.Ad-request also can comprise document request information.This information can comprise document itself (for example page), part or all of, the content use duration with document content or the corresponding classification of document request or theme (for example art, commercial affairs, computing machine, art-film, art-music or the like), document request, content type (for example text, figure, video, audio frequency, mixed-media or the like), geographical location information (for example defining the position in the zone of cartographic information), document information or the like.Notice that map server can provide map to another content server, make map can be integrated in the document of distributing by another content server.
One or more combined in the advertisement that content server 230 can provide the document of being asked and Advertisement Server 120/210.Comprise that this combined information of document content and advertisement is forwarded to final user's device 250 of request the document then, is used for showing to the user.At last, content server 230 can with about advertisement and advertisement how, when and/or the information that is presented where whether (for example position, the time of whether selecting, flash, the date of flashing, size, conversion or the like) transmit back Advertisement Server 120/210.Alternatively or extraly, can provide back Advertisement Server 120/210 with this kind information by some other means.
Off-line content supplier 232 can be with the information about the advertisement position in the issue that be about to occur, and may be that this information releasing (for example perhaps the theme of content or notion) offers Advertisement Server 210.In response, Advertisement Server 210 can provide the one group advertisement relevant with the content of issuing in the advertisement position at least some.Off-line content supplier 232 example comprises, for example magazine publishers, newspaper publisher, book publishers, offline music publisher, offline video game publisher, theatrical production, concert, sport event or the like.
The owner of offline advertisement position belongings 234 can provide the information about advertisement position at its off-line belongings (for example being used for the stadium scoreboard banner in the NBA of San Antonio, Texas match).In response, Advertisement Server can provide the one group advertisement relevant with belongings at least some of advertisement position.The example of off-line belongings 234 comprises, for example billboard, stadium scoreboard and baffle plate, truck trailer side plate or the like outside the venue.
Another example of ad consumer 130 is a search engine 220.Search engine 220 can receive the inquiry to Search Results.In response, search engine can the index of webpage (for example from) retrieve relevant search results.The paper " The Anatomy of a Large-ScaleHypertextual Search Engine (large-scale hypertext analysis on Search Engine) " and the United States Patent (USP) NO.6 that on the 7th the international web-seminar that Brisbane ,Australia is held, deliver at S.Brin and L.Page, in 285,999 (the two all incorporates this paper by reference into) exemplary search engine has been described.This kind Search Results can comprise, the extracts of for example tabulation of web page title, the text that extracts from those webpages and the hypertext link of pointing to those webpages, and can be grouped into predetermined number (for example 10 s') Search Results.
Search engine 220 can will be submitted to Advertisement Server 120/210 to the request of advertisement.Request can comprise a plurality of advertisements of wanting.This number can depend on the quantity in the space of the screen that Search Results, Search Results are shared or the page, size and dimension of advertisement or the like.In one embodiment, the number of the advertisement of wanting is from 1 to 10, and is preferably from 3 to 5.To the request of advertisement can also comprise inquiry (as imported or resolved), based on information inquiring (such as geographical location information, inquiry whether from the identifier of branch offices and this kind branch offices) and/or be associated with Search Results or based on the information of Search Results.This kind information can comprise, for example relevant identifier (for example document identifier or " docID "), the score value relevant (information retrieval (" IR ") score value for example, such as corresponding to dot product, page rank score value and/or the IR score value of the proper vector of inquiry and document and the combination of page rank score value) with Search Results with Search Results, from proper vector of the theme of the full text of the extracts of the text of document (for example webpage) extraction discerned, the document discerned, the document discerned, the document discerned or the like.
One or more combined in the advertisement that search engine 220 can provide Search Results and Advertisement Server 120/210.This combined information that comprises Search Results and advertisement is forwarded to the user who submits this search to then, is used for showing to this user.Preferably, Search Results is maintained as is different from advertisement, so as not to the user in paid advertisement be speculated as to produce between the neutral Search Results and obscure.
At last, search engine 220 can with about advertisement and advertisement when, where and/or the information how to be presented whether (for example position, the time of whether selecting, flash, the date of flashing, size, conversion or the like) transmit back Advertisement Server 120/210.Alternatively or extraly, can provide back Advertisement Server 120/210 with this kind information by some other means.
At last, e-mail server 240 can be considered to content server usually, and the document of being distributed only is an Email therein.In addition, e-mail applications (such as MicrosoftOutlook) can be used to send and/or receive Email.Therefore, e-mail server 240 or application can be considered to ad consumer 130.Thereby Email can be considered to document, and targeted ads can be planted document therewith and distributed explicitly.For example, one or more advertisements can be in Email, at it down, distributed explicitly thereon or with it.
Although previous examples is described as server (i) request advertisement, and (ii) that itself and content is combined, one or two in these operations can be passed through client terminal device (such as final user's computing machine) and carry out.
§ 4.3 example embodiment
Fig. 3 shows can be by the various operations of Advertisement Server execution according to the invention and the bubble diagram that can plant the various information of manipulating and/or generating thus.Advertisement selection operation 310 can be used to use advertising message 330 and the group 340 of solicited message 320 to generate one or more advertisements.In an exemplary embodiment according to the invention, this group advertisement 340 can comprise the advertisement relevant with solicited message 320.For example, if solicited message 320 is associated with search inquiry, advertisement 340 can be relevant with the word of search inquiry.Alternatively, if solicited message 320 is associated with the document that will be distributed, advertisement 340 can be relevant with the content of document.Under any circumstance, solicited message 320 comprises the positional information based on map.For example, solicited message 320 can be included in the boundary of the geographic area shown in the map.Among the § 4.3.1, with reference to figure 4 and Fig. 5 the example data structure that can be used for storing solicited message 320 and advertising message 330 has been described respectively below.Among the § 4.3.2, the illustrative methods that can be used for carrying out advertisement selection operation 310 has been described with reference to figure 6 below.
Still referring to Fig. 3, advertisement scoring operation 350 can be used for using first group of 340 advertisement and advertising message 330 with group 360 that generates one or more advertisements and the score value (and/or rank) that is associated.Scoring operation 350 can be considered the positional information based on map of advertisement, for example position effect information and/or position pricing information.Alternatively or extraly, scoring operation 350 can be considered more general effect information and pricing information.Among the § 4.3.2, the exemplary method that can be used for carrying out scoring operation 350 has been described with reference to figure 7 below.
At last, advertising message 330 can comprise based on the orientation for place of map and/or based on the position pricing information of map.This information can be imported and/or revise by advertising message input and/or bookkeeping 335 by advertiser or its representative.Among the § 4.3.3, the illustrative methods that can be used for carrying out these operations 335 has been described with reference to Figure 10 below.
Embodiment according to the invention does not need to provide and/or uses 3 described all operations and the information with reference to figure, and need not come executable operations with the order that illustrates.At last, the present invention can make up or separate described function about various operations.For example, selection and scoring operation 310 and 350 can be combined as single operation.
§ 4.3.1 example data structure
Fig. 4 shows example ad solicited message 320 ' according to the invention.Ad-request information 320 ' can comprise such as the information described in the § 4.1.1 in the above.As shown in the figure, ad-request information can comprise the positional information based on map.This kind information can be used to distributing of targeted ads.This kind information also can be used in the scoring or rank of advertisement.
Positional information based on map can be encoded with different modes.For example, can be encoded as coordinate (for example latitude and longitude) in one or more positions (for example corner) at map based on the positional information of map.If a pair of coordinate only is provided, the size of map (or engineer's scale) also should be provided.Can use the alternate manner of encoding to based on the positional information of map.
Fig. 5 shows example ad information 330 ' according to the invention.Advertising message 330 ' can comprise such as the information described in the top § 4.2.For example, advertising message 330 ' can comprise unique ad identifier, advertising creative the content pointer of this kind creative content (or point to) and/or login page link or the like.And example ad information 330 ' can comprise at least one in map-orientation for place information and the map-position pricing information.Map-position effect information (not shown) can be tracked and be associated with advertisement.
Map-orientation for place information can comprise that the advertiser wants one or more geographic position and/or the zone that its advertisement is directed to.For example, the map location directed information can be certain location and service specified radius.For example, theme park can have bigger service radius than sedan limousine service, and the sedan limousine service can have bigger service radius than local pizzeria.Map-position pricing information can comprise each the pricing information in one or more zones.Map-position pricing information should be corresponding with map-orientation for place information.Map-position pricing information can be the function from the distance of ad-hoc location.For example, can be used in proposed on March 31st, 2005, title classifies inventor's U.S. Patent application NO.11/096 as for " AUTOMATED OFFER MANAGEMENTUSING AUDIENCE SEGMENT INFORMATION (using the automatic bid management of audient's zone field) " and with Ross Koningstein, the technology described in 283 (incorporate this paper by reference into and be called " ' 283 application ").
In one embodiment of the invention, can infer the geographic position directed information from the geographic position pricing information.For example, if the advertiser has submitted flash 1.50 dollars highest bid of a certain geo point at every turn, can suppose that this advertiser wants its advertisement is directed to the final user who watches the map that comprises this point.Similarly, if the advertiser has submitted to flash 0.00 dollar bid price of given geographic area at every turn, can suppose that this advertiser wants to avoid with the final user of its ad serve to the map of watching given geographic area.
§ 4.3.2 illustrative methods
Fig. 6 is the process flow diagram that is used to carry out the illustrative methods 310 ' of advertisement selection operation 310 in mode according to the invention.The information that accepts request and advertising message (frame 610).Except other, solicited message can comprise the positional information based on map.Except other, advertising message can comprise map-orientation for place information.As the 620-640 that circulates is indicated, to each the execution action in one or more advertisements.More specifically, use at least be associated with solicited message determine the circuit correlation measure (frame 630) of advertisement based on the positional information of map and the map that is associated with advertisement-orientation for place information.After in one or more advertisements each is all processed, leave method 310 ' (node 650).
Use the keyword directed information be associated with advertisement, and advertisement associated advertisement correlation information or the like can determine the correlativity of advertisement.Under any circumstance, can use the request and the positional information based on map of advertisement to determine the correlativity of advertisement at least.In at least some embodiment according to the invention, (for example littler geographic area) map-positional information of coupling is concrete more, and advertisement is relevant more aspect the position at least.Thereby, for example, if the final user is watching the map that comprises San Diego, CA, suppose that all other relevance factors are equal, then having can be more relevant than the advertisement that has the map-orientation of California to the advertisement of the map-orientation of San Diego, CA, having can be more relevant than the advertisement that has the map-orientation of West Coast to the advertisement of the map-orientation of California, and having can be more relevant than the advertisement that has the map-orientation of the U.S. to the advertisement of the map-orientation of West Coast.That is, different positional informations can have different scopes, and some positional informations can comprise other positional information.Usually, in order to determine the advertisement correlativity, the weight of the so not concrete positional information (for example bigger zone) of the matching ratio of positional information (for example littler zone) is bigger more specifically.
Naturally, map-orientation for place can be in a plurality of relevance factors one.For example, the advertisement correlativity also can be considered the comparison of (a) advertisement correlation information and the content of the document of being asked, (b) the advertisement keyword orientation of the word of reference search inquiry, (c) the demographic information of user, (d) user behavior information, (e) time/date/season directed information or the like.
Fig. 7 is the process flow diagram that is used to carry out the illustrative methods 350 ' of scoring operation 350 in mode according to the invention.Score value can be used for determining the relevant displaying attribute (for example information bubble attribute of the mark icon attribute of the element of size, color, volume, enhancing, enhancing, enhancing or the like) of advertisement.Can be used in proposed on June 30th, 2003, title classifies inventor's U.S. Patent application NO.10/610 as for " USINGENHANCED AD FEATURES TO INCREASE COMPETITION INONLINE ADVERTISING (using the characteristic of advertisement that strengthens to increase competitive power) " and with Eric Veach in online advertisement, the technology described in 350 (incorporate this paper by reference into and be called " ' 350 application ") is used enhanced features.Accept the advertising message (frame 710) of candidate's advertisement.As the 720-740 that circulates is indicated, to each the execution action in one or more advertisements.More specifically, at least one in use pricing information, map-position pricing information (if available), effect information and the map-position effect information (if available) determined ad score (frame 730).In case after all candidate's advertisements are all processed, leave method 350 ' (node 750).
Exist several different methods to determine to meet the ad score of frame 730.Several illustrative methods are described below.If ad system wants to make revenus maximization, it can multiply by advertising effect by each effect price value determines score value.For example, it can determine to click cost * click-through rate at every turn, or each conversion cost * conversion ratio.Price can be given a discount or be adjusted.The present invention can advantageously use map-positional information, if available, improve income and estimates.For example, suppose that advertisement watching the map that comprises Santiago with the final user who is directed to.Further the following relevant comparably on the other hand advertisement of hypothesis has shown related information:
Advertisement A: at every turn click maximum cost=0.25 dollar;
The maximum cost of each click=1.00 dollars in Santiago;
CTR=is in the U.S. 0.02;
CTR=is in the California 0.04;
CTR=is in Santiago 0.20.
Advertisement B: at every turn click maximum cost=0.50 dollar;
The maximum cost of each click=2.00 dollars in the Florida State;
CTR=is in the U.S. 0.07;
CTR=is in the California 0.02;
CTR=is in Santiago 0.02.
If do not use map-location score, to the simple product score value of advertisement A will be 0.0050 (=0.25*0.02), and to advertisement B will be 0.0350 (=0.50*0.07).If use map-location score, to the simple product score value of advertisement A will be 0.20 (=1.00*0.20), and to advertisement B will be 0.01 (=0.50*0.02).Thereby if do not use map-positional information, advertisement B will be than advertisement A score height, if still use map-positional information, advertisement A will be than advertisement B score height.For example, advertisement A can be the restaurant that is used in Santiago, and advertisement B is used for a large amount of chain restaurants that exist in the Florida State.By using map-positional information, the present invention can have precedence over advertisement B and come advantageously serve ads A, because it usually may be to more useful to the interested final user of the map that comprises Santiago.
When determining score value, embodiment according to the invention also can use propinquity (for example contiguous with the final user of Input Address or position, contiguous or the like with the center of map).Usually, if all other factorses are equal, the advertisement of position with final user of the center of neighbor map more or assigned address will be than having apart from the center of map or the advertisement of the position that the final user of assigned address is farther has higher score value.This kind distance can be used continuously or be used with discrete number the influence of ad score.When advertisement is marked, can consider again other factor.These factors can comprise the project that use is searched by the final user local availability, use attribute (for example position of advertiser's nearest retail shop) of advertiser or the like.
In at least some embodiment according to the invention, for advertisement scoring, the most concrete position price and/or effect information that use is complementary.In different embodiment according to the invention, can use following content-targeted ads: (A) " be included in " position that is directed in the map, (B) " be included in " map in the position that is directed, and/or (C) figure and to the common factor of the position that small part is directed at least in part.
Fig. 8 is the process flow diagram that is used to carry out the illustrative methods 390 ' of user behavior feedback operation 390 in mode according to the invention.Look back scoring operation 350, can in the score value of determining advertisement, use map-position certain effects information.The method 390 ' of Fig. 8 is a kind of method of following the tracks of this kind information.Each serve ads, this incident can be discerned by unique procedure identifier (for example Advertisement Server IP address, date and Time of Day).Any map-orientation for place the information used when procedure identifier can be with serve ads or the map-positional information of association requests are associated.Advertisement can be distributed (frame 810) with its procedure identifier.Indicated as event box 820, in response to different incidents can manner of execution 390 ' different branches.For example, if received user behavior information, (so map-positional information if having, is used when serve ads at first) (frame 830) was associated the user behavior information that is received before event box 820 is got back to by method 390 ' branch with procedure identifier.If satisfied the condition that is used to upgrade effect information (for example reception of the effect information of the reception of effect information, some, from the timing termination of final updating, absolute time/date or the like), consider map-orientation for place information or the map-position request information that is associated with the ad serve process, before event box 820 is got back to by the branch of method 390 ', upgrade advertising results information (frame 840).
Thereby method 390 ' can be used for tracking advertising effectiveness information, map-positional information that its explanation may be used when serve ads.The various alternative methods that map-positional information is associated with effect information are possible.Although not shown, can be used for following the tracks of advertising effect by the size in the zone of map shows.For example, the advertisement with cafe reward voucher can be than with the map better effects if of showing the city with the map of showing a little square.
Fig. 9 is a process flow diagram of carrying out the illustrative methods 335 ' of advertising message input and/or bookkeeping in mode according to the invention.Look back Fig. 5, advertising message 330 ' can comprise one or more in map-orientation for place information and the map-position pricing information.Method 330 ' is accepted advertisement user input that authorized and/or that verified (frame 910).Indicated as event box 920, in response to different input types can manner of execution 335 ' different branches.If the advertiser imports map-position pricing information, add or renewal map-position pricing information (frame 930).Also can fill or revise related map-orientation for place information (frame 940) according to pricing information.For example, if the user has imported 0.80 dollar of each click highest price for a mile radius of No. 123 from the Main street of California Anytown, and if advertisement do not comprise this regional map-orientation for place, can add this kind information.If the user changes subsequently to each click highest price to 0.00 in this zone dollar, can close or remove this regional map-orientation for place.Get back to frame 920,, add or renewal map-orientation for place information (frame 950) if the user imports map-orientation for place information.Related map-position pricing information can be requested (frame 960) but not need to be provided.
In one embodiment of the invention, if the advertiser imports the geographic position directed information, make it remove that employed position qualifier is desirable in the keyword orientation.
In one embodiment of the invention, the advertiser can be limited to the quantity and/or the combination of the type of map-positional information of being imported.
Can provide the further feature at advertiser user interface to make input and/or managing advertisement information more convenient.For example,, still want to add the propaganda activity of map-orientation for place, can provide input in batches to support, make the advertiser not need to re-enter total advertising message if any advertiser has ready-made propaganda activity.In response to map-positional information of being imported, help feature can be used for the extra map-positional information of suggestion (more same type, more specifically, more generally or the like).
