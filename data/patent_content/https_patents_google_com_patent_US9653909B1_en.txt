Definitions
- Various components of a vehicle system may be arranged in series to form a stacked topology. Stacked topologies are often advantageous because they present certain efficiencies.
- An energy kite may have rotors coupled to a number of motor-generators.
- the motor-generators may be connected in series to form a stack.
- an electrical fault may occur in one of the motor-generators. Due to the fault, a voltage across the faulty motor-generator may increase or decrease, causing the unfaulty motor-generators to be subjected to an undervoltage or overvoltage condition. To compensate for this, a fault-mitigation circuit may short circuit the faulty motor-generator, facilitating proper operation of the remaining motor-generators.
- a method may include operating a number of circuit elements, where each circuit element includes an energy storage element.
- the method may further include operating a number of fault-mitigation circuits, each individual fault-mitigation circuit being electrically coupled in parallel to a respective circuit element and each individual fault-mitigation circuit including a switch that in a closed position will cause the energy storage element to drain and in an open position will not cause the energy storage element to drain.
- operating the fault-mitigation circuits may include detecting an electrical fault in one of the circuit elements and cycling the switch of the fault-mitigation circuit coupled in parallel to the faulty circuit element between the open position and the closed position until the storage element of the faulty circuit element is discharged of energy, at which point the switch remains closed.
- a system may include a number of circuit elements, where each circuit element includes an energy storage element.
- the system may further include a number of fault-mitigation circuits, each individual fault-mitigation circuit being electrically coupled in parallel to a respective circuit element and each individual fault-mitigation circuit including a switch that in a closed position will cause the energy storage element to drain and in an open position will not cause the energy storage element to drain.
- the system may further include a controller coupled to each fault-mitigation circuit, the controller being configured to carry out operations including detecting an electrical fault in one of the circuit elements and cycling the switch of the fault-mitigation circuit coupled in parallel to the faulty circuit element between the open position and the closed position until the storage element of the faulty circuit element is discharged of energy, at which point the switch remains closed.
- a controller coupled to each fault-mitigation circuit, the controller being configured to carry out operations including detecting an electrical fault in one of the circuit elements and cycling the switch of the fault-mitigation circuit coupled in parallel to the faulty circuit element between the open position and the closed position until the storage element of the faulty circuit element is discharged of energy, at which point the switch remains closed.
- FIG. 1 depicts an energy kite, according to an example embodiment.
- FIG. 2 is a simplified block diagram depicting components of an energy kite, according to an example embodiment.
- FIG. 3 depicts an example fault-mitigation circuit according to an example embodiment.
- FIG. 4 depicts another example fault-mitigation circuit according to an example embodiment.

- FIG. 6 depicts a fault-detection circuit according to an example embodiment.
- FIG. 7 depicts a pulse-width modulation circuit according to an example embodiment.
- FIG. 8 depicts a flowchart of a method according to an example embodiment.
- Illustrative embodiments relate to example fault-mitigation circuits and corresponding control methods.
- the control methods may be used to operate the fault-mitigation circuits in such a way so as to divert current around a faulty circuit element. This may be useful when circuit elements are arranged in stacked topologies. However, the methods may be useful for circuit elements arranged in other topologies as well, including being electrically isolated from one another.
- fault-mitigation circuits may be embodied as crowbar circuits, which may include a switch and a current suppressing element. Each fault-mitigation circuit may be electrically coupled in parallel to a respective circuit element, such as a motor or generator.
- a faulty circuit element may be detected.
- the term “faulty,” as used in this disclosure, describes a circuit element whose voltage is above a threshold high value or below a threshold low value.
- a faulty circuit element may be caused by, for example, an open circuit, a short circuit, or some other aspect of the circuit element that may affect its voltage level.
- the switch of the fault-mitigation circuit coupled in parallel to the faulty circuit element may be cycled between an open and closed position at a varying duty cycle. The duty cycle may be increased until it reaches 100 percent and the switch remains closed. Concurrently, the remaining switches coupled in parallel to unfaulty circuit elements may be prevented from cycling and may be held in an open position.

- the threshold high value may be a predetermined voltage level that is higher than a typical voltage, where the typical voltage is the voltage across a circuit element 302 a - d during normal operation.
- the threshold low value may be a predetermined voltage level that is lower than the typical voltage.
- a fault may be caused by an open circuit, a short circuit, or any other aspect of a circuit element 302 a - d that may cause its voltage to rise above the threshold high value or fall below the threshold low value.
- the controller 308 may be electrically coupled to the circuit elements 302 a - d .
- the controller 308 may be advantageous to electrically isolate the controller 308 from the rest of the circuit 300 .
- the controller 308 is electrically coupled to the circuit elements 302 a - d through a number of high voltage dividers 310 a - e ; however, in other embodiments, different components may be used to isolate the controller 308 , such as optical isolators, or any other electrical isolation component.
- the controller 308 may be electrically isolated from the switches 306 a - d by optical isolators or any other electrical isolation component.
- the switch of the fault-mitigation circuit coupled in parallel to the faulty circuit element may be toggled from an open position to a closed position. Closing the switch creates a short circuit across the faulty circuit element and allows an energy storage component of the faulty circuit element to discharge through the switch.
- the controller 308 may toggle the switch 306 a from the open position to the closed position, allowing an energy storage component of the circuit element 302 a to discharge through the switch 306 a.
- the energy storage components of the circuit elements 302 a - d may store enough energy to damage the switches 306 a - d or the circuit elements 302 a - d if discharged all at once.
- the duty cycle may initially be low (e.g., 50% or lower) when the energy component of the faulty circuit element stores the most energy and, therefore, discharges the fastest.
- the duty cycle may be increased at a predetermined rate until it reaches 100%, where the switch remains closed, allowing the energy component to completely discharge.
- the controller 308 may cycle the switch 306 a between an open position and a closed position at a varying duty cycle until an energy storage component in the circuit element 302 a is completely discharged, at which point the switch 306 a remains closed.
- the duty cycle may initially be 50% or lower and may increase to 100% at a predetermined rate, and the entire process may be completed in 10 milliseconds or less.
- a switch of a fault-mitigation circuit coupled in parallel to a faulty circuit element may be cycled between an open position and a closed position at a duty cycle that varies depending on an electrical current through the switch.
- the controller may toggle the switch coupled in parallel to the faulty circuit element from an open position to a closed position, allowing an energy storage component in the faulty circuit element to discharge through the switch. While the energy storage component is discharging, the controller may measure an electrical current through the switch using a current probe, ammeter, or any other device for measuring electrical current. If the measured current exceeds a threshold high value, the controller may toggle the switch from the closed position to the open position.
- the threshold high value may be a predetermined value that is chosen based on the characteristics of the switch. For example, for a switch with a maximum current rating, the threshold high value may be equal to or lower than the maximum current rating of the switch.
- the switch may remain in the open position for a predetermined amount of time, at which point the controller toggles the switch from the open position to the closed position. This process may be repeated until the energy storage component of the faulty circuit element is completely discharged, at which point the switch remains in the closed position.
- the controller may toggle a MOSFET on by applying a particular voltage (e.g., 8.0 V) between the gate and source terminals of the MOSFET and toggle a MOSFET off by removing the application of voltage between the gate and source terminals and/or by applying a lesser voltage (e.g., 0.5 V) between the gate and source terminals of the MOSFET.
- a particular voltage e.g., 8.0 V
- a lesser voltage e.g., 0.5 V
- a 50% duty cycle dictates that over the course of a switching cycle, the amount of time a switch is toggled on is about equal to the amount of time the switch is toggled off.
- a duty cycle of, say, 75% dictates that over the course of a switching cycle, the amount of time a switch is toggled on is about three times longer than the amount of time the switch is toggled off.
- the controller may lower the voltage level of the voltage source 304 so the voltages across the unfaulty circuit elements are not increased.
- the voltages across the circuit elements V 1-4 may be equal to respective typical operating voltages.
- the controller 308 may cycle the switch 306 a between an open position and a closed position, allowing an energy storage component of the circuit element 302 a to discharge through the switch 306 a .
- V 1 is lowered and approaches zero volts once the switch 306 a remains closed.
- V 2-4 increase accordingly.
- the controller 308 may lower the voltage level of the voltage source 304 until V 2-4 are equal to their respective typical operating voltages.
- the circuit 300 may further include a fault-sensing inductor 314 connected in series to the voltage source 304 .
- a fault occurs in one of the circuit elements 306 a - d , a change in current from the voltage source 304 may induce a voltage across the fault-sensing inductor 314 .
- the voltage supplied by the voltage source 304 may be lowered by a predetermined amount.
- FIG. 4 depicts an alternate arrangement for fault-mitigation circuits that may utilize current suppressor elements to help mitigate faults in circuit elements.
- Circuit 400 is chiefly the same as circuit 300 , however circuit 400 includes current suppressor elements 402 a - d each coupled in series with switches 306 a - d respectively.
- the current suppressor elements 402 a - d each include an inductor coupled in parallel with a diode; however, in other arrangements, the current suppressor elements may include other components, such as a resistor, a thermistor, or any other inrush current limiter.
- the inductors limit the inrush current to the switches 306 a - d while the diodes act as flyback diodes to prevent voltage spikes across the inductors.
- the controller 308 detects a fault in circuit element 302 a
- switch 306 a is cycled between an open position and a closed position.
- switch 306 a is toggled closed, the inductor in current suppressor element 402 a limits the inrush current to switch 306 a .
- switch 306 a is toggled open, the flyback diode of current suppressor element 402 a prevents a voltage spike across the inductor of current suppressor element 402 a .
- the size of the inductors in current suppressor elements 402 a - d may be chosen based on the current ratings of the switches 306 a - d and the duty cycle of the switches 306 a - d during operation of the example control method described above. Switches with lower current ratings require larger inductors to further suppress inrush current. On the other hand, by lowering the duty cycle of switches 306 a - d , smaller inductors may be used. This may be advantageous for arrangements where size and weight are important considerations, for example when the circuit 400 is implemented as part of an aerial vehicle, such as the aerial vehicle 100 depicted in FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 5 depicts an alternate arrangement for fault-mitigation circuits that may utilize energy absorbing elements to help mitigate faults in circuit elements.
- Circuit 500 is chiefly the same as circuit 300 , however circuit 500 includes energy absorbing elements 502 a - d each coupled in parallel to switches 306 a - d respectively.
- the energy absorbing elements 502 a - d are further coupled in parallel to the circuit elements 302 a - d respectively by inductors 504 a - e .
- the energy absorbing elements 502 a - d each include one or more varistors, such as metal-oxide varistors; however, in other arrangements, the energy absorbing elements may include other components, such as a gas discharge tube or any other voltage suppressor.
- the energy absorbing elements 502 a - d protect the switches 306 a - d from overvoltage conditions by absorbing energy from the storage element of a faulty circuit element when the switches 306 a - d are in an open position.
- the inductors 504 a - e limit the rate of change of current flowing from the storage element of a faulty circuit element by directing current to the energy absorbing elements 502 a - d when cycling the switches 306 a - d . For example, if the controller 308 detects a fault in circuit element 302 a , switch 306 a is cycled between an open position and a closed position.
- switch 306 a When switch 306 a is toggled closed, current flows from the storage element of circuit element 302 a through switch 306 a , as well as through inductors 504 a and 504 b .
- switch 306 a When switch 306 a is toggled open, the voltage across the switch 306 a and the energy absorbing element 502 a increases. As the voltage across the energy absorbing element 502 a increases, the energy absorbing element 502 a becomes more conductive.
- Inductors 504 a and 504 b limit the rate of change of current flowing from the storage element of circuit element 302 a by directing current through the energy absorbing element 502 a while switch 306 a is in the open position.
- the inductors 504 a - e may include discrete inductors; however, the inductors 504 a - e may alternatively or additionally include a parasitic inductance of the conductors connecting the energy absorbing elements 502 a - d to the circuit elements 302 a - d.
- FIG. 6 depicts a fault-detection circuit 600 that may be implemented as part of a fault-mitigation circuit according to an example embodiment and may be implemented as part of the controller 308 depicted in FIGS. 3-5 .
- the fault-detection circuit 600 includes an arming circuit 604 , four delay circuits 602 a - d , and four lockout circuits 606 a - d (one delay circuit and one lockout circuit for each of the four circuit elements 302 a - d ). As with the number of circuit elements 302 a - d depicted in FIGS.
- the fault-detection circuit 600 is arranged to output a logic signal based on whether a fault is detected in one of the circuit elements 302 a - d .
- the fault-detection circuit 600 is arranged to output a logic high signal when a fault is detected; however, the fault-detection circuit 600 may alternatively be arranged to output a logic low signal when a fault is detected.
- the arming circuit 604 is configured to prevent the fault-detection circuit 600 from outputting a logic high until the voltage source 304 has been turned on for a predetermined amount of time.
- the delay circuits 602 a - d are configured to prevent the fault-detection circuit 600 from outputting a logic high until the voltage across one of the circuit elements 302 a - d is above a threshold high value or below a threshold low value for a predetermined amount of time. This improves the accuracy of the fault-detection circuit 600 by eliminating false positives that may occur due to transient variations of the voltages across the circuit elements 302 a - d .
- the lockout circuits 606 a - d are configured to prevent more than one of the switches 306 a - d from being toggled closed at any given time.

- the MAIN logic signal may be configured to be logic high when the voltage source 304 is turned on and logic low when the voltage source 304 is turned off. When the voltage source 304 is turned on, the MAIN logic signal becomes logic high.
- the logic high signal is passed through the chained D flip-flops one at a time at the rate of the clock signal.
- the AND gate outputs a logic high signal, arming the fault-detection circuit 600 and allowing faults to be detected.
- the length of the arming delay provided by the arming circuit 604 may be increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing the number of chained D flip-flops. Similarly, the length of the arming delay may be increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing the period of the clock signal.
- each of the delay circuits 602 a - d include a number of chained D flip-flops, the output of each being input to an AND gate, and the chained D flip-flops may share a clock signal.
- Each of the delay circuits 602 a - d may include two logic input signals, LO 1-4 and HI 1-4 configured to be logic high when a particular fault is present.
- the LO 1-4 signals may be configured to be logic high when the voltage across a corresponding circuit element 302 a - d is below the threshold low value.
- LO 1 may be logic high when the voltage across circuit element 302 a is below the threshold low value, and so on.
- the HI 1-4 signals may be configured to be logic high when the voltage across a corresponding circuit element 302 a - d is above the threshold high value.
- HI 1 may be logic high when the voltage across circuit element 302 a is above the threshold value, and so on.
- each of the delay circuits 602 a - d includes an OR gate configured to output a logic high value into the input of the chained D flip-flops when either of its inputs is logic high.
- an input to one of the delay circuits 602 a - d becomes logic high.
- the logic high signal is passed through the chained D flip-flops one at a time at the rate of the clock signal. For example, if the voltage across circuit element 302 a is above the threshold high value, the HI 1 input becomes logic high.
- the logic high signal passes through the chained D flip-flops of delay circuit 602 a . Once the logic high signal has passed through all of the chained D flip-flops, and once the arming circuit 604 outputs a high signal, the AND gate of delay circuit 602 a outputs a logic high signal. If, at any time before the logic high signal passes through each of the chained D flip-flops, the voltage across circuit element 302 a returns to a value below the threshold high value and above the threshold low value, a logic low signal is input to the chained D flip-flops, and the AND gate of delay circuit 602 a outputs a logic low signal. Similar to the arming circuit 604 , the length of the delay provided by the delay circuits 602 a - d may be increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing the number of chained D flip-flops or by increasing or decreasing the period of the clock signal.
- arming circuit 604 and delay circuits 602 a - d in the fault-detection circuit 600 in FIG. 6 include chained D flip-flops to introduce delay, other sources of delay may be used as well, such as various shift registers, counters, or other known configurations of logic devices.
- the lockout circuits 606 a - d include output signals TRIG 1-4 configured to be logic high when a fault is present in a corresponding circuit element 302 a - d .
- each of the lockout circuits 606 a - d include a D flip-flop with enable and clear inputs. When a logic high signal is input to the enable input, the D flip-flop is configured to output a logic high signal. When a logic high signal is input to the clear input, the D flip-flop is configured to output a logic low signal.
- lockout circuit 606 a - d By connecting the clear input of one lockout circuit 606 a - d to the outputs of the other lockout circuits 606 a - d through an OR gate, only one of the lockout circuits 606 a - d may output a logic high value at any given time.
- the D flip-flop of lockout circuit 606 a is enabled, and the TRIG 1 signal becomes logic high.
- the logic high TRIG 1 signal is passed through OR gates to the clear inputs of the D flip-flops in the lockout circuits 606 b - d , so when the TRIG 1 signal is logic high, the TRIG 2-3 signals are all logic low.
- the lockout circuits 606 a - d are configured in a “first-in” arrangement ensuring only one lockout circuit may be activated at any given time, the lockout circuits 606 a - d may be synchronous and clocked by a four-phase clock in order to avoid race conditions.
- the controller 308 may be configured to activate a corresponding switch 306 a - d when one of the outputs TRIG 1-4 of lockout circuits 606 a - d becomes logic high. For example, when TRIG 1 is logic high, the controller 308 may cycle switch 306 a to mitigate a fault in circuit element 302 a , and so on. Because only one of the outputs TRIG 1-4 of the lockout circuits 606 a - d may be logic high at any given time, the controller 308 may only cycle one of the switches 306 a - d at any given time.
- FIG. 7 depicts a pulse-width modulation circuit 700 that may be implemented as part of a fault-mitigation circuit according to an example embodiment and may be implemented as part of the controller 308 depicted in FIGS. 3-5 .

- the comparator 704 is depicted as a 4-bit comparator, but may be implemented as any type of comparator in other examples.
- the delay circuit 706 is depicted as chained D flip-flops, but other sources of delay may be used as well, such as various shift registers, counters, or other known configurations of logic devices.
- the first latch 708 , second latch 710 , and third latch 716 are depicted as D flip-flops, but various other types of latches may be implemented in other example embodiments. All logic devices depicted in FIG. 7 may share a clock signal unless indicated otherwise.
- the first counter 702 generates a 4-bit signal that is input to the comparator 704 .
- the comparator 704 compares the 4-bit signal from the first counter 702 with a 4-bit signal ABCD from the lookup table 714 . When the 4-bit signal from the first counter 702 equals the 4-bit signal ABCD from the lookup table 714 , the comparator 704 outputs a logic high signal; otherwise, the comparator 704 outputs a logic low signal.
- the output of the comparator 704 is connected to a clear input of the first latch 708 , so when the output of the comparator 704 is logic high, the first latch 708 outputs a logic low signal to the OR gate 718 .
- the logic high output from the comparator 704 is concurrently passed through the chained D flip-flops of the delay circuit 706 .
- An AND gate connected to the end of the delay circuit 706 is configured to output a logic high signal for one clock cycle after the logic high signal from the comparator 704 passes through the chained D flip-flops.
- the output of the delay circuit 706 is connected to an enable input of the first latch 708 , so when the output of the delay circuit 706 is logic high, the first latch 708 outputs a logic high signal until the clear input of the first latch 708 receives the next logic high signal from the output of the comparator 704 .
- the time difference between the enable input of the first latch 708 receiving a logic high signal and the clear input of the first latch 708 receiving a logic high signal may be varied.
- the output of the delay circuit 706 is also connected to a clear input of the first counter 702 , such that when the delay circuit 706 outputs a logic high signal for one clock cycle, the output of the first counter 702 is reset to zero. After being reset to zero, the first counter 702 resumes counting by incrementing its outputs to the comparator 704 with each clock cycle.
- the output of the delay circuit 706 is further connected to a clock input of the second latch 710 .
- the second latch 710 is configured to output a logic signal that alternates between low and high each time the delay circuit 706 outputs a logic high signal.
- the second latch 710 generates an output with a frequency equal to half the frequency of the delay circuit 706 output.
- This lower frequency signal from the second latch 710 is used as the clock signal to drive the second counter 712 .
- the clock signal for the second counter 712 may be effectively reduced even further by only using the four most significant digits (and ignoring the four least significant digits) of the output generated by the second counter 712 as depicted in FIG. 7 .
- the output of the second counter is used to determine the 4-bit output ABCD of the lookup table 714 .
- the lookup table 714 may be any device configured to output a predetermined 4-bit signal ABCD based on a 4-bit input signal.
- the lookup table 714 may include four 16:1 multiplexers, where the 4-bit signal from the second counter 712 is used to determine the output of each of the multiplexers. Other arrangements are possible as well.
- the lookup table 714 may be configured so that as the 4-bit signal from the second counter 712 increases, the 4-bit output ABCD from the lookup table 714 increases as well. As the 4-bit output ABCD increases, the amount of time between logic high outputs of the comparator 704 increases. This causes the first latch 708 to be cleared less frequently, which results in an increased duty cycle in the output of the OR gate 718 .
- the lookup table 714 is configured to increase the 4-bit output ABCD to its maximum value ( 1111 ).
- the third latch 716 is enabled, and a logic high signal is input to the OR gate 718 .
- the third latch 716 is enabled, it will continue to output a logic high signal to the OR gate 718 , causing the output of the OR gate 718 to have a duty cycle of 100%.
