Such as transmission information of relay node identifier, block length, transmission property, transmission priority.Header information can with comprising
Header information in packet frames is same or like, and the delivering of packet frames is confirmed by acknowledgement frame.For example, packet frames X can be with
Destination node D is transmitted to from source node S and relay node R1, R2 and R4 can be identified as to a part of chain.
Destination node D can be generated when receiving packet frames X and be transmitted acknowledgement frame Y.Acknowledgement frame Y can identify identical relay node
R1, R2 and R4, so that acknowledgement frame Y is intended to be intended to the phase for being relayed to destination node D from source node S via packet frames X
Same or similar relay node is delivered to source node S.At step 350, the relay node for receiving acknowledgement frame can be transmitted
Acknowledgement frame, and at step 360, source node can receive acknowledgement frame.Source node can be taken when receiving acknowledgement frame appoints
What movement applicatory is such as cancelled and retransmits obligation, the subsequent packet frames transmission of starting, change pattern (such as into standby mould
Formula, reception instruction mode etc.) etc..As illustrated examples, as shown in fig. 4c, destination node D 440 can receive grouping
Frame generates and transmits the received acknowledgement frame of confirmation packet frames.The acknowledgement frame can identify relay node C 430 and relay node
B 420.Relay node C 430 can receive acknowledgement frame and relay it.Relay node B 420 can receive acknowledgement frame and relay

A part of chain.Relay node C430 can receive acknowledgement frame Y and store and/or transmit acknowledgement frame Y.Then, it relays
Node C 430 can remove acknowledgement frame Y from its memory.Relay node B 420 can receive acknowledgement frame Y and store and/
Or transmission packet frames X.Then, relay node B 420 can remove acknowledgement frame Y from its memory.
According to the embodiment of disclosed theme, as grouping or the source node, mesh of a part of acknowledgement frame chain
Ground node and relay node can be the other nodes participated in node and network and can be non-participating node.Non-participating section
It is not source node, destination node or the node for being expected relay node that point, which can be relative to chain,.For example, Wi-Fi is routed
Device can transmit the packet frames of mark relay node R1, R2 and R3.Via determining relay node R1, R2 and R3 in Wi-Fi
During the packet frames transmitted between router and destination node, non-participating relay node R4 can receive packet frames and
It can not store and/or transmit the received packet frames of institute.As disclosed herein, non-participating node can notice that packet frames pass
It is defeated to avoid conflict activity.Such as, it is seen that the non-participating node of the transmission of packet frames can postpone transmit frame up to specified rate when
Between to avoid with grouping transmission conflict.Notably, non-participating node can be for purpose related with transmission packet frames
Pay no attention to packet frames (that is, the packet frames for not identifying non-participating node).However, non-participating node can be for network transmission purpose
The transmission of (for example, network load, conflict avoidance etc.) consideration packet frames.
According to the embodiment of disclosed theme, packet frames can be received by out-of-order relay node.Out-of-order relaying
Node can be participation node, but not be subsequent expectation node.Chain may include being intended to relay for packets or acknowledgement frame
Relay node and random ordering node can be not the participation node after transmission node in order.It can be based on institute herein
Disclosed technology determines sequence of the node in chain.As the example of out-of-order relay node, router can be transmitted
The instruction message of laptop computer is gone to, which will be relayed by relay node A, B and C.Router, relay node
A, B, C and laptop computer can be entirely the participation node section of instruction message chain.Relay node can be established
To arrange that router, relay node A, relay node B, relay node C and laptop computer in order according to the sequence.
Furthermore, it is possible to relay node A, B and C are identified as an alternative or sequentially in the header portion of instruction message according to this.Therefore, if
Relay node B directly receives transmission from router, rather than receives and transmit from relay node A, then relay node B can be random ordering
Relay node.Although being received out of order, out-of-order relay node can be passed through by the out-of-order received packet frames of relay node
To transmit.
As illustrated examples, as shown in fig 4b, source node A 410 can transmit packet frames X, and packet frames X is gone to
Destination node D 440.Packet frames X can directly be received by out-of-order relay node C 430 from source node A 410.Although still
Packet frames X is not received from relay node B 420 in order, out-of-order relay node C 430 can transmit packet frames X, and
Destination node D 440 can receive packet frames X.Showing for the relay node sequence identified in packet frames is illustrated in fig 5 a
Example.The header portion of packet frames 500 can identify relay node in order.As shown in part 512, for packet frames 500
The sequence of identified relay node can be R1, R3, R4 and R9.As another example, the grouping of destination node D1 is gone to
Frame Y can be received by relay node P sequentially.Relay node P can retransmit packet frames Y and destination node D1 can receive
Packet frames Y is relayed without packet frames Y by subsequent expectation relay node Q.Although not from subsequent expectation relay node Q
Packet frames Y is received, destination node D1 can transmit the received acknowledgement frame of confirmation packet frames Y.
Sequence of the node in chain can be determined based on the topology of source node, destination node or relay node.
That is, subsequent node can be in suitable direction recently close to the node of transmission node in order.For example, source, relaying A,
Relaying B and destination node can be arranged in a row, so that source is located at position 1, relaying A is located at ten feet from source in the x direction
Position 2 at, relaying B be located in the x direction from ten feet of A of position 3 of relaying at, and destination node is located in the direction x
On from ten feet of B of position 4 of relaying at.Therefore, the sequence of node can be source, relaying A, relay B, destination, or on the contrary,
For destination, relaying B, relaying A, source.Substantially, according to this example, sequentially based on the physical location of node.As based on network
The example of the ordering joint of topology, source, relaying A, relaying B and destination node can be laid out such that from source to relaying A's
It is expected that the delivery time is 4ms (shortest length of the time between source and any other node).From relaying A to the expectation of relaying B
Delivery time is 5ms (shortest length of the time between relaying A and any other node in addition to source node).From relaying B
Expected time to destination node is 4ms (shortest length of the time between relaying B and any other node).Therefore, it saves
The sequence of point can be source, relaying A, relaying B, destination, or be on the contrary destination, relaying B, relaying A, source.Substantially, root
Example accordingly is sequentially based on network topology associated with given node.It will such as be will be readily understood that by those skilled in the art
, network topology and arrangement can be based on the considerations of in addition to physical layouts and desired delivery time.
According to the embodiment of disclosed theme, transmission sequence can be opened up based on the network for being such as network controlled device offer
It flutters.Network controller can be communicated with source node, and source node can develop transmission sequence based on reliable communication.Example
Such as, network controller can check the instruction of controller for all nodes the topology that determine network and each by transmitting
The network site of node in a network.Controller can provide topology information to source node, and which source node can determine
Relay node is necessary to transmission.Controller can update network topology based on periodically examination, so that controller is pre-
First all nodes are checked during determining periodic intervals.As an alternative, the control when node is added or is removed from network
Device can update network topology by receiving automation examination.As an alternative or in addition, one or more relay nodes can be looked into
It tests each other and/or adjacent node, and provides the transmission information that result obtains then to controller.For example, every in chain
A node can check one or more adjacent nodes and tracer signal intensity or packet success probabilities data.Each node can be with
Transmit information to the controller that can carry out analyzing and determine based on the analysis transmission sequence to information.It is worth noting
Ground, relay node can be based on reliably being communicated and are selected as one of chain with other nodes or with controller
Point.
According to the embodiment of disclosed theme, transmission sequence can be based on historical data.Arrangement can be based in mistake
The historical data collected during the transmission gone will include the relay node in chain to determine.Historical data can be any
Data applicatory, signal strength, successful percentage, the percentage of failure, number, the node ranking of transmission etc..Example
Such as, as shown in the table 700 in Fig. 7, pass through the Successful transmissions percentage of five different relay nodes to destination node D1
Storage can be arranged.Arrangement can be based on such as associated important with the one or more packet frames of destination node of arrival
Property, speed, the duration, packet frames size etc. it is any applicatory because usually determining one group of relay node.It can will be compared with
A small number of purpose relay nodes are included in chain, to increase the speed that packet frames reach one or more destination nodes.It will
It is to be understood that as disclosed herein, although out-of-order packet frames can be with relay for packets frame, the relaying of higher number
Node may be limited to due to such as network of contention time section and/or collision avoidance technique and increase packet frames and arrive at the destination section
The time that point is spent.
According to the embodiment of disclosed theme, relay node can be cancelled based on the packet frames of transmission or acknowledgement frame
Relaying obligation.Receive packet frames relay node may due to such as network delay, conflict avoidance (for example, with one or
The identical time transmission frame of a number of other nodes, making one or more receiving nodes, over-burden), predetermined delay,
Any reason applicatory of delay etc. without transmitting/relay for packets frame immediately priority-based.Therefore, if relay node
It determines and has not yet been relayed by another relay node by the packet frames that relay node relays, then relay node can cancel it and relay
The obligation of packet frames.Similarly, relay node can receive confirmation relay node for received the answering of transmission/relaying packet frames
Answer frame.Based on acknowledgement frame, relay node can cancel the obligation of its relay for packets frame.Cancelling relaying obligation can be to avoid redundancy simultaneously
And reduce network load.
The relay node for receiving packet frames and not yet relay for packets frame can determine that another relay node has transmitted point
Framing, and therefore, cancel the relaying obligation that it transmits packet frames.Notably, detecting another relay node (after for example,
Continuous relay node) it may be redundancy that packet frames are transmitted by current hop node to be indicated to the transmission of packet frames,
It is thus unnecessary.As illustrated examples, as shown in FIG. 6 a, source node A 610 can transmit mark relay node B
The packet frames of 620 and relay node C 630.The packet frames can be connect by both relay node B 620 and relay node C 630
It receives.Relay node C 630 can transmit packet frames before relay node B 620 transmits packet frames.Relay node B 620 can be with
Determine packet frames by another node transmission (for example, being transmitted by any other node, specifically transmitted by relay node C, by
Subsequent node transmission etc.), and cancel the obligation that it transmits packet frames.Therefore, node B is to the expectation of packet frames or with other
The transmission 625 of mode plan may not be to be carried out by node B.
The relay node for receiving packet frames and not yet relay for packets frame can receive confirmation destination node and receive
The acknowledgement frame of packet frames, and therefore cancel the relaying obligation that it transmits packet frames.Notably, desired when having been carried out
As a result when (that is, packet frames are supplied to destination node), the acknowledgement frame that confirmation destination node receives packet frames can refer to
Show that current hop node transmission packet frames may be unnecessary.As illustrated examples, as shown in Figure 6b, source node A
610 can transmit the packet frames of mark relay node B 620 and relay node C 630.The packet frames can be by relay node B
Both 620 and relay node C 630 are received.Relay node C 630 can be transmitted before relay node B 620 transmits packet frames
The packet frames.Additionally, destination node D 640 can receive packet frames, generate the received acknowledgement frame of confirmation packet frames, and
And transmission acknowledgement frame 643.As will in addition occur, relay node B 620 can receive acknowledgement frame and cancel it at 626
Transmit the obligation of packet frames.
According to the embodiment of disclosed theme, multiple destination nodes can receive the grouping transmitted by source node
Frame.The packet frames can be transmitted by source node, it is intended to be received by multiple destination nodes via one or more relay nodes.Make
For illustrated examples, as shown in the figure 6c, source node A 610 can be transmitted via relay node B 620 and relay node C 630
Go to the packet frames of destination node D1 641 and destination node D2 650.The packet frames can be by 620 He of relay node B
Both relay node C 630 are received.Relay node C 630 can transmit this point before relay node B 620 transmits packet frames
Framing.Additionally, destination node D1 641 and destination node D2 650 can receive packet frames, generate confirmation packet frames
Received corresponding acknowledgement frame, and transmit these acknowledgement frames 647 and 651.Relay node B 620 can receive acknowledgement frame and
Based on the obligation for receiving two acknowledgement frames to cancel it at 627 and transmitting packet frames.Notably, packet frames may include
Destination node information, so that both node D1 641 and node D2 650 are identified as intended destination node.Therefore, only
The relay node B when the acknowledgement frame that both confirmation D1 641 and D2 650 receive packet frames is received by relay node B 620
620 can just cancel the obligation that it transmits packet frames.Receiving acknowledgement frame from the only one in D1 641 or D2 650 can not lead
Cause the relaying for cancelling relay node B voluntary.
According to the embodiment of disclosed theme, relay node priority can be distributed to one in chain or
Multiple relay nodes.As an alternative or furthermore, it is possible to chain priority is distributed into grouping or acknowledgement frame transmission.Due to it is all for example
Maintain desired network load, the transmission for increasing packet frames probability, increase packet frames transmission speed, utilize one
Or any reason applicatory of multiple specific nodes etc., priority can make the priority for being able to achieve the transmission of relay node
Sequence.
Relay node priority can determine by source node, or normal priority can be distributed to relay node with
In all transmission.For example, source node can transmit mark relay node R1 and relay node R2 and for relay node R1 and
The packet frames X of the relay node priority of both relay node R2.In illustrated examples, as illustrated in fig. 5b, packet frames 501
With the may include recognition purpose header of node D and relay node R1, R3, R4, R6 and R9.Additionally, header may include
Priority associated with each relay node.As indicated, header 530 includes identified node and associated priority
(that is, R1-2, R3-1, R4-3, R6-1 and R9-2).As an alternative, as an example, relay node R2 can be such that normal priority distributes
To it for transmitting one or more packets frame.Distribute to relay node normal priority can be it is permanent or can be with
It is modified by relay node, source node, controller etc. by any technology applicatory.
Priority for relay node can determine relay node, and when relay for packets frame is (for example, for relay for packets
Time, delay etc.).Relay node with higher priority value can be than the relay node with lower priority value faster
Ground repeater frame (that is, the received frame of transmission institute).The time, which can be, priority-based receives packet frames relative to relay node
Time, source node transmission packet frames to be relayed time etc..As an example, as illustrated in fig. 5b, relay node R1 tool
There is 1 priority, and relay node R4 has 3 priority.Therefore, if both relay node R1 and relay node R4 simultaneously
Receive packet frames, then relay node R1 can before relay node R4 relay for packets frame relay for packets frame.As an alternative, it is based on
The relaying time of priority can be the time relative to source node transmission packet frames, so that priority 1 relay node can be with
1ms relay for packets frame after the transmission, and priority 3 relay node can be with 4ms relay for packets frame after the transmission.Therefore, such as
Both fruit R1 and R4 2ms after the transmission of source node receive the packet frames transmitted by source node, then R1 can be relayed immediately
Packet frames, and R4 will be inserted into 3ms delay before relay for packets frame.It will be appreciated that priority value is opposite, and special
Reversed order can be made by determining embodiment, so that lower priority relay node compares priority node and quickly transmits grouping
Frame.
Priority can be associated with packet frames chain.Packet frames in chain with higher priority value can be with
It is quickly transmitted than the packet frames in the chain with lower priority value by relay node.Packet frames chain priority can
To be specified via source node, relay node, controller etc. by any technology applicatory.As illustrated examples, such as scheme
Shown in 5a, source node can transmit packet frames 500.Packet frames 500 may include the report of the chain priority 514 including 3
Head point 510.As another example, packet frames chain P1 and P2 can be respectively provided with priority 2 and 4.Therefore, if one
Or multiple relay nodes receive both P1 and P2 simultaneously, then one or more relay nodes can be corresponding with P2 point in relaying
Corresponding packet frames corresponding with P1 are relayed before framing.As an alternative, 2 priority value can correspond to the delay of 2ms simultaneously
And 4 priority value can correspond to the delay of 4ms.Therefore, the relay node R1 for receiving P1 can make to relay corresponding
It grouping frame delay 2ms and receives the relay node R2 of P2 and can make to relay corresponding grouping frame delay 4ms.It will be appreciated that
, priority value is opposite, and particular implementation can make reversed order, so that lower priority relay node ratio
Higher priority node quickly transmits packet frames.
Priority can be associated with the confirmation received acknowledgement frame of packet frames.It can be according to preferential with packet frames chain
The similar mode of grade realizes acknowledgement frame chain priority.For example, arrangement can have point of 2 priority according to arrangement processing
The same way processing of framing chain has the acknowledgement frame chain of 2 priority.According to the embodiment party of disclosed theme
Formula, higher priority can be with acknowledgement frame rather than packet frames are associated.Notably, as disclosed herein, first
Relay node can receive packet frames, and before relaying the packet frames, destination node also can receive the packet frames.Cause
This, when packet frames are received by destination node, the first relay node may be unnecessary to the transmission of packet frames.
Here, the acknowledgement frame with higher priority can be transmitted before first node relay for packets frame by destination node and by the
One node receives.Therefore, first node can cancel the obligation of its relay for packets frame, to effectively reduce network load.
For purposes of illustration, the description of front is described referring to particular implementation.However, property described above is begged for
By being not intended to be exhaustive or be intended to for the embodiment of disclosed theme being limited to disclosed precise forms.In view of above-mentioned
Introduction, many modifications and variations are possible.Embodiment is selected and is described, to explain the embodiment party of disclosed theme
