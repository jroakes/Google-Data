- servers may log a myriad of interactions within an information resource (e.g., webpage) by visiting client devices, as an event handler for a respective content element on the information resource is triggered.
- the multitude of recorded interactions may be used to measure the performance statistics of the information resource itself and the various content elements therein.
- One challenge in making use of these performance statistics is in processing and presenting them within a single viewable frame of a graphical interface together with the information resource as opposed to multiple frames and different interfaces, thereby allowing a user of the graphical interface to easily digest such statistics.
- a computing device may calculate interaction statistics from the logged interactions and generate a graph or map including the interaction statistics depicting how various client devices interact with one content element on the information resource before interacting with another content element on the same information resource.
- a computing device can retrieve the logged interaction data for a given information resource from a database.
- Each entry of the logged interaction data may include an interaction, a client device identifier, a time duration, and a content element identifier.
- the computing device can calculate the number of interactions for each content element on the information resource and the average time duration across all the client devices for each content element.
- the computing device can then select the top-n content elements with the highest number of interactions.
- the computing device can determine the flow or sequence of client devices from each content element to another. For example, some client devices may have hover over an image on the webpage before clicking on a textbox, while other client devices may have clicked on the textbox and then hovered over the image.
- the computing device can calculate various interaction statistics.
- the calculated interaction statistics can include, for example, a number of clicks, a click-through rate, a number of hover-overs, a number of impressions, et cetera in relation to the flow or sequence of client devices interacting one content element prior to interacting with another.
- the computing device can generate a graph (e.g., directed) including nodes and edges. Each node may represent a content element on the information resource. Each edge of the graph may represent a flow or sequence of client devices interacting with one content element prior to interacting with another content element on the information resource.
- the nodes or the edges of the graph may have different visual properties based on the interaction statistics. For example, edges corresponding to higher interaction statistics may be bolded relative to edges associated with lower interaction statistics.
- the computing device may apply any number of path finding algorithms to generate the graph with content elements, flow or sequence of interactions, and the interaction statistics as parameters.
- an application e.g., web browser
- the computing device can store the graph and transmit a file containing instructions for rendering the graph to another computing device, responsive to a request for the graph.
- Generating and displaying the graph as an overlay concurrently with or over the information resource in this prescribed manner may allow the computing device to present such interaction statistical data without interfering the behavior of the content elements or the information resource.
- HAI human-computer interaction
- the graph allows users of the graphical interface of the application to simultaneously view the interaction statistics along with the contents of the information resource.

The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the described concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation.
- In a computer networked environment, servers may log a myriad of interactions within an information resource (e.g., webpage) by visiting client devices, as an event handler for a respective content element on the information resource is triggered. The multitude of recorded interactions may be used to measure the performance statistics of the information resource itself and the various content elements therein. One challenge in making use of these performance statistics, however, is in processing and presenting them within a single viewable frame of a graphical interface together with the information resource as opposed to multiple frames and different interfaces, thereby allowing a user of the graphical interface to easily digest such statistics.
- To address these and other challenges, the present disclosure is generally directed to systems and methods of rendering webpage interaction statistics data over graphical user interfaces. In brief overview, a computing device may calculate interaction statistics from the logged interactions and generate a graph or map including the interaction statistics depicting how various client devices interact with one content element on the information resource before interacting with another content element on the same information resource.
- In one implementation, a computing device can retrieve the logged interaction data for a given information resource from a database. Each entry of the logged interaction data may include an interaction, a client device identifier, a time duration, and a content element identifier. Using the logged interaction data, the computing device can calculate the number of interactions for each content element on the information resource and the average time duration across all the client devices for each content element. The computing device can then select the top-n content elements with the highest number of interactions. The computing device can determine the flow or sequence of client devices from each content element to another. For example, some client devices may have hover over an image on the webpage before clicking on a textbox, while other client devices may have clicked on the textbox and then hovered over the image.
- Using the logged interaction data for the top-n content elements with the highest number of interactions, the computing device can calculate various interaction statistics. The calculated interaction statistics can include, for example, a number of clicks, a click-through rate, a number of hover-overs, a number of impressions, et cetera in relation to the flow or sequence of client devices interacting one content element prior to interacting with another. To depict the interaction statistics in context of the various content elements of the information resource, the computing device can generate a graph (e.g., directed) including nodes and edges. Each node may represent a content element on the information resource. Each edge of the graph may represent a flow or sequence of client devices interacting with one content element prior to interacting with another content element on the information resource. The nodes or the edges of the graph may have different visual properties based on the interaction statistics. For example, edges corresponding to higher interaction statistics may be bolded relative to edges associated with lower interaction statistics. The computing device may apply any number of path finding algorithms to generate the graph with content elements, flow or sequence of interactions, and the interaction statistics as parameters.
- Once processed and generated, an application (e.g., web browser) of the computing device can display the graph as an overlay concurrently with or over the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can store the graph and transmit a file containing instructions for rendering the graph to another computing device, responsive to a request for the graph. Generating and displaying the graph as an overlay concurrently with or over the information resource in this prescribed manner may allow the computing device to present such interaction statistical data without interfering the behavior of the content elements or the information resource. In addition, from a human-computer interaction (HCI) perspective, the graph allows users of the graphical interface of the application to simultaneously view the interaction statistics along with the contents of the information resource.

The content element may be, for example, a document object model (DOM) object of the webpage, such as a textbox, inline frame, video, image, and body text, among others. The request for content can include an identifier for the information resource or the content element. For example, the request for content can include Uniform Resource Locator (URL) referring to a specific resource such as a webpage (e.g., “https://www.example.com/ homepage.html”). The host name of the URL for the information resource may differ from the host name of the URL for the content element. For example, the URL for the information resource can be “https://www.example_10.com/index.html” but the URL for the content element can be “https://www.example_23.com/content_obj_271828.html.” - The
content delivery module 130 can transmit the information resource or the content element of the information resource to theclient device 125A-N. Thecontent delivery module 130 can identify the address or identifier for the information resource and the content element included in the request for content. Thecontent delivery module 130 can retrieve, select, or otherwise access the information resource or the content element identified by the address or identifier. Upon retrieving the information resource or the content element identifier in the request from theclient device 125A-Ncontent delivery module 130 can transmit the information resource or the content element identified by the address or identifier to theclient device 125A-N. - In some implementations, the
content delivery module 130 can receive the content element from an ad auction system that can select the content element for display based on an ad auction. The ad auction system can select an ad from a plurality of ads based on ad auction parameters, such as bid values, size of ad, click-through rate (CTR), cost per mille (CPM), and impression rate, among others. The ad auction system can select the ad from the plurality of ads further based on size specifications of the respective ad and ad performance from previous presentation of the respective ad. - The
interaction recorder module 132 can accumulate interactions by theclient devices 125A-N on the information resource or the content elements of the information resource. In some implementations, theinteraction recorder module 132 can receive a ping or interaction indicator indicating interaction on the information resource or the content element of the information resource. The information resource or the content element transmitted to theclient device 125A-N can include a pingback script. Once loaded onto theclient device 125A-N, the pingback script can transmit a ping or an interaction identifier indicating interaction by theclient device 125A-N on the respective content element. The ping or the interaction indicator can include an information resource identifier, a content element identifier, an interaction type, a client device identifier, timestamp, and other metadata. The content element identifier can correspond to the content element upon which theclient device 125A-N detected an event on. The interaction type can identify which event was detected by theclient device 125A-N from an input-output device such as a mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen among others. The detected event may include, for example, click, touch, hover over, hover out, key press, mouse wheel, and scrolling, among others.

In some implementations, theinteraction recorder module 132 can process the fields of the ping or the interaction indicator prior to recording the fields onto theinteraction log 140 of the database. In some implementations, theinteraction recorder module 132 can generate an entry using a subset of the fields in the ping or the interaction indicator. For example, theinteraction recorder module 132 can record the information resource identifier, the content element identifier, and timestamp, while not saving the client device identifier and the interaction type. In some implementations, theinteraction recorder module 132 can identify a range of times corresponding to the time stamp and then record the corresponding range of time for the entry in theinteraction log 140. - In some implementations, the
interaction recorder module 132 can maintain theinteraction log 140 by one or more client device segments. In some implementations, theinteraction recorder module 132 can save, update, or otherwise write the ping or the indication indicator onto theinteraction log 140 of thedatabase 138 arranged by the one or more client device segments. The one or more client device segments may be based on the location identifier, device type identifier, and the account identifier included in the metadata of the ping or the interaction indicator. In some implementations, theinteraction recorder module 132 can save, update, or otherwise write the ping or the indicator into separate data structures in theinteraction log 140 of thedatabase 138. For example, if theinteraction recorder module 132 receives one ping with the device type identifier “mobile phone” and another ping with the device type identifier “laptop,” theinteraction recorder module 132 can append one entry for the ping with the device type identifier “mobile phone” onto a data structure for mobile phones on theinteraction log 140 and append another entry for the ping with the device type identifier “laptop” onto a separate, corresponding data structure for laptops on theinteraction log 140 of thedatabase 138. - The
interaction statistics module 134 can calculate one or more interaction statistics for each of the content elements of the information resource based on the entries in theinteraction log 140 of thedatabase 138. The one or more interaction statistics can include a number of interactions with one content element prior to or subsequent to other content elements of the information resource. In some implementations, the one or more interaction statistics may be measured as percentages ofclient devices 125A-N that interact with one content element prior to or subsequent to other content elements of the information resource. For example, for content element “A,” 66% of the client devices may subsequently interact with content element “B,” while the remaining 34% of the client devices may subsequently interact with content element “C.” In some implementations, the one or more interaction statistics may be measured normalized over all theclient devices 125A-N that interact the information resource. - In some implementation, the
interaction statistics module 134 can identify sequence of interactions by the one ormore client devices 125A-N among the content elements of the information resource based on the content element identifier and the timestamp of theinteraction log 140. For example, theinteraction statistics module 134 can access the entries of theinteraction log 140 and identify which content elements are recorded prior to or subsequent to interactions with other content elements. The one or more interaction statistics can include time duration of interaction for each content element of the information resource. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can measure, determine, calculate, or otherwise identify time difference between each interaction among the content elements of the information resource. For example, theinteraction statistics module 134 can access the entries of theinteraction log 140, identify timestamp of temporally prior or subsequent interaction, and subtract the two time stamps to identify the time durations. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can calculate the one or more metrics over a specified time period. For example, theinteraction statistics module 134 can identify the sequence of interactions by the one ormore client devices 125A-N among the content elements and the time durations of the interactions within the specified time period. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can store, save, or otherwise write onto thedatabase 138 to record the one or more calculated interaction statistics. - In some implementations, the
interaction statistics module 134 can receive a request for interaction statistics from any of the content provider devices 115A-N, the content publisher devices 120A-N, theclient devices 125A-N, and thecontent administrator device 145. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can calculate the one or more interaction statistics, responsive to receiving the request for interaction statistics. The request for interaction statistics can include an information resource identifier or content element identifier. In some implementations, the request for interaction statistics can further include a specified time period. In some implementations, the request for interaction statistics can include a client device segment identifier. The client device segment identifier can correspond to a subset of the one ormore client devices 125A-N. The client device segment identifier may be, for example, any alphanumeric identifier used to uniquely identify a subset of theclient devices 125A-N. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can retrieve or access thedatabase 138 for the one or more calculated interaction statistics. In some implementations, the one or more calculated interaction statistics retrieved may be over the specified time period. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can calculate the one or more interaction statistics for the content items of the information resource identified in the request for interaction statistics. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can calculate the one or more interaction statistics for the one or more content items identified in the request for interaction statistics. For example, the request for the interaction statistics may identify a subset of the content elements of the information resource. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can retrieve or access the one or more interaction statistics for the subset of client devices identifier in the client device segment identifier. - The
interaction statistics module 134 can maintain a timer to determine whether time elapsed since receiving the request for interaction statistics is greater than or equal to a predefined time threshold. The timer can include an application, service, server, daemon, routine, or other executable logic for maintaining time. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can determine whether the time elapsed since transmitting the one or more interaction statistics is greater than or equal to the predefined time threshold. Theinteraction statistics module 134 can transmit the one or more interaction statistics to the content provider devices 115A-N, the content publisher devices 120A-N, theclient devices 125A-N, and thecontent administrator device 145 associated with the request for interaction statistics, responsive to determining that the time elapsed is greater than or equal to the predefined time threshold. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can determine whether the time elapsed since transmitting the one or more interaction statistics is greater than or equal to the predefined time threshold. - The
interaction statistics module 134 can maintain a comparator to determine whether the one or more interaction statistics have changed by at least a predefined statistic threshold. The comparator can include an application, service, server, daemon, routine, or other executable logic for comparing the one or more interaction statistics. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can determine whether the one or more interaction statistics have changed by at least a predefined statistic threshold, responsive to determining that the time elapsed since the request for interaction statistics or since transmitting the one or more interaction statistics is less than the predefined time threshold. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can retrieve the entries of theinteraction log 140 of thedatabase 138 for the information resource or the content element identified in the request for interaction statistics. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can determine whether the one or more interaction statistics have changed by at least a predefined statistic threshold per client device segment. - In some implementations, the
interaction statistics module 134 can compare a length of the currently retrieved entries to a length of the previously retrieved entries of theinteraction log 140 of thedatabase 138. If the length of the currently retrieved entries is greater than the length of the previously retrieved entries by at least a predefined statistic threshold length, theinteraction statistics module 134 can recalculate the one or more interaction statistics based on the currently retrieved entries. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can transmit the recalculated one or more interaction statistics to the content provider devices 115A-N, the content publisher devices 120A-N, theclient devices 125A-N, and thecontent administrator device 145 associated with the request for interaction statistics. For example, the number of entries in theinteraction log 140 for a specific inline frame on the information resource may be 12,503 when the original request for the interaction statistics was received but may then be 15,012 at some time later, and the predefined statistic threshold length may be 2,500. In this example, theinteraction statistics module 134 can calculate the difference in the lengths of the entries in theinteraction log 140 for the inline frame and determine that the difference is greater than the predefined statistic threshold length. Continuing the example, theinteraction statistics module 134 can then recalculate the interaction statistics for the inline frame and transmit the recalculated interaction statistics to the computing device that made the original request for interaction statistics. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can compare the length of the currently retrieved entries to the length of the previously retrieved entries per client device segment. - In some implementations, the
interaction statistics module 134 can calculate the one or more interaction statistics from the currently retrieved entries of theinteraction log 140. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can compare the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries of theinteraction log 140 to the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the previously retrieved entries of theinteraction log 140 by at least a predefined statistic threshold. In some implementations, the predefined statistic threshold may differ from interaction type. For example, the predefined statistic threshold may be 0.01 for click rates but 0.2 for hover over rates. In some implementations, if any of the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries of theinteraction log 140 is different from the corresponding one or more interaction statistics calculated from the previously retrieved entries of theinteraction log 140 by the predefined statistic threshold, theinteraction statistics module 134 can transmit the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries to the content provider devices 115A-N, the content publisher devices 120A-N, theclient devices 125A-N, and thecontent administrator device 145 associated with the request for interaction statistics. For example, if the key press rate for a specified text box on an information resource has changed by 0.34 and the predefined statistic thresholds for key press rates for text boxes is 0.2, theinteraction statistics module 134 can transmit the key press rate to the original computing device that sent the request for interaction statistics for the text box. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can calculate the one or more interaction statistics from the currently retrieved entries of the interaction log 140 per client device segment. - In some implementations, the
interaction statistics module 134 can determine the number of the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries different from the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the previously retrieved entries by the predefined statistic threshold. If the number of the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries different from the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the previously retrieved entries by the predefined statistic threshold, theinteraction statistics module 134 can transmit the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries to the content provider devices 115A-N, the content publisher devices 120A-N, theclient devices 125A-N, and thecontent administrator device 145 associated with the request for interaction statistics. In some implementations, theinteraction statistics module 134 can determine the number of the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries different from the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the previously retrieved entries from theinteraction log 140 by the predefined statistic threshold per client device segment. - The
script provider module 136 can receive the request for interaction statistics from any of the content provider devices 115A-N, the content publisher devices 120A-N, theclient devices 125A-N, and thecontent administrator device 145. The request for interaction statistics can include an information resource identifier or content element identifier. Thescript provider module 136 can retrieve the information resource and the content element identified in the request from any of the content provider devices 115A-N and the content publisher devices 120A-N, responsive to receiving the request. For example, if the request included the URL “www.example_431.com/index.html” corresponding to an inline frame content element on an information resource, thescript provider module 136 can retrieve the content element from the any of the content provider devices 115A-N or the content publisher devices 120A-N corresponding to the URL. - The
script provider module 136 can retrieve, access, or receive the one or more interaction statistics calculated by theinteraction statistics module 134 corresponding to the information resource identifier or the content element identifier. In some implementations, thescript provider module 136 can transmit a request to theinteraction statistics module 134 or thedatabase 138 for the one or more interaction statistics corresponding to the information resource identifier or the content element identifier. In some implementations, thescript provider module 136 can subsequently receive the one or more interaction statistics from theinteraction statistics module 134 or thedatabase 138. Thescript provider module 136 can insert, embed, append, or otherwise add an interaction statistics visualization script into the information resource or the content element. - The interaction statistics visualization script can include one or more modules and the one or more interaction statistics calculated by the
interaction statistics module 134. The interaction statistics visualization script can include computer-executable instructions. The computer-executable instructions can include a script, such as HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript™, among others. The computer-executable instructions can be executed by an application of any of the content provider devices 115A-N, the content publisher devices 120A-N, theclient devices 125A-N, and thecontent administrator device 145. The application may have caused thecontent administrator device 145 to transmit the request for interaction statistics received by thescript provider module 136. The application can include, for example, an Internet browser, mobile application, or any other computer program capable of reading and executing the computer-executable instructions. In brief overview, the computer-executable instructions of the interaction statistics visualization script, when executed by one or more processors of any of the content provider devices 115A-N, the content publisher devices 120A-N, theclient devices 125A-N, can cause an application running on one or more processors to include a graph element onto the information resource or the content element based on the calculated one or more interaction statistics for the corresponding information resource or the content element.

For example, thecontent administrator device 145 that transmitted the request for interaction statistics may already have the information resource and transmitted the interaction statistics visualization script. In some implementations, thescript provider module 136 can transmit the interaction statistics visualization script to one of the content provider devices 115A-N or the content publisher devices 120A-N associated with the request for interaction statistics. Receipt of the interaction statistics visualization script can cause the respective content provider device 115A-N or the content publisher device 120A-N to insert the interaction statistics visualization script into the information resource or the content element and transmit the information resource or the content element with the interaction statistics visualization script to any one of theclient devices 125A-N or thecontent administrator device 145.

The one ormore processors 202, the network interface 204, the input-output interface 206, and thememory 208 may be hardware components in the computing device those detailed below in conjunction withFIG. 5 . The network interface 204 may be configured to interface with thenetwork 105 described inFIG. 1 . The input-output interface 206 may include a mouse, a keyboard, a touchscreen, and or microphone, among others. Theapplication 210 can include, for example, an Internet browser, mobile application, or any other computer program capable of executing or otherwise invoking computer-executable instructions processed by theclient device 125A-N or thecontent administrator device 145, such as theinformation resource 216, one or more content elements, aresource request module 212, arendering engine 214, and the interactionstatistics visualization script 220. The interactionstatistics visualization script 220 can be received from thedata processing system 110 or any interaction log system, and can include anmetric calculator module 222, agraph generator module 224, acounter 226, acomparator 228, and atimer 230 and aninteraction statistics storage 232 with one ormore interaction statistics 234A-N. Theapplication 210 and the components, scripts, and modules therein may include any form of executable logic or instructions on memory or in a non-transitory computer-readable medium executed, run, or otherwise processed by theprocessor 202. Theprocessor 202 in turn may interface with thenetwork interface 202 and the input-output interface 206 in accordance with the executable logic or instructions of theapplication 210 and the components, scripts, and modules therein. - The
resource request module 212 can transmit, via the network interface 204 of thecontent administrator device 145, a request for interaction statics to thedata processing system 110. The request for interaction statistics can identify aninformation resource 216 or acontent element 218A-N on theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, the request for interaction statistics can include an information resource identifier or content element identifier. The information resource identifier can correspond to theinformation resource 216. The information resource identifier can include, for example, a resource address (e.g., Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) or any alphanumerical identifier. The content element identifier can correspond to any of the one ormore content elements 218A-N. The content element identifier can include, for example, a resource address (e.g., URL) or any alphanumerical identifier. In some implementations, the request for interaction statistics can further include a specified time threshold for the interaction statistics. The specified time threshold may indicate a range of times forinteraction statistics 234A-N. In some implementations, theresource request module 212 can transmit multiple requests for interaction statistics to thedata processing system 110 at periodic time intervals. - The
resource request module 212 can subsequently receive, via the network interface 204, from thedata processing system 110, theinformation resource 216 or thecontent element 218A-N. Theinformation resource 216 can include one ormore content elements 218A-N and the interactionstatistics visualization script 220, including the one ormore interaction statistics 234A-N. Each of the one ormore content elements 218A-N can correspond to a node of a document object model (DOM) tree and a cascading style sheets (CSS) style generated by the application 210 (e.g., a resource parser module). In some implementations, thecontent element 218A-N can include the interactionstatistics visualization script 220. Each of the one ormore content elements 218A-N can correspond to a content element identifier. In some implementations, a subset of the one ormore content elements 218A-N can be actionable, while another subset of the one ormore content elements 218A-N may be non-actionable. For example, a body text content element on theinformation resource 216 may not have any instructions executed responsive to an event (e.g., click, key press, etc.) and may thus be considered non-actionable. - Each of the one or
more interaction statistics 234A-N can correspond to a respective content element of the one ormore content elements 218A-N. The one ormore interaction statistics 234A-N can include a number of interactions by theclient devices 125A-N with therespective content item 218A-N prior or subsequent to interacting withother content elements 218A-N of theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, the one ormore interaction statistics 234A-N can include time duration for interacting with therespective content element 218A-N by theclient devices 125A-N. In some implementations, the one ormore interaction statistics 234A-N can correspond to at least one client device segment corresponding to a subset of the one ormore client devices 125A-N.

resource request module 212 can receive theinformation resource 216, the one ormore content elements 218A-N, the interactionstatistics visualization script 220, and the one ormore interaction statistics 234A-N repeatedly. For example, theapplication 210 may have loaded and may still display theinformation resource 216 on the display of thecontent administrator device 145. Subsequently, theresource request module 212 can receive, from thedata processing system 110, a second or updated version of the interactionstatistics visualization script 220 and the one ormore interaction statistics 234A-N. In some implementations, theresource request module 212 can, at a first time, receive theinformation resource 216 or thecontent element 218A-N. In some implementations, theresource request module 212 can, at a second time subsequent to the first time, receive the second version or updated version of theinformation resource 216, thecontent elements 218A-N, the interactionstatistics visualization script 220, or theinteraction statistics 234A-N. In some implementations, theresource request module 212 can access thetimer 230 to retrieve time.

In some implementations,non-actionable content elements 218A-N can also include thosecontent elements 218A-N that do not specify any further instructions or executable logic upon triggering of event listeners for therespective content element 218A-N. For example, a bodytext content element 218A on theinformation resource 216 may include code specifying no further actions are to be taken upon the triggering of an “onClick” event listener. In some implementations, themetric calculator module 222 can determine which of the one ormore content elements 218A-N are non-actionable based on a corresponding element type of thecontent element 218A-N. - The

metric calculator module 222 can calculate a total number of interactions by the one ormore client devices 125A-N over all of thecontent elements 218A-N of theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, the total number of interactions may be a sum of the number of interactions for eachcontent element 218A-N. In some implementations, the total number of interactions may be a sum of the number of interactions over a subset of thecontent elements 218A-N. For example, the sum of the number of interactions may be over the subset ofcontent elements 218A-N that may be actionable. In some implementations, themetric calculator module 222 can calculate a conditional probability for eachcontent element 218A-N based on the number of interactions for therespective content element 218A-N and the total number of interactions over all of thecontent elements 218A-N. The conditional probability for a givencontent element 218A-N may be, for example, of the following mathematical form p(it|l t−1 ), where it is the interaction for i-th content item at the t-th sequence andl t−1 is the interaction for content elements excluding the i-th content item at the t−1-th sequence. In some implementations, themetric calculator module 222 can generate or otherwise calculate a conditional probability matrix for eachcontent element 218A-N based on the number of interactions for therespective content element 218A-N and the total number of interactions over all of thecontent elements 218A-N. In some implementations, themetric calculator module 222 can generate the conditional probability matrix using the conditional probability for eachcontent element 218A-N.

In some implementations, themetric calculator module 222 can adjust, modify, or otherwise weigh the conditional probability for eachcontent element 218A-N based on the average time duration for therespective content element 218A-N. For example, themetric calculator module 222 can multiply the conditional probability by the average time duration to generate the interaction sequence metrics. - The
metric calculator module 222 can select a subset of the one ormore content elements 218A-N of theinformation resource 216 based on the calculated interaction sequence metrics for thecontent elements 218A-N. The subset of the one ormore content elements 218A-N may, for example, include two of thecontent elements information resource 216. In some implementations, themetric calculator module 222 can identify the subset of the one ormore content elements 218A-N corresponding to the highest respective subset of interaction sequence metrics using thecomparator 228. Thecomparator 228 can include an application, service, server, daemon, routine, or other executable logic for comparing any set of values including interaction sequence metrics. In some implementations, using thecomparator 228, themetric calculator module 222 can compare the interaction sequence metrics for eachcontent element 218A-N to identify the subset ofcontent elements 218A-N corresponding to the highest respective subset of interaction sequence metrics. For example, themetric calculator module 222 can identifyn content elements 218A-N with the top n interaction sequence metrics. - In some implementations, using the
comparator 228, themetric calculator module 222 can compare the interaction sequence metric of eachcontent elements 218A-N among another to determine whether that the interaction sequence metric differs by at least a predetermined margin. In some implementations, themetric calculator module 222 can select the subset of the one ormore content elements 218A-N, responsive to determining that the respective interaction subsequence statistics for the subset of thecontent elements 218A-N is each greater than other interaction subsequence statistics ofother content elements 218A-N by the predetermined margin. For example, themetric calculator module 222 can determine that a first interaction sequence metric for afirst content element 218A and a second interaction sequence metric for asecond content element 218B is each greater than to a third interaction sequence metric for athird content element 218C by a predetermined margin. Themetric calculator module 222 can select thefirst content element 218A and thesecond content element 218B based on the respective interaction sequence metrics being greater than the third interaction statistic for thethird content element 218C by the predetermined margin. - In some implementations, using the
comparator 228, themetric calculator module 222 can determine which range of the one or more interaction sequence metric ranges the calculated interaction sequence metric is within. The one or more interaction sequence metric ranges can be quantiles (e.g., tertiles, quartiles, deciles, etc.) or uneven predefined ranges. In some implementations, the one or more interaction sequence metric ranges may be defined using variance measures (e.g., 1-sigma, 2-sigma, etc.) of the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics. For example, themetric calculator module 222 can calculate a variance of the calculated interaction sequence metrics. Using the calculated variance, themetric calculator module 222 can compute the standard deviation and set multiples of the standard deviations as the one or more interaction sequence metric ranges. In some implementations, themetric calculator module 222 can determine which range of the one or more interaction sequence metric ranges per client device segment. - In some implementations, the
metric calculator module 222 can calculate which range of the one or more time duration ranges the time durations of interacting with therespective content element 218A-N is within. In some implementations, themetric calculator module 222 can calculate which range of the one or more time duration ranges the calculated average time duration of interactions with therespective content element 218A-N is within. The one or more time duration ranges may be quantiles (e.g., tertiles, quartiles, deciles, etc.) or uneven predefined ranges. In some implementations, the one or more time duration ranges may be defined using variance measures (e.g., 1-sigma, 2-sigma, etc.) of the time durations of interacting with therespective content element 218A-N. In some implementations, themetric calculator module 222 can assign the time duration range for therespective content element 218A-N by dividing the calculated average time duration for therespective content element 218A-N by a predefined quantile. - The
graph generator module 224 can generate a graph element for insertion into theinformation resource 216 using the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics. The graph element may be a DOM tree element (e.g., canvas) instantiated by thegraph generator module 224 and appended to thecontent elements 218A-N of theinformation resource 216. The graph element can include a graph. The graph may include a set of nodes, a set of paths, and a set of loops. The graph may be, for example, acyclic or cyclic, directed or undirected, mixed, or be of any combination and form. The graph may be a data structure (e.g., array, list, linked list, heap, table, tree, matrix, etc.) including the set of nodes, the set of paths, and the set of loops arranged or indexed by the respective content element identifier. Each node of the graph may correspond to acontent element 218A-N. Each path of the graph may be connected from one node to another node, and may indicate the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics for the interactions by the one ormore client devices 125A-N with onecontent element 218A-N prior or subsequent to anothercontent element 218A-N. Each loop of the graph may be a self-referential edge connected from one node to itself, and may correspond to the time durations of interacting with therespective content element 218A-N corresponding to the node. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can generate a plurality of graph elements, each including a set of nodes, a set of paths, and a set of loops, for insertion into theinformation resource 216 using the interaction sequence metrics per client device segment. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can generate the graph element at a predefined time interval. For example, theresource request module 212 may receive the one ormore interaction statistics 234A-N periodically. Each the one ormore interaction statistics 234A-N is received, themetric calculator module 222 can calculate the interaction sequence metrics and thegraph generator module 224 can generate the graph element. - In some implementations, the
graph generator module 224 can generate or create the graph for insertion as the graph element into theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can instantiate a canvas element as the graph element on the DOM tree element generated for theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, for each node corresponding to therespective content element 218A-N, thegraph generator module 224 can modify the canvas element to include a mark. The mark can be of any shape. For example, thegraph generator module 224 can invoke the function “arc( )” to draw a circle or “fillRect( )” to draw a rectangle onto the canvas element. In some implementations, for each path corresponding to the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics for therespective content element 218A-N, thegraph generator module 224 can modify the canvas element to include a line from one node to another. In some implementations, for each loop corresponding to the time durations for interacting with therespective content element 218A-N, thegraph generator module 224 can modify the canvas element to include a line from one node to itself. For example, in drawing the line onto the canvas for the path or the loops, thegraph generator module 224 can invoke the “arcTo( )” “lineTo( )” “quadraticCurveTo( )” or “bezierCurveTo( )” function to draw a line from one node to another or itself. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can instantiate any number of DOM tree elements or invoke any number of functions to generate the graph or the graph element for insertion into theinformation resource 216. - In some implementations, the
graph generator module 224 can insert the graph element into theinformation resource 216 over the one ormore content elements 218A-N. Visually, the graph element may be, for example, transparent so that the set of nodes, the set of paths, and the set of loops appear visible on a layer (e.g., z-level) above with the one ormore content elements 218A-N on theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can identify thecontent element 218A-N corresponding to the respective node based on the respective content element identifier for thecontent element 218A-N. For example, thegraph generator module 224 can access the data structure for the graph, identify the first content element identifier, and determine that thefirst content element 218A corresponds to the first node based on the first content element identifier. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can identify which of the one ormore content elements 218A-N are actionable. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can identify which of the one ormore content elements 218A-N are non-actionable. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can insert the graph element into theinformation resource 216 over the one ormore content elements 218A-N identified as actionable. - In some implementations, the graph generator module 224 can identify a position property of the content element 218A-N. The position property can include the x-y coordinates on the information resource 216 and dimensions of the respective content element 218A-N. In some implementations, the graph generator module 224 can set a position property of the nodes of the graph to the position property of the respective content element 218A-N. In some implementations, the graph generator module 224 can set a position property of each node to overlap or be adjacent to the respective content element 218A-N. For example, if node “A” corresponds to content element 218A, the graph generator module 224 can set the position property of the node within the dimensions of the respective content element 218A-N. In some implementations, the graph generator module 224 can set a start point of the path for the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics for the respective content element 218A-N to the position property of the respective content element 218A-N. In some implementations, the graph generator module 224 can set an end point of the path for the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics for the respective content element 218A-N to the position property of the other content elements 218A-N. For example, if a path corresponds to an interaction sequence metric for interacting with the first content element 218A prior to interacting with the second content element 218B, the graph generator module 224 can set the start point of the path to a coordinate using the position property of the first content element 218A or the corresponding node and set the end point of the path to a coordinate using the position property of the second content element 218B or the corresponding node. In some implementations, the
graph generator module 224 can include or insert a marker at the end point of the path to indicate direction of the one or more interaction sequence metrics. For example, the graph generator module may modify the canvas element for the graph element to insert an arrow head at the end point. - In some implementations, the
graph generator module 224 can set a visual property of each path of the graph of the graph element based on the respective one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics. The visual property may include, for example, color, width, dashes, size, among others. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can set the visual property of each path of the graph element based on the identifier respective interaction sequence metric range. For example, if the interaction sequence metric for a specific path may be 0.9, thegraph generator module 224 may set the line for the path to be bolder than if the interaction sequence metric were 0.25. In some implementations, using thecomparator 228, thegraph generator module 224 can compare the one or more interaction sequence metrics among the one ormore content elements 218A-N to one another interaction sequence metric. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can determine that the one or more interaction sequence metrics is greater than other interaction sequence statics by at least a predetermined margin. In some implementations, using thecomparator 228, thegraph generator module 224 can set the visual property of the respective path different from the visual property of the other respective path, responsive to determining that the respective interaction sequence metric is greater than the other respective interaction sequence metric by at least the predetermined margin. - In some implementations, the
graph generator module 224 can generate a set of loops for each node based on the time duration of interactions with therespective content element 218A-N. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can generate the set of loops based on the time duration range for the time durations of interactions with therespective content element 218A-N. For example, the one or more time duration ranges may be n buckets. In this example, thegraph generator module 224 can identify the number of loops to generate based on the bucket the time duration for interactions with therespective content element 218A-N is within. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can set a start point and end point of each loop for therespective content element 218A-N based on the position property of therespective content element 218A-N. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can set the start point of a loop based on the end point of another loop on the node. - In some implementations, the
graph generator module 224 can insert the graph element as an overlay interface element on theinformation resource 216. The overlay interface element can include the graph including the set of nodes, the set of paths, and the set of loops. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can generate the overlay interface element based on position properties of eachcontent element 218A-N of theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can identify a size of theinformation resource 216 or a viewport of theapplication 210. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can set the overlay interface element to a size smaller than the size of theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can set the overlay interface element to the size smaller than the viewport of theapplication 210 on a display of thecontent administrator device 145. - In some implementations, the
graph generator module 224 can calculate or identify a coordinate for each node proportional on the overlay interface element as to the position property of therespective content element 218A-N on theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can calculate an offset coordinate value based on a position property of the overlay interface element on theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can adjust or modify the coordinate for each node by the calculated offset For example, if the overlay interface element is set to 25% the size of theinformation resource 216, thegraph generator module 224 can set the coordinate of the node corresponding to arespective content element 218A-N to 25% of the position property of therespective content element 218A-N, plus any offset to account for position of the overlay interface element on theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can set the start point and the end point of each path and each loop based the size of the overlay interface element and the adjusted coordinate for each node. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can identify the adjusted coordinate for each node. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can set the start point of a path to the coordinate of the corresponding node for the interaction sequence metric. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can set the end point of the path to a coordinate of another corresponding for the interaction sequence metric. In some implementations, thegraph generator module 224 can set the start point and the send point of a loop based on the coordinate of the corresponding node for the interaction sequence metric for therespective content element 218A-N. - The
rendering engine 214 can render and display theinformation resource 216 including the one ormore content elements 218A-N and the graph element. In some implementations, therendering engine 214 can display the graph element as the overlay interface element on theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, therendering engine 214 can display the graph element as the transparent overlay over the one ormore content elements 218A-N of theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, therendering engine 214 can display the marks over the one ormore content elements 218A-N on theinformation resource 216. In some implementations, therendering engine 214 can dynamically update the rendering and displaying of the graph element. For example, if themetric calculator module 222 or thegraph generator module 224 reprocess the updatedinteraction statistics 234A-N received from thedata processing system 110, therendering engine 214 can re-render and display the updated graph element. - The functionalities of the

In this way, the interactionstatistics visualization script 220 may maintain the other, pre-specified run-time functionalities of theinformation resource 216 displayed via theapplication 210 on a computing device (e.g., the content administrator device 145). At the same time, the interactionstatistics visualization script 220 may dynamically visualize and display theinteraction statistics 234A-N such as the number of interactions and time duration of the interactions by the one ormore client devices 125A-N for each of thecontent elements 218A-N by generating the graph element for insertion into theinformation resource 216. The interactionstatistics visualization script 220 may thus improve the display functionality of the computing device and enhance human-computer interactions (HCI) with theapplication 210 and theinformation resource 216. - Referring to

FIG. 4 is a flow diagram depicting one implementation of rendering webpage interaction statistics data over graphical user interfaces in a computer network environment. The functionality described herein described in themethod 400 can be performed bydata processing system 110, content provide devices 115A-N, content publisher devices 120A-N,client devices 125A-N, and thecontent administrator device 145, or any one or more components or modules of thesystem 100 shown inFIG. 1 or of thesystem 200 inFIG. 2 . - In brief overview, a computing device (e.g., content administrator device 145) can transmit a request for interaction statistics for an information resource (ACT 403). The data processing system (e.g., data processing system 110) can receive the request for interaction statistics for the information resource (ACT 406). The data processing system can accumulate or calculate interaction statistics (ACT 409). The data processing system can transmit the information resource with the interaction visualization script (ACT 412). The computing device can receive the information resource with the interaction visualization script (ACT 415). The computing device can identify the content element for the interaction statistics (ACT 418). The computing device can calculate the time metric for the i-th content element (ACT 421). The computing device can calculate the conditional probabilities for interacting with the i-th content element prior or subsequent to interacting with the other N-1 content elements (ACT 424). The computing device can calculate the interaction sequence metric based on the interaction time duration and the calculated conditional probabilities for the i-th content element (ACT 427). The computing device can determine whether the i-th content element is the last content element on the information resource (ACT 430). If the i-th content element is not the last content element on the information resource, the computing device can identify the next content element (ACT 433). If the i-th content element is the last content element on the information resource, the computing device can select the top M content elements with the highest interaction sequence metrics (ACT 436). The computing device can generate nodes corresponding to selected content elements for a graph element (ACT 439). The computing device can generate edges corresponding to the interaction sequence metrics among the content elements for the graph element (ACT 442). The computing device can determine which range the interaction sequence metric is within (ACT 445). The computing device can set the respective node or the respective edge to a visual style based on the determined range (
ACT 448A-N). The computing device can insert the graph element into the information resource (ACT 451). The computing device can display the information resource (ACT 454). The data processing system can determine whether the time elapsed since the request for interaction statistics is greater than or equal to a predefined time threshold (ACT 457). If the time has elapsed since the request for interaction statistics is less than the predefined time threshold, the data processing system can monitor for changes in interaction statistics (ACT 460). The data processing system can determine whether the change in interaction statistics is greater than or equal to a predefined statistic threshold (ACT 463). If the time has elapsed since the request for interaction statistics is greater than the predefined time threshold or the change in interaction statistics is greater than the predefined statistic threshold, the data processing system can transmit updated interaction statistics (ACT 466). The computing device can receive the updated interaction statistics (ACT 470). The computing device can determine whether the script is executing (ACT 473). If the script is not executing, the computing device can terminate (ACT 476). - A computing device (e.g., content administrator device 145) can transmit a request for interaction statistics for an information resource (ACT 403). The data processing system (e.g., data processing system 110) can receive the request for interaction statistics for the information resource (ACT 406). The request for interaction statistics can include an information resource identifier or content element identifier. The information resource identifier can correspond to an information resource (e.g., webpage) to be displayed on the computing device. The information resource identifier can include, for example, a resource address (e.g., Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) or any alphanumerical identifier. The content element identifier can correspond to any of the one or more content elements on the information resource. The content element identifier can include, for example, a resource address (e.g., URL) or any alphanumerical identifier. In some implementations, the request for interaction statistics can further include a specified time threshold. The one or more interaction statistics can include click-through rate (CTR), hover-over rate, scroll-over rate, impression rate, and key press rate, among others.
- The data processing system can accumulate or calculate interaction statistics (ACT 409). The data processing system can receive a ping or interaction indicator indicating interaction on the information resource or the content element of the information resource from a plurality of client devices. The information resource or the content element transmitted to the client device can include a pingback script. Once loaded onto the client device, the pingback script can transmit a ping or an interaction identifier indicating interaction by the client device on the respective content element. The ping or the interaction indicator can include an information resource identifier, a content element identifier, an interaction type, a client device identifier, timestamp, and other metadata. The content element identifier can correspond to the content element upon which the client device detected an event on. The interaction type can identify which event was detected by the client device from an input-output device such as a mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen among others. The detected event may include, for example, click, touch, hover over, hover out, key press, mouse wheel, and scrolling, among others. The client device can correspond to a unique alphanumerical identifier or a device address (e.g., IP or MAC address) corresponding to the client device. The timestamp can include the time at which the event was detected by the client device. Examples of metadata included in the ping or the interaction indicator may include a location identifier, device type identifier, application identifier, and account identifier, among others.
- Upon receiving the ping or interaction indicator, the data processing system can save, update, or otherwise write onto the interaction log of the database. In some implementations, the data processing system can create or generate an entry including the information resource identifier, the content element identifier, the interaction type, the client device identifier, and the timestamp from the ping or the interaction indicator. In some implementations, the data processing system can process the fields of the ping or the interaction indicator prior to recording the fields onto the interaction log of the database. In some implementations, the data processing system can generate an entry using a subset of the fields in the ping or the interaction indicator. For example, the data processing system can record the information resource identifier, the content element identifier, and timestamp, while not saving the client device identifier and the interaction type . In some implementations, the data processing system can identify a range of times corresponding to the time stamp and then record the corresponding range of time for the entry in the interaction log.
- The data processing system can maintain the interaction log by one or more client device segments. In some implementations, the data processing system can save, update, or otherwise write the ping or the indication indicator onto the interaction log of the database arranged by the one or more client device segments. The one or more client device segments may be based on the location identifier, device type identifier, and the account identifier included in the metadata of the ping or the interaction indicator. In some implementations, the data processing system can save, update, or otherwise write the ping or the indicator into separate data structures in the interaction log of the database. For example, if the data processing system receives one ping with the device type identifier “mobile phone” and another ping with the device type identifier “laptop,” the data processing system can append one entry for the ping with the device type identifier “mobile phone” onto a data structure for mobile phones on the interaction log and append another entry for the ping with the device type identifier “laptop” onto a separate, corresponding data structure for laptops on the interaction log of the database.
- The data processing system can transmit the information resource with the interaction visualization script (ACT 412). The data processing system can transmit the information resource or the content element including the interaction statistics visualization script to the content provider devices, the content publisher devices, the client devices, or the computing device associated with the request for interaction statistics. In some implementations, the data processing system can transmit the interaction statistics visualization script without the information resource or the content element to the content provider devices, the content publisher devices, the client devices, or the computing device. In some implementations, the data processing system can transmit the interaction statistics visualization script to one of the content provider devices or the content publisher devices associated with the request for interaction statistics. Receipt of the interaction statistics visualization script can cause the respective content provider device or the content publisher device to insert the interaction statistics visualization script into the information resource or the content element and transmit the information resource or the content element with the interaction statistics visualization script to any one of the client devices or the computing device. In some implementations, the data processing system can transmit the interaction statistics visualization script or the one or more interaction statistics, responsive to the data processing system determining that the time elapsed since receiving the request for interaction statistics is greater than or equal to the predefined time threshold or determining that the one or more interaction statistics has changed by the predefined statistic threshold.
- In some implementations, the data processing system can retrieve, access, or receive the one or more interaction statistics calculated by the data processing system corresponding to the information resource identifier or the content element identifier. In some implementations, the data processing system can transmit a request to the data processing system or the database for the one or more interaction statistics corresponding to the information resource identifier or the content element identifier. In some implementations, the data processing system can subsequently receive the one or more interaction statistics from the data processing system or the database. The data processing system can insert, embed, append, or otherwise add an interaction statistics visualization script into the information resource or the content element.
- The computing device can receive the information resource with the interaction visualization script (ACT 415). The computing device can subsequently receive, via the network interface, from the data processing system, the information resource or the content element. The information resource can include one or more content elements and the interaction statistics visualization script, including the one or more interaction statistics. Each of the one or more content elements can correspond to a node of a document object model (DOM) tree and a cascading style sheets (CSS) style generated by the application. In some implementations, the content element can include the interaction statistics visualization script. Each of the one or more content elements can correspond to a content element identifier. In some implementations, a subset of the one or more content elements can be actionable, while another subset of the one or more content elements may be non-actionable. For example, a body text content element on the information resource may not have any instructions executed responsive to an event (e.g., click, key press, etc.) and may thus be considered non-actionable.
- Each of the one or more interaction statistics can correspond to a respective content element of the one or more content elements. The one or more interaction statistics can include a number of interactions by the client devices with the respective content item prior or subsequent to interacting with other content elements of the information resource. In some implementations, the one or more interaction statistics can include time duration for interacting with the respective content element by the client devices. In some implementations, the one or more interaction statistics can correspond to at least one client device segment corresponding to a subset of the one or more client devices. In some implementations, the one or more interaction statistics can include a number of interactions by a subset of client devices with one content element prior or subsequent to interacting with other content elements and time duration interacting with content element by the subset of client devices. In some implementations, the number of interactions and the time durations may be stored as a data structure (e.g., array, list, linked list, heap, table, tree, matrix, etc.) arranged or otherwise indexed by content element identifier or client device segment identifier.
- The computing device can receive the information resource, the one or more content elements, the interaction statistics visualization script, the one or more interaction statistics repeatedly. For example, the application may have loaded and may still display the information resource on the display of the content administrator device. Subsequently, the computing device can receive, from the data processing system, a second or updated version of the interaction statistics visualization script and the one or more interaction statistics. In some implementations, the computing device can, at a first time, receive the information resource or the content element. In some implementations, the computing device can, at a second time subsequent to the first time, receive the second version or updated version of the information resource, the content elements, the interaction statistics visualization script, or the interaction statistics. In some implementations, the computing device can access the timer to retrieve time. In some implementations, using the timer, the computing device can transmit a request for interaction statistics, responsive to determining that the time elapsed since the time of receiving the last interaction statistics has elapsed by at least a predefined time threshold. In some implementations, the computing device can receive the updated interaction statistics. In some implementations, the computing device can receive the one or more interaction statistics, responsive to the data processing system determining that the interaction data has changed by at least a predefined statistic threshold between the second time and the first time. In some implementations, the computing device can receive the one or more interaction statistics, responsive to the data processing system determining that a predefined time threshold has lapsed between the first time and the second time.
- The computing device can identify the content element for the interaction statistics (ACT 418). The computing device can determine or identify the one or more content elements for the corresponding one or more interaction statistics based on the corresponding content element identifier. In some implementations, the computing device can search for the one or more content elements for the corresponding one or more interaction statistics based on the corresponding content element identifier. For example, the computing device can access a data structure storing the interaction statistics and the content element identifiers. In this example, using the content element identifier from the data structure, the computing device can search to find the corresponding content element by iterating through the one or more content elements using the counter. In some implementations, the computing device can identify the one or more interaction statistics for each of the one or more content elements based on the corresponding content element identifier.
- The computing device can determine or identify which of the one or more content elements are actionable. Actionable content elements can include those content elements, event listeners of which are enabled. The computing device can determine or identify which of the one or more content elements are non-actionable. Non-actionable content elements can include those content elements, the event listeners of which are disabled. In some implementations, non-actionable content elements can also include those content elements that do not specify any further instructions or executable logic upon triggering of event listeners for the respective content element. In some implementations, the computing device can determine which of the one or more content elements are non-actionable based on a corresponding element type of the content element.
- The computing device can calculate the time metric for the i-th content element (ACT 421). In some implementations, the computing device can an average time duration for each content element based on the time durations of interactions by the one or more client devices for the respective content element. In some implementations, the computing device can calculate a time duration sum for each content element over the time duration of interaction for each client device for the respective content element. In some implementations, the computing device can calculate or identify a number of the one or more client devices. In some implementations, the computing device can calculate the average time duration for each content element based on the time duration sum for the respective content element and the number of the one or more client devices.
- In some implementations, the computing device can calculate which range of the one or more time duration ranges the time durations of interacting with the respective content element is within. In some implementations, the computing device can calculate which range of the one or more time duration ranges the calculated average time duration of interactions with the respective content element is within. The one or more time duration ranges may be quantiles (e.g., tertiles, quartiles, deciles, etc.) or uneven predefined ranges. In some implementations, the one or more time duration ranges may be defined using variance measures (e.g., 1-sigma, 2-sigma, etc.) of the time durations of interacting with the respective content element. In some implementations, the computing device can assign the time duration range for the respective content element by dividing the calculated average time duration for the respective content element by a predefined quantile.
- The computing device can calculate the conditional probabilities for interacting with the i-th content element prior or subsequent to interacting with the other N-1 content elements (ACT 424). In some implementations, the computing device can calculate a total number of interactions by the one or more client devices over all of the content elements of the information resource. In some implementations, the total number of interactions may be a sum of the number of interactions for each content element. In some implementations, the total number of interactions may be a sum of the number of interactions over a subset of the content elements. For example, the sum of the number of interactions may be over the subset of content elements that may be actionable. In some implementations, the computing device can calculate a conditional probability for each content element based on the number of interactions for the respective content element and the total number of interactions over all of the content elements. The conditional probability for a given content element may be, for example, of the following mathematical form p(it|
l t−1), where it is the interaction for i-th content item at the t-th sequence andl t−1 is the interaction for content elements excluding the i-th content item at the t−1-th sequence. In some implementations, the computing device can generate or otherwise calculate a conditional probability matrix for each content element based on the number of interactions for the respective content element and the total number of interactions over all of the content elements. In some implementations, the computing device can generate the conditional probability matrix using the conditional probability for each content element. The conditional probability matrix may be, for example, n-dimensional. Using the conditional probability or the conditional probability matrix, the computing device can calculate the interaction sequence metric for the respective content element. - The computing device can calculate the interaction sequence metric based on the interaction time duration and the calculated conditional probabilities for the i-th content element (ACT 427). The computing device can calculate one or more interaction sequence metrics for interactions by the one or more client devices with each content element prior to interacting with other content elements based on the interaction statistics. The interaction statistics metric may be stored or maintained in a data structure (e.g., array, list, linked list, heap, table, tree, matrix, etc.) arranged, indexed, or otherwise identified by the content element identifier. In some implementations, the computing device can calculate the one or more interaction sequence metrics based on the number of interactions and the time durations for the respective content element. In some implementations, the computing device can calculate the interaction sequence metric at the predefined time interval. In some implementations, the computing device can calculate the interaction sequence metric, responsive to receiving the updated one or more interaction statistics. In some implementations, the computing device can calculate the one or more interaction sequence metrics based on the interaction statistics for each client device segment. In some implementations, the computing device can adjust the conditional probability or the conditional probability matrix.
- In some implementations, the computing device can adjust, modify, or otherwise weigh the conditional probability for each content element based on the average time duration for the respective content element. For example, the computing device can multiply the conditional probability by the average time duration to generate the interaction sequence metrics.
- In some implementations, using the comparator, the computing device can determine which range of the one or more interaction sequence metric ranges the calculated interaction sequence metric is within. The one or more interaction sequence metric ranges can be quantiles (e.g., tertiles, quartiles, deciles, etc.) or uneven predefined ranges. In some implementations, the one or more interaction sequence metric ranges may be defined using variance measures (e.g., 1-sigma, 2-sigma, etc.) of the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics. For example, the computing device can calculate a variance of the calculated interaction sequence metrics. Using the calculated variance, the computing device can compute the standard deviation and set multiples of the standard deviations as the one or more interaction sequence metric ranges. In some implementations, the computing device can determine which range of the one or more interaction sequence metric ranges per client device segment.
- The computing device can determine whether the i-th content element is the last content element on the information resource (ACT 430). In some implementations, the computing device can traverse the content elements of the information resource to calculate the interaction sequence metrics for each content element. In some implementations, upon calculating the interaction sequence metric for the respective content element, using a counter, the computing device can determine whether there are more content elements remaining on the information resource. If the i-th content element is not the last content element on the information resource, the computing device can identify the next content element (ACT 433) and subsequent repeat ACTS 421-430.
- If the i-th content element is the last content element on the information resource, the computing device can select the top M content elements with the highest interaction sequence metrics (ACT 436). The computing device can select a subset of the one or more content elements of the information resource based on the calculated interaction sequence metrics for the content elements. The subset of the one or more content elements may, for example, include two of the content elements on the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can identify the subset of the one or more content elements corresponding to the highest respective subset of interaction sequence metrics using the comparator. In some implementations, using the comparator, the computing device can compare the interaction sequence metrics for each content element to identify the subset of content elements corresponding to the highest respective subset of interaction sequence metrics. For example, the computing device can identify n content elements with the top n interaction sequence metrics.
- In some implementations, using the comparator, the computing device can compare the interaction sequence metric of each content elements among another to determine whether that the interaction sequence metric differs by at least a predetermined margin. In some implementations, the computing device can select the subset of the one or more content elements, responsive to determining that the respective interaction subsequence statistics for the subset of the content elements is each greater than other interaction subsequence statistics of other content elements by the predetermined margin.
- The computing device can generate nodes corresponding to selected content elements for a graph element (ACT 439). In some implementations, the computing device can instantiate a canvas element as the graph element including the graph. The graph may include a set of nodes, a set of paths, and a set of loops. The graph may be, for example, acyclic or cyclic, directed or undirected, mixed, or be of any combination and form. The graph may be a data structure (e.g., array, list, linked list, heap, table, tree, matrix, etc.) including the set of nodes, the set of paths, and the set of loops arranged or indexed by the respective content element identifier. Each node of the graph may correspond to a content element. In some implementations, for each node corresponding to the respective content element, the computing device can modify the canvas element for the graph element to include a mark. The mark can be of any shape with any set visual property. For example, the computing device can invoke the function “arc( )” to draw a circle or “fillRect( )” to draw a rectangle onto the canvas element.
- The computing device can generate edges corresponding to the interaction sequence metrics among the content elements for the graph element (ACT 442). Each path of the graph may be connected from one node to another node, and may indicate the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics for the interactions by the one or more client devices with one content element prior or subsequent to another content element. Each loop of the graph may be a self-referential edge connected from one node to itself, and may correspond to the time durations of interacting with the respective content element corresponding to the node. In some implementations, for each path corresponding to the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics for the respective content element, the computing device can modify the canvas element to include a line from one node to another. In some implementations, for each loop corresponding to the time durations for interacting with the respective content element, the computing device can modify the canvas element to include a line from one node to itself. For example, in drawing the line onto the canvas for the path or the loops, the computing device can invoke the “arcTo( )” “lineTo( )” “quadraticCurveTo( )” or “bezierCurveTo( )” function to draw a line from one node to another or itself.
- The computing device can determine which range the interaction sequence metric is within (ACT 445). The computing device can set the respective node or the respective edge to a visual style based on the determined range (
ACT 448A-N). In some implementations, the computing device can set a visual property of each path of the graph of the graph element based on the respective one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics. The visual property may include, for example, color, width, dashes, and size, among others. In some implementations, the computing device can set the visual property of each path of the graph element based on the identifier respective interaction sequence metric range. In some implementations, using the comparator, the computing device can compare the one or more interaction sequence metrics among the one or more content elements to one another interaction sequence metric. In some implementations, the computing device can determine that the one or more interaction sequence metrics is greater than other interaction sequence statics by at least a predetermined margin. In some implementations, using the comparator, the computing device can set the visual property of the respective path different from the visual property of the other respective path, responsive to determining that the respective interaction sequence metric is greater than the other respective interaction sequence metric by at least the predetermined margin. - The computing device can insert the graph element into the information resource (ACT 451). In some implementations, the computing device can instantiate any number of DOM tree elements or invoke any number of functions to generate the graph or the graph element for insertion into the information resource. The computing device can generate a graph element for insertion into the information resource using the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics. The graph element may be a DOM tree element (e.g., canvas) instantiated by the computing device and appended to the content elements of the information resource. The graph element can include a graph. In some implementations, the computing device can generate a plurality of graph elements, each including a set of nodes, a set of paths, and a set of loops, for insertion into the information resource using the interaction sequence metrics per client device segment.
- In some implementations, the computing device can generate the graph element at a predefined time interval. For example, the computing device may receive the one or more interaction statistics periodically. Each the one or more interaction statistics is received, the computing device can calculate the interaction sequence metrics and the computing device can generate the graph element. In some implementations, the computing device can generate or create the graph for insertion as the graph element into the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can instantiate a canvas element as the graph element on the DOM tree element generated for the information resource.
- In some implementations, the computing device can insert the graph element into the information resource over the one or more content elements. Visually, the graph element may be, for example, transparent so that the set of nodes, the set of paths, and the set of loops appear visible on a layer (e.g., z-level) above with the one or more content elements on the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can identify the content element corresponding to the respective node based on the respective content element identifier for the content element. In some implementations, the computing device can identify which of the one or more content elements are actionable. In some implementations, the computing device can identify which of the one or more content elements are non-actionable. In some implementations, the computing device can insert the graph element into the information resource over the one or more content elements identified as actionable.
- In some implementations, the computing device can identify a position property of the content element. The position property can include the x-y coordinates on the information resource and dimensions of the respective content element. In some implementations, the computing device can set a position property of the nodes of the graph to the position property of the respective content element. In some implementations, the computing device can set a position property of each node to overlap or be adjacent to the respective content element. In some implementations, the computing device can set an end point of the path for the one or more calculated interaction sequence metrics for the respective content element to the position property of the other content elements. In some implementations, the computing device can include or insert a marker at the end point of the path to indicate direction of the one or more interaction sequence metrics. For example, the graph generator module may modify the canvas element for the graph element to insert an arrow head at the end point.
- In some implementations, the computing device can insert the graph element as an overlay interface element on the information resource. The overlay interface element can include the graph including the set of nodes, the set of paths, and the set of loops. In some implementations, the computing device can generate the overlay interface element based on position properties of each content element of the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can identify a size of the information resource or a viewport of the application. In some implementations, the computing device can set the overlay interface element to a size smaller than the size of the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can set the overlay interface element to the size smaller than the viewport of the application on a display of the content administrator device.
- In some implementations, the computing device can calculate or identify a coordinate for each node proportional on the overlay interface element as to the position property of the respective content element on the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can calculate an offset coordinate value based on a position property of the overlay interface element on the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can adjust or modify the coordinate for each node by the calculated offset. For example, if the overlay interface element is set to 25% the size of the information resource, the computing device can set the coordinate of the node corresponding to a respective content element to 25% of the position property of the respective content element, plus any offset to account for position of the overlay interface element on the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can set the start point and the end point of each path and each loop based the size of the overlay interface element and the adjusted coordinate for each node. In some implementations, the computing device can identify the adjusted coordinate for each node. In some implementations, the computing device can set the start point of a path to the coordinate of the corresponding node for the interaction sequence metric. In some implementations, the computing device can set the end point of the path to a coordinate of another corresponding for the interaction sequence metric. In some implementations, the computing device can set the start point and the send point of a loop based on the coordinate of the corresponding node for the interaction sequence metric for the respective content element.
- The computing device can display the information resource (ACT 454). The computing device can render and display the information resource including the one or more content elements and the graph element. In some implementations, the computing device can display the graph element as the overlay interface element on the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can display the graph element as the transparent overlay over the one or more content elements of the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can display the marks over the one or more content elements on the information resource. In some implementations, the computing device can dynamically update the rendering and displaying of the graph element. For example, if the computing device reprocesses the updated interaction statistics received from the data processing system, the computing device can re-render and display the updated graph element.
- The data processing system can determine whether the time elapsed since the request for interaction statistics is greater than or equal to a predefined time threshold (ACT 457). The data processing system can maintain a timer to determine whether time elapsed since receiving the request for interaction statistics is greater than or equal to a predefined time threshold. In some implementations, the data processing system can determine whether the time elapsed since transmitting the one or more interaction statistics is greater than or equal to the predefined time threshold. The data processing system can transmit the one or more interaction statistics to the content provider devices, the content publisher devices, the client devices, and the computing device associated with the request for interaction statistics, responsive to determining that the time elapsed is greater than or equal to the predefined time threshold. In some implementations, the data processing system can determine whether the time elapsed since transmitting the one or more interaction statistics is greater than or equal to the predefined time threshold.
- If the time has elapsed since the request for interaction statistics is less than the predefined time threshold, the data processing system can monitor for changes in interaction statistics (ACT 460). The data processing system can maintain a comparator to determine whether the one or more interaction statistics have changed by at least a predefined statistic threshold. The comparator can include an application, service, server, daemon, routine, or other executable logic for comparing the one or more interaction statistics. In some implementations, the data processing system can determine whether the one or more interaction statistics have changed by at least a predefined statistic threshold, responsive to determining that the time elapsed since the request for interaction statistics or since transmitting the one or more interaction statistics is less than the predefined time threshold. In some implementations, the data processing system can retrieve the entries of the interaction log of the database for the information resource or the content element identified in the request for interaction statistics. In some implementations, the interaction statistics module can determine whether the one or more interaction statistics have changed by at least a predefined statistic threshold per client device segment.
- The data processing system can determine whether the change in interaction statistics is greater than or equal to a predefined statistic threshold (ACT 463). If the change in interaction statistics is less than the predefined statistic threshold, the data processing system can return to
ACT 457. In some implementations, the data processing system can compare a length of the currently retrieved entries to a length of the previously retrieved entries. If the length of the currently retrieved entries is greater than the length of the previously retrieved entries by at least a predefined statistic threshold length, the data processing system can recalculate the one or more interaction statistics based on the currently retrieved entries. In some implementations, the data processing system can transmit the one or more interaction statistics to the computing device associated with the request for interaction statistics. In some implementations, the data processing system can compare the length of the currently retrieved entries to the length of the previously retrieved entries per client device segment. - In some implementations, the data processing system can calculate the one or more interaction statistics from the currently retrieved entries of the interaction log. In some implementations, the data processing system can compare the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries of the interaction log to the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the previously retrieved entries of the interaction log by at least a predefined statistic threshold. In some implementations, the predefined statistic threshold may differ from interaction type. In some implementations, if any of the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries of the interaction log is different from the corresponding one or more interaction statistics calculated from the previously retrieved entries of the interaction log by the predefined statistic threshold, the data processing system can transmit the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries to the content provider devices, the content publisher devices, the client devices, and the computing device associated with the request for interaction statistics. In some implementations, the data processing system can calculate the one or more interaction statistics from the currently retrieved entries of the interaction log per client device segment.
- In some implementations, the data processing system can determine the number of the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries different from the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the previously retrieved entries by the predefined statistic threshold. If the number of the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries different from the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the previously retrieved entries by the predefined statistic threshold, the interaction
statistic module 130 can transmit the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries to the content provider devices, the content publisher devices, the client devices, and the computing device associated with the request for interaction statistics. In some implementations, the data processing system can determine the number of the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the currently retrieved entries different from the one or more interaction statistics calculated from the previously retrieved entries from the interaction log by the predefined statistic threshold per client device segment. - If the time has elapsed since the request for interaction statistics is greater than the predefined time threshold or the change in interaction statistics is greater than the predefined statistic threshold, the data processing system can transmit updated interaction statistics (ACT 466). The computing device can receive the updated interaction statistics (ACT 470). The computing device can determine whether the script is executing (ACT 473). If the script is no longer executing, the computing device can terminate (ACT 476). If the script is still executing, the computing device can return to
ACT 418. -

A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatuses can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
- Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), for example.

Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can include any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system such as
system 500 orsystem 110 can include clients and servers. For example, thedata processing system 110 can include one or more servers in one or more data centers or server farms. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server. - While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of the systems and methods described herein. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.

In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results.
- In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products. For example, the
content delivery module 130,interaction recorder module 132,script provider module 136, and theinteraction statistics module 134 can be part of thedata processing system 110, a single module, a logic device having one or more processing modules, one or more servers, or part of a search engine.
