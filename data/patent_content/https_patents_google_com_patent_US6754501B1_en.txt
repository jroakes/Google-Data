Definitions
- the present invention relates to communications systems and, more particularly, to a method for adaptive control of access to a wireless telecommunication system.
- a subscriber unit or mobile station and a fixed network unit or base station establish a two-way communication link through forward and reverse radio frequency (RF) communication links.
- the forward communication links originate from the base station and the reverse communication links from the mobile station.
- the base station normally communicates simultaneously to a number of mobile stations.
- Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industry Association Standard 95B TIA/EIA/IS-95-B.
- FIG. 1 is a plot of access channel throughput versus offered traffic measured through the number of access attempts per slot time for an exemplary cellular telecommunication system. As shown in FIG. 1, the system throughput steadily increases up to an ideal point at an offered traffic rate of 1.0. Beyond this point, system degradation is evident.
- the media access controller or base station controller broadcasts an access restriction value to the subscriber units on a paging channel in an attempt to keep the system operating on the left side of the throughput curve.
- the access restriction value is used by each subscriber unit to calculate when to initiate another access attempt.
- the media access controller cannot determine on which side of the throughput curve the subscriber unit is functioning. This is partially due to the fact that in conventional cellular telecommunication systems, it is impossible to determine how many attempts a subscriber made before successfully initiating an access. Therefore, the media access controller indiscriminately broadcasts access restriction values based on a static database configuration in order to cut off excess traffic.
- one advantage of the present invention is that it provides a more robust system with better throughput.
- Another advantage of the present invention is the provision of a cellular communications system which accommodates geographic loading differences.
- Yet another advantage of the present invention is that more call attempts will succeed when the system is experiencing a heavy load.
- Still another advantage of the present invention is the provision of a dynamic assignment of access restriction values based on actual load instead of a static database configuration.
- a further advantage of the present invention is that it selectively reduces less important traffic components, better accommodating all classes of subscriber during emergency situations.
- the invention may take form in various components and arrangements of components, and in various steps and arrangements of steps.
- the drawings are only for purposes of illustrating preferred embodiments and are not to be construed as limiting the invention.
- FIG. 1 is a plot of access channel throughput versus offered traffic measured through the number of access attempts per slot time for an exemplary wireless communication system
- FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic illustration of a wireless communication system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a simplified block diagram of an exemplary wireless device that incorporates the features of the present invention therein;
- FIG. 4 is a buffer diagram which illustrates the congestion control method of the present invention.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart which illustrates a method of accessing a base transceiver station in accordance with the present invention.
- a wireless communication system 10 such as a direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) digital radiotelephone system is provided.
- Base transceiver stations (BTSs) 22 , 32 , 42 may communicate with mobile device 24 , operating within coverage area 20 , served by BTS 22 .
- BTSs 22 , 32 , 42 may communicate with a mobile device 34 operating within coverage area 30 , served by BTS 32 .
- BTSs have fixed locations, such locations chosen to provide overlapping coverage areas.
- BTSs 22 , 32 , 42 are coupled to a media access controller, such as a base station controller (BSC) 50 , which includes, among other things, a processor 52 and a memory 54 .
- BSC base station controller
- the BSC 50 is, in turn, coupled to a mobile switching center (MSC) 60 , also including, among other things, a processor 62 and a memory 64 .
- MSC mobile switching center
- the BSC and MSC operate according to well-known methods and are commercially available from Motorola, Inc. While the present invention is being described with respect to a wireless communication system, it is to be appreciated that it is applicable to any system in which a plurality of subscriber units compete for access to a shared media, such as an internet-based and/or ethernet-based system.
- Multiple access wireless communication between BTS's 22 , 32 , 42 and mobile devices 24 , 34 , 44 occurs via radio frequency (RF) channels over which digital communication signals such as voice, data, and video are transmitted.
- RF radio frequency
- Base-to-mobile device communications are said to occur on a forward-link channel 70
- mobile-to-base communications are referred to as being on a reverse-link channel 80 .
- a communication system using CDMA channelization is described in detail in EIA/TIA Standard IS95-B.
- a communication signal 70 is transmitted on an IS-95B forward-link channel, such as a paging channel or traffic channel from a BTS, such as BTS 32 to mobile device 34 .
- a communication signal 80 may be transmitted via an IS-95B reverse-link channel, such as an access channel or a traffic channel, by mobile device 34 to its source BTS 32 .
- other mobile devices may receive and/or transmit communication signals with other base transceiver stations.
- the wireless device 24 , 34 , 44 can be a telephone, a cable telephony interface device, a cellular or PCS radiotelephone, a cordless radiotelephone, a radio, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager, a palm-top computer, a personal computer, etc. Accordingly, as used herein, wireless device refers to each of these devices and their equivalents.
- the device 24 , 34 , 44 includes a transceiver 70 , transceiver antenna 72 , microprocessor-based controller 74 , memory 76 , keypad 78 , transducers 80 (e.g. microphone, speaker), an analog-to-digital converter 82 , and a processor 84 .
- the wireless device 24 , 34 , 44 is adapted to communicate (i.e. transmit and receive communication signals such as data and voice) over a public switched telephone network (PSTN) via a cellular radiotelephone system, such as a CDMA cellular radiotelephone system, global system for mobile communication (GSM) cellular radiotelephone system, etc.
- PSTN public switched telephone network
- GSM global system for mobile communication
- the subscriber unit 100 can be a telephone, a cable telephony interface device, a cellular or PCS radiotelephone, a cordless radiotelephone, a radio, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager, a palm-top computer, etc. Accordingly, as used herein, subscriber unit or wireless device refers to each of these devices and their equivalents.
- the subscriber unit 100 which includes a processor 110 and a controller 112 , periodically transmits an access message 120 on an Access Channel 130 to a base transceiver station (BTS) 140 , which is controlled by a controller 150 .
- Access messages may include unsolicited registrations, data burst messages, mobile originations, and the like. Because of the sporadic nature of cellular traffic, access attempts often fail because there are a greater number of access attempts than available time slots (FIG. 1 ). In the case of a failed access attempt, the subscriber unit 100 keeps a count of failed access attempts over a given period of time.
- This data is stored in a subscriber unit memory 160 , which consists of a failed attempts memory 162 and a time period memory 164 . It is to be appreciated that access attempts consist of probe sequences executed by the subscriber unit 100 before successfully accessing the CDMA cellular system.
- access attempts consist of probe sequences executed by the subscriber unit 100 before successfully accessing the CDMA cellular system.
- CDMA systems allow a mobile subscriber unit up to sixteen probe sequences before aborting its attempt to access.
- the access message 120 from the subscriber unit 100 contains two new data fields, namely, a number of failed attempts data field 122 and a time period data field 124 .
- the subscriber unit 100 calculates a sliding average of failed access attempts per unit time and transmits this field to the BTS 140 .
- the failed attempts data field 122 and the time period data field 124 may be optional within the Access Message, allowing pre-existing subscriber units to co-exist with subscriber units employing the present invention. In other words, the functionality of the present invention is not lost in an environment in which legacy subscriber equipment co-exists with a statistically sufficient population of subscriber equipment employing the present invention.
- the system congestion data 122 , 124 i.e. the failed attempts per unit time, is passed to the access controller 150 for processing. From this data, the controller 150 generates an array of access restriction values. In one embodiment, the controller computes a sliding average of failed access attempts per unit time and uses the sliding average as an index into a lookup table of access restriction values. In another embodiment, the controller calculates an array of access restriction values from the transmitted system congestion data 122 , 124 . In a preferred CDMA system, the access restriction values consist of an array of PSIST or persistence values. As is discussed more fully below, PSIST values are broadcast to and used by the subscriber units within a given coverage area in the calculation of persistence delay values. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that different PSIST values may be transmitted for different mobile overload classes. In other words, different PSIST values are broadcast to be used for different traffic components based on the observed number of access probe sequences before the access channel request is satisfied.
- an Access Parameters Message 170 is broadcast on a Paging Channel 180 to all subscriber units within a given coverage area.
- the Access Parameters Message 170 defines the parameters used by the subscriber units transmitting to the BTS 140 along the Access Channel 180 .
- an access restriction values field 172 Within the Access Parameters Message 170 is an access restriction values field 172 , which contains the array of access restriction values calculated by the controller 150 .
- a subscriber unit 100 transmits an access message 120 to the BTS 140 (step 200 ).
- the subscriber unit 100 records the number of failed access attempts (step 210 ) over a given period of time before successful access to the system.
- the subscriber unit transmits the failed attempt data to the BTS.
- the failed attempt data is transmitted within the access message.
- the failed attempt data is transmitted to the BTS in a separate message.
- the controller 150 receives the failed access attempt data and calculates an array of access restriction values that are broadcast continuously to all subscriber units within the given coverage area. These access restriction values are received (step 230 ) by the subscriber unit. The access restriction values are used by the subscriber unit to perform one or more persistence tests (step 250 ). More particularly, the subscriber unit generates a persistence delay (PD) value (step 245 ) using the access restriction values.
- PD persistence delay
- the subscriber unit receives an array of PSIST values, such as those provided in Table 1, which are used to compute the PD value in a conventional manner.
- the subscriber unit generates a pseudorandom backoff value (step 240 ) in a conventional manner.
- the PD value (step 245 ) and backoff value (step 240 ) are used to perform the persistence test at step 250 . More particularly, the calculated persistence delay value is compared to the backoff value. If the PD value is less that the backoff value, the persistence test (step 250 ) fails. If the persistence test fails, the subscriber unit waits until the next access slot and performs another persistence test. Persistence tests are performed until the test is passed.
- the persistence test passes and the subscriber unit transmits an access message (step 260 ) to the BTS at relatively low power.
- the access restriction values that the subscriber unit receives from the controller controls the probability of the persistence test passing for any given access slot.
