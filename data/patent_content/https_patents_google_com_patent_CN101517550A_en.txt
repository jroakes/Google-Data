Mass medium system 202 generates the environment audio frequency of mass medium broadcasting (for example television audio) when operation, this environment audio frequency is detected by environment audio detection device 204.Environment audio detection device 204 can be any equipment that can the testing environment audio frequency, comprise free-standing microphone and with the integrated microphone of client-side interface 102.Detected environment audio frequency is by client-side interface 102 codings, so that the descriptor of this environment audio frequency of sign to be provided.This descriptor is sent to audio database server 104 via network access equipment 206 and network 108.
In certain embodiments, the audio file (" fragment ") of n second (for example 5 seconds) environment audio frequency is monitored and write down to the client software that moves on client-side interface 102 continuously.According to process shown in Figure 4, this fragment is converted into the m frame (for example 415 frames) of the descriptor (for example 32 bits) of k bits of encoded subsequently.In certain embodiments, monitoring and record are based on incident.For example, monitoring and record can be on a specified date and the fixed time (for example: Monday, late 8:00) start and time of lasting appointment (for example late 8:00 to 9:00) automatically.Alternatively, monitoring and record from opertaing device (for example: remote control etc.) user input (for example: click the mouse function key or Macintosh etc.) and starting also can be in response to.In certain embodiments, utilize the stream of the 32 bit/frame differentiation feature of people's descriptions such as Ke to send variation (streaming variation), come the environment audio frequency is encoded.
In certain embodiments, client software is as " sidebar " or the operation of other user interface element.By this way, when client-side interface 102 started, the environment audio sample can begin immediately and move in " background ", and its result (selectively) is shown in and need not to call a complete WEB browser session in this sidebar.
In certain embodiments, the environment audio sample can start or begin in spectators' service of signing in to or when using (as: Email etc.) at client-side interface 102.
Descriptor is sent to audio database server 104.In certain embodiments, descriptor is the statistical abstract of the compression of environment audio frequency, and is described as people such as Ke.By sending statistical abstract, because this statistical abstract is irreversible, that is, original audio frequency can not recover from this descriptor, therefore can keep the privacy of user voice.Therefore, monitored dialogue with the user who writes down or other people can't be reproduced from this descriptor in broadcast environment.In certain embodiments, can utilize one or more existing encryption technologies (for example: asymmetric or symmetric key encryption, oval encryption or the like) to encrypt descriptor, so that extra privacy and security to be provided.
In certain embodiments, descriptor is submitted (being also referred to as the query specification symbol) to and is sent to audio database server 104 as inquiry, and this inquiry is submitted to and is in response to observation process at client-side interface 102 detected trigger events.For example, trigger event can be the beginning melody (as: the beginning song of " Song Feichuan ") of TV programme or performer's dialogue.In certain embodiments, the query specification symbol can be used as the part of continuous Streaming Media process and is sent to audio database server 104.In certain embodiments, the query specification symbol can be imported (as: by remote control, click or the like) in response to the user and be sent to audio database server 104.
Popular individuation process
Fig. 3 is the process flow diagram of popular individuation process 300.The step of process 300 need not to finish with any specific order, and at least some steps can be performed under multithreading or parallel processing environment at one time.
Process 300 at client-side interface (for example: begin when client-side interface 102) having monitored and having write down the environment audio fragment that mass media broadcasts under the broadcast environment (302).The environment audio fragment of record is encoded as descriptor (as: statistical abstract of compression), and this descriptor can be used as inquiry and be sent to audio database server (304).The database that this audio database server will be inquired about with the reference descriptor that calculates from mass media broadcasting statistic compares, to determine and this inquiry candidate's descriptor of coupling.This candidate's descriptor is sent to social application server or other Internet resources, and this candidate's descriptor of this society's application server or other network resource usage compiles customized information (310) for the user.For example, the play " Song Feichuan " if this user is televiewing, then the query specification symbol that generates from the environment audio frequency of this TV play will be complementary from before " Song Feichuan " reference descriptor that program obtained.Therefore, candidate's descriptor of coupling is used to compile customized information about " Song Feichuan " (for example, News Stories, discussion group points to from the link of organizing social reciprocity colony or chatroom, advertisement or the like).In certain embodiments, utilize hash (hashing) technology (as direct Hash or position sensing hashing (LSH)) to carry out matcher effectively, to obtain the short tabulation of candidate's descriptor, as shown in Figure 4.Handle candidate's descriptor subsequently in verification step, for example people such as Ke is described.
In certain embodiments, directly mate, rather than each inquiry and database with reference to descriptor are mated from different spectators' query specification symbol.Such embodiment can allow to create the reciprocity colony of the society of group certainly about subject events, and the database with reference to descriptor concerning this subject events is unavailable.Such embodiment can mate in real time and is in identical public place (as the stadium, bar etc.) and uses portable electric appts () spectators for example: mobile phone, PDA etc.
Popular audience ratings
In certain embodiments, from current spectators' tabulation of watching broadcasting (as: TV play, advertisement etc.), release in real time and the statistic of compiling.These statistics can be collected in background when spectators use other to use.Statistic can include but not limited to: the average number of 1) watching the spectators of this broadcasting; 2) spectators watch the average time of this broadcasting; 3) other program of watching of spectators; 4) spectators' minimum and maximum number; 5) spectators leave the most normal which program that switches to after the broadcasting; 6) spectators watch the time of broadcasting; 7) spectators change the number of times of platform; 8) which advertisement spectators watch; And 9 enter when broadcasting as spectators, and he comes or the like by the most normal the switching from which program.One or more popular audience ratings can be determined from these statistics.
Can use the counter of each monitored broadcasting channel to generate the statistic that is used to generate popular audience ratings.In certain embodiments, these counters can be divided into population group data or geographical group data.Spectators can utilize popular audience ratings to understand which most popular (as: increasing by announcement audience ratings when 2004 Super Bowl intermissions are performed) in the ongoing broadcast program.Advertisement and content supplier also can utilize popular audience ratings to come in response to audience ratings dynamically to adjust the material of playing.This is especially suitable for advertisement, because short by the time of advertising company's making, the advertisement that version is many can be changed according to spectators' audience ratings level at an easy rate.Other example of statistic includes but not limited to: per capita or by the time television broadcasting with respect to the popular audience ratings of station broadcast, prime time in one day, promptly, the peak is watched/is listened to the period, domestic household number in the given area, surfing channel number during specific program (program category, one day special time), volume of broadcasting or the like.
Customized information is sent to client-side interface (312).Popular audience ratings also can be stored in the database uses (318), for example dynamic adjustment of above-mentioned advertisement for other process.This customized information is received (314) at client-side interface, and formatted and be presented on user interface (316) at this.This customized information can with the comment media of presenting to the user in user interface (for example: the text message in the chatroom) be associated.In certain embodiments, the chatroom can comprise one or more son groups.For example, may comprise the child group that is called " Song Fei expert " about the discussion group of " Song Feichuan ", perhaps child group can with specific crowd, for example the age watches the women of " Song Feichuan " to be associated at 20-30 between year, or the like.
In certain embodiments, the raw information (as Counter Value) that is used to popular audience ratings to generate statistic is collected and storage at client-side interface, rather than at social application server.As long as the user is online and/or call popular personalized application, this raw information just can be transferred into the broadcaster.
In certain embodiments, broadcasting measuring box (BMB) is installed in client-side interface.This BMB is similar to set-top box but the hardware simplicity equipment that is not connected with broadcasting equipment.Need hardware to be installed on TV different with Neilsen audience ratings system, and BMB can be installed near mass medium system place or within the scope of TV signal.In certain embodiments, automatic record audio fragment of BMB and generation are stored in the descriptor in the storer (as flash media).In certain embodiments, BMB comprises one or more hardware button alternatively, and the user can indicate them watching which broadcast program is (similar by pressing the button
Audience ratings).Can collect the descriptor of being stored every now and then by the BMB equipment that audience ratings provider selects, perhaps BMB (for example: phone can connect by network, the Internet is such as the radio in SMS/ carrier wave radio station or the like) descriptor stored to one or more interested parties broadcasting every now and then.
In certain embodiments, can monitor advertisement to judge this advertising effect, this effect can be reported to the advertiser.For example, which advertisement is viewed, is skipped volume of advertisement or the like.
In certain embodiments, image-capturing apparatus (as: digital camera, video recorder or the like) can be used to metering has watching or broadcast listening for how many spectators.For example, various existing image matching algorithms can be applied to image or image sequence, to determine to be in the quantity of the spectators in the broadcast environment during specific broadcasting.The image and/or the data that obtain from this image can be used to combine with audio descriptor, to collect user's customized information, calculate popular audience ratings, or for other purpose.
The audio-frequency fingerprint processing procedure
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram of audio-frequency fingerprint processing procedure 400.The step of process 400 need not to finish with the order of any specific, and at least some steps can be carried out in multithreading or parallel processing environment at one time.Process 400 in real time or (for example: query specification symbol that client-side interface 102) generates and the reference descriptor that is stored in one or more databases mate with client-side interface on low delay ground.The technology that process 400 adopts people such as Ke to propose is come processing environment voice data (for example from television broadcasting) and inquiry.
The environment audio fragment that process 400 starts from the mass medium broadcasting that client-side interface obtains environment audio detection device (for example microphone) (for example: the audio frequency of 5-6 second) be decomposed into overlapped frame (402).In certain embodiments, (for example: 12 milliseconds at interval) be separated by several milliseconds between these frames.Each frame be converted into through the training after can overcome audio-frequency noise and distortion descriptor (for example: 32 bit descriptors) (404), described as people such as Ke.In certain embodiments, each descriptor is represented the identification statistical abstract of audio fragment.
In certain embodiments, descriptor can be used as query fragment (being also referred to as the query specification symbol) and be sent to the audio database server, this descriptor this audio database server be complementary the statistical abstract (406) of the environment audio fragment of mass medium broadcasting of record before this has identified with reference to descriptor with reference to the database of descriptor.Can determine to have the tabulation (408) of candidate's descriptor of optimum matching.Can mark to candidate's descriptor, make the score value of the candidate descriptor consistent be higher than the candidate's descriptor (410) that accords with not enough sequential unanimity with query specification with query specification symbol sequential.(for example has highest score, the score value that surpasses a fully high threshold value) candidate's descriptor is sent out or otherwise offers social application server (412), and these candidate's descriptors can be used to compile the customized information relevant with media broadcast at social application server.Utilize threshold value to guarantee that this descriptor is abundant coupling before candidate's descriptor being sent or otherwise offers social application server (412).
In certain embodiments, the broadcasting that can provide from different media companies generates the database with reference to descriptor, and this database can be indexed and be used to generate descriptor.In other embodiments, also can utilize list of television programmes or other metadata and/or the information that is built in the broadcast singal generates with reference to descriptor.
In certain embodiments, can utilize speech recognition technology to help which program of identification just watching.This technology can help the user that media event is discussed and be not only TV play.For example, the user can watch the emission of space shuttle at the channel different with other spectators, therefore, may obtain different sound signal (for example, because different announcers).Speech recognition technology can be used to identidication key (as, space shuttle, emission or the like), and this key word can be used to user and comment media are linked.
The hash descriptor
People such as Ke utilize computer vision technique to seek the height of audio frequency is differentiated power, succinct statistic.Their program is in the positive example (wherein x is the noise version of same audio frequency with x ') of mark and counter-example (wherein x with x ' from different audio frequency) centering training.In this training stage, based on the machine learning techniques usage flag that advances (boosting) to 32 filtrators of the statistic of selecting to have created jointly high differentiation power and the combination of threshold value.First rank and the second jump variation of assigning to locate spectrogram amplitude of filtrator utilization on time domain and frequency domain.A benefit using these simple and easy differential filter is to use the integral image technology to calculate them efficiently, wherein the integral image technology is at Viola, P. and Jones, M. be published in " International Journal ofComputer Vision ", (2002) phase, exercise question is to describe to some extent in the article of " Robust Real-Time ObjectDetection ", and it is incorporated herein by reference in full.
In certain embodiments, these 32 filtrators are output as threshold value, provide 1bit/ each filtrator at each audio frame.These 32 threshold values are only by the descriptor of that frame of the audio frequency that is sent out and obtain.Sparse property in this coding has guaranteed user's privacy, prevents unwarranted eavesdropping.In addition, the descriptor of these 32 bits is strong for the audio distortion in the training data, thereby make positive example (as the coupling frame) have little Hamming distance from (for example, weighing the distance of different bit numbers), and counter-example (as unmatched frame) have big Hamming distance from.Note that the filtrator that also can use more or less quantity, and each audio frame use more than each filtrator of 1bit/ (as, use many bits of many threshold testings).
In certain embodiments, 32 bit descriptors itself are as the hash key of direct hashing algorithm.Descriptor is the hash function of balance.By not only to query specification symbol, also similar descriptor to fraction (with the Hamming distance of original query descriptor from mostly being most 2) inquire about, retrieval rate is further enhanced.
Inner inquiry sequential consistance
In case use above-mentioned hash routine that query specification symbol and audio database are complementary, verify this coupling with determine which database returns to hit item (hit) be accurate coupling.Otherwise candidate's descriptor has many frames and the query specification symbol is complementary, but sequential organization is wrong.
In certain embodiments, checking is to be that support to the coupling of ad hoc inquiry database skew place realizes by each database being hit item is considered as.For example, if at 5 seconds, " Song Feichuan " query fragment of 415 frame lengths, 8 descriptor (q among the q
8) hit the 1008th database descriptor (X
1008), then this has supported the candidate matches between 1001 frame to 1415 frames in inquiry in 5 seconds and audio database.At q
nAnd X
1000+n, other coupling between (1≤n≤415) can be supported the candidate matches that this is identical.
Except the sequential consistance, when session sound temporarily was submerged in the environment audio frequency, we also needed interpreted frame.This can be modeled as the alternative conversion between environment audio frequency and interference sound.For each inquiry frame i, a hidden variable y is arranged all
iIf, y
iEqual 0, then Cha Xun i frame only is modeled as interference; If y
iEqual 1, then the i frame is modeled as from clean environment audio frequency.Adopt a kind of extreme sight (pure environment audio frequency or pure interference), the extremely low precision that is used to expression (32 bit) each audio frame proves rationally, and by supposing (y at these two kinds
i=0 and y
i=1) for providing the extra bit probability of beating, in 32 positions of this frame vector each weakened under.At last, we utilize the transition probability that is obtained by training data, will be modeled as implicit first-order Markov process in the conversion of the interframe between pure environment audio frequency or the pure disturbance state.For example, the 66 parameter probability models that on CVPR 2005, provide of people such as we reusable Ke.
Environment data base vector x at query vector q and skew N frame
NBetween the final mask of matching probability, for:
Wherein＜q
n, x
mExpression 32 bit frame vector q
nWith x
mBetween the bit difference.This model combines sequential consistency constraint and environment/interference hidden Markov model.
Coupling back consistance is filtered
When people watch TV through being everlasting and other people talk, disturb thereby fragmentary but stronger sound wave occurs, particularly using when the environment audio frequency being sampled based on portable microphone.Suppose most of talk modes for continuing for two or three seconds, the simple exchanging meeting between spectators can not be discerned 5 seconds inquiry.
In certain embodiments, the coupling back is filtered and is used to handle not matching of these intermittent low confidences.For example, we can use and have hidden Markov model continuous time that L expects that the channel of residence time (expected dwell time) (being the time between channel changes) switches second.The high confidence level of society's application server 106 in will the nearest past mate (with its " (discounted) after the discounting " degree of confidence) as with the part of each client sessions associated state information.Utilize this information, server 106 can according to which have higher degree of confidence and from recently passing chosen content index coupling, or select current index to mate.
We use M
hAnd C
hOptimum matching and log-likelihood degree of confidence score value thereof in the step before the expression (before 5 seconds).If we are to applying markov model simply of optimum matching before this, and do not carry out other observation, then our expection be the optimum matching of current time with 5 seconds optimum matching forward is identical agenda, and is C in this pre-interim our degree of confidence
h-l/L, wherein l=5 second is the query time step-length.The discount of l/L and Markov model probability e in log-likelihood

Detect advertisement and replay
Duplicate detection
For the inquiry readiness database time, can utilize foregoing descriptor to indicate that in advance the material of repetition is helpful.The material that repeats can include but not limited to: the program of repetition, and advertisement, sub-fragment (as the stock fragment in the news program), or the like.Utilize these signs, can present the material of repetition by this way, promptly can not release the every other material (hitting item) of the concern scope that exceeds the user who searches for as surpassing initial 10-20 bar.The process 700 that describes below provides a kind of method that detects those copies before to any search inquiry of database earlier.
The video ads deletion
Broadcaster is the replay of embedded advertisements about one of complaint of allowing the searched and playback of material.From the viewpoint of broadcaster, replay is reactive: thus because it provides free advertisement to reduce the directly value of the broadcast program of paying of advertiser to the advertiser.Unless delete old advertisement and suitably add new advertisement in mode from some comments to original broadcast company that return, otherwise they can not gain from broadcasted material before.It is a kind of by searching repetition that the process 700 that describes below provides, and also may detect the approach of embedded advertisements together with Else Rule (as the duration, volume, visual activity, chain group blank frame (bracketing blank frame) etc.) together.
Video frequency abstract
" summary " of non-if desired repeated program material
1(promptly short version), a kind of mode of obtaining it is deletion advertisement (as detected repeated material), and from just in time taking out fragment the material before or after this location advertising.On radio and television, these positions typically comprise " trailer " (before advertisement) and " recapitulaion " (just in time after advertisement) in program.If summary need be made by the news program of the non-ad material that comprises non-repetition and repetition, typically the non-ad material of this repetition is equivalent to primary sound summary broadcast (sound bite).Usually, the information that provides of these fragments is less than News Stories host's the information that narration provided, and is good deletion candidate target.If summary need be made by narration program (as: film or publish in instalments part), the track of repetition typically is equivalent to theme, the sight music, or mourn in silence.Again, these are fit to fragment deleted from summarized radio typically.Process 700 described below provides and detects the method that these repeat tracks, so as from this summarized radio with its deletion.
The duplicate detection process
Fig. 7 is the process flow diagram according to an embodiment of duplicate detection process.The step of process 700 need not to finish with the order of any specific, and at least some steps can be carried out under multithreading or parallel processing environment at one time.
Process 700 starts from from such as TV, and the content collection that video is uploaded etc. is created the database (702) of audio statistics amount.For example, this database can comprise the descriptor of 32 bits/every frame, and is described as people such as Ke.Obtain inquiry from this database, and this database is moved this inquiry where produced repetition (704) to understand.In certain embodiments, the short-movie section of audio statistics amount is taken as inquiry and is performed, utilizing hashing technique (as direct hashing or position sensing hashing (LSH)) to check nonidentity coupling (coupling but inconsistent), thereby obtain the short tabulation of possible sense of hearing coupling.In proof procedure, handle these candidate matches then, for example, described as people such as Ke.Can be identified as repeated content (706) with the corresponding content of the candidate matches of empirical tests.
The strongest nonidentity coupling is forward and backward " growth " in time, with the beginning and the end point (708) of searching repeated material.In certain embodiments, can utilize existing dynamic programming technology (as Viterbi (Viterbi) decoding) to finish this.When extending this coupling forward in time, last timeslice in " seed " coupling is set to " coupling " by force, and the first last timeslice that is lower than the coupling of confidence level that is used for the same database skew between this inquiry and this coupling is set to " not matching ".In certain embodiments, the coupling score value of the single frame between these two point of fixity is used as observed value, and has used the single order Markov model of the single conversion of enable state internal conversion and from " coupling " to " not matching " state.Can slightly at random be provided with from matching unmatched transition probability to 1/L, wherein L is the frame number between these two point of fixity, and it is corresponding to the minimum cognition to dislocation in the allowed band.Another selects the possibility of transition probability to be to use coupling intensity profile to setover to the estimation of morning and later conversion.But this can increase the complexity of dynamic programming model, and unlikelyly can improve the result, has been used as observed value because will mate intensity in during this period.Can make and use the same method the fragment match (for example, only switch past/future and move same algorithm) of growing backward in time.
In certain embodiments, audio prompt combines with non-acoustic information (as visual cues), to obtain higher matching accuracy.For example, by the audio frequency matched and searched to coupling can verify (or check for the second time) (710) subsequently by utilizing simple visual similarity to measure.These tolerance can include but not limited to: color histogram (as the frequency of similar color in two images), and to statistic of amount of edge and distribution etc.These not only need to calculate at entire image, also to calculate at the subregion of image, and with target image in corresponding subregion compare.
Search the application of advertisement (opposite) for those with all kinds of repeated materials, the testing result of repeated material can be used to distinguish advertisement combine with the module of non-advertisement (712).These distinguishing characteristicss can be dependent on the advertisement convention, as the duration (for example, 10/15/30 second commercial breaks is commonplace), (as: volume of advertisement often is higher than near the volume of program material to depend on volume, if therefore the material that repeats is louder than the material of either side, then it probably is advertisement), (as: advertisement has more conversion fast often and more moves in the camera lens between camera lens to depend on visual activity, if therefore the material that repeats has bigger interframe difference than the program material of either side, then it probably is advertisement), and depend on chain group blank frame (local advertisement of inserting typically can not the national feedback of complete filling be broadcast (national feed) and be its space that stays, and causing with 30 seconds multiple serves as to occur blank frame at interval and mourn in silence).
In case identify advertisement, can analyze this advertisement material on every side, and generate statistic.For example, can do the how many times advertisement to specific products, or broadcasted how many times or the like and generated statistic about specific fragment about utilizing specific intention (as image, text).In certain embodiments, one or more old advertisements are deleted or alternative by new advertisement.Also have some to be used for the technology of purposes of commercial detection and replacement at Covell, M., Baluja, S., Fink, M. be published in IEEE SignalProcessing Society, MMSP 2006 International Workshop on MultimediaSignal Processing, 3-6 day in October, 2006, Canada, exercise question is described in the literary composition of " AdvertisementDetection and Replacement Using Acoustic and Visual Repetition ", and it is incorporated herein by reference in full.
In certain embodiments, can be used to expansion process 700 from content owner's information (as the position that ad material is inserted, the position that program repeats), and can increase matching accuracy about this content detailed structure.In certain embodiments, can use video statistics amount alternate audio statistic to determine repetition.In other embodiments, also can use the combination of video and audio statistics amount.
The audio fragment auction
In certain embodiments, the advertiser can participate in the auction relevant with the environment audio frequency, and wherein this environment audio frequency wants product sold relevant with service with this advertiser.For example, but the right of a plurality of advertiser's auction to obtain its product or service and the audio fragment or the descriptor of relevant " Song Feichuan " are associated.The winner of auction subsequently can be when this theme environment audio frequency occurring be presented on some relevant informations (for example, sponsored link) in face of the spectators.In certain embodiments, but advertiser's auction has the environment audio fragment that unit level (meta-level) is described.For example, but advertiser's auction audio frequency relevant with television advertising (for example, this is and the relevant audio frequency of Ford Explorer TV advertisement), closed caption (as: captions show " Yankees baseball "), (as: this audio frequency will appear at " Song Feichuan " and broadcast 15 minutes in the program segment position, appear at a commercial breaks 3 minutes afterwards and next the commercial breaks 1 minute before), or low level sound or visual characteristic (as: " background music ", " dialogue sound ", " explosive sound " etc.).
In certain embodiments, one or more popular personalized application can be carried out other task the user, such as moving under the background of browsing another website (as sponsored link).The material relevant with media broadcast (as television content) can join in the sponsored link auction identical with another content resource (as web site contents) related materials.For example, the advertisement that TV is relevant can mix with the advertisement corresponding to the current web page content.
Within the scope of appended claim, allow disclosed embodiment is carried out various modifications.
