Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to the field of optical wavelength splitters/combiners, more particularly it relates to fiber-to-the-premises network equipments comprising optical wavelength band splitter/combiner.
- FTTP fiber-to-the-premises
- GPON gigabit passive optical network
- Converged voice, video and data services networks are also known as “triple play networks”. These networks support two signals in downstream direction (from central station to the user) and one signal in upstream direction.
- a first downstream signal delivers analog television and a second downstream signal delivers digital voice and data services, such as for example telephone and/or Internet.
- the upstream signal is typically a digital signal delivering voice and data from the user to the central station or the service provider.
- FTTP system delivers voice, video and data over a PON using the ITU-T GPON standard.
- the system supports radio frequency (RF) analog video delivery using a 1550 nm wavelength overlay.
- RF radio frequency
- High-quality video on a PON is achieved with a high power 1550 nm signal and power requirement at 1550 nm is greatly demanding.
- the second downstream signal uses a 1490 nm wavelength and the upstream digital signal is typically allocated at 1310 nm wavelength.
- FTTP networks In FTTP networks, as well in many other applications, a key technology is signal splitting and/or combining.
- Signal multi/demultiplexing must fulfill very demanding requirements such as, among the other, wide bandwidths and small cross-talk over a wide temperature range (typically from ⁇ 40° C. to +85° C.).
- low cost components such as light emitter, are used over a wide temperature range, possibly generating a large wavelength drift.
- Many applications require a rectangular wavelength response in order to maintain a low-loss and wavelength-independent transmission in a passband and a high-level rejection to all wavelengths in a stopband.
- anticipated telecommunications applications seek a 1.3/1.55 ⁇ m WDM filter having a flat and low-loss passband at 1.280-1.335 ⁇ m and a ⁇ 50 dB stopband at 1.525-1.575 ⁇ m.
- micro-optic products based on thin-film technology are currently used, such as for example multilayer thin-film filters in free space optics. Nonetheless, they are undesirable because they cannot be readily integrated and because their fabrication requires high labor cost, mainly due to the operations of alignment of components during assembly, and because of difficulties in coupling light to and from fibers.
- Optical splitting components may be classified as the following three types: (1) bulk-type optical splitters; (2) fiber-type optical splitters; and (3) guided-wave type optical splitters.
- the bulk-type optical splitters are constructed by arranging microlenses, prisms, interference-film filters, etc., and have little wavelength dependence. Although the bulk-type optical splitters can be put into practical use to some extent, they require a long time and skill for assembly and adjustment, and present some problems with regard to long-term reliability, cost and size.
- the fiber-type optical splatters are fabricated using optical fibers as constituent material. Although they exhibit reduced wavelength dependence, the fabrication process requires skill, and is not suitable for mass production because of lack of reproducibility.
- guided-wave type optical splitters have the advantage that they can be constructed on flat substrates in large quantities through processes such as the photolithography process. Hence, they attract attention as a promising type of splitting component which can be reproduced and integrated as compact parts.
- Optical devices based on this technology are also referred to as planar lightwave circuits (PLC) devices or integrated optical circuit (IOC) devices.
- FIG. 1 is a planar view exemplifying a configuration of a conventional (2 ⁇ 2) guided-wave type optical coupler.
- two optical waveguides 2 and 3 are formed on a substrate 1 .
- a part of the optical waveguide 2 and a part of the optical waveguide 3 are brought into close proximity with each other over a length L c to form a directional coupler 4 .
- One end of the optical waveguide 2 is a first input port 7 into which an optical signal P in is launched, and the other end of the optical waveguide 2 is a bar output port 8 from which a bar optical signal P bar is emitted.
- one end of the optical waveguide 3 is a second input port 5
- the other end of the optical waveguide 3 is a cross output port 6 from which a cross signal P cross is emitted.
- the directional coupler 4 may be designed in such a way that an optical signal P in launched into the first input port 7 is branched into two optical signals P bar and P cross to be outputted from ports 8 and 6 , respectively.
- the power coupling ratio C is defined as:
- ⁇ ( ⁇ ) also depends on the length L c of the straight coupling region, on the distance between the waveguides at the coupling region over the length L c , on the shape, width and depth of the waveguides, on the refractive index difference between waveguide core and cladding, on the geometry of the input and output curves 9 , etc.
- ⁇ ( ⁇ ) ⁇ ( ⁇ )[ L C + ⁇ L ( ⁇ )] (3), wherein ⁇ ( ⁇ ) is the wavelength-dependent coupling per unit length in the straight part of the coupler and ⁇ L( ⁇ ) is an equivalent effective interaction length accounting for the wavelength-dependent coupling contribution of the input and output curves 9 .
- the optical coupler 4 can act as an optical wavelength splitter, by properly exploiting the wavelength dependence of the power coupling ratio, but its sine-like response does not make it suitable for telecommunication purposes.
- the power coupling ratio of the directional coupler 4 can be specified to a desired value at a particular desired wavelength, the wavelength dependence of the coupling ratio presents a problem when the optical coupler is used in a wide wavelength region.
- MZI Mach-Zehnder Interferometers
- the coupling ratios of the couplers are not functions of wavelength.
- the path difference of the single-stage MZI is determined from the frequency period of the filter characteristics.
- the spectral transmittance is periodic for optical frequency, since directional couplers exhibit negligible wavelength dependence.
- the frequency period is set at 10 GHz.
- the frequency multi/demultiplexer described in Jinguji et al. is designed for frequency multi/demultiplexing and has very narrow stopband and passband.
- the stopband and passband are narrower than 10 GHz, which means significantly narrower than 1 nm at typical optical transmission wavelengths (from 850 nm to 1800 nm).
- the Applicant thus observes that the above device is not suitable to split/combine two optical wavelength bands wider than several nm, such as in 1.49/1.55 ⁇ m WDM optical transmission system.
- the multi/demultiplexer described therein is not intended for high density optical device, as shown by the relatively low refractive index difference (0.3%). Moreover, Applicant has determined that the structure disclosed in Jinguji et al. exhibits a limited tolerance to fabrication errors, especially in view of a dense optical integration, as will become clear below.
- Monolithic optical waveguide devices are particularly promising because they can perform complex circuit functionalities and because they can be made by mass production integrated circuit techniques.
- the integration of all the components needed for the full functionality in a single optical integrated circuit may reduce the alignment problem.
- a single integrated chip may allow to a larger extent the automation during the module assembly.
- high-density In this context, it is highly desirable to achieve a high-density of optical chips on the substrate wafer, in order to reach an economic cost-effectiveness. In fact, the higher is the density of PLC devices on the substrate, the higher is the saving in the labour-and-material cost and the shorter is the overall processing time. In order to achieve a high-density, it is convenient to choose a high waveguide-to-cladding index contrast, wherein high index contrast means an index contrast equal to or greater than about 1%. A problem arises with high index contrast, in that the fabrication tolerances and chip-to-fiber alignment tolerances worsen with the increasing of index contrast.
- the PLC device demands that there is little need of active characterization and/or control of the device, both during the fabrication process and during operation.
- the active characterization and/or control may be avoided if the device is strongly tolerant to fabrication errors, in order to guarantee high fabrication yield, and if it is strongly tolerant to operation variations, such as wavelength drifting and/or temperature variations. Accordingly, the demand for high density and the demand for high tolerances are in conflict.
- the Applicant has tackled the problem of providing an optical band splitter/combiner device, particularly suitable for FTTP networks, having wide flattened continuous bands and strong tolerance to fabrication errors.
- the Applicant has found that the above problem is particularly severe in the context of PLC devices, and more particularly in the context of high-density PLC devices.
- a splitter/combiner comprising five cascaded splitting devices and four differential phase delay devices alternated with the splitting devices may be made suitable to the use in wideband WDM transmission systems.
- a splitter/combiner for a first and a second continuous optical band wider than 10 nm may be made by designing the five splitting devices and the four differential delay devices so as to send the power input at an operating wavelength within a first optical band substantially in one of the two output ports and the power input at an operating wavelength within a second optical band substantially in the other of the two output ports.
- the Applicant has found that a preferred choice of the splitting coefficients of the five splitting devices may result in a splitter/combiner of a first and a second continuous optical band wider than 10 nm having particularly wide flattened bands and very strong tolerance to fabrication errors.
- Cascaded configurations of the inventive structure can be designed in order to get even better performances.
- the present invention finds particularly advantageous application in the context of integrated optics circuit or PLC devices, particularly silica based PLC, wherein the device may comprise two optical waveguides apt to form the couplers and the differential delays. Moreover, Applicant has found that the present invention is particularly advantageous in the context of high-density circuits, wherein the refractive index contrast is greater than or equal to about 1%, preferably greater than or equal to about 2%. Applicant has found that an optimal choice of the refractive index contrast suitable to meet the above requirements is below about 4.5%, preferably below about 3%.
- the present solution shows a good trade-off between high manufacturing automation, high density, high yield and high tolerance.
- the present invention relates to an optical device for splitting/combining a first and a second continuous optical wavelength band, each wider than 10 nm, comprising a first input port and a first and a second output port, a first, a second, a third, a fourth and a fifth optical splitting device optically coupled in cascade and optically connected to the first input port and to the first and second output port, wherein
- the coupling angles ⁇ A , ⁇ B and ⁇ C satisfy, at least at a wavelength ⁇ 3op within the first optical band, the relation 2 ⁇ A ( ⁇ 3op )+ ⁇ C ( ⁇ 3op )+2 ⁇ B ( ⁇ 3op ) ⁇ 2 ⁇ .

- the coupling angles ⁇ A , ⁇ B and ⁇ C satisfy, at least at a wavelength ⁇ 3op within the first optical band, the relation 2 ⁇ A ( ⁇ 3op )+ ⁇ C ( ⁇ 3op )+2 ⁇ B ( ⁇ 3op ) ⁇ .
- the coupling angles ⁇ A , ⁇ B and ⁇ C satisfy, at least at a wavelength ⁇ 3op within the first optical band, the relation:
- the first optical differential delay device and the second optical differential delay device may have differential delays equal in sign.
- the optical device of the present invention is a planar optical device, for example it may comprise a pair of optical waveguides forming the first, second, third, fourth and fifth optical splitting device and the first, second, third and fourth optical differential delay device.
- the optical waveguides may have an index contrast higher than about 1% or they may have an index contrast lower than about 4.5%.
- the present invention relates to an optical device for splitting/combining a first and a second optical wavelength band comprising a plurality of optical devices as described above optically connected in tree-cascade.

- a difference between two optical devices due to the unavoidable fabrication errors does not depart from the optical devices being substantially identical. Accordingly, a deviation of the actual value of a generic differential delay from a respective nominal value ⁇ by at most 1% does not depart, for the purpose of the present invention, the actual differential delay device from having an associated differential delay equal to about the nominal value ⁇ .
- the optical splitting devices have respective associated coupling angles ⁇ A ( ⁇ ), ⁇ B ( ⁇ ) and ⁇ C ( ⁇ ) apt to direct, in combination with above described differential delay devices 111 , 112 , 113 and 114 , more than half of the total output power of an optical radiation inputting at the first input port 101 and having any wavelength within the first optical band to one of the first and second output port 102 , 103 and more than half of the total output power of an optical radiation inputting at the first input port 101 and having any wavelength within the second optical band to the other of the first and second output port 102 , 103 .

- k and m are selected in order to have ⁇ A ( ⁇ ), ⁇ B ( ⁇ ) and ⁇ C ( ⁇ ) positive.
- the first wavelength ⁇ 1op coincides with the third wavelength ⁇ 3op and the second wavelength ⁇ 2op coincides with the fourth wavelength ⁇ 4op , but wavelength deviations may occur because of the fine-tuning of the overall structure.
- the designer needs to make the passband and the stopband of each output port of the device to fit with the desired optical bands.
- the designer needs to take into account the specific desired level of cross-talk of each stopband, which in general may vary with the first and the second optical band.
- a fine tuning process is usually required to achieve the desired specifications and it is generally driven by the optical sub-band having the most stringent specification for the cross-talk.
- ⁇ 1op is equal to ⁇ 3op and is at the center of the desired optical sub-band
- ⁇ 2op is equal to ⁇ 4op and is at the center of the respective desired optical sub-band.

- This is because of the deviation of ⁇ 1op from ⁇ 3op and ⁇ 2op from ⁇ 4op at the end of the fine tuning process described above.
- the optical device 100 of the present invention is apt to direct an optical radiation inputting at the first input port 101 and having a wavelength within the first optical band substantially at one of the first and second output port 102 , 103 and an optical radiation inputting at the first input port 101 and having a wavelength within the second optical band substantially in the other of the first and second output port 102 , 103 , wherein “substantially” means at least the 95% of the total power outputting from the device 100 at the respective wavelength.
- the Applicant has found that it is advantageous to choose the indexes t, m and k in order to keep the coupling angle values ⁇ A ( ⁇ ), ⁇ B ( ⁇ ) and ⁇ C ( ⁇ ) as low as possible.
- This in turn means that, according to relation (3), also the lengths of the splitting devices 106 , 107 , 108 , 109 and 110 are as low as possible, thus reducing the wavelength dependence of the coupling angle itself.
- the reduced wavelength dependence of the splitting devices is particularly critical in high index contrast technology.
- Table 1 shows some of the possible configurations corresponding to the lower-order choices of indexes t, m and k in accordance to (7):
- the last column of table 1 shows the respective sum of all the coupling angles of the band splitter/combiner 100 at the third wavelength ⁇ 3op within the first optical band, according to the second relation of eq. (6).
- the sum is a good indication of the total length of the optical splitters 106 , 107 , 108 , 109 and 110 in the particular case of PLC optical splitters, such as for example of the type of FIG. 1 .

- a PLC splitter/combiner comprising longer optical couplers will occupy more space on the substrate of fabrication, thus reducing the yield of the manufacturing process.
- longer optical couplers will generally lead to narrower rejection bands and to higher sensitivity of the overall spectral response of the respective splitter/combiner with respect to small fluctuations of the structural parameters arising from the manufacturing process, as will be described in greater details below. This is especially true in the context of high index contrast PLC splitters/combiners, wherein the tolerance of the optical devices to manufacturing errors worsen with the increasing of the refractive index contrast.

Description
when the input optical radiation is launched only in the first input port 7.
C=sin2θ(λ) (2),
wherein the coupling angle θ(λ) of the power coupling ratio typically depends on wavelength. In case of a
θ(λ)=κ(λ)[L C +δL(λ)] (3),
wherein κ(λ) is the wavelength-dependent coupling per unit length in the straight part of the coupler and δL(λ) is an equivalent effective interaction length accounting for the wavelength-dependent coupling contribution of the input and
-
- the first and the fifth optical splitting device have an associated first coupling angle (θA),
- the second and the fourth optical splitting device have an associated second coupling angle (θB) and
- the third optical splitting device have an associated third coupling angle (θC); and a first, a second, a third and a fourth optical differential delay device optically coupled to, and interleaved between, said optical splitting devices, wherein
- the first, second, third and fourth optical differential delay device have a respective differential delay which is substantially an even multiple of π at least at a first wavelength (λ1op) within the first optical band and substantially an odd multiple of π at least at a second wavelength (λ2op) within the second optical band;
- the differential delay of the third optical differential delay device is opposite in sign with respect to the differential delay of the second optical differential delay and
- the differential delay of the fourth optical differential delay device is opposite in sign with respect to the differential delay of the first optical differential delay, wherein the coupling angles θA, θB and θC are selected in order to direct more than half of an output power of a first optical radiation inputting at the first input port and having any wavelength within the first optical band to the first output port and more than half of an output power of a second optical radiation inputting at the first input port and having any wavelength within the second optical band to the second output port.

|φ(λ1)|>|φ(λ2)| if λ1<λ2 (4)
ΔL=(2m+1)π/|β(λ2op)−β(λ1op)|, m integer (5)
where tε{0,1}, k is an integer and m is a non-negative integer. Advantageously, k and m are selected in order to have θA(λ), θB(λ) and θC(λ) positive. Nominally, the first wavelength λ1op coincides with the third wavelength λ3op and the second wavelength λ2op coincides with the fourth wavelength λ4op, but wavelength deviations may occur because of the fine-tuning of the overall structure. In fact, when designing an optical device in accordance with the present invention, one needs to make the passband and the stopband of each output port of the device to fit with the desired optical bands. In addition, the designer needs to take into account the specific desired level of cross-talk of each stopband, which in general may vary with the first and the second optical band. As a consequence, a fine tuning process is usually required to achieve the desired specifications and it is generally driven by the optical sub-band having the most stringent specification for the cross-talk. Exemplarily, one may start from an ideal condition wherein λ1op is equal to λ3op and is at the center of the desired optical sub-band and λ2op is equal to λ4op and is at the center of the respective desired optical sub-band. After calculating, e.g. by computer simulation, the corresponding spectral response, one may seek an optimal configuration by stepwise changing, for example, λ1op and λ3op independently from each other. Typically, λ2op and λ4op move accordingly. The process ends when an optimal solution is found.
