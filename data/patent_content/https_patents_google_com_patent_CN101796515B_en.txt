Embodiment
Fig. 1 is the schematic diagram of exemplary information-retrieval system 100, described information retrieval system 100 is used for information (for example, web document) and the content (after this be called advertisement or be called simply ad) that the search inquiry of retrieval and demonstration and user's 104 submissions matches.System 100 illustrates search inquiry information transparency to be provided and to allow advertiser 106 to improve the performance of advertising campaign to advertiser 106 (advertisement sponsor person).In some instances, system 100 provides the original query word of the search inquiry that system 100 receives to advertiser 106, wherein search inquiry comprises the probability very low (for example, close to zero) of personal information (for example, home address or Social Security Number).
To be it illustrate the fraction of whole search inquiries that system 100 receives to advertiser 106 to another feature of system 100, and cover the relevant search inquiry of most of and advertiser 106.Advertiser 106 is concerned about which search inquiry can cause its advertisement clicked.Most of clicked advertisement is to trigger by the search inquiry of submitting to by a plurality of users 104.The user 104 who clicks in particular advertisement may may be illustrated particular advertisement because having keyed in identical search terms.For example, clicking for the major part of the advertisement of specific portable music player can be from the title of having keyed in this specific music player and the user who has carried out thus same or similar inquiry.For example, system 100 can be illustrated in to advertiser 106 less than 1% of the whole unique search inquiries that receive in a period of time, and cover to surpass the search inquiry of 50% the click of triggering in described advertisement.
Term " searching request " refers to from user 104 to search server 108 requests to information that send, and term " search inquiry " refers to the search terms and the operational symbol (for example, Boolean operator) that comprise in the described searching request.Searching request from different user 104 can comprise identical search inquiry.As described below, different user 104 can be associated with the different identification symbol, such as the cookie identifier.Therefore, if a plurality of user 104 has submitted identical search inquiry to, then search inquiry can be associated with a plurality of unique identifiers.
In some embodiments, query statistic engine 114 provides graphic user interface 200 (seeing Fig. 2) to allow advertiser 106 to select to watch what statistics.For example, advertiser 106 can ask to watch the search inquiry that triggers specific action, described action case as so that advertisement shown, click or conversion.As response, the search inquiry 116 that 114 identifications of query statistic engine are associated with particular advertisement and action.Query statistic engine 114 can provide to advertiser 106 the original query word (for example, the actual keyword of user's 104 submissions) of search inquiry 116.Query statistic engine 114 has built-in safety practice to prevent from illustrating the search inquiry 116 with personal information.
The search inquiry 116 that user 104 submits to can comprise personal information.For example, some users 104 may comprise in search inquiry that its home address is to search for local information.Some users 104 may input its Social Security Number to watch its Social Security Number whether to list in common document in search inquiry 116.User 104 may input personal information for other reasons in search inquiry.In order to protect user 104 privacy, 114 identifications of query statistic engine do not comprise the search inquiry 116 of personal information, and it is known as " personal secrets " inquiry 134, and those inquiries is stored in the inquiry log 118 of personal secrets.Query statistic engine 114 only provides the search inquiry 134 of personal secrets to advertiser 106.
In some embodiments, query statistic engine 114 is identified the inquiry 134 of personal secrets by being identified in the schedule time length the search inquiry 116 of being submitted to by the unique users of predetermined quantity at least.For example, if identical search inquiry 116 was submitted to by dozens of unique users 104 within one month or longer time, then described dozens of unique users 104 can not be inquired about identical unique individual's information.The requirement that search inquiry 116 is submitted to by the unique users of predetermined quantity at least can be regarded as the popularity threshold value, wherein only has search inquiry popular in different user 116 just to be considered to personal secrets.
Described predetermined quantity can be for for example more than 10, and described schedule time length can be for for example more than one month.Query statistic engine 114 is used for identifying the type of the search service that the standard (for example quantity of unique users and time span) of the search inquiry 134 of personal secrets can provide according to for example search server 108 and to some extent conversion.
In some embodiments, query statistic engine 114 can be carried out query specification and merges (consolidate) search inquiry 116 when the search inquiry 134 of identification personal secrets.Query specificationization can be by being decomposed into search inquiry search terms (or mark) and keeping the order of described search terms to carry out.For example, two or more spaces between two keywords in the search inquiry can be reduced to a space.Can remove special operational symbol from search inquiry, negate word and some junction symbol.
For example, search inquiry " apple juice " (having two or more spaces between " apple " and " juice ") and search inquiry " apple juice " (having a space between " apple " and " juice ") can be confirmed as identical search inquiry.Search inquiry " apple-orange juice " also can be confirmed as the search inquiry identical with " apple juice " with " apple and juice ".Therefore, if four different users have been submitted search inquiry " applejuice ", " apple juice ", " apple-orange juice " and " apple and juice " to, query statistic engine 114 can think that search inquiry " apple juice " submitted to by four unique users.This (has for example improved inquiry, " apple juice ", " apple juice ", " apple-orange juice " or " apple and juice ") be marked as the inquiry of personal secrets and probability that can invasion of privacy, reason is that extra space and some connector can not disclose any personal information.
In some embodiments, query statistic engine 114 usefulness Proxy Methods determine based on the cookie that is associated with user 104 whether search inquiry 116 is submitted to by unique users 104.When user 104 uses web-browsing devices 120 access search server 108, search server 108 be configured such that web-browsing device 120 user 104 for the first time during access search server 108 at client device 122 places storage cookie.Each cookie can comprise identifier, but can not comprise user 104 personal information.When user 104 sends searching request to search server 108, also provide the cookie identifier to search server 108.The cookie that is stored in the different client devices 122 can have different identifiers.
Query statistic engine 114 by find out the search inquiry 138 that is associated from different cookie identifiers identify by unique users 104 submit to through normalized search inquiry 116.A plurality of users 104 can use identical client device 122, so the search inquiry 116 that different user is submitted to may be associated with identical cookie identifier.This can not affect the ability of the search inquiry 134 of query statistic engine 114 identification personal secrets usually, reason is to be configured to identify and n search inquiry 116 that unique cookie identifier is associated at least when query statistic engine 114, and when each cookie identifier was associated with one or more unique users 104, the search inquiry 134 of personal secrets can be associated with n or more unique users 104 then.Although user 104 can use a plurality of client devices 122 to visit search server 108 and be associated with a plurality of cookie identifiers, the frequency of the activity that the possibility that the same search that but user 104 uses a plurality of client devices 122 to submit to comprises identical personal information is inquired about is very low and such is very low, thereby the quantity of the unique users of each inquiry probably is lower than the unique users threshold value.
In some embodiments, user 104 has the option of closing cookie.When user 104 closed cookie in the web-browsing device 120, search server 108 still can be specified cookie to web-browsing device 120, but web-browsing device 120 can not stored described cookie.When web-browsing device 120 sends searching request to search server 108, search server 108 will receive described cookie, and it comprises the second timestamp when very first time stamp that when described cookie generate and described cookie sent by web-browsing device 120.Search server 108 can determine whether user 104 has closed cookie by for example freshness of relatively determining cookie based on the first and second timestamps.If the difference between two timestamps, thinks then that cookie is fresh and query statistic engine 114 determines that users 104 have closed cookie less than for example 10 seconds.
In some embodiments, in the situation that closed cookie and submitted to the user 104 of same search inquiry can be collected at together and be queried statistics engine 114 to think a unique users.Therefore, if whether be used for to determine search inquiry 116 is that the unique users threshold value of personal secrets is p, if then p-1 unique users 104 submitted search inquiry 116 to and do not closed cookie at least, and one or more users 104 have submitted search inquiry 116 to but closed cookie, search inquiry 116 is considered to personal secrets.
Query statistic engine 114 can be categorized as different types with the search inquiry 134 of personal secrets based on the similarity grade of search terms and the keyword that is associated from advertisement.For example, search inquiry 134 can be classified as three types: exact matching Class1 28, phrase match Class1 30 and wide in range match-type 132.Exact matching Class1 28 comprises wherein search terms and the identical search inquiry 134 of advertisement keyword.Phrase match Class1 30 also is known as the expansion match-type, and it comprises that wherein advertisement keyword is the search inquiry 134 of the part (for example, its substring) of search terms.Wide in range match-type 132 comprises wherein search terms and the general search inquiry 134 that mates of advertisement keyword, for example, a part and the search terms of advertisement keyword are complementary, advertisement keyword appears in the search inquiry and still occurs with different order, and perhaps advertisement keyword is the synonym of search terms.
For example, if advertisement is associated with keyword " plasma hdtv ", the search inquiry 134 that then has search terms " plasma hdtv " can be placed in the exact matching Class1 28.Search inquiry 134 with search terms " cheap plasma hdtv " can be placed in the phrase match Class1 30, and reason is that advertisement keyword is the part of search terms.Search inquiry 134 with search terms " hdtvplasma " or " LCD hdtv " can be placed in the wide in range match-type 132.
But query statistic engine 114 and described matching engine example such as specialized hardware, the software module of carrying out at multi-purpose computer or the combination of custom hardware and software are implemented.
Fig. 2 is that query statistic engine 114 provides to allow advertiser 106 to generate various types of reports and determines to watch the figure of example of the graphic user interface (GUI) 200 of what query statistic.GUI 200 can comprise the part 202 that allows advertiser 106 to determine the report of what type of generation.In this example, selected the report of search inquiry performance.GUI 200 can comprise permission advertiser 106 determines the part 204 in what information shown in the described report.In this example, term " movable (campaign) ", " advertisement keyword (ad keyword) ", " search inquiry (search query) ", " match-type (match type) ", " number (number of impressions) flashes ", " clicks (number of clicks) " and " turnover number (number of conversions) " have been selected.GUI 200 can comprise the part 206 that allows advertiser's 106 arrangements regularly to generate report and send email notifications to advertiser 106 when each generation report.GUI 200 can comprise the extention that allows advertiser 106 to add selection.After advertiser 106 finished its selection, he can click to generate report at " creating report (create report) " button 208.
Fig. 3 is the example of the report 300 of the search inquiry statistics that can be provided to advertiser 106 by query statistic engine 114.Report 300 can comprise various columns, for example movable number 302, advertisement keyword 304, search inquiry 306, match-type 308, several 310, the clicks 312 of flashing and turnover number 314.Column in the report 300 can be made amendment based on the selection of advertiser in the GUI 200 of Fig. 2.
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram for the example process 400 of the information that provides the search inquiry of personal secrets to advertiser 106 and be associated.Process 400 is from the request (402) of advertiser's reception to the query statistic of advertisement.Described request can required movement certain type, such as shown, click or conversion.For example, the advertiser can be the advertiser 106 of Fig. 1, and query statistic engine 114 can be used to receive described request from advertiser 106.Process 400 access search inquiry logs are to find out the search inquiry (404) of the described advertisement of triggering of submitting to during certain time period.For example, described search query log can be the search query log 112 of Fig. 1, and search inquiry can be search inquiry 116, and query statistic engine 114 can be used to find out the search inquiry of the described advertisement of triggering of submitting to during certain time period.
