Definitions
- the present disclosure relates in general to wireless communication devices, and, in particular, to methods and apparatus for transmitting service information in a neighborhood of peer-to-peer communication groups.
- a cellular phone may exchange contact information with another cellular phone via a Bluetooth connection or execute a multiplayer game with another cellular phone via a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection (e.g., an 802.11 Wi-Fi connection without the need for a router).
- a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection e.g., an 802.11 Wi-Fi connection without the need for a router.
- peer-to-peer mechanisms do not scale efficiently to a large number of devices. Attempts to scale these peer-to-peer mechanisms results in inefficient routing of data packets, which results in data delays and increased power consumption. In addition, these peer-to-peer mechanisms do not efficiently discover each other's services and individually interact across the network.
- US2004/044727 discloses a shared resource distributed index mechanism that peers in a P2P network may utilize to distribute index entries corresponding to resources to indexes of shared resources among one or more peers, for example rendevouz peers.
- EP 2 555 490 describes a method for the creation of a Wi-Fi P2P group using Wi-Fi direct where a Wi-Fi group owner relays messages among the members of a group.
- US2005/107102 discloses a method of relaying a connection request to minimize connection waiting time between Bluetooth devices supporting an ad hoc network.
- a peer-to-peer client e.g., a cellular phone or other computing device
- a service notification message including a category (e.g., games), a sub-category (e.g., game title), an action (e.g., find player), a group identifier (e.g., group 1), and a device identifier (e.g., device 1).
- the peer-to-peer client sends the service notification to a local group owner, which in turn forwards the service notification to each member in that group that is associated with both the category and the sub-category (e.g., games and game title).
- the local group owner also forwards the service notification to each local bridge that is associated with the category (e.g., games).
- Each forwarding bridge adds addressing information (e.g., return path) and forwards the message to each neighboring group owner that is associated with the category (e.g., games).
- Each receiving group owner removes duplicates due to multiple paths and forwards the service notification to each of its group members that is associated with both the category and the sub-category (e.g., games and game tirle).
- Each receiving group owner also forwards the service notification to each group member that is identified as a bridge and is associated with the category (e.g., games).
- each peer-to-peer client that is associated with the category and the sub-category receives the service notification.
- a peer-to-peer client that receives the service notification may generate a response to the service notification (e.g., also wish to play game title).
- the response is forwarded from bridge to bridge via group owners based on the return path included with the original service notification until the originating peer-to-peer client receives the response message.
- wireless devices using the disclosed methods and apparatus are able to dynamically form very large peer-to-peer groups, discover each other's services, and individually interact with each other in manner that reduces the consumption of power and scales efficiently.
- an apparatus includes a service notification generator structured to generate a service notification including a category and a sub-category.
- the apparatus also includes a peer-to-peer connector operatively coupled to the service notification generator, the peer-to-peer connector is structured to connect a first peer-to-peer client to a first peer-to-peer communication group via a first peer-to-peer group owner and transmit the service notification from the first peer-to-peer client to the first peer-to-peer group owner.
- the apparatus also includes a message forwarder operatively coupled to the peer-to-peer transmitter, the message forwarder is structured to (a) forward the service notification from the peer-to-peer group owner to a first group member that is associated with the category and the sub-category in the service notification, and (b) forward the service notification from the peer-to-peer group owner to a second group member that is identified as a first bridge and is associated with the category in the service notification.
- the second group member may be structured to add addressing information to the service notification and forward the service notification to a neighboring group owner that is associated with the category in the service notification.
- the neighboring group owner may be structured to forward the service notification to a second group member that is associated with the category and the sub-category in the service notification.
- the neighboring group owner may be structured to forward the service notification to a third group member that is identified as a second bridge and is associated with the category in the service notification.
- a second peer-to-peer client may be structured to generate a response message including the addressing information and transmits the response message to the first peer-to-peer client via a return path identified by the addressing information.
- the service notification may include an action associated with at least one of the category and the sub-category.
- the service notification may include a group identifier and a device identifier.

- the service notification generator 402 generates a service notification including a category and a sub-category for the service.
- the peer-to-peer connector 404 connects a peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 to a peer-to-peer communication group 104a, 104b, 104c, 104d via a peer-to-peer group owner wireless device 102 and transmits the service notification from the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 to the peer-to-peer group owner wireless device 102.
- the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 may connect to an 802.11 Wi-Fi access point that is part of a peer-to-peer neighborhood 100.
- the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 in this example may be a smart phone and the owner may be looking for someone to play a certain game.
- the category may be set to "games” and the sub-category may be set to the title of the game (e.g., chess). Any type of category and sub-category may be used.
- a "messaging" category may have a "text" and "social media" as sub-categories.
- a “sports” category may have “football” and “baseball” as sub-categories.
- the "football” sub-category may have an “NFL” sub-sub-category, which may in turn have a "Chicago” sub-sub-sub-category.
- the message forwarder 408 forwards the service notification from the peer-to-peer group owner wireless device 102 to group member wireless devices 102 that are associated with the category and the sub-category in the service notification. For example, if any of the other peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102 associated with that access point are looking for a chess opponent, the access point sends each of those peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102 the service notification from the first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102.
- the access point does not send the service notification to each of those peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102. In this manner, unnecessary network communications are avoided.
- the message forwarder 408 also forwards the service notification from the peer-to-peer group owner wireless device 102 to group member wireless devices 102 that are identified as bridges and are associated with the category in the service notification. For example, the local group owner wireless device 102 forwards the service notification to other groups with at least one member interested in "games" (but not necessarily "chess”). However, in this example, the local group owner wireless device 102 does not forward the service notification to other groups that have no members interested in "games.” In this manner, unnecessary network communications are avoided.

- a peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 generates a service notification message including a category (e.g., games), a sub-category (e.g., chess), an action (e.g., find player), a group identifier (e.g., group 1), and a device identifier (e.g., device 1).
- the group identifier and the device identifier specify the logical location of the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 that generated the service notification message.
- the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 sends the service notification to the local group owner wireless device 102, which in turn forwards the service notification to each member in that group that is associated with both the category and the sub-category (e.g., games and chess).
- the local group owner wireless device 102 also forwards the service notification to each local bridge that is associated with the category (e.g., games).
- Each forwarding bridge wireless device 102 adds addressing information (e.g., return path) and forwards the message to each neighboring group owner that is associated with the category (e.g., games).
- Each receiving group owner wireless device 102 removes duplicate service notifications caused by the existence of multiple communication paths and forwards the service notification to each of its group member wireless devices 102 that is associated with both the category and the sub-category (e.g., games and chess). Each receiving group owner wireless device 102 also forwards the service notification to each group member wireless device 102 that is identified as a bridge and is associated with the category (e.g., games). This process is repeated as necessary to fully propagate the service notification throughout the appropriate portions of the neighborhood 100 of peer-to-peer communication groups 104a, 104b, 104c. Eventually, each peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 that is associated with the category and the sub-category (e.g., games and chess) receives the service notification.
- the sub-category e.g., games and chess
- the process 500 begins when a first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 connects to a group owner wireless device 102 that is part of a peer-to-peer neighborhood (block 502).
- the first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 may connect to an 802.11 Wi-Fi access point that is part of a peer-to-peer neighborhood.
- the first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 then generates a service notification including a category, a sub-category, an action, a group identifier, and a device identifier (block 504).
- the first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 may be a smart phone and the owner may be looking for someone to play the game chess.
- the category may be set to "games”
- the sub-category may be set to “chess”
- the action may be set to "find player.”
- the group identifier and the device identifier specify the logical location of the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102.
- the first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 then sends the service notification to the local group owner wireless device 102 (block 506).
- the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 may send the notification that it is looking for a chess opponent to the local 802.11 Wi-Fi access point associated with the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102.
- the local group owner wireless device 102 then forwards the service notification to each member in that group that is associated with the category and the sub-category in the service notification (block 508).
- the access point sends each of those peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102 the service notification from the first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102.
- the access point does not send the service notification to each of those peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102. In this manner, unnecessary network communication is avoided.
- the local group owner wireless device 102 then forwards the service notification to each group member wireless device 102 that is identified as a bridge and is associated with the category in the notification (block 510). For example, the local group owner wireless device 102 forwards the service notification to other groups with at least one member interested in "games” (but not necessarily "chess "). However, in this example, the local group owner wireless device 102 does not forward the service notification to other groups that have no members interested in "games.” In this manner, unnecessary network communication is avoided.

Description
- The present disclosure relates in general to wireless communication devices, and, in particular, to methods and apparatus for transmitting service information in a neighborhood of peer-to-peer communication groups.
- Most modern wireless devices include some form of peer-to-peer wireless communication. For example, a cellular phone may exchange contact information with another cellular phone via a Bluetooth connection or execute a multiplayer game with another cellular phone via a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection (e.g., an 802.11 Wi-Fi connection without the need for a router).
- However, these peer-to-peer mechanisms do not scale efficiently to a large number of devices. Attempts to scale these peer-to-peer mechanisms results in inefficient routing of data packets, which results in data delays and increased power consumption. In addition, these peer-to-peer mechanisms do not efficiently discover each other's services and individually interact across the network.

FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an example process for transmitting a response to a service notification via a neighborhood of peer-to-peer communication groups. - The invention is defined by the appended claims.
- Briefly, in a specific embodiment, a peer-to-peer client (e.g., a cellular phone or other computing device) generates a service notification message including a category (e.g., games), a sub-category (e.g., game title), an action (e.g., find player), a group identifier (e.g., group 1), and a device identifier (e.g., device 1). The peer-to-peer client sends the service notification to a local group owner, which in turn forwards the service notification to each member in that group that is associated with both the category and the sub-category (e.g., games and game title). The local group owner also forwards the service notification to each local bridge that is associated with the category (e.g., games). Each forwarding bridge adds addressing information (e.g., return path) and forwards the message to each neighboring group owner that is associated with the category (e.g., games). Each receiving group owner removes duplicates due to multiple paths and forwards the service notification to each of its group members that is associated with both the category and the sub-category (e.g., games and game tirle). Each receiving group owner also forwards the service notification to each group member that is identified as a bridge and is associated with the category (e.g., games).
- This process is repeated as necessary to fully propagate the service notification throughout the appropriate portions of the neighborhood of peer-to-peer communication groups. Eventually, each peer-to-peer client that is associated with the category and the sub-category (e.g., games and game title) receives the service notification. A peer-to-peer client that receives the service notification may generate a response to the service notification (e.g., also wish to play game title). The response is forwarded from bridge to bridge via group owners based on the return path included with the original service notification until the originating peer-to-peer client receives the response message. Among other features, wireless devices using the disclosed methods and apparatus are able to dynamically form very large peer-to-peer groups, discover each other's services, and individually interact with each other in manner that reduces the consumption of power and scales efficiently.
- More generally, methods and apparatus for transmitting service information in a neighborhood of peer-to-peer communication groups are disclosed. In an embodiment, an apparatus includes a service notification generator structured to generate a service notification including a category and a sub-category. The apparatus also includes a peer-to-peer connector operatively coupled to the service notification generator, the peer-to-peer connector is structured to connect a first peer-to-peer client to a first peer-to-peer communication group via a first peer-to-peer group owner and transmit the service notification from the first peer-to-peer client to the first peer-to-peer group owner. The apparatus also includes a message forwarder operatively coupled to the peer-to-peer transmitter, the message forwarder is structured to (a) forward the service notification from the peer-to-peer group owner to a first group member that is associated with the category and the sub-category in the service notification, and (b) forward the service notification from the peer-to-peer group owner to a second group member that is identified as a first bridge and is associated with the category in the service notification.
- The second group member may be structured to add addressing information to the service notification and forward the service notification to a neighboring group owner that is associated with the category in the service notification. The neighboring group owner may be structured to forward the service notification to a second group member that is associated with the category and the sub-category in the service notification. The neighboring group owner may be structured to forward the service notification to a third group member that is identified as a second bridge and is associated with the category in the service notification. A second peer-to-peer client may be structured to generate a response message including the addressing information and transmits the response message to the first peer-to-peer client via a return path identified by the addressing information. The service notification may include an action associated with at least one of the category and the sub-category. The service notification may include a group identifier and a device identifier.
- Turning now to the figures, a block diagram of certain elements of an example peer-to-
peer neighborhood system 100 is illustrated inFIG. 1 . The illustratedsystem 100 includes a plurality of wireless devices 102 (e.g., cellular phone, portable computer, television, camera, etc.) in a plurality of peer-to-peer groups peer groups network neighborhood system 100. Each peer-to-peer group wireless device wireless devices wireless device wireless devices peer group wireless device - A peer-to-
peer group peer groups peer groups - The example shown in
FIG. 1 includes three peer-to-peer groups peer group 104a includes a peer-to-peer group ownerwireless device 102a and two peer-to-peer clientwireless devices wireless device 102c and two peer-to-peer clientwireless devices wireless device 102c is both a client device in peer-to-peer group 104a and the peer-to-peer group owner in peer-to-peer group 104b.Wireless device 102c is a client of thegroup 104a and an owner of the group 104b. The peer-to-peer group 104c includes a peer-to-peer group ownerwireless device 102f and two peer-to-peer clientwireless devices Wireless device 102e is a client in of the group 104b and a client of thegroup 104c. - The group owner
wireless device 102a runs an RBridge, which forms one side of a connection betweengroup 104a and group 104b. The group ownerwireless device 102c runs another RBridge, which forms the other side of the connection betweengroup 104a and group 104b. The clientwireless device 102e runs an RBridge, which forms one side of a connection between group 104b andgroup 104c. The group ownerwireless device 102f runs another RBridge, which forms the other side of the connection between group 104b andgroup 104c. - Any wireless device 102 in the
system 100 may communicate with any other wireless device 102 in thesystem 100. For example,wireless device 102b may send a message towireless device 102g. In this example, the message travels fromwireless device 102b towireless device 102a.Wireless device 102a, acting as a group owner and a bridge, determines that the destination for the message is not ingroup 104a. Accordingly,wireless device 102a forwards the message towireless device 102c.Wireless device 102c, acting as a group owner and a bridge, determines that the destination for the message is not in group 104b. Accordingly,wireless device 102c forwards the message towireless device 102e.Wireless device 102e is not a group owner. Accordingly,wireless device 102e forwards the message towireless device 102f.Wireless device 102f, acting as a group owner and a bridge, determines that the destination for the message is ingroup 104c. Accordingly,wireless device 102f forwards the message to its final destination,wireless device 102g. - A block diagram of certain elements of another example peer-to-
peer neighborhood system 200 is illustrated inFIG. 2 . Theexample system 200, like the example system 100 (which is included as a subset of example system 200), includes a plurality of wireless devices 102 (e.g., cellular phone, portable computer, television, camera, etc.) in a plurality of peer-to-peer groups peer group wireless device owner wireless device owner wireless device peer group - In addition, in this example, each peer-to-peer group
owner wireless device network infrastructure 204. Thenetwork infrastructure 204 may be anysuitable network infrastructure 204 such as the Internet and/or some other wired and/or wireless data network, including, but not limited to, any suitable wide area network or local area network. - As described above with reference to
FIG. 1 , each peer-to-peer group peer groups peer groups - In addition, each peer-to-
peer group peer groups network infrastructure 204. In such an instance, either a wireless device 102 connecting thegroup - Any wireless device 102 in the
system 200 may communicate with any other wireless device 102 in thesystem 200. For example,wireless device 102b may send a message towireless device 102h. In this example, the message travels fromwireless device 102b towireless device 102a.Wireless device 102a, acting as a group owner and a bridge, determines that the destination for the message is not ingroup 104a. Accordingly,wireless device 102a forwards the message to accesspoint 202a.Access point 202a forwards the message to accesspoint 202c via thenetwork infrastructure 204.Access point 202c, acting as a bridge, determines that the destination for the message is ingroup 104d. Accordingly,access point 202c forwards the message to its final destination,wireless device 102h. - Each of the devices illustrated in
FIG. 1 andFIG. 2 (e.g., wireless device 102 and/or access point 204) may include certain common aspects of many electronic devices such as microprocessors, memories, peripherals, etc. A block diagram of certain elements of an exampleelectronic device 300 is illustrated inFIG. 3 . The exampleelectrical device 300 includes amain unit 302 which may include, if desired, one or morephysical processors 304 electrically coupled by an address/data bus 306 to one ormore memories 308,other computer circuitry 310, and one ormore interface circuits 312. Theprocessor 304 may be any suitable processor or plurality of processors. For example, theelectrical device 300 may include a central processing unit (CPU) and/or a graphics processing unit (GPU). - The
memory 308 may include various types of non-transitory memory including volatile memory and/or non-volatile memory such as, but not limited to, distributed memory, read-only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM) etc. Thememory 308 typically stores a software program that interacts with the other devices in the system as described herein. This program may be executed by theprocessor 304 in any suitable manner. Thememory 308 may also store digital data indicative of documents, files, programs, web pages, etc. retrieved from a server and/or loaded via aninput device 314. - The
interface circuit 312 may be implemented using any suitable interface standard, such as an Ethernet interface and/or a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface. One ormore input devices 314 may be connected to theinterface circuit 312 for entering data and commands into themain unit 302. For example, theinput device 314 may be a keyboard, mouse, touch screen, track pad, isopoint, camera, voice recognition system, accelerometer, global positioning system (GPS), and/or any other suitable input device. - One or more displays, printers, speakers, monitors, televisions, high definition televisions, and/or other
suitable output devices 316 may also be connected to themain unit 302 via theinterface circuit 312. Thedisplay 316 may be a cathode ray tube (CRTs), liquid crystal displays (LCDs), electronic ink (e-ink), and/or any other suitable type of display. Thedisplay 316 generates visual displays of data generated during operation of thedevice 300. For example, thedisplay 316 may be used to display web pages and/or other content received from a server 106 and other device. The visual displays may include prompts for human input, run time statistics, calculated values, data, etc. - One or
more storage devices 318 may also be connected to themain unit 302 via theinterface circuit 312. For example, a hard drive, CD drive, DVD drive, and/or other storage devices may be connected to themain unit 302. Thestorage devices 318 may store any type of data used by thedevice 300. - The
electrical device 300 may also exchange data withother network devices 322 via a connection to a network 110. The network connection may be any type of network connection, such as an Ethernet connection, digital subscriber line (DSL), telephone line, coaxial cable,wireless base station 330, etc. Users 114 of thesystem 100 may be required to register with a server 106. In such an instance, each user 114 may choose a user identifier (e.g., e-mail address) and a password which may be required for the activation of services. The user identifier and password may be passed across the network 110 using encryption built into the user's browser. Alternatively, the user identifier and/or password may be assigned by the server 106. - In some embodiments, the
device 300 may be awireless device 300. In such an instance, thedevice 300 may include one ormore antennas 324 connected to one or more radio frequency (RF)transceivers 326. Thetransceiver 326 may include one or more receivers and one or more transmitters operating on the same and/or different frequencies. For example, theRF transceiver 326 may be a Bluetooth® transceiver, a Wi-Fi transceiver, and diversity cellular transceivers or a combination of the different transceivers. Thetransceiver 326 allows thedevice 300 to exchange signals, such as voice, video and data, withother wireless devices 328, such as a phone, camera, monitor, television, and/or high definition television. For example, thedevice 300 may send and receive wireless telephone signals, text messages, audio signals and/or video signals directly and/or via abase station 330. A receive signal strength indicator (RSSI) associated with each receiver generates an indication of the relative strength or weakness of each signal being received by thedevice 300. - A block diagram of certain elements of an
example system 400 for transmitting service information in a neighborhood of peer-to-peer communication groups is illustrated inFIG. 4 . Thesystem 400 may be implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware and hardware executing software. In one embodiment, thesystem 400 includes a CPU executing software. Other suitable hardware includes one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), state machines, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and/or digital signal processors (DSPs). - The
example system 400 includes aservice notification generator 402, a peer-to-peer connector 404, and amessage forwarder 408. As described in more detail below with reference to the flow charts inFIG. 5 andFIG. 6 , theservice notification generator 402 generates a service notification including a category and a sub-category for the service. The peer-to-peer connector 404 connects a peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 to a peer-to-peer communication group peer neighborhood 100. The peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 in this example may be a smart phone and the owner may be looking for someone to play a certain game. Accordingly, in this example, the category may be set to "games" and the sub-category may be set to the title of the game (e.g., chess). Any type of category and sub-category may be used. For example, a "messaging" category may have a "text" and "social media" as sub-categories. Similarly, a "sports" category may have "football" and "baseball" as sub-categories. In addition, any number of hierarchical levels may be used. For example, the "football" sub-category may have an "NFL" sub-sub-category, which may in turn have a "Chicago" sub-sub-sub-category. - The message forwarder 408 forwards the service notification from the peer-to-peer group owner wireless device 102 to group member wireless devices 102 that are associated with the category and the sub-category in the service notification. For example, if any of the other peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102 associated with that access point are looking for a chess opponent, the access point sends each of those peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102 the service notification from the first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102. However, if one or more peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102 associated with that access point are not associated with the sub-category (e.g., associated with "games," but not "chess"), the access point does not send the service notification to each of those peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102. In this manner, unnecessary network communications are avoided.
- The
message forwarder 408 also forwards the service notification from the peer-to-peer group owner wireless device 102 to group member wireless devices 102 that are identified as bridges and are associated with the category in the service notification. For example, the local group owner wireless device 102 forwards the service notification to other groups with at least one member interested in "games" (but not necessarily "chess"). However, in this example, the local group owner wireless device 102 does not forward the service notification to other groups that have no members interested in "games." In this manner, unnecessary network communications are avoided. - A flowchart of an
example process 500 for transmitting a service notification via a neighborhood of peer-to-peer communication groups is illustrated inFIG. 5 . Theprocess 500 may be carried out by one or more suitably programmed processors such as a CPU executing software (e.g., block 304 ofFIG. 3 ). Theprocess 500 may also be carried out by hardware or a combination of hardware and hardware executing software. Suitable hardware may include one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), state machines, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), digital signal processors (DSPs), and/or other suitable hardware. Although theprocess 500 is described with reference to the flowchart illustrated inFIG. 5 , it will be appreciated that many other methods of performing the acts associated withprocess 500 may be used. For example, the order of many of the operations may be changed, and some of the operations described may be optional. - In general, a peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 generates a service notification message including a category (e.g., games), a sub-category (e.g., chess), an action (e.g., find player), a group identifier (e.g., group 1), and a device identifier (e.g., device 1). The group identifier and the device identifier specify the logical location of the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 that generated the service notification message. The peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 sends the service notification to the local group owner wireless device 102, which in turn forwards the service notification to each member in that group that is associated with both the category and the sub-category (e.g., games and chess). The local group owner wireless device 102 also forwards the service notification to each local bridge that is associated with the category (e.g., games). Each forwarding bridge wireless device 102 adds addressing information (e.g., return path) and forwards the message to each neighboring group owner that is associated with the category (e.g., games). Each receiving group owner wireless device 102 removes duplicate service notifications caused by the existence of multiple communication paths and forwards the service notification to each of its group member wireless devices 102 that is associated with both the category and the sub-category (e.g., games and chess). Each receiving group owner wireless device 102 also forwards the service notification to each group member wireless device 102 that is identified as a bridge and is associated with the category (e.g., games). This process is repeated as necessary to fully propagate the service notification throughout the appropriate portions of the
neighborhood 100 of peer-to-peer communication groups - More specifically, the
process 500 begins when a first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 connects to a group owner wireless device 102 that is part of a peer-to-peer neighborhood (block 502). For example, the first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 may connect to an 802.11 Wi-Fi access point that is part of a peer-to-peer neighborhood. The first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 then generates a service notification including a category, a sub-category, an action, a group identifier, and a device identifier (block 504). For example, the first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 may be a smart phone and the owner may be looking for someone to play the game chess. Accordingly, in this example, the category may be set to "games," the sub-category may be set to "chess," and the action may be set to "find player." The group identifier and the device identifier specify the logical location of the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102. - The first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 then sends the service notification to the local group owner wireless device 102 (block 506). For example, the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 may send the notification that it is looking for a chess opponent to the local 802.11 Wi-Fi access point associated with the peer-to-peer client wireless device 102. The local group owner wireless device 102 then forwards the service notification to each member in that group that is associated with the category and the sub-category in the service notification (block 508). For example, if any of the other peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102 associated with that access point are looking for a chess opponent, the access point sends each of those peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102 the service notification from the first peer-to-peer client wireless device 102. However, if one or more peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102 associated with that access point are not associated with the sub-category (e.g., associated with "games," but not "chess "), the access point does not send the service notification to each of those peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102. In this manner, unnecessary network communication is avoided.
- The local group owner wireless device 102 then forwards the service notification to each group member wireless device 102 that is identified as a bridge and is associated with the category in the notification (block 510). For example, the local group owner wireless device 102 forwards the service notification to other groups with at least one member interested in "games" (but not necessarily "chess "). However, in this example, the local group owner wireless device 102 does not forward the service notification to other groups that have no members interested in "games." In this manner, unnecessary network communication is avoided.
- Each forwarding bridge wireless device 102 adds addressing information to the service notification message envelope and forwards the service notification to each neighboring group owner that is associated with the category in the notification (block 512). The addressing information builds in to a return path as the service notification is propagated through the neighborhood of peer-to-peer communication groups. Each receiving group owner wireless device 102 removes duplicates due to multiple paths (block 514) and forwards the service notification to each of its group member wireless devices 102 that is associated with the category and the sub-category (e.g., associated with "games" and "chess ") from the service notification (block 516).
- Each receiving group owner wireless device 102 also forwards the service notification to each group member wireless device 102 that is identified as a bridge and is associated with the category in the notification (block 518). For example, the receiving group owner wireless device 102 forwards the service notification to other groups with at least one member interested in "games" (but necessarily "chess "). However, in this example, the receiving group owner wireless device 102 does not forward the service notification to other groups that have no members interested in "games." In this manner, unnecessary network communication is avoided.
- Blocks 512 - 518 are repeated as necessary to fully propagate the service notification throughout the appropriate portions of the neighborhood of peer-to-peer communication groups. Eventually, each peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 that is associated with the category and the sub-category (e.g., associated with "games" and "chess ") receives the service notification including the appropriate version of the return path (block 520).
- A flowchart of an
example process 600 for transmitting a response to a service notification via a neighborhood of peer-to-peer communication groups is illustrated inFIG. 6 . Theprocess 600 may be carried out by one or more suitably programmed processors such as a CPU executing software (e.g., block 304 ofFIG. 3 ). Theprocess 600 may also be carried out by hardware or a combination of hardware and hardware executing software. Suitable hardware may include one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), state machines, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), digital signal processors (DSPs), and/or other suitable hardware. Although theprocess 600 is described with reference to the flowchart illustrated inFIG. 6 , it will be appreciated that many other methods of performing the acts associated withprocess 600 may be used. For example, the order of many of the operations may be changed, and some of the operations described may be optional. - In general, one or more peer-to-peer client wireless devices 102 that received a service notification may generate a response to the service notification (e.g., also wish to play chess). The response is forwarded from bridge wireless device 102 to bridge wireless device 102 via group owner wireless devices 102 based on the return path include with the original service notification until the originating peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 receives the response message.
- More specifically, the
process 600 begins when a peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 that received a service notification generates a response to the service notification (block 602). For example, a peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 may generates a response message indicating a desire to participate in the chess game. The response message includes the return path from the received service notification envelope. - The responding peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 sends the response message to the local group owner (if the responder is not also the group owner) (block 604). The local group owner wireless device 102 then forwards the response message to the appropriate return path RBridge wireless device 102 based on the return path from the received notification envelope (block 606). By using the return path received with the notification in
block 520 ofFIG. 5 , unnecessary network communication is avoided. - The receiving bridge wireless device 102 then forwards the response message to the next appropriate group owner wireless device 102 based on the return path from the received notification envelope (block 608), and the receiving group owner in turn forwards the response message to the next appropriate return bridge based on the return path from the received notification envelope. This process of forwarding the response message from bridge wireless device 102 to bridge wireless device 102 via group owner wireless devices 102 based on the return path is repeated as necessary until the originating peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 receives the response message (block 610). For example, the originating peer-to-peer client wireless device 102 may receive the group identifier and the device identifier of a chess opponent.
