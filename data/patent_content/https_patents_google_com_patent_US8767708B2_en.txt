- the illustrative embodiments provide a method, system, and mobile wireless device for identifying neighbor cells in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) configured wireless communication system.
- the cell searcher module (CSM) residing in the receiver of the wireless device detects that the device is in the coverage region of an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network Node B (eNodeB or eNB) by processing the receive signal associated with the primary synchronization (PSCH) and secondary synchronization (SSCH) sequences transmitted by an eNB.
- the wireless device determines whether candidate SCH signals (i.e., one or both of PSCH and SSCH sequences) from candidate neighbor/interferer cells are coherent and/or are synchronous with SCH sequences from the serving cell.
- the serving cell and a neighbor cell are frame time aligned (i.e., synchronous)
- the SCH sequences transmitted from the serving cell overlap in time and frequency with the neighbor cells' SCH transmission when both cells share the same carrier.
- This frame time alignment of the SCH sequences results in the serving cell interfering with the detection of the neighbor cell (i.e., in intra-frequency cell identification) as typically, the serving cell is the strongest cell (when ranked by reference signal received power, RSRP).
- the CSM generates a joint estimate of the received power of SSCH sequences corresponding to already detected/identified serving cell and a hypothetical neighbor cell (which has not yet been detected).
- the CSM re-constructs one or both of the PSCH and SSCH sequences for the already detected/identified serving cell and subtracts the reconstructed signal(s) from the received signal.
- the subtraction operation removes the serving cell PSCH/SSCH transmission from the received signal and therefore mitigates the serving cell interference problem to a large extent.
- the CSM then proceeds to detect/identify the PSCH and SSCH associated with a hypothetical neighbor cell (which has not been detected yet), as if there was no interference from the serving cell.
- the CSM jointly estimates the channel response associated with the known SSCH sequence of the serving cell and the SSCH sequence of a hypothetical neighbor cell (which has not been detected/identified yet).
- the estimated channel response (h 0 ) for the hypothetical neighbor cell is correlated against a similar channel response (h 1 ) obtained from the hypothetical neighbor cell's PSCH to determine whether the neighbor cell is present.

- UE 102 when processor 210 executes CSM 220 , UE 102 initiates a series of functional processes that enable the above functional features as well as additional features/functionality. These features/functionalities are described in further detail below within the (continuing description of FIGS. 1-3 and) description of FIGS. 4-10 .
- Three different methods are provided within the following description, with each method occasionally being referred to as a first embodiment, a second embodiment, and a third embodiment. Each method comprises multiple stages as defined within the specific presentation of that method.
- the embodiments assume implementation of only one method by a specific UE at any given time, although multiple of the three methods can be supported within a single UE and made available by selective activation (e.g., by programming of the device to operate in a specific manner desired by a manufacturer or commercial retailer or device engineer).
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating the execution stages/steps involved in cell identification via joint SCH power estimation using an iterative filtering loop, according to one embodiment.
- Cell Identification (ID) execution flow 400 provides cell identification via three stages, stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3, as illustrated by first execution step 402 , second execution step 404 and fourth execution step 408 .
- execution of the cell ID procedure via joint SCH power estimation occurs via a pipelined implementation in which execution of “successive” stages overlap in time, as described in FIG. 5 .
- a number of half frames of a received signal i.e., at UE/MS 102
- OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
- Stage 1 is further described by considering a half-frame of 5 ms duration.
- CSM 220 filters the received signal (e.g., to generate a 1.08 MHz bandwidth (BW) received signal).
- the received signal in a half-frame of 5 ms duration is correlated against codewords corresponding to all 3 PSCH hypotheses (i.e., candidate sequences) resulting in 3 ⁇ T correlation metrics, where T is the number of timing hypotheses.
- T the number of timing hypotheses.
- the two vectors of L 1 correlation metrics for each of the N 1 half-frames are stored and accumulated.
- the correlation metrics are indexed according to the PSCH and symbol timing hypotheses and are stored in a vector in memory.
- the stored correlation metrics are accumulated (i.e., summed non-coherently if the indices corresponding to the same PSCH/timing hypotheses match) for the different half-frames by merging the lists, which may increase the size of the list.
- the merging operation comprises extending the list if new PSCH/timing hypotheses arise out of processing a new half-frame.
- a smaller number of candidates e.g., 32 candidates
- the leading M 1 in this instance 32) candidate correlation metrics are passed to stage 2.
- Stage 2 is an iterative stage in which CSM 220 generates a score for each of the hypothetical SSCH sequences associated with the M 1 candidates from stage 1.
- CSM 220 uses the last half frame of stage 1, which half-frame is stored in the half-frame buffer, for generating the respective scores.
- Each SSCH sequence has an associated CP length hypothesis (normal and extended) and a half-frame timing hypothesis (first half-frame or second half-frame).
- CSM 220 implements the programmed method (in this instance Method 1) from among the three possible methods for generating SSCH scores.
- selection of a particular one of the programmed methods is based on whether the PSCH may be used as a phase reference for estimating the SSCH codeword power for that candidate, as explained below.
- CSM 220 /UE 102 implements a single method.
- CSM 220 is programmed to dynamically select one method from among the different methods when CSM 220 determines that there is an interference problem from the serving cell.
- a candidate from stage 1 having the same PSCH as the serving cell and having timing that is within one half CP length of the serving cell is considered.
- a first transmission received from the serving cell substantially overlaps in time with second transmission received from a candidate/neighbor/interferer cell.
- the candidate is characterized by the fact that the serving cell is several dBs higher in power than the power of the candidate.
- a channel estimate formed from a PSCH symbol which is used for computing the SSCH correlations, corresponds to the sum channel of the serving and candidate cells rather than an estimate of the candidate cell channel.
- neighbor/interferer cell identification is performed based on a first cell identification procedure that jointly estimates the SSCH received power.
- the SSCH received power provides/forms the SSCH score described in the section presented below, titled “ Joint Estimation of SCH Received Power”.
- neighbor/interferer cell identification is performed based on an alternative cell identification procedure in which a channel estimate determined from the received PSCH symbol is used for computing SSCH correlations corresponding to unidentified neighbor cells.
- the SSCH received power via this alternative cell identification procedure provides/forms the SSCH score based on coherent processing performed as if there is no interference from the serving cell.
- coherent processing the received PSCH signal is used to estimate the channel response associated with the received PSCH and SSCH signals. This estimated channel response is then used to construct a correlation metric associated with a hypothetical SSCH symbol that corresponds to an undetected/unidentified neighbor cell.
- CSM 220 employs one of the above mentioned cell identification procedures for ranking the SSCH/half-frame timing/CP length hypotheses for each candidate from stage 1.
- CSM 220 adds the SSCH scores during list merging. Finally, a threshold is applied to the aggregated SSCH scores and M 2 ⁇ 32 candidates that pass the threshold test from each list are passed from stage 2 to the inner loop for filtering.
- a first (single) iteration is defined as the processing of stage 1 followed by stage 2.
- two separate lists are output to the inner loop based on different methods used for constructing the SSCH correlation score.
- a total of N IL iterations are performed which generates N IL lists of either type. In the end, these lists are separately merged and M IL candidates from the merged lists of both types are output to stage 3, which is the RSRP estimation stage.
- a similar approach as utilized in stage 2 is used for merging lists involving an aggregation of SSCH scores.
- RSRP>T 3 are passed on as output of the cell identification module for one of: (a) providing an RSRP measurement report for an already configured event-trigger reporting criterion (i.e., execution step 412 ); and (b) allowing a newly detected candidate into the monitored cell list (i.e., execution step 410 ).
- FIG. 5 is an illustration of a time-line of different events associated with the execution of various stages in the pipelined implementation of a cell identification procedure, according to one embodiment.
- Time-line 500 shows various time instants and the events associated with the different time instants. These time instants include first time instant 502 and second time instant 504 .
- Time-line 500 also comprises legend 510 .
- one stage 1-stage 2 iteration is completed.
- time gap of T 1-2 ⁇ 0 ms seconds At the end of each stage 1-stage 2 iteration, there is time gap of T 1-2 ⁇ 0 ms seconds to enable time diversity in slow fading channels. Therefore, one stage 1-stage 2 iteration together with the time gap takes [(N 1 +N 2 ⁇ 1) ⁇ 5+T 1-2 ] ms.
- the inner loop filters a number, N IL , of such iterations.
- Stage 3 takes N 3 ⁇ T 3 ms to execute.
- N 3 ⁇ 4 and T 3 ⁇ 50 ms resulting in a total RSRP measurement period equal to 200 ms.
- the minimum total time therefore, for generating a candidate that meets the thresholding (i.e., the applied threshold) from start of stage 1 in the first iteration is equal to [(N 1 +N 2 ⁇ 1)5+T 1-2 ]N IL +N 3 T 3 .
