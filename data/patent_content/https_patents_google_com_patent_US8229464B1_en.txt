- the data may also be formatted in any computer-readable format.
- image data may be stored as bitmaps comprised of grids of pixels that are stored in accordance with formats that are compressed or uncompressed, lossless (e.g., BMP) or lossy (e.g., JPEG), and bitmap or vector-based (e.g., SVG), as well as computer instructions for drawing graphics.
- the data may comprise any information sufficient to identify the relevant information, such as numbers, descriptive text, proprietary codes, references to data stored in other areas of the same memory or different memories (including other network locations) or information that is used by a function to calculate the relevant data.
- the processor 120 may be any conventional processor, such as processors from Intel Corporation or Advanced Micro Devices. Alternatively, the processor may be a dedicated controller such as an ASIC. Although FIG. 1 functionally illustrates the processor and memory as being within the same block, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the processor and memory may actually comprise multiple processors and memories that may or may not be stored within the same physical housing. For example, memory may be a hard drive or other storage media located in a server farm of a data center. Accordingly, references to a processor or computer will be understood to include references to a collection of processors or computers or memories that may or may not operate in parallel.
- the computer 110 may be at one node of a network 195 and capable of directly and indirectly communicating with other nodes of the network.
- computer 110 may comprise a web server that is capable of communicating with client devices 160 and 170 via network 150 such that server 110 uses network 195 to transmit and display information to a user on display 162 of client device 170 .
- Server 110 may also comprise a plurality of computers that exchange information with different nodes of a network for the purpose of receiving, processing and transmitting data to the client devices. In this instance, the client devices will typically still be at different nodes of the network than any of the computers comprising server 110 .
- Network 195 may comprise various configurations and use various protocols including the Internet, World Wide Web, intranets, virtual private networks, local Ethernet networks, private networks using communication protocols proprietary to one or more companies, cellular and wireless networks (e.g., WiFi), instant messaging, HTTP and SMTP, and various combinations of the foregoing.
- cellular and wireless networks e.g., WiFi
- instant messaging HTTP and SMTP, and various combinations of the foregoing.
- FIGS. 1-2 Although only a few computers are depicted in FIGS. 1-2 , it should be appreciated that a typical system can include a large number of connected computers.
- Each client device may be configured similarly to the server 110 , with a processor, memory and instructions.
- Each client device 160 or 170 may be a personal computer intended for use by a person 191 - 92 , and have all of the components normally used in connection with a personal computer such as a central processing unit (CPU) 161 , memory (e.g., RAM and internal hard drives) storing data 165 and instructions 163 , an electronic display 162 (e.g., a monitor having a screen, a small LCD touch-screen, a projector, a television, a computer printer or any other electrical device that is operable to display information), end user input 164 (e.g., a mouse, keyboard, touch-screen or microphone).
- the client device may also include a camera 166 , GPS receiver 168 , speakers, a network interface device, and all of the components used for connecting these elements to one another.
- client devices 160 and 170 may each comprise a full-sized personal computer, they may alternatively comprise mobile devices capable of wirelessly exchanging data with a server over a network such as the Internet.
- client device 170 may be a wireless-enabled PDA or a cellular phone capable of obtaining information via the Internet.
- the user may input information using a small keyboard (in the case of a Blackberry phone), a keypad (in the case of a typical cell phone) or a touch screen (in the case of a PDA).
- computers in accordance with the systems and methods described herein may comprise any device capable of processing instructions and transmitting data to and from humans and other computers including general purpose computers, network computers lacking local storage capability, and set-top boxes for televisions.
- the client devices may also include a geographic position component to determine the geographic location and orientation of the device.
- client device 160 may include a GPS receiver 168 to determine the device's latitude, longitude and/or altitude position.
- the position component may also comprise software for determining the position of the device based on other signals received at the client device 160 , such as signals received at a cell phone's antenna from one or more cell phone towers if the client device is a cell phone.
- It may also include an accelerometer 169 or gyroscope to determine the direction in which the device is oriented.
- the device may determine its pitch, yaw or roll (or changes thereto) relative to the direction of gravity or a plane perpendicular thereto.
- a client device's provision of location and orientation data as set forth herein may be provided automatically to the user, to the server, or both.
- aspects of the invention are not limited to any particular manner of transmission of information.
- information may be sent via a medium such as an optical disk or portable drive.
- the information may be transmitted in a non-electronic format and manually entered into the system.
- functions are indicated as taking place on a server and others on a client, various aspects of the system and method may be implemented by a single computer having a single processor.
- data 134 may include user information 136 which identifies users of the systems, i.e., any entity that interacts with the systems or methods such as people or businesses.
- User information may be used to determine which user is interacting with the system. It will be understood that user information may refer only to a user's device and not actually identify any actual person or entity. Thus, if two client devices are associated with a particular user, server 110 may identify actions associated with each client device, but may not identify the devices as associated with the same user. As will be described in more detail below, a particular user or user device may request information or take some action associated with a geographic location.
- Action data 138 may identify information received or requested from a particular client device.
- client devices may identify various activities involving capturing information at a particular location. Users may take pictures, use visual search applications such as Google Goggles, take video or audio recordings, access an augmented reality application, etc.
- the server may use action data to determine correlations (if any) between discrete physical locations or points of interest at those locations.
- Action data 138 may be received by the server 110 in an active or a passive manner. For example, if a user initiates some action over the network and the server receives information regarding the action without requesting it, this information is received passively.
- the client device may request information from the server. In response, the server may actively request more information from the client device.
- Server 110 may also access geographic location information 140 .
- server 110 may identify a geographic location. Locations may be expressed in different ways, such as latitude/longitude positions, street addresses, street intersections, an x-y coordinate with respect to the edges of a map (such as a pixel position when a user clicks on a map), names of buildings and landmarks, and other information in other reference systems that is capable of identifying a geographic locations (e.g., lot and block numbers on survey maps). Moreover, a location may define a range of the foregoing. The system and method may further translate locations from one reference system to another.
- the client 160 may access a geocoder to convert a location identified in accordance with one reference system (e.g., a street address such as “1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, Calif.”) into a location identified in accordance with another reference system (e.g., a latitude/longitude coordinate such as (37.423021°, ⁇ 122.083939°)).
- a reference system e.g., a street address such as “1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, Calif.”
- another reference system e.g., a latitude/longitude coordinate such as (37.423021°, ⁇ 122.083939°)
- Server 110 may also access geolocated information 146 .
- This information may include any information associated with at least one location.
- geolocation information 146 may include advertisements, pictures, videos, user reviews, websites, etc.
- Valuation information 142 may be used to determine a weighted value associated with one or more actions at a particular location. Each activity described above may be associated with a weighted value. For example, activities may be valued on a scale between 0 and 1, may be a binary 0 or 1, or a number along a scale (0.152).
- Weighted values may be determined in various ways. For example, the final score for user i on location j may be defined as a weighted sum of scores on different user actions. More significant actions may be valued more than less significant actions. For example, taking one picture at a given location may have a relatively low ranking, e.g. on the order of 0.1, while taking 20 pictures at the same location may equate to a higher ranking, e.g. on the order of 0.6. In another example, video of a location may be valued greater than 20 pictures of the location, e.g. with a ranking on the order of 0.8.
- any method of associating or ranking values may be used, and any scale besides 0 to 1 (e.g., 0 to 100) may be used.
- Data 134 may be associated with one or more databases.
- the databases 144 may include matrixes or other representations which are used to identify associations between users, geographic locations, and weighted values.
- Each user, or user's device may be associated with one or more geographic locations (which may be anywhere on Earth).
- the matrix may indicate a weighted value of actions identified at particular geographic locations.
- matrix 300 may include weighted values of actions associated with particular users at different locations.
- user 1 may be associated with an action at location 3 .
- weighted value associated with user 1 at location 3 is 0.6
- user 1's client device may have registered one or more actions at location 3 .
- user 1 may have taken several pictures and/or video at location 3 .
- there may be no association between user 1 and location 1 as no weighted value is indicated.
- the matrix 300 may include any number of users and/or locations.
- each geographic location may be associated with a vector identifying a plurality of users (or user devices) and the weight assigned to the action(s) of each user (or device) at the particular location.
- a plurality of users may transmit action information.
- user A may take a video of a particular location.
- Server 110 may receive information identifying that a video was taken at that location.
- user A may then take some further action associated with the network, such as uploading or emailing the video.
- user A's device may automatically identify the action to the server, such as by using a visual search application to request information from the server.
- server 110 may also receive location information associated with the action. For example, server 110 may identify an IP address associated with user A's device and determined a geographic location, such as by referring to a lookup table. In another example, server 110 may receive GPS information from user A's device. In a further example, server 110 may identify a location based on the identification of one or more cell phone towers. In still a further example, the content, such as user A's video, may identify the location associated with the action.
- the server may assign a weighted value to the action as shown in block 420 .
- user 3 of matrix 300 may have taken a high quality video, such as high definition or 1080p signal, at location 2 .
- Server 110 may identify the action and assign a weighted value such as 0.3.
- server 110 may assign or revise a weight accordingly. For example, the server may assign the first high quality video from a particular user, such as user 4, some arbitrary value such as 0.3. If user 4 of matrix 300 has previously taken a high quality video at location 2 and server 110 determines that user 4 has taken a second high quality video at location 2 , server 110 may assign a weighted value of 0.5 by assigning the second video by the same user less weight. Alternatively, the server may assign a weighted value of 0.6 by doubling 0.3. This information is then stored, for example in the database 144 such as a matrix, as shown in block 430 .
- server 110 may identify a vector for each particular location as described above.
- a user may transmit a location to server 110 as shown in block 445 .
- the user may be a client device which automatically transmits GPS information to server 110 .
- the location may be identified as part of a request for information, such as a search request, map search request, visual search application request, or request for turn-by-turn directions.
- the location may or may not be associated with a particular action such as taking a picture or video as described above.
- server 110 may receive the location. As shown in block 460 , server 110 may use the vectors generated at block 440 to identify a vector associated with the received location.
- the identified vector may be used to identify correlated locations as shown in block 470 .
- the identified vector may be compared to vectors associated with other locations.
- Various methods of calculating similarities or associations may be used including calculation by cosine similarity, correlation based similarity, or other known methods. Using a simple example and comparing location 3 with locations 2 and 1 , there may be several users which took actions at location 3 which also took actions at location 2 . Comparing location 3 with locations 1 , there may be fewer users which took actions at location 3 which also took actions at location 1 .
- the vectors identified in block 440 may be compared as described above. Based on the example, server 110 may identify a high correlation between the vector associated with location 3 and the vector associated location 2 . A correlation may exist even though the locations are physically remote, e.g. New York City and Lima, Peru. These correlations may indicate that people who were at different locations were interested in both locations. One reason may be similar architectural styles, beautiful scenery (such as exotic beaches), similar points of interest (soccer stadiums or restaurants), or similar events occurring at those locations.
- the identified location may be transmitted to client device 160 .
- server 110 may transmit location 2 to the client device.
- Client device may receive the location at block 485 .
- the server may identify a correlated location and identify information associated with the identified vector as shown in block 510 of FIG. 5 .
- server 110 may identify advertisements associated with location 2 and transmit the advertisement at block 510 to client device 160 .
- Client device 160 may receive the advertisement at block 525 .
- matrix 300 may store information associated with a particular action or data of interest.
- matrix 300 may be associated with data such as pictures, audio recordings, or videos.
- server 110 may store information associated with a particular user rather than a particular user device. For example, server 110 may recognize a particular user, such as by assigning a unique identifier or requiring the user to login with a username and password. Each time the user identifies an action to the server from a particular device, server 110 identifies the user as well as an action associated with the user and stores this information in a database such as matrix 300 . If the user identifies an action to server 110 with an alternate device, the server may again identify the user based on the unique identifier and update the matrix with the additional action information.
- the matrix and vectors may be used to recommend locations. For example, if server 110 identifies a correlation between Aspen, Colo. and New York City, N.Y., it may indicate that a user taking pictures of New York may also be interested in Aspen, Colo. Thus, server 110 may send a message to the user identifying Aspen, Colo. as a location of interest or to provide a targeted advertisement concerning Aspen.
- the matrix and vector data may also be used to rank locations. The higher the number of correlations between vectors, the higher a location may be ranked. The reverse may also be true.
- Ranking information for example, may be used by server 110 to identify and order search results.
- the matrix and vector data may also be used to estimate a user's preference for a location even if the user has not been to that location yet.
- w_k is the similarity between location j and location l_k.
