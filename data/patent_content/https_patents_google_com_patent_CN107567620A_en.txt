Figure 1A and 1B depicts the example system for providing the search inquiry suggested based on one or more terms
System 100.Specifically, system 100 handles such implementation, wherein receiving the search inquiry to suggestion during search sessions
Request (that is, search inquiry be automatically performed), and provide one or more search inquiries suggested in response to the request, its
In, generate one or more based on one or more terms from the search inquiry extraction received during search sessions
It is recommended that search inquiry.
In brief, system 100 can receive one or more search inquiries during search sessions, such as defeated by user
The one or more natural language queryings entered.System 100 can identify one or more quoted by one or more search inquiries
Individual entity, and the one or more query patterns quoted by one or more search inquiries can be selected.System 100 can be with base
In identifying one or more entities and selecting the one or more query patterns quoted by one or more search inquiries, generation is built
The search inquiry of view.The list of the search inquiry of suggestion can be provided in response to the request of reception, for example, by being looked into search
Ask input field in provide suggestion search inquiry list and as the output for user.System 100 is set including client
For database 116 in 102, query engine front end 110, pattern database 112, entity data bak 114, session and it is automatically performed life
Grow up to be a useful person 120.The component of system 100 can communicate on each one or more networks of leisure (such as one or more LAN or WAN),
Or it can be communicated by other one or more wired or wireless connections.
As shown in Figure 1A, during operation (A), i.e., during search sessions, query engine front end 110 is received to by user
The data of one or more search inquiries coding of input.For example, user can provide inquiry at client device 102
" Band-A ", and query engine front end 110 can receive the data encoded to the inquiry.In some implementations,
Query engine front end 110 may be received on one or more networks or wirelessly or non-wirelessly connected in one or more other it is right
The data that the inquiry of user's input is encoded.
Client device 102 can be mobile computing device, such as mobile phone, smart phone, personal digital assistant
(PDA), music player, E-book reader, tablet personal computer, wearable computing devices, laptop computer, Desktop Computing
Machine or other portable or fixed computing devices.Client device 102 can be enabled a user to input at equipment and looked into
Microphone, keyboard, touch-screen or other interfaces of inquiry are characterized.In some implementations, user can set from client
Standby 102 presentation or addressable interface provide inquiry.For example, user can search what can be accessed at client device 102
Index holds up input inquiry, can at the database that can be accessed at the client device 102 input inquiry, or can with
Any other interface (for example, at social network interface) that search capability is characterized provides inquiry.
User can be for example by saying one or more terms of inquiry, the one or more terms for keying in inquiry, example
One or more terms of search inquiry are selected such as from the menu of available term, bag is for example selected from the menu of available query
The inquiry of one or more terms is included, or inquiry is provided by using any other method, is provided certainly at client device 102
Right language inquiry.In other implementations, user can for example, by by select or submit user want search image,
By provide user want search content audio or video sample, or by other side in client device 102
Locate input inquiry, inquiry is provided using another method.
Query engine front end 110 can be received including being inputted by user in individual data packet or in multiple packets
Inquiry and identification as user input inquiry cited in one or more terms data.It is related to the inquiry of user's input
The data of connection can be further received simultaneously along each beam direction, or can individually be received in the different time.
After the data that the inquiry to user's input encodes are received, query engine front end 110 can will be defeated with user
The data that the inquiry entered is associated are sent to database 116 in session.For example, include user's input search inquiry based on receiving
The data of " Band-A ", query engine front end 110 can extract the data associated with the inquiry " Band-A " of user's input, and
And the data associated with inquiry can be sent to database 116 in session.
During operation (B), database 116 can receive the information associated with the inquiry of user's input in session, and
And the entity associated with the inquiry of user's input can be identified.For example, database 116 can be received and inquired about in session
" Band-A " associated information, and can be band " Band-A " by the Entity recognition associated with inquiry.
In some implementations, in session database 116 can by by the term of inquiry with and one group of known entities
Associated term is compared, to identify the entity associated with inquiry.For example, looked into by what database in session 116 received
Inquiry can be natural language querying, for example, inquiry " Band-A ", and database 116 can be based on by the art of inquiry in session
Language with and the associated term of one group of known entities compared with, entity " Band-A " is identified as associated with the inquiry.
In some implementations, it is known that a group object can be such as can be by session at the entity data bak of entity data bak 114
Database 116 accesses, the entity data bak with can data-in-voice storehouse 116 it is associated or otherwise (such as pass through one
Individual or multiple networks) it can be accessed by database in session 116.
In some implementations, database 116 can identify one or more related to the entity identified in session
Individual entity, the entity identified are associated with the inquiry that user inputs.For example, the inquiry received by database in session 116 can
To be natural language querying, for example, inquiry " Band-A ", and database 116 can know one or more entities in session
Wei not be related to inquiry, such as band Band-A member " Member#1 ", or the song played by band " Band-A "
“Dancing King”.In some implementations, database 116 can use the reality of such as entity data bak 114 in session
Volume data storehouse, identify one or more entities on the entity that is identified associated with the inquiry that user inputs, the reality
Volume data storehouse is associated with meeting data-in-voice storehouse 116 or otherwise (such as by one or more networks) can be by session
Database 116 accesses.
The each entity identified by database in session 116 can be allocated relevance score.Multiple factors can be based on, it is all
Entity is included in the nearest time in the search inquiry of user's input such as during search sessions, for example, entity is included in
Entity is included in the frequent degree in the search inquiry of user's input, example in previous search inquiry, during search sessions
Such as, entity is included in during search sessions in the search inquiry of user's input more than once, or the journey that entity is taken seriously
Degree, for example, based on the number for checking or clicking on entity or the received resource associated with entity, phase is distributed to entity
The scoring of closing property.Relevance score can be used for appointing what search query suggestion was partial to extract from the nearest search inquiry of user
What entity, and can be dynamically adjusted during search sessions.In some cases, database 116 can be by phase in session
Closing property distributes to entity, and either relevance score, which can be distributed to the entity by another system or by individual, (such as is
The arbitration side of system 100 or user) distribute to entity.
In some implementations, database 116 can identify the type associated with the entity identified in session.Example
Such as, the inquiry received by database in session 116 can be natural language querying, for example, inquiry " Band-A ", and in session
Entity " Band-A " can be identified as that " $ band " are associated, and by related entities " Dancing with type by database 116
King " is identified as that " $ song " are associated with type.Other examples of entity type include " $ city ", " $ singer " or " $
Country " etc..In some implementations, it is known that a group object and its correlation type can be in such as entity data bak
It can be accessed at 114 entity data bak by database in session 116, the entity data bak is related to meeting data-in-voice storehouse 116
Join or otherwise (such as by one or more networks) can be accessed by database in session 116.
In some implementations, database 116 can identify the inquiry associated with the inquiry of user's input in session
Pattern.For example, the inquiry received by database in session 116 can be natural language querying, such as inquiry " Dancing
Kinglyrics Band-A ", and database 116 can identify query pattern " $ song lyrics $ band " in session.Look into
Other examples of inquiry pattern include " weather in $ city ", " $ singer birthday " or " $ country
population 2014”.In some implementations, it is known that a group polling pattern can be in such as query pattern database
Can be by database access in session, the query pattern database and meeting data-in-voice storehouse 116 at 112 query pattern database
It is associated or otherwise (such as by one or more networks) can be accessed by database in session 116.
The information associated with search sessions can be stored in buffer 118 by database 116 in session, described information
Such as information relevant with each entity identified during search sessions.For example, as shown in Figure 1A, database 116 in session
The entity and associated entity type that the search inquiry inputted from user (such as " Band-A ") can be identified are deposited together
Storage, such as " $ band " and relevance score " 1.0 ".In this example, because the present search query of user's input is " Band-
A ", therefore entity " Band-A " is allocated relevance score 1.0.Database is also by the related entities with being identified respectively in session
" Member#1 " and " information associated Dancing King " and associated entity type " $ singer " and " $ song "
Store together.In this illustration, entity " Member#1 " and " Dancing King " each be allocated relevance score
" 0.8 ", the connectivity of this reflection entity and present search query " Band-A ".In some implementations, database in session
116 can also store the other information associated with search sessions, the query pattern received such as identified or search meeting
Talk about search history.
As shown in Figure 1B, during operation (C), i.e., during identical search sessions, query engine front end 110 can connect
Receive the request to the search inquiry of suggestion.For example, user can be for example by clicking on search inquiry input field " | ", in client
Start new search inquiry at end equipment 102, and can be received by query engine front end 110 to new inquiry request coding
Data.In some implementations, query engine front end 110 by one or more networks or can pass through one or more
Individual other are wirelessly or non-wirelessly connected to receive the data to new inquiry request coding.Query engine front end 110 can will be to newly looking into
The data of inquiry request coding, which are sent to, is automatically performed maker 120.
In operation (D), being automatically performed maker 120 can receive from query engine front end 110 to new inquiry request coding
Data.During operation (E), be automatically performed maker 120 can access be stored in information in session in database 116 with
And the information in pattern database 112 and entity data bak 114 is stored in, to generate the search inquiry of suggestion.It is for example, automatic
Completing maker 120 can be to select query pattern in slave pattern database 112, such as " song lyrics ", and in session
One or more search inquiry (examples from buffer 118, with being received during search sessions are identified in interior database 116
Such as " Band-A ") associated entity, to generate the search inquiry of suggestion.Life has been described in further detail as below with reference to Fig. 2
Query pattern and identification entity are selected into the search inquiry of suggestion.
During operation (F), it is automatically performed maker 120 and can be provided to client device 102 and one or more is built
The data that the search inquiry 124 of view encodes, for being presented in user interface 122.For example, as shown in Figure 1B, based on searching
One or more inquiries that rope ession for telecommunication receives, such as search inquiry " Band-A ", it is automatically performed maker 120 and provides and build
Search inquiry " Dancing King lyrics " and " Member#1birthday " of view.
As shown in Figure 1 C, during operation (G), query engine front end 110 can receive the search inquiry for suggestion
Request, for example, being automatically performed request.For example, as shown in Figure 1 C, user can submit part searches to look into client device 102
Ask, such as " D |, ", i.e. include the searching request of one or more characters, and can be received by query engine front end 110 pair
The data of partial search query coding.In some implementations, query engine front end 110 can pass through one or more nets
Network or by other one or more wired or wireless connections, receives the data to partial search query coding.Before query engine
End 110 can be automatically performed maker 120 by being sent to the data that partial search query encodes.
In operation (H), being automatically performed maker 120 can receive from query engine front end 110 to partial search query volume
The data of code.During operation (I), the information being stored in session in database 116 can be accessed by being automatically performed maker 120
And the information in pattern database 112 and entity data bak 114 is stored in, it is automatic complete so as to generating portion search inquiry
Into.For example, the one of partial search query and the query pattern in pattern database 112 can be determined by being automatically performed maker 120
Part matches and selects query pattern.In addition, it is automatically performed the buffer that maker 120 can be out of session in database 116
The 138 identifications entity associated with the one or more search inquiries (such as " Band-A ") received during search sessions, with
Just generation is automatically performed.In this example, buffer 138 includes the entity " David ' s with relevance score 0.5
Donuts ", this may be had been received by during being reflected in search sessions with " inquiry relevant David ' s Donuts ", either
The inquiry that user is likely to be received.Selection query pattern is more fully described below with reference to Fig. 2 and identifies in nearest context
In meet the entity of the pattern and be automatically performed with generating search inquiry.
During operation (J), it is automatically performed maker 120 and can be provided to client device 102 and one or more is built
The data that the search inquiry 134 of view encodes, for being presented in user interface 132.For example, as shown in Figure 1 C, based on searching
One or more inquiries that rope ession for telecommunication receives, for example, search inquiry " Band-A " and partial search query " D |, ", it is automatically complete
Search inquiry " Dancing King lyrics " and " the Directions to of suggestion are provided into maker 120
Stockholm " (wherein it is assumed that band " Band-A " comes from Stockholm).In some implementations, it is proposed that search look into
Inquiry may include the suggestion related to the entity beyond the search inquiry received recently.Such as, it is proposed that search inquiry 134 also include
" David's Donuts ", that reflects user may the time of some during search sessions input with " David's " and/or
" Donuts " relevant search inquiry.
Fig. 2 shows the instantiation procedure 200 for providing the search inquiry suggested based on one or more terms.
For example, process 200 can be performed by system 100 in response to receiving the request to the search inquiry of suggestion.
In step 202, the request of the search inquiry for suggestion is received.Request is received during search sessions.One
In a little implementations, the request for the search inquiry of suggestion includes partial search query, and it includes one of user's input again
Or multiple characters.For example, the request for the search inquiry of suggestion can include term " weather in | ".In other realizations
In mode, the request for the search inquiry of suggestion can not include any character of user's input.For example, input one in user
Before individual or multiple characters, by being clicked in search inquiry input frame, the request for the search inquiry of suggestion can include
User has begun to the instruction of new search inquiry.
In step 204, the request in response to receiving the search inquiry for suggestion, select to look into from query pattern database
Inquiry pattern.The query pattern that query pattern database purchase has extracted from search query log.For example, it can be looked into from search
Ask in daily record (search history for including user) and query pattern is extracted with off-line operation.Query pattern can include can be with some
One or more placeholder terms of type identification.For example, " flights to city " include using place or position query pattern
Put placeholder term " the $ city " of identification.As another example, " $ song lyrics $ bandname " include can for query pattern
With respectively with song and band's title come the placeholder term " song " identified and " bandname ".
Above with reference to as described in step 202, in some implementations, the request for the search inquiry of suggestion can wrap
Include partial search query.In this case, query pattern is selected to include from query pattern database：It is determined that part is searched
A part for query pattern of the rope inquiry with being stored in query pattern database matches, and selects to be stored in query pattern
Query pattern in database.For example, term " weather in can be included for the component requests of the search inquiry of suggestion
|”.In such a case, it is possible to determine partial search query " weather in | " and query pattern " weather in
A city " part matches.
In other implementations, query pattern is selected to include from query pattern database：Identification is in search meeting
The one or more nearest query patterns inputted during words, it is determined that one or more of nearest query pattern identified with
Predetermined entity list is related, and selection is confirmed as the query pattern related to the predetermined entity list.For example, it can know
Not during search sessions user recently may input inquiry pattern one or more examples, such as " $ song1 lyrics $
Bandname ", it is followed with " $ song2 lyrics $ bandname ".In this case, it may be determined that nearest inquiry
Pattern is related to the continuous song in band special edition, and can select to be confirmed as and the list of songs in band's special edition
Related query pattern.
In some implementations, the list of entities that predetermined list of entities is ordered into.For example, as described in above-mentioned paragraph,
Predetermined list of entities can be the list of the song in band's special edition.In this case, it is determined that the nearest inquiry identified
One or more of pattern is related to predetermined list of entities to be may include：Determine one or more of identified to look into recently
Inquiry pattern is related to the project of the order in list of entities.
In other implementations, predetermined list of entities is unordered list of entities.For example, predetermined list of entities can
With the list for being the actor or actress that occur in film or European list of countries.In this case, it is determined that being known
One or more of other nearest query pattern is related to predetermined list of entities to be may include：Determine one or more of
The nearest query pattern identified is related to the project in list of entities.
In step 206, in response to receiving the request to the search inquiry of suggestion, identification during search sessions with receiving
The associated entity of one or more search inquiries.In some implementations, can identify by being received during search sessions
One or more search inquiries cited in entity sets.For as the entity sets cited in one or more search inquiries
In each entity, related to the entity one or more extension entities can be identified, and the entity sets can be expanded
