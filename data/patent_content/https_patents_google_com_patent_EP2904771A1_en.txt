- the analyzing in block 608 may be performed responsive to receiving 606 the product identification request or may be performed automatically or autonomously.
- the method 600 continues by determining 610 product data for the purchasable product and transmitting 612 the product data to one or more users of the video communication session (e.g., the first user).
- the product data is determined 610 based on the analyzing 608.
- the method 600 determines 610 the product data by retrieving it from a product database using an object detected by the analyzing.
- the product data can include information describing a location of the purchasable product within the video communication session stream and/or attribute information describing the purchasable product.
- the method 600 then transmits 612 the product data to the first user, and responsive there to, the method 600 receives 614 a product selection from the first user selecting the purchasable product.
- the video communication engine 124 may transmit product data to the client device 106 of the first user 1 14, the client application 108 may identify the purchasable product to the first user 114 based on the product data, the first user 1 14 may provide input selecting to compare prices for the purchasable product via the client application 108, and the client application may instruct the client device 106 to transmit the selection to the video communication engine 124 for processing.
- the method 600 may transmit the product data to some or all participants of the video communication session.
- a seller/user participating in the video communication session may request identification of one or more products included in the video communication session on behalf of one or more of the other participants and the method 600 may provide the product data determined responsive thereto to the one or more other participants for presentation and receive a product selection from the one or more other participants responsive thereto.
- the method 600 enables 616 the purchase of the selected product.
- the video communication engine 124 may provide comparison shopping functionality to the first user or one or more other users participating in the session, sell the product to the user(s) and place an order for it, redirect the user(s) to a seller/vendor of the product, and the like.
- Figure 7 is a graphic representation of an example user interface 700 for displaying a video communication session stream to a user highlighting a product and providing for purchase of the product.
- the user interface 700 illustrated in Figure 7 is provided merely by way of example, and that numerous other user interfaces may be generated and displayed by the client application 108 to allow user to engage in video communication sessions, research, view, and purchase products, interact with others on the social network, etc.
