- the data may comprise any information sufficient to identify the relevant information, such as numbers, descriptive text, proprietary codes, references to data stored in other areas of the same memory or different memories (including other network locations) or information that is used by a function to calculate the relevant data.
- the processor 204 may be any suitable processor, such as various commercially available general purpose processors. Alternatively, the processor 204 may be a dedicated controller such as an application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”).
- ASIC application-specific integrated circuit
- FIG. 2 functionally illustrates the processor and memory as being within a single block, it should be understood that the processor 204 and memory 202 may actually comprise multiple processors and memories that may or may not be stored within the same physical housing. Accordingly, references to a processor, computer or memory will be understood to include references to a collection of processors, computers or memories that may or may not operate in parallel.
- the computing device 200 may be at one node of a network and be operative to directly and indirectly communicates with other nodes of the network.
- the computing device 200 may comprise a web server that is operative to communicate with client devices via the network such that the computing device 200 uses the network to transmit and display information to a user on a display of the client device.

- the browser 206 may further comprise a prerendered web page 218 .
- the prerendered web page 218 represents a web page that was requested and accessed by the prerender module 210 in response to a predicted navigation event provided by the navigation prediction module 208 .
- the prerendered web page 218 may be stored in a hidden rendering environment such that the prerendered web page 218 is not visible to a user until the user selects a navigation link with which the prerendered web page 218 is associated.
- the hidden rendering environment refers to any representation that does not have an immediately apparent interface for the user.
- the prerendered web page 218 may be stored within a browser “tab” that does not have an associated selection control in a web browser tab interface.
- the hidden rendering environment may be accessible via a menu or interface command, and in response to the selection of this interface command an interface for the prerendered content is generated, such as by adding a selection control for the prerendered content to the browser tab interface.
- the hidden rendering environment may also be provided by a variety of other methods suitable to receive and render the page environment while avoiding distraction of the user with potentially irrelevant content.
- the prerendered web page 208 may be stored in a completely executed and rendered format. For example, any executable code, scripting language, multimedia files, and/or interactive objects may be fully requested and loaded in the prerendering environment.

- the web page request generated by the prerender module 210 is identical to a standard web page request.
- the web page request generated by the prerender module 210 comprises certain features to facilitate the prerender process as described further below (see FIGS. 3-7 ).
- the computing device 200 may determine a likely navigation event using a client navigation history, such as the client navigation history 212 .
- the client navigation history 212 comprises a set of navigation events associated with past activity of the browser 206 .
- the client navigation history 212 may track a set of visited URLs, also known as a “clickstream,” which tracks an order in which the user typically visits URLs (e.g., when the user visits a news website, they tend to next select a URL corresponding to the top story of the day), a set of access times associated with the URLs, and the like.
- the aggregate navigation history 214 may comprise similar data, but keyed to multiple users rather than a single user.
- the client navigation history 212 and aggregate navigation history 214 may represent data collected using one or more browser add-ons, scripts, or toolbars.

- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 300 for prerendering a web page in accordance with aspects of the disclosure. Aspects of the method 300 operate to minimize load times for network content by requesting the network content prior to the user navigating to said network content.
- the method 300 may be performed by a computing device, such as the computing device 200 , to eliminate delays in the user web browsing experience by prerendering web pages that are identified as likely navigation targets by the user.
- the method 300 may be performed by elements of the browser 206 , the navigation prediction module 208 , and the prerender module 210 acting together.
- the method 300 may also be performed by the server 104 , or any device with hardware and/or software designed to accept instructions.
- Example aspects of the method 300 as described relate to prerendering of a single page associated with a single navigation event, but the method 300 is also broadly applicable to prerendering multiple pages associated with one or more navigation events, such as prerendering multiple pages in sequence or in a plurality of parallel prerendering instances.
- the computing device 200 determines a next navigation event within a web browser.
- the next navigation event may be received from a navigation prediction element, such as the navigation prediction module 208 , or the next navigation event may be embedded within the web page displaying within the web browser.
- a search engine may embed a tag within a set of search results to indicate that a particular link associated with the most relevant result should be prerendered by the web browser. A method for embedding prerendering tags within a web page is described below (see FIG. 4 ).
- the computing device 200 requests the content associated with the navigation event identified at stage 302 .
- the request may comprise a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) GET request, a file transfer protocol (FTP) request, or any other network data access request as known in the art.
- HTTP hypertext transfer protocol
- FTP file transfer protocol
- a first set of web content may be provided in response to a HTTP GET request, which may then lead to additional HTTP GET requests in accordance with the first set of web content.
- a HTTP GET request may result in a base web page being sent to the web browser, which may trigger other page loading operations, such as additional GET requests.
- the base web page may have multiple embedded images, which are then fetched and rendered using HTTP GET requests for each image.
- the prerendering process as described may request the full web page, including associated scripts, and then execute those scripts.
- the web content associated with the navigation event is sent to the web browser.
- the remote server 104 may send the content to the web browser.
- the computing device 200 upon receiving a web page with an embedded prerender tag, the computing device 200 requests and renders the web page associated with the URL associated with the top search result as identified by the search engine.
- the computing device 200 renders content associated with the navigation event determined at stage 302 .
- the content may be rendered in an alternate instance of the web browser that is hidden from the user.
- the content may be rendered by an alternate process or in a hidden web browser tab.
- the computing device 200 may render content associated with multiple navigation events.
- the navigation events may be associated with a priority value, with higher or lower values associated with more likely navigation events.
- the computing device 200 may render the top “n” most likely events, depending upon the capabilities of the computing device 200 (see FIG. 7 ).
- the rendered content may include a redirection operation.
- a redirection operation is when the act of loading a first page, for instance, www.a.com, causes the browser to load a second page, such as www.b.com. Redirection may occur in response to a HTML tag, a JAVASCRIPT navigation command, or the like. In the case a prerendered page requests a redirection operation, said redirection operation would also occur in the alternate instance.
- a first redirection operation may lead to subsequent redirections.
- www.a.com may lead to www.b.com, which leads to www.c.com.
- aspects of the system and method may account for this fact, such as by storing a history of redirection operations and prerendering the last page in a series in response to a first page being identified to prerender.
- the method 300 may short-circuit redirection operations by not prerendering intermediate pages when the destination result page (i.e. the page at the end of the redirection operations) is known, and only prerendering the final page in the series.
- the computing device 200 may determine whether the user has selected the link identified at stage 302 within a particular time period. For example, the method 300 may wait for 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, one minute, 5 minutes, or any other time frame.
- the time frame may be configurable within an options menu associated with the web browser.
- the time frame may also be specified by the server 104 .
- the server 104 may embed a timeout value within a prerender tag, indicating the length of time the content associated with the tag should be held before being discarded. If the user has selected the link within the time period, the method 300 proceeds to stage 312 . Otherwise, the method 300 proceeds to stage 310 .
- the computing device 200 discards the prerendered content.
- the prerendered content is allowed to expire in this manner in order to free up system resources associated with the prerender operation and prevent the user from being presented with stale data.
- a different expiration period may be specified for different types of data. For example, data that is likely to rapidly change, such as breaking news articles, stock quotes, syndication feeds, and the like, is more likely to grow stale quickly, and might be associated with a shorter expiration timer, such as 10 seconds, 20 seconds, or one minute.
- the wait time is based on a page type. For example, if the user is viewing a lengthy news article, a longer wait time may be specified when prerendering a next page of the article to provide the user time to read the current page of the article before selecting the next page.
- the wait time is determined by a time-to-live (TTL) parameter embedded within the page.
- TTL time-to-live
- the wait time is hard coded within the browser.
- the computing device 200 swaps the alternate instance containing the prerendered content into the current user instance, in response to the user selecting the navigation event determined at stage 302 .
- the computing device 200 displays the content associated with the navigation event instantly, without a delay while the data is requested from and received from the host server.
- the computing device 200 may select the navigation event prior to the prerendering operation completing. In such cases, the partially loaded page would be swapped into the current user instance. The partially loaded page would then continue to load in the current user instance as normal.
- the method 300 then ends after making the prerendered content available to the user.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 400 for indicating a navigation event to prerender.
- the server hosting the content such as the server 104
- the server 104 may embed a prerender tag or tags within a hosted page, instructing the prerender module 210 of the computing device 200 in which content to render.
- the server 104 identifies one or more links within a hosted web page. For example, the server 104 may generate a list of web sites in response to a query from the computing device 200 . Each search result may be associated with a particular link on the page that is to be provided in response to the query.
- the server 104 selects one or more links to prerender, chosen from the links identified at stage 402 .
- the links to prerender may be chosen by a variety of methods for a variety of purposes, such as by examining a user navigation history, an aggregate navigation history, a most relevant link, and the like.
- the links are chosen by a search engine analyzing the links most frequently clicked in response to a particular query. For example, the search engine may collect “click-through” data indicating which links are clicked on in response to a particular query, and select one or more links to prerender based upon the frequency with which the particular links are selected.
- the server 104 might identify the top search result, or the top “n” search results as optimal links to prerender.
- the server 104 may further identify a ranking of links to prerender, with the most optimal link to prerender being ranked number 1, the next most optimal link being ranked number 2, and so on.
- the server 104 may also identify a likelihood that each link will be selected, rather than a rank. For example, the server 104 may indicate that a particular link has a 50% likelihood, a 25% likelihood, or a 80% likelihood of being selected by a user.
- Prerender operations performed by the client may elect to prerender links associated with a threshold level of likelihood, for example, such as at least 50% likelihood, at least 80% likelihood, or any other threshold value.
- the server 104 embeds one or more prerender tags with the one or more links identified at stage 404 .
- the server 104 may include a hypertext markup language (HTML) tag for identifying the optimal link or links to prerender.
- the prerender tag may also include a ranking value and a TTL value specifying a time to keep the prerender.
- the server 104 may identify each search result with a prerender tag, along with ranking the prerender order of the results by the relevance of the search result.
- the page with the embedded prerender tags is sent to the client that requested the page.
- the method 400 then ends after sending the page.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 500 for managing web impression statistics during a prerender operation in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- Web sites often track what content is viewed, which pages are accessed, in what order those pages are accessed, and how much time is spent on each page. These capture and analysis of such data is broadly referred to as “website analytics”. These statistics provide data that may be used by site operators for a variety of purposes. For example, one such use of this data is to calculate rates for advertisements displayed along with the content. However, in some instances, the user may not select the navigation event associated with prerendered content, thus possible interfering with collection of this data.
- the server such as the server 104
- One such method is described below. Although specific examples of the method may be provided with respect to managing impression statistics of advertisement content, it should be appreciated that aspects of the method are broadly applicable to ensuring accurate website analytics for pages served in response to prerender requests.
- the server 104 receives a prerender request from a computing device, such as the computing device 200 .
- the prerender request may be identified using a scripting application programming interface (API), such as by the computing device 200 indicating the content request is for a prerender operation via a JAVASCRIPT API transmitted with the content request.
- API application programming interface
- the prerender request may also be accompanied by a modified HTTP header, indicating that the request is a prerender request.
- the server 104 is configured to receive an event notification from the computing device 200 as provided by the API, such as by registering for the event notification using an application executing on the server 104 .
- the server 104 may elect to not send content in response to a prerender request, such as in instances where the server is bandwidth constrained, or otherwise does not wish to allow prerendering. Providing notification of the prerender request in this manner also allows for the server 104 to “opt-out” of processing the prerender request.
- the server 104 may be bandwidth constrained and thus need to focus on hosting non-prerendered content.
- the server 104 may also opt-out by including a HTML metatag indicating as such, or an entry in a “robots.txt” file hosted on the server to prevent prerendering of content by a search engine, such as indicated in a list of search results.
- the server 104 may send a partial web page, with the certain content redacted.
- the server 104 may not provide images associated with advertisement content in response to a prerender request, as in many instances advertisement impressions are determined based upon the number of times the advertisement image is sent.
- a similar method may apply to advertisements provided in other manners, such as via scripting or executable content.
- the server 104 might respond to a prerender request by providing a base web page.
- the base web page may result in the computing device 200 initiating one or more additional HTTP GET requests for content identified by the base web page.
- the server 104 may opt not to send content in response to HTTP GET requests for ad images identified within the base web page.
- the redacted version of the content may include a special HTTP error codes associated with redacted images, scripts, and the like, indicating to the receiving computing device that certain content has been redacted.
- the computing device 200 may be informed that certain content has been redacted and will be supplied later, rather than that the content is unavailable.
- the computing device 200 may opt to indicate redacted content with a particular graphic or temporary display while the content loads upon access, or the redacted content may appear blank.
- the computing device 200 may not be aware of how to properly display redacted content, in which case the computing device 200 may abort the prerender operation. Furthermore, when the user accesses the content, the computing device 200 may notify the server 104 that the prerendered page has been viewed. In response, the server 104 may send the redacted content to the computing device 200 .
- the server 104 receives confirmation that the prerender of the content was viewed by the user.
- the server 104 may be notified of the viewing of the content via an API provided through the web browser.
- a script may communicate an event notification to the server 104 . If the server 104 is registered for such an event notification, it may take appropriate action, such as sending the redacted content to the computing device 200 .
- the server 104 By informing the server 104 that the prerender content was viewed, the server 104 knows to send any redacted content and update the impression statistics associated with any advertisements.
- the server 104 sends the content that was redacted at stage 504 .
- the content can now be sent because the server 104 has ensured that the user has accessed the content.
- the server 104 may send images associated with advertisements, scripting code, or the like.
- the server 104 updates the impression statistics associated with the content as sent at stage 508 .
- stages 508 and 510 occur simultaneously as the act of hosting the image/sending an advertisement automatically updates the page impression statistics. In this manner the server 104 maintains accurate reporting of website analytics data while also allowing the computing device 200 to perform prerender operations.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 600 for managing a prerender operation in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the computing device 200 can account for different factors that may affect the browsing experience. For example, web pages commonly use small files known as cookies to provide various page services via the web browser.
- a news site may employ a tracking cookie to allow a user to access one news article per day without registering on the page. A prerender operation associated with that news site could then interfere with the user's browsing experience, as the user may prerender an article he does not intend to read, thus using up the one free article per day on a page he has not viewed.
- Some web pages have embedded audio or video content that begins to play as soon as the page loads.
- the prerender method and system as described herein can allow such content to begin playing before the user navigates to the content, thus when the user begins viewing the page, the content is already playing.
- Some web pages may include additional content that might not be suitable for prerendering, such as pop-up pages, scripted programs, downloads, authentication prompts, translation bars, and the like.
- the prerender module 210 may employ a method, such as the method 600 , for managing these special cases.
- the computing device 200 requests and receives prerender content from a server, such as the server 104 .
- the request may be presented in or accompanied by an API call, indicating to the server that the request is a prerender request.
- the page is prerendered based on a response received from the server.
- the computing device 200 monitors for several particular cases as described below. Although presented in a particular order, these cases could be encountered in any order, such as by identifying an embedded video prior to experiencing a cookie state change, for example.
- the computing device 200 determines whether the requested prerender content includes a cookie state change or another special case. For example, if a user is accessing a banking web page, if an account page is prerendered and then the user logs out of their account, selecting the prerender link would incorrectly report data as if the user was still logged in. As such, the prerender would be invalid as soon as the user has logged out.
- the computing device 200 therefore monitors the state of any cookies associated with prerender content and may take appropriate action. Appropriate action may include attempting to properly propagate cookie state changes, ignoring cookie state changes and continuing with the prerender operation, or giving up and aborting the prerender operation.
- the computing device 200 further determines if the prerender content includes a special case, such as a pop-up page, a scripted application, a download, an authentication menu, or a translation bar. If a cookie state change has occurred or the prerender page includes a special case, the method proceeds to stage 608 . Otherwise the method 600 continues to stage 606 .
- a special case such as a pop-up page, a scripted application, a download, an authentication menu, or a translation bar.
- the computing device 200 may abort the prerender operation.
- the computing device 200 may abort the prerender operation because the cookie state change or special case identified at stage 604 makes the data associated with the prerendered page stale or otherwise unviewable to the user. In some aspects, the computing device 200 may ignore the cookie state change. The method 600 then ends.
- the computing device 200 may track any cookie state change associated with the prerendered content, and apply the state change when the prerendered content is accessed by the user.
- the computing device 200 may also monitor for conflicts in cookie state change, and abort the prerendering operation in the event of a conflict. For example, a cookie state change may occur after the prerender operation is complete, thus causing a conflict. In such a case, the prerendered version of the page could be discarded to avoid presenting incorrect page data to the user.
- the computing device 200 determines whether there is multimedia content on the page, such as audio or video.
- the page may include an embedded video programmed with ADOBE FLASH, HTML5 media, or another type of embedded media. In such a situation, it may be desirable to pause the multimedia until the user actually navigates to the page, thus saving bandwidth and ensuring the user may view the entire multimedia file. If the page contains embedded multimedia, the method 600 proceeds to stage 612 . Otherwise the method 600 proceeds to stage 610 .
- the computing device 200 has determined that the content contains no multimedia content, cookie state changes, or special cases, and thus the computing device 200 prerenders the page.
- the prerendering process may be performed by receiving the page from the server 104 , and rendering the page in an application instance that is hidden from the user. Rendering the page generally relates to loading all of the data received from the server 104 , and executing any instructions contained therein, as they would otherwise be executed when viewing the page in a non-hidden application instance.
- the computing device 200 has determined that the content contains multimedia content.
- the computing device 200 prerenders the content of the page other than the multimedia content, and may pause playback of the multimedia content, or defer the instantiation of a plug-in associated with the content.
- the computing device 200 might pause an embedded audio or video file after prerendering the rest of the page, or a FLASH video might not execute until the prerender content is shown to the user.
- the computing device 200 determines whether the user has accessed the prerendered content. If the user accesses the prerendered content, the content is displayed as described above, and the method 600 proceeds to stage 616 . If the user does not access the prerendered content, for example, if a prerender timer expires as described above with respect to FIG. 3 , then the method 600 ends.
- the computing device 200 sends notification that the user accessed the prerender to the server 104 .
- the notification may be sent using a scripted API from which the server is configured to receive event notifications. Providing notification in this manner allows for the management of website impressions by the server (see FIG. 5 ).
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 700 for configuring a prerender operation in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- Different computing devices may possess different capabilities, such as network bandwidth, system memory, and processor speed. As such, various devices may be able to support different prerender operations. A device with more capability may be able to support multiple prerender operations, or the prerendering of more complicated pages. As such, the method 700 provides for configuration of these prerender operations based upon the capabilities of the system.
- the computing device 200 conducts a measurement of system capabilities. For example, the computing device 200 may query the operating system for the amount of free system memory, the computing device 200 may request the processor speed from the basic input-output system (BIOS), or the computing device 200 may conduct a network speed test to determine free bandwidth.
- BIOS basic input-output system
- the computing device 200 determines a maximum number “n” prerenders based upon the capabilities as determined at stage 702 .
- the computing device 200 may determine a set of system requirements to support a single prerender instance. For example, a single prerender instance may require 10 percent processor utilization, 16 megabytes of system memory, at least 10 kilobytes/second of network bandwidth, or the like.
- the system requirements may also include multiple capabilities associated with different system components, such as each of a minimum memory requirement, a processor utilization, and a network bandwidth. These system requirements may be determined by measuring the system utilization of a single prerender instance executing on the client device 200 .
- the computing device 200 may determine that each prerender operation is likely to require the system processor while prerendering. Such processor use may be “bursty” in that the entire processor is needed when the page is first loading, with reduced processor need thereafter. In such cases, the computing device 200 may assign a lower processor priority to the prerender instance to ensure that prerendering of a page does not impact the user's browsing experience. In some aspects, the computing device 200 may monitor a system memory to determine a number of prerender instances. The computing device 200 may determine an amount of memory used by a prerender instance and then compare this amount to the total available memory capacity. In some aspects, the computing device 200 may reserve a particular amount of system memory for prerendering, and generate prerender instances until the reserved memory is filled.
- a maximum network bandwidth of the system is determined, and prerender instances are generated based on the percentage of available bandwidth.
- the computing device 200 may request a bandwidth measurement from a remote server to identify a local maximum bandwidth, and use the measurement to determine a prerender setting.
- the computing device 200 is configured to perform as many simultaneous prerenders as the system capabilities can support, as determined at stage 704 .
- the number of prerenders may be configurable by the user, such as in an options menu.
- stages of the illustrated methods are not intended to be limiting.
- the functionality of the methods can exist in a fewer or greater number of stages than what is shown and, even with the depicted methods, the particular order of events may be different from what is shown in the figures.
- the systems and methods described herein advantageously provide for an improved browsing experience. By prerendering the next navigation event, the system and methods minimize the amount of time users wait for network content to load.
- the various management and configuration methods provide for a robust experience that ensures accurate impression counts for advertisers hosting content.
