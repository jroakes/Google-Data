Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to inter-application communication, and more particularly, to inter-application communication between a mapping application and a ride service application.
- mapping applications provide the user with the ability to select the type of map information or features for viewing as well as to adjust the display of the digital map.
- mapping application providers offer application programming interfaces (APIs) for accessing map and navigation data to display digital maps and provide step-by-step navigation directions to a destination location.
- APIs application programming interfaces
- a ride service application may invoke a mapping application API to provide a digital map of a geographic area that includes a pick-up location for the user, a destination location, navigation directions for travelling to the destination location, etc.
- the mapping application invokes one or several ride service APIs to access ride service data from various ride service providers. For example, a user may request navigation directions within the mapping application to a destination location. The user may then select from several modes of transportation for travelling to the destination location, including a ride service mode. When the user selects the ride service mode, the mapping application may communicate with various ride service applications by invoking respective ride service APIs. The mapping application communicates with the ride service applications and/or ride service servers to retrieve indications of the types of ride services provided by each of the ride service providers.
- Types of ride services may include a carpooling ride service, where the ride service providers picks up additional passengers on the way to the user’s destination, a taxi service that does not pick up additional passengers on the way to user’s destination, a limo service that includes additional features within the vehicle, an extra-large vehicle service for picking up large groups of passengers, etc.
- the mapping application may also communicate with the ride service applications to retrieve price estimates for each type of ride service, wait times for each type of ride service, ride durations for each type of ride service, ride status information regarding the status of trip (e.g., waiting for the driver to accept the ride, waiting for the driver to arrive at the pick-up location, ride in progress, ride completed), a number of vehicles within a geographic area surrounding the user’s current location, etc.
- ride service applications do not need to be downloaded to the user’s client device and instead the mapping application invokes the respective ride service APIs to communicate with ride service servers.
- the user may then select a ride service provider and type of ride service directly from the mapping application to order transportation services to her destination location.
- a user may select from several candidate ride service providers within the mapping application without having to open each of the corresponding ride service applications for comparison and without leaving the mapping application.
- a user may identify pick-up locations and destination locations in an application that has built-in map functionality. For example, the user may view a three-dimensional street level view of the area around the pick-up location, so that the user may easily find the driver at the pick-up location.
- the mapping application may also provide recommendations on pick-up locations based on the context and location of the user as well as walking directions from the user’s current location to the pick-up location.

- the method includes providing an interactive digital map via a user interface, receiving, via the user interface, a request to obtain travel directions to a destination, and obtaining, from a third-party provider of a ride service, an indication of a ride from a pick-up location to a drop-off location to traverse at least a portion of the route.
- the method further includes receiving, from the third-party provider of the ride service, visualization information for rendering a visualization of the ride on the digital map, and generating the visualization of the ride on the digital map in accordance with the received visualization information.

- the method further includes, receiving the requested indications of the candidate rides, determining a ranking the candidate rides according to at least one of price and pick-up time, providing, on the digital map, a listing of the candidate rides in accordance with the determined ranking, and in response to one of the candidate rides being selected via the user interface, transmitting a request for the selected ride to the

- the mapping application may prompt the user to select a pick-up location.
- the mapping application provides a default pick-up location near the user’s current location and the user may adjust the pick-up location via user controls.
- the mapping application may provide a recommended pick-up location based on the user’s current location and context information. For example, in an area with several one-way streets, the mapping application may recommend a pick-up location at a street that allows drivers to travel in the direction of the destination location, so that the driver does not need to make unnecessary turns after picking up the user.
- the recommended pick-up location may be determined based on traffic to avoid streets with heavy traffic in order to minimize cost.
- the mapping application may invoke a ride service API corresponding to the selected ride service provider and provide rider identification information for the user, the requested pick-up location, and the type of ride service to the corresponding ride service application.
- the ride service application may then provide a ride identifier, an updated wait time, updated price estimate, updated ride duration, and driver identification information for display on the mapping application via the ride service API.
