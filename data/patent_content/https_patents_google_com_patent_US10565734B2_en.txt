Definitions
- the present document relates to various techniques for improving image capture from a high-resolution light guided image plane tiled array system leveraging dense fiber optic bundles.
- CMOS, CCD and other image acquisition technologies are traditionally manufactured based upon 2D, industrial and/or other traditionally (potentially) mass-produced consumer requirements. This results in the need for custom silicon, sensors, electronics, and the like for niche markets, including light-field and ultra-high-resolution image acquisition.
- sensor array density involves the package and electronics size of each imaging/sensor device. Generally, these packages represent more than half of the size of the active imaging area of the individual sensor. Thus, these sensors cannot be arrayed without causing large gaps between images produced by the sensors, or overly complex and problematic optical systems to compensate for the presence of these gaps. Further, this problem is exacerbated by the electronics requirements for the interface and processing boards required to capture or transmit the data to a storage device. These gaps present a challenge that has not been successfully addressed by prior art attempts to provide higher-resolution digital image capture.
- the system and method described herein provide an image capture device with a plurality of image sensors and a plurality of tapered fiber optic bundles.
- the tapered fiber optic bundles may convey light to the image sensors in a manner that minimizes or negates the effects of gaps between the image sensors.
- a complex architectural system in combination with a computational fiber artifact removal process can be used.
- a high performance data management and processing system can be implemented in support of such an architecture.
- Various calibration techniques may be performed on the individual image sensors before and after positioning of the microlens array.
- the described system can be used with state-of-the-art image processing techniques in order to achieve compelling high resolution still, video, and light-field content.
- an image capture system may include a plurality of image sensors arranged in a pattern such that gaps exist between adjacent image sensors of the plurality of image sensors. Each of the image sensors may be configured to capture sensor image data.
- the image capture system may also have a main lens configured to direct incoming light along an optical path, a microlens array positioned within the optical path, and a plurality of tapered fiber optic bundles. Each tapered fiber optic bundle may have a leading end positioned within the optical path, and a trailing end positioned proximate one of the image sensors. The leading end may have a larger cross-sectional area than the trailing end.
- sensor data from the image sensors may be combined to generate a single light-field image that is substantially unaffected by the gaps.
- some of the incoming light may be directed to a preview camera, which may generate a preview image representative of the single light-field image.
- the image capture device and/or the preview camera may be calibrated in various ways prior to image capture.
- the image sensor data may be transmitted to a plurality of servers for processing to generate the single light-field image.
- Various image processing steps may be applied to facilitate generation of the single light-field image.

- FIG. 2 is a perspective view depicting an example of a machine vision camera module, or module 200 , that may be used in an array configuration, according to one embodiment.
- the module 200 may have an active area 210 and packaging 220 .
- the module 200 has a relatively small form factor that may provide a favorable ratio of package-to-active-area sizing, as indicated by the exemplary width 230 of the active area and width 240 of the package.
- FIG. 3 is a front view of the module 200 of FIG. 2 , according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 3 depicts the width 230 and the width 240 to illustrate the footprint of the active area 210 and that of the packaging 220 , which may define a sensor enclosure around the active area 210 .
- FIG. 4A is a front view of multiple modules 200 stacked side-by-side, according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 4A illustrates the evident challenge of simply stacking sensors next to each other. The result of such stacking is the presence of gaps 400 between the active areas 210 of adjacent modules 200 .
- gaps 400 may cause the captured image to show corresponding discontinuities, and may also result in the inefficient capture of light, as some of the light received would not be captured by an active area 210 , but would instead impinge against the package 220 of one of the modules 200 .
- FIG. 4B is a side view depicting an example configuration in which modules 200 are arranged into a first array 450 and a second array 460 , including a beam splitter 470 , according to one embodiment.
- the first array 450 and the second array 460 may each be generally planar, with the planes angled at 90° relative to each other.
- the beam splitter 470 may be positioned to divide incoming light 480 into a first beam 490 directed toward the first array 450 and a second beam 495 directed toward the second array 460 .
- FIG. 5 is a front view depicting the arrangement of active areas 210 and packaging 220 that results from use of the beam splitter 470 as shown in FIG. 4B , according to one embodiment.
- the beam splitter 470 may increase the density of the active areas 210 receiving light by a factor of two.
- FIG. 5 illustrates the virtual imaging plane that would result, although the two planes would be separated on two or more separate axes. Gaps 500 still remain between the active areas 210 . Gaps 500 are smaller than the gap 400 of FIG. 4A , but may still cause the resulting image to have discontinuities.
- Additional beam splitters can be added, at the expense of light efficiency.
- approximately twelve to sixteen beam split image surfaces could be used, which could correspond to six to eight beam splitters, depending on mechanical configuration, to result in a virtually contiguous image surface.
- only approximately 10% of the available light would hit each pixel, which may have a detrimental effect on efficiency and image quality.
- the described system makes use of recent breakthroughs in fiber optic technologies that allow extremely dense fiber bundles to be manufactured efficiently and enable light to be rerouted and/or focused over the distance of the fiber bundle with more than 50% and, possibly even 80% or more, light transmission with very low image distortion.
- fiber optic technologies that allow extremely dense fiber bundles to be manufactured efficiently and enable light to be rerouted and/or focused over the distance of the fiber bundle with more than 50% and, possibly even 80% or more, light transmission with very low image distortion.
- compelling advances for light-field computational imaging may be achieved. Such advances may have particular utility for video applications.
- a fiber bundle manufacturing process can be used that allows for magnification or demagnification by stretching the fibers through a heat process, resulting in the ability to create an image plane at the ‘magnified’ end of a fiber bundle that is physically larger than the active area of a coupled image sensor at the opposite end of the fiber bundle.
- the image sensor may be directly mounted to the compressed and demagnified end of the fiber bundle.
- Each fiber can have a dimension smaller than the size of a pixel, resulting in a highly accurate averaging of light at the opposite end of the bundle, and further resulting in highly accurate light collection at the pixel level of the sensor.
- the demagnification process may maintain an exact fiber-for-fiber alignment between the fibers at the compressed side and at the unmodified side. In this manner, the image may be magnified or demagnified with a little warping but virtually no loss of content.
- the system is implemented by optically stitching the active area of each individual image sensor so as to scale each pixel to a ratio equivalent to the required increase in active area size that is large enough to meet or exceed the minimum dimensions of the packaging.
- the gaps caused by image sensor packaging may be negated so that multiple image sensors may cooperate to capture an image without any optical seams (within a predetermined tolerance) between each of the discrete image sensors.
- FIG. 6 is a perspective view depicting an example of an individual image sensor, or module 200 , with an active area 210 and packaging 220 , according to one embodiment.

- FIG. 7 is a front view depicting a 3 ⁇ 1 array of modules 200 and tapered fiber optic bundles 600 , according to one embodiment.
- the magnified end (i.e., the leading end 610 ) of each fiber optic bundle may have a width equal to or greater than the width 240 of the package 220 of each of the modules 200 .
- the leading ends 610 of the tapered fiber optic bundles 600 may cooperate to define a single, seamless surface at the image plane. As a result, the modules 200 may cooperate to capture a single, seamless image.
- FIG. 8A includes a side view of the module 200 and the tapered fiber optic bundle 600 of FIG. 6 , and front and rear views of the fiber optic bundle 600 in isolation, according to one embodiment.
- the dimensions and other values shown in FIG. 8 are merely exemplary.
- the “large end” may be the leading end 610 of the fiber optic bundle 600
- the “tapered end” may be the trailing end 620 .
- FIG. 8B is a table 850 illustrating exemplary parameters and specifications that may be used in the construction of a camera with multiple image sensors and fiber optic bundles, according to certain embodiments.
- the values shown in the table 850 are merely exemplary; many other configurations may be used within the scope of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 9 includes a side view and a front view, depicting exemplary arrangements of modules 200 and fiber optic bundles 600 , according to certain embodiments.
- a 3 ⁇ 1 configuration and a 3 ⁇ 2 configuration are illustrated. These particular configurations are merely exemplary; other configurations are possible to provide a wide variety of image resolutions and aspect ratios.
- a 5 ⁇ 11 configuration may be used in one alternative configuration (not shown).
- the example shown in FIG. 9 can be used to illustrate how the modules 200 can be effectively stitched by aligning the leading ends 610 of the corresponding fiber optic bundles 600 to provide a larger overall imaging plane.
- the systems and methods described herein may provide a way to use light-field customized dense fiber bundle technologies to couple multiple image sensors of existing types and sensor technologies together. These techniques may thus avoid problems with seams that may otherwise be present in the final image due to sensor package size and electronics footprint. Further, these techniques may avoid the limitations that can otherwise exist when light splitting is used to optically seam arrays together, which can reduce light transmission to a level that adds significant noise.
- the systems and methods described herein can improve data throughput capabilities for video applications so that they exceed the transmission capabilities of most commercially available interfaces.
- the ability to receive image data from multiple image sensors, in parallel, may provide such enhanced throughput rates.
- the system can thereby transfer and store data from array segments independently, in a manner that is beneficial and efficient from a manufacturing standpoint.
- the ability to stack professionally leveraged image sensors to form sensor arrays may allow for higher quality imaging without the need of custom silicon fabrication.
- the system can thereby avoid the need for a large imaging plane that could otherwise exceed full frame formats.
- the described system and method may provide the ability to mount commercially available image sensors, including dies, packaging, electronics, interfaces, and/or the like, at the compressed end of the fiber bundle element.
- image sensors including dies, packaging, electronics, interfaces, and/or the like
- Such an arrangement may provide a virtually unlimited pixel count as well as an extremely large and seamless highly efficient imaging plane through the use of an array of fiber optic bundles and sensors, as described previously. No custom image sensor fabrication is required.
- the cost of materials for the fiber optic bundles may be very low. Process costs can be reduced by constructing a dedicated manufacturing pipeline and process by which tapered fiber optic bundles can be rapidly and inexpensively manufactured.
- Various embodiments include additional enhancements.
- One such enhancement relates to the fact that light may exit a tapered fiber optic bundle with an increased angle, relative to the angle at which the light entered the tapered fiber optic bundle.
- the ratio of exit angle to entry angle may be proportional to the ratio of magnification provided by the tapered fiber optic bundle. For example, if light enters the fiber at an angle of 10 degrees relative to the axis of the fiber, and the magnification of the fiber is approximately 3:1, the angle of exit will be approximately 30 degrees.
- FIG. 10 is a side view depicting a single fiber 1000 within a tapered fiber optic bundle, such as the fiber optic bundle 600 of FIG. 6 .
- the angles at which the light reflects within the interior of the fiber 1000 provide an angle of exit 1020 that is approximately three times an angle of entry 1010 , demonstrating how light exits at a potentially increased exit angle.
- the angle of entry 1010 and the angle of exit 1020 are exaggerated in FIG. 10 to illustrate the change.
- the system redirects light entering the camera such that the light impinges on the active area of each image sensor at an angle that optimizes the light collection efficiency of the system.
- Various aspects of the camera such as the length and magnification of the tapered fiber optic bundles, may be configured in a manner that optimizes the light collection efficiency.
- the active area of one or more of each image sensor may not be square.
- the magnification of each of the tapered fiber optic bundles may be limited to have a magnified dimension that is greater than or equal to the largest mechanical dimension for the larger active sensor area dimension. For example, if the packaging of each module is 60 mm ⁇ 60 mm, and the sensor is 20 mm ⁇ 15 mm, the magnified end (i.e., the leading end) of the optical fiber bundle may be configured to be at least 60 mm, resulting in an approximate magnification factor of 3 ⁇ , and an imaging area of approximately 60 mm ⁇ 45 mm.
- the imaging area can be split multiple times to allow for decreased magnification factors per tapered fiber optic bundle, at the expense of decreased light transmission and increased overall system size, but with decreased angular magnification of each fiber.
- each fiber optic bundle there are two ends of each fiber optic bundle: a large, leading end (magnified, used at the imaging plane) and a small, trailing end (minimized, used at the sensor).
- the leading end of the tapered fiber optic bundle is magnified so that its minimum dimension is at least as large as the maximum dimension of the packaging of the corresponding image sensor. In this manner, when incorporating the packaging behind the tapered fiber optic bundle, there is more than sufficient mechanical spacing without the need to stagger the fiber optic bundles and/or the image sensors to increase density.
- each module is 60 mm ⁇ 60 mm
- the sensor is 20 mm ⁇ 15 mm.
- a magnification factor of 4 may be applied, so that the smallest dimension of the sensor (15 mm) is magnified to include the maximum dimension of the enclosure (60 mm).
- the aspect ratio is preserved, so that the leading end of the tapered fiber optic bundle is 80 mm ⁇ 60 mm in size.
- each fiber optic bundle can be about 80 mm ⁇ 60 mm, resulting in the ability to stitch all packaging without any staggering or beam splitters (or the like), at the expense of an increased taper in the fiber optic bundles, and thus a larger overall imaging plane.
- FIG. 11 includes front, top, and side views depicting an array of image sensors, or modules 200 , and tapered fiber optic bundles, or fiber optic bundles 600 , according to one embodiment.
- the leading end 610 of each tapered fiber optic bundle 600 may be wider than the width 240 , the largest side of the packaging 220 of the corresponding module 200 . This may result in increased magnification and imaging area without the need to stagger the electronics. Such an approach may facilitate the use of a beam splitter (or multiple beam splitters, depending on the system configuration) and configuration of each of the rows of modules 200 into two aligned imaging planes.
- the top view illustrates the presence of gaps 1100 between the modules 200 . In the side view, the modules 200 may be positioned to abut each other such that no gaps are present.
- FIG. 12 includes a side view and a front view depicting a configuration that uses a beam splitter in conjunction with modules 200 that receive light through tapered fiber optic bundles, or fiber optic bundles, 600 , according to one embodiment.
- the left side of the FIG. 12 depicts a side view, wherein the design for the beam splitter 470 can be seen dividing the optical path into a first plane 1210 and a second plane 1220 , allowing for additional package spacing.
- the right side of the FIG. 12 depicts a front view, wherein the rows of the modules 200 can be seen; the virtual imaging plane that results from the combination of the top and bottom paths intersecting with one another may result in a contiguous imaging surface.
- Any suitable arrangement can be used that allows for increased electronics dimensions through the use of scaled pixels with tapered fiber optic bundles, including for example a horizontal arrangement, a vertical arrangement, a checkerboard arrangement, and/or the like.
- Use of the beam splitter 470 may allow further increased resolution by capturing light at surfaces displaced from each other by 90° (or in alternative embodiments, a different angle). Some light transmission may be sacrificed due to the fact that each surface may only receive about half of the incoming light received through the aperture. However, greater mechanical configuration flexibility may be obtained by rotation of the planes.
- any other optical method can be used for directing light in multiple optical paths.
- reference herein to a “beam splitter” can be considered to include any such alternatives, including for example, but not limited to, polarizers, birefringent materials, prisms, various optical coatings, mirrors, and/or the like.

- FIG. 15 is a perspective view depicting how the first plane 1210 and the second plane 1220 may be aligned with each other, according to one embodiment.
- the columns 1300 of the first plane 1210 may be staggered relative to the columns 1400 of the second plane 1220 , such that the light received by the modules 200 of the second plane 1220 negates the gaps 1310 between the columns 1300 , and the light received by the modules of the first plane 1210 negates the gaps 1410 between the columns 1400 .
- FIG. 16 is a side view depicting an example configuration of tapered fiber optic bundles, or fiber optic bundles 600 , that may be used to direct light to image sensors (not shown), according to another embodiment.

- the various values and numerical labels in FIG. 17 are merely exemplary; other dimensions and numbers of modules 200 and fiber optic bundles 600 may be used.
- configurations may provide additional benefits.
- such configurations may allow for a spherically curved imaging plane without the requirement of trapezoidal fiber customizations, as discussed in more detail below.
- these configurations provide the ability to orient each row or column independently, and/or to install custom rows and/or columns of the microlens array in strips without seams when viewed as the virtual complete sensor.
- these configurations may facilitate improved mechanical design.
- FIG. 18 is a front view depicting an example of strips 1800 for mounting micro lens optics to the rows or columns of fiber optic bundles and sensors, according to one embodiment.
- the microlens array may be positioned in any of various locations, including but not limited to between the module 200 and the fiber optic bundle 600 , and between the main lens 1600 and the fiber optic bundle 600 .
- the microlens array may be divided into strips 1800 and secured to the fiber optic bundles 600 and/or modules 200 of the columns, as shown in FIG. 18 , providing additional mechanical clearance for other adjustments and design.
- a multi-length face plate approach may be employed. By mounting two or more faceplates with offsets between them, or by incorporating fiber tapers at different lengths, and staggering at a minimum of every other row and/or column, it is possible to allow for increased package size with increased sensor density, while gaining increased light transmission efficiency by eliminating additional beam splitter paths.
- FIG. 19 is a top view depicting an example of a multi-length tapered fiber optic bundle solution, according to one embodiment.
- the mechanical spacing required along X and Y may decrease to the minimum dimension of the packaging 220 of each module 200 . This may achieve a continuous imaging plane without the necessity of a beam splitter.
- a A fiber optic faceplate may be used to attach each camera module to each tapered fiber optic bundle 600 , where one side of the faceplate is bonded to the small trailing end of the tapered fiber optic bundle, and the other side of the faceplate is bonded to the sensor module.
- a continuous imaging plane may be achieved by using an arrangement of equal-length tapers with staggered face plate lengths, staggered-length tapers with equal-length faceplates, or a combination of staggered taper lengths and staggered face place lengths.
- there are two ends of each tapered fiber optic bundle, or fiber optic bundle 600 a large, leading end 610 (magnified, used at the imaging plane) and a small, trailing end 620 (minimized, used at the module).
- the leading end 610 of the fiber optic bundle 600 is magnified so that the largest dimension of the leading end 610 is at least as large as the maximum dimension of the packaging 220 of the module 200 .
- each module 200 is 60 mm ⁇ 60 mm, and the active area 210 is 20 mm ⁇ 15 mm.
- a magnification factor of 3 is applied, so that the largest dimension of the active area 210 (20 mm) is magnified to include the maximum dimension of the packaging 220 (60 mm).
- the aspect ratio is preserved, so that the resulting leading end 610 becomes 60 mm ⁇ 45 mm.
- the lengths of the faceplates/fiber optic bundles 600 are staggered to provide an overlap between the packaging 220 of the modules 200 .
- an overlap of 15 mm is provided in one dimension, with no overlap in the other dimension (since the large dimension of the leading end 610 is matched to the largest side of the packaging 220 ).
- Staggering the lengths of the fiber optic bundles 600 in this manner may provide increased mechanical density and decreased active imaging area. Further, such staggering may provide higher light transmission by enabling the use of a lower magnification ratio in the fiber optic bundles.
- Such a configuration may allow for any number of staggered tiers, given certain mechanical requirements to include two or more lengths. For example, in one embodiment, five to seven lengths can be provided for five to seven tiers of modules 200 that are staggered from each other.

- this arrangement may be constructed on a variable approach, where the ability to curve these tiles or return to a flat imaging plane is possible. This may allow the optical center of the main lens to drift depending on the requirements for focal length, focus, and/or calibration. This may result in a single axis exhibiting a cylindrical form (with step functions at each image sensor). Illumination and aberration may become more computationally intensive without a contiguous cylindrical surface.
- an additional fiber face plate is added with a single surface that matches the faceted function of the leading end 610 of each fiber optic bundle 600 , with a polished exterior surface. This design may eliminate the face plate. This surface may be directly polished in this configuration with each fiber optic bundle individually or as a whole mechanical apparatus.

- a polished fiber face plate surface may additionally or alternatively be fabricated by bonding the fiber surfaces together, and then directly polishing the surface into the desired cylindrical or spherical shape without orienting the centers of each respective leading end 610 to be perpendicular to the optical center.
- some hybrid of the two options can be used, blending the partially angled and partially polished approaches.
- FIG. 22B is a side view illustrating an arrangement of fiber optic bundles 2250 that have been bonded together and polished to provide a polished fiber face plate surface 2260 , according to one embodiment.
- the fiber face plate surface may thus be formed from the fibers of the fiber optic bundles 2250 , rather than from the attachment of an additional element to the fiber optic bundles 2250 .
- a cylindrical (stepped) approach is used, wherein an additional faceplate is added to a spherical imager in a stepped or smooth approach.
- the cylindrical (x axis) may remain stepped with either approach. This is beneficial as all shapes may remain linear, and thus may not require trapezoidal distortion.
- x and y can be interchanged as the dominant axis (so that cylindrical would be along y instead of x). This may be directly manufactured into the leading ends of the fiber optic bundles as in FIG. 22B , without the attachment of separate face plates as mentioned in the previous cylindrical face plate section.

- fiber surfaces may be bonded together, and then a spherical surface may be directly polished into the adjoining leading ends of the fiber optic bundles that define the resulting fiber structure, without orienting each leading end to be perpendicular to the optical center.
- some hybrid solution may be performed that combines the angled and polished approaches.
- the modules 200 and fiber optic bundles 600 are mounted in a configuration wherein each of the modules 200 is angled, with a commensurate angle to the cut and polish of the trailing end 620 of the fiber optic bundle 600 .

- the arrow on the right-hand side points to a bonding point for an image sensor to the corresponding portion of the divided trailing end 3320 .
- the image sensor and electronics can be bonded to the associated portions of the trailing end 3320 .
- the leading end 3310 may remain undivided, providing a single planar imaging plane.
- Such a design may provide significant cost reductions for the tapered fiber optic bundle manufacturing process. Production of only a single fiber optic bundle (in an embodiment that only requires four image sensors) may be less expensive than the production of four separate fiber optic bundles.

- the imaging qualities of such a system are vastly superior to conventional designs.
- the system can be implemented in a manner wherein the main lens projects an image onto the MLA (micro lens array), followed by a single or tiled fiber faceplate (or other transmissive surface). This may result in a viewed image at the rear of the fiber face plate, with high transmission as the fiber elements have very high efficiency when used as a relay alone. The image may appear similar to viewing an image on ground glass, yet may retain higher overall MTF/image quality.
- MLA micro lens array
- Non-planar surface for imaging may help to reduce the effects of aberrations in the main lens of a camera.
- Known methods often utilize software correction efforts and/or extensive calibration routines to correct for lens aberration.
- Such aberration effects may not be as apparent in the image derived from a non-planar surface such as a cylindrical or spherical surface, as described herein.
- an additional fiber plate may be interjected to further diffuse the transmission of light and provide increased angular sensitivity or altered directionality to the modules 3630 .

- One advantage of using a configuration with a number of mirrors that is much higher than 4 is that the pattern of sampling points is more evenly distributed across a field of view that is more narrow (in the case of the 13-sided mirror design, the field-of-view is 30° as compared with a 90° field-of-view for the 4-sided mirror design). This narrow field of view may better match the camera field of view, and result in more samples for objects that appear in the captured image.

- High dynamic range;
- Wide gamut;

- Motion blur reconstruction;
- Automated 3D camera tracking; and/or

-
- Compute wide depth of field image from light-field capture;
- Compute multiple perspectives/rays of information from within the main lens exit pupil;
- Compute disparity/depth vector triangulated correlations (spatial analysis, which may include additional temporal frames compared with motion vectors for statistical accuracy calculations);
- Compute motion vector tracked correlations (temporal analysis, which may include two or more frames);
- Analyze image; and
- Average error from all calculated vectors and statistically calculate the highest accuracy between all calculated data points.
-
- Infinite refocus: Post-capture refocus that allows multiple focus positions to be retargeted to match a single temporal position and seamlessly move among all possible focus positions contained in the scene.
- Variable frame rate: With the high frame rate information and known rays of angular entrance into the optical system, the exact integration time can be computed and reconstructed.
- Live action “deep imaging”: Deep imaging is a 3D image format traditionally used for computer generated materials. It is a format that allows a single XY pixel coordinate to store multiple RGBAZ pixels to reproject very complex scenes, including things like particle clouds. With the increased imaging data and vectors available, it is possible to generate live action deep image files where color and alpha are processed per pixel to generate a final image output with multiple RGBAZ pixels per XY coordinate.

-
Automated 3D Camera Tracking: With the computational analysis data and a known “zero” frame, an extremely accurate real-world camera representation of the camera's movement may be produced. - Automated Segmentation and Rotoscope: With accurate motion vectors, perspective data, and high quality imaging analysis, it may be possible to segment an image in much more accurate methods than those used for state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. Further, if a user defines an object, the outline or splines can be automatically propagated throughout a clip as the vectors and perspective analysis retain high correlation to the objects contained within a scene. This can additionally apply to motion capture applications, and potentially remove the necessity of tracking markers from these technologies. Such features may be computed in real time.
- Computational Lens Flare Removal: The lenslet structure may facilitate automation of removal of lens flares. Artistic tools can be leveraged to generate photo-real lens flares with much higher quality imagery than when a flare hits the lens/sensor.
- Extreme Low Light Capture: Due to the fixed aperture design and multiple perspectives of imaging data involved, in exchange for decreased refocusable range, it is possible to increase sensitivity of the resulting output pixels and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a single perspective and focus position at extremely low light conditions by averaging and/or adding retargeted perspective information to a single viewpoint to statistically decrease noise while retaining extremely high dynamic range.
- Artistic Lens Flavor: Due to the ability to understand the physics of light involved in the captured scene given the multiple vector analysis performed, it may be possible to characterize any other existing lens and reproject the rays of light as acquired through the light-field system to generate a near exact reconstruction of the characterized lens while simultaneously providing additional artistic controls over these parameters.

- 1. Remove dark regions by imaging a uniformly-lit planar light source. Determine a per-pixel gain map to apply to the image in order to normalize the response across each taper image plane. Generate a mask of the pixels that are directly attached to the fiber, as opposed to boundary sensor pixels that do not receive light.
- 2. Map large dark regions that are completely occluded by defects, and perform interpolation from neighboring pixels.
- 3. Remove optical warping caused by fiber optic deformation by imaging an optical chart with a rectilinear reference grid that forms a reference pattern over the entire imaging surface of the taper array. Unwarp each image to match the reference grid.
- 4. Remove fiber fault line artifacts for all tapers by imaging a Ronchi ruling. Record a series of images in which this Ronchi ruling is offset at regular intervals spaced by a subpixel or greater. This is done both for horizontal lines offset in the vertical direction, and vertical lines offset in the horizontal direction. Adjust each image to match the reference Ronchi ruling, and aggregate the required displacements together to produce one vector displacement map to apply to the original image.
- 5. Use the rectilinear grid pattern image to align adjacent tapers and determine their relative and global positioning in the array, forming a singular image.
- 6. Apply all of the above processing steps to the mask generated in
Step 1. When aligned inStep 5, the mask forms a map of seam boundaries between adjacent tapered fiber optic bundles. These seams are used for further processing. - 7. Record images using multiple color transparencies with varying color coordinates placed in front of a uniform planar light source. Assign one taper to be the master, and determine the color correction required for each of the other tapers to match the master using a 3-D lookup table. Apply this correction to form a uniform response between all tapers.

- Standardized light-field data is modified to use already-computed disk geometry values appropriate for the focus position of the main lens;
- After depth map generation, there is no Extended Depth-of-Field (EDOF) generation; and
- The RGB values of the light-field are saved along with the depth map, so that the playback software can perform projection using the blended refocus method as fast as computationally possible.
Image Sequence Processing—Render Farm Architecture
-
- Horizontal line spacing: 130 lines per tapered fiber optic bundle height, with line thickness of about 20 pixels; and

Preview Camera ISO vs. Main Camera ISO
-
- Input: 2D RGB image array with checkerboard pattern; and
- Output: A 2D per-pixel correction map (or UV map).
-
- 1. Define input parameters. These may include, for example, block size, grid rotation, and top left corner offset. These parameters are used as initial guesses for the grid fitting routine.
- 2. Run corner detection algorithm. Checkerboard corners are detected.
- 3. Run grid fitting algorithm. A global optimization routine is applied to find a set of parameters which defines a reference grid that fits the detected corners best. The output of this tool is a set of positional vectors that maps each corner point in the undistorted image coordinates to the corresponding corner point in the distorted image coordinates.
- 4. Manual Adjustment. Mismatched corner points can be adjusted.
- 5. Save Correction Map.
-
- A chart with 65 horizontal line pairs per individual tapered fiber optic bundle height, with about 20 pixel widths for each line.
- A chart with 85 vertical line pairs per individual tapered fiber optic bundle height, with about 20 pixel widths for each line.
-
- 1. For each chart, take a series of images (for example, ten images, such that N=10) in which all the line patterns in the image plane are shifted by ˜5 pixels vertically/horizontally. In at least one embodiment, the data can be captured by moving the line charts sequentially, which can be programmed by fine stepper motor controllers.
- 2. Multiple images can be formed by performing a pixel-by-pixel multiplication of one vertical line image and one horizontal line image recorded in the previous step. These are called product images. If N vertical line and M horizontal line images are recorded, then there are N×M possible product images. These product images will each contain a grid pattern of white box-shaped areas, surrounded by dark borders formed by the vertical and horizontal lines in the source images.
- 3. For each of the product images, the center-of-mass of each of the light box-shaped areas can be calculated. This forms a grid.
- 4. For each of the product image grids, a global optimization routine is applied to find a set of parameters which defines a reference grid that fits the observed grid best. The output of this tool is to generate a set of positional vectors that map between each of the white box center points in the undistorted image coordinates and to the corresponding white box center point in the distorted image coordinates. This forms a correction map for each product image.
- 5. The set of all of the correction maps from the product images can be combined to achieve a high-density correction map, which is then saved.
Fault Line Artifact Removal
-
- Input: 2D RGB image array. In at least one embodiment, these images are taken with no MLA pattern, but after applying noise artifact removal to remove noise, hexagon patterns, and dark spots.
- Output: A 2D correction map array.
-
- A chart with 65 horizontal ti e pairs per individual tapered fiber optic bundle height, with about 20 pixel widths for each line.
- A chart with 85 vertical line pairs per individual tapered fiber optic bundle height, with about 20 pixel widths for each line.
-
- 1. Data Capture. For each chart, take a series of images (for example, forty images, such that N=40) in which all the line patterns in the image plane are shifted by ˜1 pixel vertically/horizontally. In at least one embodiment, the data can be captured by moving the line charts sequentially, which can be programmed by fine stepper motor controllers.
- 2. Line Detection. Given N line chart images taken from different phases (1 pixel offset in either horizontal or vertical), find all of the distorted line patterns. Ideally, the
system 7500 finds all of line patterns in the chart, which requires that the straight line separation is larger than the largest fault line separation. - 3. Coarse Straight Line Fitting. For all points in Line i, fit them into Ai*x+Bi*y+Ci=0.
- 4. Fine Straight Line Fitting. For each line, fit it into A*x+y+Ci=0 (horizontal), x+B*y+Ci=0 (vertical), where Ci=C0+i*delta(C), delta(C)=C1−C0=C2−C1= . . . =Cn−Cn−1. In at least one embodiment, even spacing line patterns can be used. Both of the two steps can be modeled as non-linear optimization problems.
- 5. Calculate Correction Map. An offset vector can be formed by calculating the distance between a point on the detected line and its correspondence on the fitted line model. The offset vectors are splatted and aggregated in order to generate a per-pixel correction map.
- 6. Post Processing. To fill in some gaps due to extremely bad fault line artifacts or missing samples, a hole-filling routine can be applied.
-
- 1. Identify the active area. This may be done manually or automatically.
- 2. Each checkerboard pattern image may be processed using calibration steps 1-4 described above. Then, a global reference grid may be used to determine the global positioning in the array, in which the transform is represented as a 2D rotation matrix and translation vector for the image from each of the
cameras 7512.
Image Seam Removal
-
- 1. Subtract Black Frame. Each
camera 7512 may have its own dark current characteristics; accordingly, a separate dark frame calibration may be used for eachcamera 7512. Eachcamera 7512, along with the corresponding taperedfiber optic bundle 7610 and/orfiber face plate 7620, may be processed independently. Input and output may both be raw-Bayer data. - 2. Carry Out Lens Shading. Each
camera 7512 may have its own PRNU (photo-response non-uniformity); accordingly, a separate flat-field calibration may be used for eachcamera 7512. This flat-field correction may include the effect of both the MLA pattern and the fiber artifacts. Eachcamera 7512, along with the corresponding taperedfiber optic bundle 7610 and/orfiber face plate 7620, may be processed independently. Input and output may both be raw-Bayer data.FIG. 91 depicts an example of a light-field image 9100 before lens shading is applied, according to one embodiment.FIG. 92 depicts an example of the light-field image 9100 after lens shading is applied, according to one embodiment. - 3. Balance Cameras. Each
camera 7512, along with the corresponding taperedfiber optic bundle 7610 and/orfiber face plate 7620, may respond to light slightly differently than the others. This step attempts to correct for the differences, and map allcameras 7512 to one reference camera. In at least one embodiment, this can be performed using a Bayer channel gain and offset; additionally or alternatively, other techniques can be used. In at least one embodiment, eachcamera 7512, along with the corresponding taperedfiber optic bundle 7610 and/orfiber face plate 7620, may be processed independently. Input and output may both be raw-Bayer data. - 4. Standardize. This step includes, for example, white-balance, demosaicing, chroma-suppression, and other operations that are known in Light-Field Engine (LFE) processing. In at least one embodiment, each
camera 7512, along with the corresponding taperedfiber optic bundle 7610 and/orfiber face plate 7620, may be processed independently. Input and output may both be raw-Bayer data.FIG. 93 depicts an example of a light-field image 9300 before standardization, after lens shading has been applied, according to one embodiment.FIG. 94 is an example of the light-field image 9300 after standardization, according to one embodiment. - 5. Merge (Fiber artifact removal). This step may take all of the tiles generated by the
cameras 7512 and merge them to one large image. The mapping table may include (1) the lens warp+grid warp+fault-line warp, and (2) tapered fiber optic bundle alignment warp, which can be collapsed into one lookup table mapping. This process is described in the above sections describing fiber artifact removal. The multiple tiles are considered the “source” (input) and the merged image is considered the “destination” (output). - 6. Blend camera images. For each pixel of the destination, the
system 7500 may keep track of whichcamera 7512 to sample from and the x,y index (floating-point) of the location to sample at. By using a lookup table percamera 7512, thesystem 7500 may be able to blend the data from thecameras 7512; for example, for a given pixel of the destination image, thesystem 7500 may take a weighted average of the data from allcameras 7512. This can help in the seam-region, which is often noisy and unreliable. With this approach, there are multiple mapping tables (one for each camera 7512) and each table may include an x,y index and weight.FIG. 95 is anexample depicting tiles FIG. 96 is anexample depicting tiles single image 9600, according to one embodiment. - 7. Apply Influence (Seam artifact removal). In at least one embodiment, each pixel is given a weight that is used in projection. In this stage, that weight is pre-multiplied. Each pixel can be weighted according to its associated demodulation value (more specifically, 1/demodValue{circumflex over ( )}2). In order to perform such weighting, in at least one embodiment, a second flat-field image (non-MLA) is applied to the flat-field image (MLA) used in step #2 (lens shading) above, in order to remove the effects of the optical fiber. This is done for the flat-field image generated by each of the
cameras 7512. Then, these multiple flat-field images are merged into one large image to yield one large influence map. A per-pixel “confidence map” can also be used to set any unreliable pixels to zero weight.FIG. 97 depicts an exemplary close-upview 9700 of the influence map, according to one embodiment. Note that interstitials receive low weight (as expected), and theseam 9710 between twocameras 7512 receives gets zero weight. - 8. Create light-field. In at least one embodiment, the
system 7500 pairs the merged image along with the appropriate geometry model, so that it can be treated as one large light-field that can be used for projection. The geometry may consist of a global model and a local per-pixel LUT for geometry correction.FIG. 98 depicts an example 9800 showing a set of disk-centers 9810, according to one embodiment. Dots are shown in the disk-centers 9810, with one set of dots from the global model only, and another set, distinct from those of the global model, using geometry correction. - 9. Estimate depth and reconstruct. In at least one embodiment, for the final 2D reconstruction from the light-field, depth and projection may be processed according to known light-field image processing techniques.
