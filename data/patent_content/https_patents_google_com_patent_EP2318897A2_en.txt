Definitions
- This document relates to systems and techniques for generating graphical display elements and controls.
- This document describes systems and techniques that may be employed to interact with a user of a computing device, like a mobile telephone having a touch screen user interface.
- the techniques may react in particular ways to inputs for moving around a multi-dimensional space in two or more directions.
- the techniques may determine whether the space is a large space (e.g., several times larger than the device display) and may present a noticeable but unobtrusive graphical control element that permits accelerated panning in the space.
- the control element may be, for example, a scroll bar that is automatically generated along an edge of the display whenever the user begins panning in a large space using touch screen inputs.
- such systems and technique may provide one or more advantages.
- a user of a device may be saved time in navigating around a large space (which could otherwise require dragging their finger repeatedly across the surface of a touch screen) because they can use the accelerated panning control to move across an entire space with a single finger input.
- the user may be provided with a contextual indication that shows them where they are currently located within the larger space.
- the scrolling control may be located along an edge of the display at a location that reflects the user's current location within the space (i.e., the control can be near the top of the screen if the user is near the top of the space).
- a computer-implemented visual navigation method comprises providing from a wireless mobile device, over a public wireless network to a server located remotely from the wireless mobile device, information identifying a geographic location.
- the method also comprises receiving in response, from the server, image data of digital images captured from an location at the geographic location, displaying the image data to a user of the mobile device as an image of an image space around e geographic locations; and panning the image within the image space automatically in response to user motion of the wireless mobile device.
- Panning the image can comprise moving forward in the image space in response to user shaking of the wireless mobile device. Also, panning the image can comprise panning the image laterally around the geographic location in accordance with compass readings sensed by the wireless mobile device The method can also comprise matching a compass reading sensed by the wireless mobile device to a compass direction at the geographic location.
- the image is comprised of multiple joined image files.
- panning the image can comprise panning the image up and down in response to accelerometer measurements sensed by the wireless mobile device.
- the image data can also be substantially similar to streetview image data.
- the method can further comprise receiving address information from a user, displaying a map around the address in response to receipt of the address information, and providing the information identifying a geographic location based on a user selection on the map.
- the method can also comprise receiving a search query from the user, identifying the search query as corresponding to the address information, and presenting the address information to the user before receiving the address information from the user.
- the address information can comprise data encoded in a hyperlink from a search result.
- the geographic location can differ from a current location of the wireless mobile device.
- an article comprising a tangible computer- readable data storage medium storing program code.
- the can is operable to cause one or more machines to perform operations, where the operations comprise providing from a wireless mobile device, to a server located remotely from the wireless mobile device, information identifying a geographic location, receiving in response from the server image data representing items around the geographic location, displaying the image data to a user of the mobile device as an image of an image space around the geographic locations, and panning the image within the image space automatically in response to user motion of the wireless mobile device.
- the panning of the image can comprise panning the image laterally around the geographic location in accordance with compass readings sensed by the wireless mobile device.
- panning the image comprises matching a compass reading sensed by the wireless mobile device to a compass direction at the geographic location.
- the operations further comprise receiving address information from a user, displaying a map around the address in response to receipt of the address information, and providing the information identifying a geographic location based on a user selection on the map.
- a computer-implemented visual navigation system comprises a compass module to sense a direction of orientation for a wireless mobile computer, and a wireless interface to communicate with a server located remote from the system to receive from the server a plurality of images around geographic locations.
- the system also comprises a processor in communication with memory storing code having instructions to determine the direction of orientation of the device using the compass module, to obtain from the server image data showing images around the geographic locations, and to display one or more images corresponding to a geographic location identified by a user of the system in an orientation corresponding to the direction of orientation for the wireless mobile computer.
- the code can further have instructions to sense a change in the direction of orientation for the wireless mobile computer, and to change a display of images on the wireless mobile computer so as to match, with the images, the change in direction of orientation for the wireless moil computer.
- the system further comprises an accelerometer to sense motion of the wireless mobile computer, and wherein the code further has instructions to change a display of images on the wireless mobile computer.
- the code to display one or more images corresponding to a geographic location identified by a user of the system in an orientation corresponding to the direction of orientation for the wireless mobile computer can comprise code to pan a display laterally around the geographic location in accordance with compass readings sensed by the compass module.
- a computer-implemented visual navigation system comprises a compass module to sense a direction of orientation for a wireless mobile computer, a wireless interface to communicate with a server located remote from the system to receive from the server a plurality of images around geographic locations, and means for displaying images retrieved from the server in a direction about a geographic location that corresponds to a direction sensed by the compass module.
- FIGs. 1A and 1 B are conceptual diagrams showing navigation mechanisms for large display spaces.
- FIG. 2A show sequential displays that may be generating for a user navigating a long list on a mobile device having a touch screen.
- FIG. 2B shows displays that may be generated for a user by a mobile device according to the motion or position of the mobile device.
- FIG. 2C shows example displays of techniques for providing a user interface for panning and zooming in a large space.

- FIGs. 4A-4B are flow charts of example processes for receiving user selections from a graphical user interface.
- FIGs. 4C-4D are a flow charts of an example process for updating a display according to the motion of a mobile device.
- FIG. 5 is a schematic representation of an exemplary mobile device that implements embodiments of the notification techniques described herein.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating the internal architecture of the device of FIG. 5.
- FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components of the operating system used by the device of FIG. 5.
- FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating exemplary processes implemented by the operating system kernel of FIG. 7.
- FIG. 9 shows an example of a computer device and a mobile computer device that can be used to implement the techniques described here.
- a user may be shown graphical objects, such as in the form of icons, that indicate to the user where they are located within a large virtual space, and may provide controls that a user may select in order to move visually within that space.
- graphical objects such as in the form of icons
- a proportional scroll bar may appear on the edge of a screen when a user starts to scroll. If the user scrolls a sufficient amount or at a sufficient speed, a large letter may appear on the screen to indicate the letter in the alphabet at which they are currently located in their scrolling of the list.
- the user may have an indication of where they are in any event.
- the location of the letter vertically on the display may be comparable to its position within the alphabet, so that the letter "A” will appear at the top of the display, and the letter “Z” will appear at the bottom.
- the scroll bar can also change appearance as a user scrolls, getting large or otherwise more prominent as a user scrolls more.
- a object in the form of a virtual magnifying glass may be provided.
- Such an object may be an area on the screen within which a portion of the space is substantially enlarged.
- Such an object may be used, for example, during web browsing, so that a user can see an overall layout of a web page, and can then quickly read or otherwise more closely review, a portion of the page.
- the visual space may be a 360-degree panorama at a point in the real world, like that provided by the well-known GOOGLE STREETVIEW service.
- a panorama may be generated by taking digital images simultaneously or nearly simultaneously by a plurality of cameras mounted near a common point and aimed radially outward.
- Such images may normally be navigated on a desktop personal computer, such as via the GOOGLE MAPS service.
- the images may be navigated inherently by using position-detecting components on a mobile device itself, such as a compass in a compass module provided on the device.
- FIGs. 1A and 1 B are conceptual diagrams showing navigation mechanisms for large display spaces.
- FIG. 1 A generally shows navigation in a long list of items, while FIG. 1 B shows navigation across a large map.
- the area to be displayed (which is shown in dashed lines) is substantially larger than the area that is capable of being displayed at one time (which is shown in solid lines).
- mechanisms are discussed here that assist a user in navigating across the spaces in ways that are more convenient than repeatedly panning across display-after-display-after-display until the user finally gets to their desired area.
- a graphical system 102 that comprises a list 108 of items stored on a mobile device.
- the items may include things such as personal contacts associated with a user, songs or records in a user's music collection, various files stored on a device, video files that may be played conveniently on the device, or other appropriate groups of items that are displayable in a list format.
- An individual item 110 may be displayed to the user with a variety of information indicative of the item. For example, where the item is a contact, the displayed information may include a name of the contact and a telephone number for the contact.
- the system may display an image of the musical group or an album cover for the musical group, a name of the group, and the name of a song, albums, or other appropriate information regarding the group.
- the system may display the file name, a size of the file, and a last-saved date for the file.
- a display 106 is shown superimposed near the middle of the list 108.
- the display 106 in this example represents a typical portrait-formatted video display from a mobile device, and may be approximately 3 to 4 inches measured diagonally.
- the display 106 is shown as a window, in effect, over the list 108, to represent that a user may scroll through the list to see various different portions of the list 108 at one time by way of the display 106.
- the list 108 moves up and down beneath the display 106, and the display 106 serves as a window onto the list.
- the manner in which the list 108 is sorted and the manner in which the display 106 fetches and formats items from the list 108 for presentation to a user may occur according to standard mechanisms.
- the top and bottom of the display 106 are shown as being shaded to indicate that items in the list 108 may fade to black near the top and bottom of the display 106 so as to provide a user with the impression that the items are effectively on a three- dimensional reel that the user is spinning as they navigate up and down the list.
- the display 106 may be integrated as part of a touch screen structure, so that a user may drag the list 108 up and down by sliding their finger up or down, respectively, on top of the list, in an intuitive manner.
- a visual control 112 is displayed on display 106 to assist in such panning across the long list 108.
- the control 112 may take the form of a slider button that will be familiar to users from various applications that involve the use of scrolling bars, such as desktop productivity software (e.g., spreadsheets and word processors).
- the control 112 may be displayed in a scrolling bar to the side of the list 108, or as an element that visually floats over the elements in the list 108.
- the control 112 may take a proportional form, as is well-known in the art, in that the control 112 may be shorter if list 108 is longer. In such a situation then, the control 112 may take the user to the top or bottom of the list 108 by the user dragging the control 112 to the top or bottom of its predetermined positions within display 106. In particular, a shorter control 112 may represent the relative smaller area being displayed by display 106 where list 108 is a very long list. As a result, each movement of control 112 through a span equal to the height of control 112 may approximate the movement across one display 106 of list 108.
- control 112 may take a variety of other forms also.
- the control 112 may be placed elsewhere on the area of display 106 such as being overlaid over the middle of display 106. In certain implementations, however, it may be preferred to locate control 112 as far out of the way of the display 106 as possible, so as to avoid obscuring the content of display 106 by a user's finger or other pointer.
- the movement of a control 112 in a particular direction may drive the movement of list 108 across display 106 in the same or an opposite direction, depending on the implementation.
- the dragging of control 112 downward may visually drag list 108 downward, and thus make it appear that display 106 is climbing the list, and that control 112 is attached directly to the list 108, though perhaps in a form of accelerating linkage.
- movement of control 112 down may cause list 108 to move upwards through display 106, leaving an impression that control 112 is connected to display 106, perhaps by way of an accelerating linkage.
- FIG. 1 B shows a number of example displays 114, 116, 118 that provide windows into a map of a metropolitan area, here the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.
- the map 104 in this example is highly simplified so as to permit a clearer view of the components in the various displays 114, 116, 118.
- the displays 114, 116, 118 may show only a small portion of the map at one time, so that mechanisms are provided to permit easy and intuitive panning across the map 104 for a user of a device, such as a mobile device having a touch screen.
- a first display 114 represents a user of a mobile device viewing a zone in the Southwest metropolitan area.
- Display 114 shows the generation of a four- headed arrow 114a over the surface of the map in display 114.
- a user may drag the arrow 114a up, or down, or sideways, to indicate an intent to pan around the map 104.
- panning by a user before the arrow 114a is displayed e.g., dragging a finger across the map
- the user may drag the arrow 114a into the upper right-hand corner of the display to thereby cause display 114 to move to the upper right corner of the map 104, in the Northeast zone on the metropolitan area.
- Other such exaggerated or accelerated motions may also occur via manipulation of the arrow 114a.
- the display 114 also includes a small overview map 114b of the entire map area.
- Map 114b is provided in a familiar manner, and shows a large box that represents the entire mapped area available to a user in a current zoom level and a smaller box that represents the current display 114 of the user, so that the user may readily identify their location relative to other locations in the larger map.
- Major features from the map 104 may also be displayed inside map 114b, though all features likely will not be displayed because map 114b is much smaller than map 104.
- Display 116 shows slider controls 116a, 116b, that operate in a manner similar to slider control 112 in FIG. 1A.
- a user presented with display 116 may initially be shown only the map information filling up their entire display 116. If they begin to pan in their display 116, across map 104, or flick to pan so as to indicate that they want to pan a long distance, controls 116a, 116b may be generated and shown to the user. The user may then pan all the way to the left or right of map 104 by sliding control 116a all the way to the left or right of display 116.
- display 116 may be moved all the way to the top or bottom of map 104 by sliding control 116b all the way to the top or bottom of display 116.
- the user may quickly move about map 104 using the controls 116a, 116b to accelerate their motion across the map 104, so that a single swipe on display 116 may move the display 116 much farther then would a normal panning motion directly on the map in display 116, and not using the controls 116a, 116b.
- Display 118 provides for navigation similar to that shown in display 114, but with an annular ring displayed over the map 104.
- the location of the ring 118a on display 118 indicates the relative position of the display 118 on map 104.
- the display 118 is near the top of map 104 and slightly to the left, and likewise, the ring 118a is near the top and slightly to the left on display 118. The user may then drag their finger in the area of display
- FIGs. 1 A and 1 B show various mechanisms for allowing a user to navigate within a large virtual space, whether the space is along a single dimension or in two dimensions. These mechanisms may provide the user a sense of their current location within the large space, as well as a selectable control or controls to let the user control their computing device so as to pan around the space.
- the mechanisms shown here may be particular useful for touch screen devices, and more particularly mobile devices having touch screens.
- FIG. 2A shows sequential displays 200-206 that may be generated for a user who is navigating a long list on a mobile device having a touch screen.
- the list is a list of music groups or singers, that could be shown conceptually like the list
- Display 200 shows seven different groups, with the group name, the number of albums stored on the user's device for that group, and the total number of songs on those albums.
- a graphical icon is shown for each group, where the icon indicates whether a single album or multiple albums are available for that group. Where available, album cover art may be downloaded manually or automatically, or other images may be inserted for the icons.
- a slider control 208 is shown along the right-hand edge of display 200 in this example.
- the slider control 208 may be shown whenever the display 200 is showing a list that is larger than the display 200, or may be shown only in particular contextual circumstances (e.g., only after particular actions by a user that indicate an intent by the user to pan a long way across a representation of data), as described more fully above and below.
- Display 202 shows the action of a user flick across the screen upward from a pictured small dot to a pictured larger dot and ring.
- the particular graphic shown here would typically not be shown on display 202, but instead is provided here to show a typical user input on the display 202.
- the flick 210 may result in the generation of slider control 212 on the display 202, in situations where the slider control was not previously displayed.
- the user is at the top of the alphabet in the list, so the slider control 212 is shown at the top of display 202.
- the size of the slider control 212 may be generally proportional, or inversely proportional, to the length of the list shown on display 202. For example, here, slider control 212 is about 1/10 the height of display 202.
- control 212 may also be related to the length of the list, but not necessarily proportionately sized against display 202. For example, a minimum size for slider control 212 may be specified, so that even if the list includes thousands of entries, the slider control 212 will be large enough for a user to see it adequately and select it without frequent errors.
- Display 204 results from the flick 210.
- the list of artists has scrolled upward and has rested two letters further down the alphabet. Notice that the movement involves momentum, because the flick 210 spanned only the distance of two artists, but the display has scrolled down through several dozen artists.
- the particular speed of the flick may determine the distance that is scrolled so as to approximate the action of a physical spinning wheel or similar physical object that a user might flick, in what is a familiar manner to a skilled artisan.
- control 212 has changed in two relevant manners, to become control 214.
- control 214 is a scrolling control
- its position has moved down slightly from its position as control 212, to reflect that the user is further down the list in display 204 in comparison to display 202.
- the control 214 is more prominent than control 212, to bring it to the user's attention more readily.
- the control 214 has begun to thicken and bulge slightly at its center to signify to the user that it may be selected for particular contextual functions.
- control 214 may be used to conduct accelerated panning up and down the list of artists.
- the control may be dragged all the way down the side of display 204, and although such motion will span only five artists as they are currently shown on the display, it can result in motion of the list all the way down to the letter Z., perhaps across hundreds of artists.
- the control 214 may be made more prominent in other ways also.
- the control 214 may be made brighter as an alternative to, or in addition to, increasing the size of control 214.
- the control 214 may also be rendered so as to appear to stretch and to look under pressure as the user conducts repeated flicks like flick 210. In this manner, the user may see more urgency in employing control 214 to conduct accelerated panning, since multiple flicks on the list itself should indicate that the user truly would benefit from accelerated panning rather than having to perform so many manual flicks.
- control 214 may change, both as a user performs one or more flicks across the surface of a list, and also as the control 214 moves up and down the edge of a display, so as to bring the control 214 more to the user's attention as they provide inputs that indicate that they may have a need for the control 214.
- Display 206 represents a change resulting from a user selection of control 214 as shown by the dot at the bottom of control 214 in the arrow leading to display 206.
- the dot on control 216 indicates that a user has maintained pressure on the control 216 and is about to scroll down through the list on display 206. Such a selection may cause the control to change shape again from that shown by control 214 to that shown by control 216.
- an index letter for the items in the list is shown in a familiar manner to provide additional guidance for a user.
- the index letter 218 represents a discrete grouping of the elements in the list, here a letter of the alphabet to represent the starting letter of the artist that is shown at the top of display 206.
- the index letter 218 may take other forms also, such as a numeral representing a size of a file stored on a device, or any other indicator by which a list of items may be classified into discrete groups.
- the index letter 218 may be displayed in a variety of manners.
- the index letter 218 is located near the edge of the display so as to minimize the manner in which it may cover the artist names, but may also be made partially or wholly transparent to permit viewing of the names even when they are positioned under the index letter 218.
- the index letter 218 may move up and down on the display 206 along with the movement of control 216.
- the index letter 218 may be anchored just to the left of control 216 a sufficient distance so that the index letter 218 may be seen by a user even while their finger is on control 216.
- the index letter 218 may move up and down the side of display 206 along with the control 216.
- the index letter may change as the letters in the list in display 206 change, so that, for example, if there were many artists in the list that started with the letter A., but few that started with the letter C, very little motion of control 216 would be required to pass through the letter C as an index letter 218., as compared to passing through the letter A.
- each index letter here A to Z (and perhaps 0 to 9), may have an equal division in comparison to the movement of control 216, so that movement down one 26th of display 206 will always result in the changing of one letter in index letter 218., for example.
- the index letter may change as the user slides the control 214 up and down, but the items in the list may stop moving when such control is occurring.
- there may be two modes of control - normal panning where the items in the list scroll up and down as the user pans, and accelerated panning, where the items no longer move, and an index letter is cycled through in an accelerated manner as the user moves the control.
- a user may readily navigate in small movements by dragging their finger across a display of a list.
- the user may navigate in larger movements by flicking across the display with their finger so as to give it virtual momentum and thereby move more than one display at a time in the list.
- the user may also be provided a convenient option for scrolling in an accelerated manner through the list, without having to take up unnecessary interaction - via the presentation of a control that is hidden until the user indicates an intent to pan or scroll through the list.
- FIG. 2B shows displays that may be generated for a user by a mobile device according to the motion or position of the mobile device.
- the mobile device may include an electronic compass that can be used to detect a change in heading, according to the Earth's magnetic field (e.g., the North and South Poles). As such, when a user holding the mobile device turns or otherwise changes the heading of the mobile device in relation to the direction of the North Pole, the mobile device can detect the change in heading.
- the mobile device may include an accelerometer that can detect a change in motion.
- the mobile device can detect the change in acceleration. In some implementations, these detected motions can be used to update the display on the mobile device automatically.
- a mobile device 220 is shown being held by a user 224a-224c, in three different orientations or directions.
- the user 224a-224c is shown with particular headings (according to the "North" arrow). That is, the same user is shown with different headings according to a compass included in the mobile device 220.
- the mobile device 220 may include a web browser or other software application(s) that allows the user of the mobile device to access a map of a particular area.
- the map also includes images of the area that are captured from a street-side vantage point.
- One such example is STREETVIEW from GOOGLE (Mountain View, CA).
- the user 224a-224c can provide an address to the web browser or other software application(s) to generate a view (in the form of a map, satellite image, or combination of the two) of the area surrounding the provided address.
- the mobile device 220 may automatically provide the address (as the current address where the user is located) using a global position system (GPS) or other systems designed to locate the mobile device automatically.
- GPS global position system
- the user may initially provide address information - here the address of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome - and may be provided with map tiles and other map data in a familiar manner for the area around "The Dome.” The user may then further select to be presented with a street view in an area around The Dome. While the user may be located, for example, in their home, they may be displayed images from the outside of The Dome that were taken by a car that passed the dome at an earlier time. The user may obtain the view alternatively, via a search, such as by the query "MetroDome,” which may return an address as a Onebox result that includes a link to the map of the area around the structure, and they may then choose to see images from a point on the map.
- a search such as by the query "MetroDome”
- the direction in which the person is looking in a virtual manner via STREETVIEW may be coordinated with the compass direction the person is facing in their own frame of reference.
- the mobile device 220 generates displays 222a-222c of a particular region according to the map data, the location of the mobile device, the heading of the mobile device, and/or other information that can be detected by the mobile device (e.g., acceleration exerted on the mobile device 220).
- user 224b is looking generally SSE, and is thus shown the view in the area near the Dome that is oriented in a similar direction.
- the mobile device 220 can detect the motion or direction of the user (e.g., the change in heading) and automatically pan the view to match heading of the user, which is illustrated as display 222a. That is, the mobile device 220 now displays (in display 222a) a different portion of the Metrodome according to new heading detected by the mobile device 220. If the user turns to their right (e.g., in a heading illustrated by user 224c), the mobile device 220 can detect the motion of the user (e.g., the change in heading) and automatically pan the view to match the current heading of the user, which is illustrated as display 222c.
- the motion or direction of the user e.g., the change in heading
- the heading of the device may be matched easily to relevant heading data that identifies portions of the image or images that make up the particular street view. Where there are multiple images, they can be made to appear seamless to a user by serving them in succession and blending them at their edges. In this manner, the user can be provided with the effect of viewing on their mobile device the area around the point at which the images were captured, even though the user may be far away from such a location.
- an accelerometer can be used instead of, or in addition to, a compass on the mobile device 220. For example, as the user walks, the accelerometer can detect the motion (e.g., shaking, walking, change in elevation, orientation, or other motion) and update the displays 222a-222c accordingly.
- the mobile device can detect that user is moving based on detected accelerations and can pan the displays 222a-222c as if the user were walking down the street. The user may also simply shake the device in space to cause forward motion to occur in the displayed space, much like selection of a travel arrow in GOOGLE STREETVIEW causes the user to move virtually down a street.
- the mobile device 220 can detect a change in the orientation of the mobile device (e.g., according to acceleration detected by the accelerometer) and can pan the displays 222a-222c up or down as if the user 224a-224c were looking up or down, where the graphical images provided by a remote server to the device include such panoramic photographs.
- the direction shown by the device may also be relative rather than absolute, and particularly where an accelerometer is used and a compass is not.
- the initial orientation of a view that is provided to a user may initially be selected by a rule rather than a particular direction that the user is facing.
- relative motion by the user rotating to the left or right may be sensed by an accelerometer on a device, and the images of the geographic locality that the viewer is reviewing may be panned relative to such motion, though perhaps not in a manner perfectly proportional to the user's motion.
- the user may rotate 90 degrees, while the display may be made to rotate only 60 degrees in the same direction because of limitations in the ability of the user's device to sense absolute motion.
- FIG. 2C shows example displays of techniques for providing a user interface for panning and zooming in a large space.
- the figure includes four screen shots (a)-(d) that show different points in time in the use of a user interface mechanism for zooming on web pages.
- a web page may be raised initially in a relatively zoomed out level, as shown around the edges of display (a). By zooming out on the page, the user may more readily browse the page to find relevant content in context. To indicate a desire to zoom in, the user may double tap on the page, via a touch screen input mechanism.
- the double tap may result in the generation of a magnifying zoom box, which is shown in screen shot (a) in the process of appearing in a large format so that it is brought readily to the user's attention, and it then shrinks to a size that represents the area that will be shown if the user chooses to zoom in.
- the user is shown moving their finger toward the zoom box, and the user may press on the box and drag it around until it lies over the area the user would like to review more closely.
- the content inside may be increased in size slightly as the box is moved around, as shown in shots (b)- (d).
- the zoom box may also trail the user's finger slightly when the motion starts (see trailing box in shot (d), where the user's finger is moving toward the lower left corner).
- the box may then "catch up” in a springy fashion once the finger stops moving. This may provide the user with a better sense that they are dragging the box, and may also keep the finger from fully covering the zoom box while it is being moved around.
- FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a system 300 that provides user interaction in response to touch screen inputs.
- the system 300 may be implemented using a mobile device such as device 302.
- the device 302 includes various input and output mechanisms such as a touch screen display 304 and a roller ball 306.
- a number of components within device 302 may be configured to provide various selection functionality on display 304, such as movement within large spaces which exceed the size of the display 304, as described above.
- One such component is a display manager 312, which may be responsible for rendering content for presentation on display 304.
- the display manager 312 may receive graphic-related content from a number of sources and may determine how the content is to be provided to a user. For example, a number of different windows for various applications 310 on the device 304 may need to be displayed, and the display manager 312 may determine which to display, which to hide, and what to display or hide when there is overlap between various graphical objects.
- the display manager 312 can include various components to provide the device 302 with particular functionality for interacting with displayed components, which may be shared across multiple applications, and may be supplied, for example, by an operating system of device 302. Such functionality may be provided, for example, by interface navigation module 311 , which may be responsible for receiving input from a user wanting to move between and among elements on display 304.
- interface navigation module 311 may be responsible for receiving input from a user wanting to move between and among elements on display 304.
- a control 305 is shown on display 304, and may be similar to control 118a on display 118 in FIG. 1 B.
- the positioning of control 305 on display 304 may represent to the user that they are looking at a portion of their map that is in the Southeast corner of the entire map.
- interface navigation module 311 may initially cause control 305 to be displayed, and may cause the map to pan an amount related to the dragging motion. Subsequent dragging on the map, but away from the control 305 may cause more panning of the map, and the control 305 may, in certain circumstances, move a small amount if the location of the control 305 on the map corresponds to the location of the map sub-section shown on the display 304 relative to the overall map. Interface navigation module 311 can likewise provide for other changes in the display 304 in response to user input, such as those described above and below. [0073] Individual applications 310 can register themselves with the display manager 312 in accordance with an API so as to indicate the sort of display elements they might require.
- an application may identify a group of data elements as corresponding to a list, and the interface navigation module 311 may then treat such elements as a list visually, e.g., it may show an accelerated scrolling control when the list is sufficiently long and a user input indicates a user intent to scroll up or down within the list.
- An input manager 314 may be responsible for translating commands provided by a user of device 302. For example, such commands may come from a keyboard, from touch screen display 304, from trackball 306, or from other such sources, including dedicated buttons or soft buttons (e.g., buttons whose functions may change over time, and whose functions may be displayed on areas of display 304 that are adjacent to the particular buttons).
- the input may also occur more inferentially, such as from signals provided by an on board compass or accelerometer.
- the input manager 314 may determine, for example, in what area of the display commands are being received, and thus in what application being shown on the display the commands are intended for. In addition, it may interpret input motions on the touch screen 304 into a common format and pass those interpreted motions (e.g., short press, long press, flicks, and straight-line drags) to the appropriate application.
- the input manager 314 may also report such inputs to an event manager (not shown) that in turn reports them to the appropriate modules or applications.
- a variety of applications 310 may operate, generally on a common microprocessor, on the device 302.
- the applications 310 may take a variety of forms, such as mapping applications, e-mail and other messaging applications, web browser applications, music and video players, and various applications running within a web browser or running extensions of a web browser.
- One application that may run independently or as part of a browser is GOOGLE MAPS and GOOGLE STREETVIEW.
- Such an application may accept readings from a compass module 313 on the device 302, which may include an electronic compass and related circuitry and software for interpreting compass readings, and an accelerometer 315.
- the compass module 313 and accelerometer may be used, such as described above with respect to FIG.
- a wireless interface 308 manages communication with a wireless network, which may be a data network that also carries voice communications.
- the wireless interface may operate in a familiar manner, such as according to the examples discussed below, and may provide for communication by the device 302 with messaging services such as text messaging, e-mail, and telephone voice mail messaging.
- the wireless interface 308 may support downloads and uploads of content and computer code over a wireless network.
- maps/lists/etc storage 316 includes all sorts of data to be used by applications 310, and can include lists of data elements, graphical components like map tiles, and a variety of other well known data structures so that a user can interact with applications on device 302.
- Other storage includes user defaults 318, which may be profile information for a user stored on the same media as maps/links/etc, storage 316.
- the user defaults 318 include various parameters about a user of the device 302.
- the user profile may include data defining the manner in which the user prefers to have panning controls presented on the display 304 (e.g., what the controls should look like, whether a list should scroll with the control or in the opposite direction of the control, the actions by the user that will bring up the control, etc.).
- the device 302 may provide particular actions in response to user inputs. Specifically, the device 302 may respond to panning inputs within large areas in particular ways, including by displaying a control that permits accelerated panning in the areas (i.e., panning that is substantially faster than dragging across a panned object, and typically permits navigation from one side of the area to another using a single swipe on the controls).
- a control that permits accelerated panning in the areas (i.e., panning that is substantially faster than dragging across a panned object, and typically permits navigation from one side of the area to another using a single swipe on the controls).
- FIGs. 4A-4B are flow charts of example processes for receiving user selections from a graphical user interface.
- FIG. 4A shows, for example, a process by which a mobile device may respond to inputs on a screen that shows only a relatively small part of a large graphical area.
- Large area data may include various forms of data whose display extends well beyond the edges of a single screen on a device. Such data may include, for example, long lists of information, and large images, or maps, or similar presentations of information.
- the request to display the large area information may take a number of forms, such as a search request provided to a device, where the search results include the large area information, such as in the form of a list of files on a computer, on the Internet, or a map generated in response to a search result.
- the process selects a subset of the large area data and displays that subset.
- the displayed subset may be a portion of that map surrounding an address that is a result for a search query that was entered by a user.
- Such an input may generally be received by a user moving their finger or a stylus across the surface of a touch screen display.
- the process reacts to the user input at box 406, by showing a panning control on the display after determining the relative size of the display in comparison to the size of the entire area of data.
- the prior determination of the relative size of the display before displaying the control may ensure that a control is not shown if the area of data is the size of the display or only slightly larger than the display. In such situations, panning either does not operate or can be completed easily right on the data, without the need for a special control that can be used to provide accelerated panning.
- the display of the control may also be dependent on the speed and manner of the user input. For example, if the user drags slowly across the display, the process may assume that the user is not interested in navigating to far flung corners of the data, and may decline to display the control. Similarly, if the user leaves their finger on the display at the end of their action, such input may be taken as an indication that the user is not interested in panning very far, and thus not in need of an accelerated panning control. In contrast, if the user moves quickly and lifts their finger at the end so as to create a "fling" input, such an input may be taken as a sign that the user intends to pan a long way, so that the control may be generated in such a situation.
- the process reacts to the user input, such as a "fling" panning input, or by the input of subsequent panning inputs, by increasing the prominence of the input control.
- Such an action may involve increasing the size or brightness of the control, or, for example, pulsing the control.
- the prominence of the control may be increased only once, such as when a second panning input is received, or may proceed through multiple increasing phases up to a maximum point.
- the intent of increasing the prominence of the control is to bring to the user's attention the option of using an accelerated panning control, where the more the user tries to pan on the subject matter itself, the more the user is likely to pan, and the more they need help from the control.
- the process responds by quick panning the data in accordance with the user's manipulation of the control. For example, if the user slides the control downward, the display may move downward across a map or list of items at an exaggerated rate as the user watches. After a time of inaction — either of the user not selecting the control and/or the user not making a panning motion on the display that would normally bring up the control — the control may disappear, as shown at box 412.
- the control may, for example, be faded out so that the user may see any data that may have been located beneath the control.
- control may be brought back and the steps repeated.
- control will generally be located in a position that reflects the user's current view of the data area. For example, if the user is currently looking at the middle of a list of videos stored on her device, the control may be generated on the side of the display, midway between the top and bottom of the display.
- FIG. 4B shows a process for generating an accelerated panning control with respect to a list of graphically represented items, such as names of contacts, musical artists, or other similar groups of distinct data elements.
- the process is similar to the process shown in FIG. 4A, but involves more particular responses to user inputs.
- the process starts at box 420, where the process receives from a user a flick input (i.e., a fast movement followed by lifting of the finger or stylus) on a long list.
- a flick input i.e., a fast movement followed by lifting of the finger or stylus
- the process may then check the length of the list (boxes 422, 424) and if the list is not long (i.e., is not longer than the device display or is not substantially longer than the device display, such as many times as long as the display), the process may continue receiving input form the user (box 426).
- a thin panning control may be displayed on a display of the device (box 428), such as in the form of a scrolling handle along one edge of the display (generally the right edge, to avoid covering left-justified text in the list).
- the list may be scrolled in response to the flick, and the speed and distance of the scrolling may represent the movement of a physical object, so that the list continues to scroll after the flick, and slows gradually, as if it were being dragged down by friction.
- the control will move along the side of the display so that it reflects, by its location between the top and bottom of the display, the user's location (i.e., the display's location) between the top and bottom of the list.
- the process receives a second flick input from the user, and the list may scroll again, as it did after the first flick input.
- the fact that the user has flicked twice indicates that he or she may want to go very far down or up the list.
- the process thickens the display of the control so that the control will be more visually prominent to the user.
- the system also checks, at box 434, whether the user has selected the control (though it would generally be checking for such input anytime after the control is initially displayed), and the control fades away if the user does not select it or perform a flick of the subject matter for a determined period (box 436). If the user does select the control, the process thickens the control further so as to make it even easier for the user to manipulate, and then pans the display according to the user's manipulation of the control, such as in the various manners discussed above.
- FIGs. 4C-4D are flow charts of an example process for updating a display according to the motion of a mobile device.
- FIG. 4C shows, for example, a process by which a mobile device may respond to sensed motion of the mobile device.
- FIG. 4D show, for example, a process that shows example actions that can b performed by additional systems, outside the mobile device, that may be used to sense motion and update the display of the mobile device to reflect the detected motion.
- the process illustrated in FIG. 4C is described in reference to a mobile device or map application and the process illustrated in FIG. 4C is described in reference to a mobile device, a maps server, or a StreetView server, according to which system is responsible for particular steps of the process.
- the process starts at box 440, when a map application is launched.
- the map application may be launched automatically when the mobile device is booted.
- the map application may be bootstrapped to the mobile device's initialization routines.
- the map application may be launched by a user.
- the user can select an application icon on the display of the mobile device to launch the map application.
- another process or application may launch the map application.
- a social networking application may launch the map application when the social networking application presents locations of particular friends to the user.
- an address is received by the map application. This can be accomplished in any number of ways. For example, the user can input the address manually. As another example, a GPS device located on the mobile device may automatically provide an address.
- the map application can fetch and display map tiles around the received address.
- the map application can display one or more tiles that show buildings, parks, streets, or other locations on the mobile device.
- the map application can fetch and display StreetView images.
- a StreetView image is an image taken from the vantage point of a person, vehicle, and the like at street level.
- the user of the map application may need to specify the street for which the map application fetches and displays the StreetView images.
- a first image may be displayed that represents the digital image taken by the camera at the relevant point, facing at a radial angle the corresponds to the present direction that the mobile device is facing.
- the map application can sense motion of the mobile device.
- the sensing of motion is accomplished by communicating with one or more systems or modules included on the mobile device that are capable of detecting motion.
- the map application can communicate with an accelerometer, a compass, or other modules to sense motion of the mobile device.
- the map application pans the StreetView images to match the orientation of the user (i.e., the orientation of the mobile device). For example, in reference to FIG. 2B, StreetView images are presented on the displays 222a-222c of mobile device 200 according to the orientation of user 224-224C.
- a user of a mobile device can quickly get a view of an area, such as a shopping district that they are planning to visit, or a neighborhood of a friend where they expect to travel. They can obtain a more immersive experience of the location by holding their mobile device in front of them and turning in a circle while the images on the device pan to match their motion. As a result, the user can quickly see what an area will look like, and can decide whether to go there or not, or can more readily recognize the area when they arrive at it.

- the user can quickly see what an area will look like, and can decide whether to go there or not, or can more readily recognize the area when they arrive at it.
- search boxes are types of input controls that give a user of a process the ability to provide some information in the form of a query.
- a search box may be an editable text box or other user interface component.
- the mobile device receives an address input from the search box.
- a user may input an address into the search box (e.g., "HHH Metrodome” or "123 Main Street, Anytown, CA").
- an automated process may automatically provide the address.
- the map application may be configured with certain predefined addresses (e.g., the user's work, the user's home, or other addresses) which the map application can automatically provide to the mobile device upon request.
- a GPS module may determine the address of the mobile device according to a GPS calculation.
- the mobile device submits a formatted maps query.
- the maps query can be formatted for any number of application program interfaces (API).
- Example formatting includes, but is not limited to, any number of database query formats, common gateway interface (CGI) request formats, hypertext markup language (HTML) formats, or any other conventional formats for submitting queries.
- API application program interfaces
- the maps server receives the query and generates one or more results.
- the address may not be able to be resolved. That is, there may be more than one location with an address substantially similar to the one received from the mobile device.
- the maps server may generate multiple results, one for each result, and may provide feedback to the mobile device (and the user) to help disambiguate the result(s). In other implementations, the maps server may first disambiguate the address before generating a result.
- the maps server transmits the relevant map tiles and other data to the mobile device. For example, the maps server may transmit map tiles and data associated with the HHH Metrodome (e.g., images, advertisements, or other data).
- the mobile device displays the map around the submitted address.
- the mobile device can display buildings, streets, parks, or other aspects of the geography around the HHH Metrodome.

In some implementations, the image is comprised of multiple joined image files.
- the mobile device senses motion and updates the display to reflect that motion. For example, in response to a user shaking of the mobile device, the mobile device can move forward in the image space according to the amount of shaking detecting.
- the image can be panned laterally around the geographic location.
- Other updates according to the reflected motion are also possible, some of which have been described above.
- the mobile device may request additional images if, for example, the mobile device does not contain any images that correspond to the sensed motion. For example, if the mobile device is panned laterally beyond a certain point, the mobile device may need to communicate with the StreetView server to receive additional images.
- the StreetView server generates and transmits additional image data as requested by the mobile device.
- the StreetView server may use previous queries to pre-fetch certain images from the image repositories in anticipation of additional motion sensed by the mobile device. That is, the StreetView server may determine additional images that may be used by the mobile device sometime in the future according to the current motion of the mobile device and transmit the additional image data with the current request.

Also, the highlighting may not occur exactly upon a press, so that mere tapping of an item does not cause it to be highlighted; instead, the highlighting may occur upon the expiration of a short press period that is slightly more than the time period for a tap, but appreciably shorter than a long press period.
- the telephony manager 742 provides event notifications (such as phone state, network state, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) status, or voicemail status), allows access to state information (such as network information, SIM information, or voicemail presence), initiates calls, and queries and controls the call state.
