Fig. 3 A, 3B and 3C illustrate the embodiment of the various state flows for the hazard detector that detection unsafe condition is alleviated.
State flow 300A, 300B and 300C can be in some of hazard detector 100, hazard detector 200 or hazard detector
Implement in other embodiments.Fig. 3 A illustrate the state flow 300A of hazard detector, which has two states：
Non-alarm state 301 and alarm state 302.Non-alarm state 301 can also be referred to as standby or monitoring pattern.In non-alert shape
State 301 can be monitored dangerous presence.In non-alarm state 301, no alarm also no lamp that sounds is illuminated to refer to
It warns report.In alarm state 302, it can respectively be sounded by hazard detector and/or light the sense of hearing and/or visual alarm.It is endangering
Detected dangerous level can continue to be monitored in the environment of dangerous detector.If defined in the level drops to
Threshold quantity is hereinafter, then flow 310 can then make the state of hazard detector degrades to return to non-alarm state 301.
The progress of flow 310 can lead to the instruction that hazard detector output unsafe condition is alleviated.In some embodiments,
Other than detected dangerous level drops to threshold value or less, continues in flow 310 and then examined by danger
It surveys before the instruction that device output unsafe condition is alleviated, detected dangerous level may be required at predefined one section
It is interior to be maintained at threshold value hereinafter, this time be changed based on many factors.In some embodiments, flow 310 causes
By the synthesized speech information of hazard detector output, such as instruction " [hazard types] are alleviated ".[hazard types] can be with base
Change in detecting smog or carbon monoxide.As another example, hazard detector can indicate the hazard detector
The room being located therein.For example, the hazard detector can export " [hazard types] in [room] are alleviated ".It can before user
The room title of the hazard detector, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom etc. are installed to be provided for hazard detector.
Fig. 3 B illustrate the state flow 300B of hazard detector, and there are three types of states for hazard detector tool：Non-alert shape
State 301, alarm state 302 and alert status 303.In general, alert status and alarm state can be dangerous referred to as indicating
The state of situation (although amount is different).In non-alarm state 301, dangerous presence can be monitored.In non-alert
State 301, no alarm sound also no lamp be illuminated to instruction alarm.If detecting that dangerous amount is more than first threshold,
Then the state of hazard detector is upgraded to alert status 303.In alert status 303, can not sound the hazard detector
Complete alarm.However, it is possible to export such as speech that the danger level in indicative for environments has risen or risen to user
The message of message.In some embodiments, the suggestion of the danger level relating to how to cope with rising can be made to user.One
In a little embodiments, the lamp of hazard detector can be illuminated to indicate alert status.
If detected danger level declines in the ambient enviroment of the hazard detector, such as in first threshold amount
Below or in some other defined threshold quantity hereinafter, then flow 312 can continue the shape so that hazard detector
State is degraded to non-alarm state 301 from alert status 303.Flow 312 can lead to hazard detector output instruction unsafe condition
The message of alleviation.If the detected dangerous horizontal increase in the ambient enviroment of hazard detector, such as higher than second
Threshold quantity (is more than first threshold amount), then alert status 303 can be upgraded to alarm state 302.It, can in alarm state 302
To be sounded by hazard detector and/or be lighted the sense of hearing and/or visual alarm respectively.It is detected in the environment of hazard detector
Dangerous amount can continue to be monitored.
If dangerous amount drop to second threshold amount (or some other defined in threshold quantities) hereinafter, if flow
311 can continue so that the state degradation of hazard detector returns to alert status 303.Alternatively, flow 311 can be with
Continue so that the state of hazard detector is degraded to non-alarm state 301 from alarm state 302.Based on any one flow
311 or 313 generation, hazard detector can export the message that instruction unsafe condition is alleviated.Continue flow 313 still
311 can depend on dangerous level detected in the ambient enviroment of hazard detector has dropped how many.In some implementations
In example, only flow 312 and 313 can be used for so that the state of hazard detector degrades.In other embodiments, only 311 He of flow
312 can be used for so that the state of hazard detector degrades.The message that the instruction unsafe condition exported to user is alleviated can be referred to
Task arbitrary or all flow 311,312,313.For example, for flow 313, message can indicate unsafe condition
Start to alleviate, and can then indicate that unsafe condition is further alleviated for the message of flow 312.
It is identical as state flow 300A, in addition to requiring detected danger level to fall on one or more threshold quantities or less
So that the state of hazard detector degrades, detected danger level can be required to degrade it in the state of hazard detector
It is preceding that the threshold quantity or less is maintained at least a period of time.This time can be discussed based on such as the method 600 about Fig. 6
It is one or more because usually determining.
Fig. 3 C illustrate the state flow 300C of hazard detector, and there are four types of states for hazard detector tool：Non-alert shape
State 301, alarm state 302, the first alert status 304 and the second alert status 305.It, can be to danger in non-alarm state 301
Presence be monitored.In non-alarm state 301, no alarm sound also no lamp be illuminated to instruction alarm.If detection
It is more than first threshold to dangerous amount, then the state of hazard detector upgrades to the first alert status 304.In the first alert status
304, the complete alarm for the hazard detector that can not sound is not also shinny.However, it is possible to export the danger in indicative for environments to user
The message for such as speech information that danger level is rising.In some embodiments, it can be made to user relating to how to cope with
The suggestion of the danger level of rising.In some embodiments, the lamp of hazard detector can be illuminated to indicate the first early warning shape
State 304.
If detected danger level declines in the ambient enviroment of the hazard detector, such as in first threshold amount
Below or in some other defined threshold quantity hereinafter, then flow 315 can continue the shape so that hazard detector
State is degraded to non-alarm state 301 from the first alert status 304.Flow 315 can cause hazard detector output instruction dangerous
The message that situation is alleviated.If in the ambient enviroment of hazard detector it is detected it is dangerous it is horizontal increase, such as higher than
Second threshold amount, then the first alert status 304 can be upgraded to the second alert status 305.In the second alert status 305, still
The complete alarm for the hazard detector that can not so sound is not also shinny.However, it is possible to export the danger in indicative for environments to user
Danger is horizontal still to synthesize or records the message of message in such as speech of rising.The message can than with the first alert status 304
Associated message is more urgent.In some embodiments, it can be made to user relating to how to cope with the danger for continuing to rise
Horizontal suggestion.In some embodiments, the lamp of hazard detector can be illuminated to indicate the second alert status 305.
If detected danger level increases to third threshold quantity or more, the second alert status 305 can be risen
Grade is to alarm state 306.In alarm state 302, it can respectively be sounded by hazard detector and/or light the sense of hearing and/or vision
Alarm.Detected dangerous level can continue to be monitored in the environment of hazard detector.
Flow 314,315,316,317,318 and 319 indicates the various flows that the state of hazard detector degrades.At some
In embodiment, when detected danger level is reduced to threshold value or less, which can be degraded to non-police
Report state 301.In other embodiments, which can be less than one or more threshold quantities based on detected
Danger level and its state is degraded through one or more alert status.For example, due to the ring around hazard detector
Detected danger level declines in border, and alarm state 306 can be degraded to the second alert status according to flow 317
305, the second alert status 305 can follow flow 316 and be degraded to the first alert status 304, and the first alert status
304 can be degraded to non-alarm state 301 via flow 315.In addition, according to detected danger level, can jump
Cross various states.For example, alarm state 306 can be degraded to the first alert status 304 via flow 318.Similarly,
Two alert status 305 can be degraded to non-alarm state via flow 319.Alarm state 306 can also be via flow 314
And directly it is degraded to non-alarm state 301.
It is used to determine when that the threshold value that the state of hazard detector is degraded is to be used to determine when to make
Obtain the same threshold value of the state upgrading of hazard detector.It is, for example, possible to use should be degraded to the second alert status 305
Same threshold value when the first alert status 304 determines when the first alert status 304 should be upgraded to the second early warning shape
State 305.Alternatively, the threshold value for alloing state to upgrade and degrade is varied from mutually.It is, for example, possible to use first
Threshold value determines when the first alert status 304 should be upgraded to the second alert status 305, but can use the second threshold
Value (size be less than first threshold) determines when the second alert status 305 should be degraded to the first alert status 304.
By export with indicate unsafe condition alleviate message can with all or arbitrary flow 314,315,316,317,
318 and 319 is associated.In some embodiments, it may be possible to one alleviation message of output be only wanted to, such as in the shape of hazard detector
When state is degraded to non-alarm state 301.It has begun to alleviate in further embodiments it is possible to want instruction unsafe condition, such as
In flow 316 or flow 317, and another message that can then there is instruction unsafe condition further to alleviate, such as
In flow 315.
It is identical as flow 300A and 300B, in addition to require detected danger level fall on one or more threshold quantities with
Under, so that the state of hazard detector degrades, detected danger level can be required to be dropped in the state of hazard detector
The threshold quantity or less is maintained at least a period of time before grade.This time can be based on such as about 600 institute of the method for Fig. 6
What is discussed is one or more because usually determining.
Although not illustrated in Fig. 3 C or any other state flow, state may upgrade and skip
One or more of the other state.For example, if detecting sufficiently high danger level, non-alarm state 301 can directly rise
Grade is to alarm state 306.State flow 300A, 300B and 300C focus on respectively there are two types of tools, the danger of three kinds and four kinds states
Dangerous detector.It should be understood that in other embodiments, greater number of state is also possible.In some embodiments,
Hazard detector can have the state of different number according to detected hazard types.For example, state flow 300A can
To be used when detecting carbon monoxide, and state flow 300B or 300C can then be used when detecting smog.
Hazard detector can use the state being described in detail about Fig. 3 A-3C to execute various methods.Fig. 4, which is illustrated, to be used for
Detect the embodiment of the method 400 of the alleviation of unsafe condition.Method 400 can use hazard detector 100, hazard detector
200 or some other embodiments of hazard detector execute.It can be by hazard detector as each step 1 of method 400
To execute.Through method 400, the one or more sensors of hazard detector can continue to monitor and measure hazard detector
The amount of the unsafe condition of such as smog and/or carbon monoxide in ambient enviroment.
In step 405, it may be determined that unsafe condition present in the environment of hazard detector.Such determination can be based on
The amount for the unsafe condition measured by one or more being compared with the threshold value stored and make.The danger can be related to
To there are smog-, it may indicate that on fire, carbon monoxide, or to there is the inhabitation in the structure of installation hazard detector
There may be dangerous some other situations or compound by person.In step 405, hazard detector can be from the hazard detector
One or more sensors receive the measurement to dangerous amount detected in the environment of the hazard detector.In response to being surveyed
The amount of the unsafe condition of amount is more than threshold value, and method 400 can continue to step 410.Otherwise, if hazard detector simultaneously
The unmeasured amount to unsafe condition, then the hazard detector can continue monitoring until detect such unsafe condition.
In step 410, the state of hazard detector can be set to indicate dangerous situation.Referring back to Fig. 3 A-
3C, step 410 can be related to hazard detector and be arranged to alert status or alarm state from non-alarm state.Hazard detection
The instruction of the current state of device can be stored by the processing system of hazard detector, and such as storage is arrived associated with state engine
Non-transitory storage medium.While the subsequent step of step 410 and method 400 is performed, hazard detector can be with
Continue to monitor the danger in the ambient enviroment of the hazard detector.
In step 415, hazard detector can determine the amount of the unsafe condition in ambient enviroment at present below threshold value.
The determination can be based on the one or more measurements carried out to danger level after executing step 405.Therefore, hazard detection
The amount of unsafe condition in the environment of device may be declined from step 405.It is used for determining hazard detection in step 405
The threshold value of dangerous situation can be identical as the threshold quantity used in the analysis of step 415 in the ambient enviroment of device.It can
Alternatively, used threshold value can be different.For example, the size of the threshold quantity used in step 415 can be less than
It is used for determining the threshold quantity of dangerous situation in step 405.
In step 420, unsafe condition amount below threshold value after, the measurement of unsafe condition therebetween can be protected always
It holds and is tracked in threshold value a period of time below.If the detected dangerous amount in the ambient enviroment of hazard detector
Be more than threshold value, then the period can be reset.
Whether the alarm of hazard detector sounds during step 415 and 420 can depend at step 410 being arranged
State is alert status or alarm state.If it is alarm state, then hazard detector can be in execution step 415 and 420
When export one or more sense of hearings and/or visual alarm.If it is alert status, then the hazard detector can not take action
Or the prompting (early warning information) that instruction hazard detector is in alert status can be exported.It is carried if outputed in alert status
It wakes up (early warning information), then the prompting may be less compared with the sense of hearing of the hazard detector under alarm state and/or visual output
Bother loudly and/or less user.For example, the prompting (early warning information) can be if showing " reminding, danger level rises "
Sound message.
In step 425, it may be determined that be at least up to threshold duration in this time that step 420 is tracked.
The threshold duration can be stored by hazard detector.For example, the threshold duration can be based on dangerous type.Such as
Fruit determines that there are smog, then can use the first threshold duration in step 405.If determining that there are an oxygen in step 405
Change carbon, then can in addition use the second threshold duration.In some embodiments, different from defining stored threshold duration
Time, the hazard detector can be based on it is one or more because usually calculating or changing in other ways the threshold duration,
At least some of above-mentioned factor is discussed about Fig. 6.
In step 430, hazard detector can export one or more instructions of unsafe condition alleviation.Step 430 it is defeated
Go out to be determined in response to this time to have reached the threshold duration of step 425 and execute.What unsafe condition was alleviated
Instruction may include：Auditory message may include speech information, and visually indicate, such as light usually not with danger
The lamp of the hazard detector of associated color, the color such as green or blue.In addition, extremely in response to this time
Reach the threshold duration of step 425 less, the state of the hazard detector can such as be dropped according to the embodiment of Fig. 3 A-3C
Grade.For example, from alarm state, hazard detector can be degraded to non-alarm state or alert status.If hazard detector
It is arranged to alert status in step 410, then the hazard detector can be set to non-alarm state.In addition, in some realities
