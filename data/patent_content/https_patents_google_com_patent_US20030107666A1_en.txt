When Nonlinear Mapping is used the dynamic range of the sensor is maximized. Nonlinear Mapping is used in the examples described below.
- the line labeled P 1 shows the relationship between integration time and photo-voltage for light with optical power P 1 .
- the photo-voltage reaches the reference voltage V ref , and the output from the comparator ( 110 in FIG. 1) switches value.
- the global counter is latched into the pixel data buffer ( 114 in FIG. 1).

- the photo-voltage reaches the reference voltage Vref, and the global counter value is latched into the pixel data buffer. If the voltage reference is increased, a longer integration time will be required. If the voltage reference is decreased, a shorter integration time will be required. Even when no light is incident upon the photo-detector, small currents and voltages will be present in the sensor because of electrical noise. Voltage levels below the voltage noise floor will be undetectable, so the minimum voltage reference level is determined by the voltage noise floor. There is an upper limit to the amount of charge that can be stored by the capacitor. The voltage corresponding to this maximum charge is called the saturation voltage. The maximum voltage reference level V max is determined by the saturation voltage.
- the integration time t i may be determined directly from the global counter value if the global counter value is set to zero at the start of the integration time. Otherwise, the integration time may be determined from the difference between the counter value at the end of the integration N i and the counter value N 0 at the start of the integration.
- Pixel data memory decoder 116 is also used to couple the global counter or code generator 118 to the individual pixel sensors.
- T frame is the time between consecutive video frames, or the maximum allowable integration time. Below this intensity, the counter will not be latched within the frame period.
- the intraframe dynamic range of an image may be adjusted by varying the reference voltage V ref during a single frame. As shown in FIG. 2, to obtain the maximum possible dynamic range V ref may vary such that it equals V max at time equaling T clock and equals V min at time equaling T frame .
- the maximum dynamic range is 106 dB if V ref is constant. If, in addition, the reference voltage is varied in the range 300 ⁇ V-1.5V, and an additional 74 dB of dynamic range is added, this gives a total range of 180 dB.

Abstract
Description
- This invention relates generally to techniques and apparatus for image sensing, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for obtaining a digital measurement of a photo-current.
- A major problem in imaging is the limited dynamic range of image sensor arrays. As a result, some portions of the image may be saturated while other portions are under exposed. A typical photodiode optical detector, such a charge-coupled device (CCD), consists of an array of pn junction photodiodes. Each photodiode has a capacitance associated with it, and when light falls on the detector the resulting photo-current charges the capacitance. The charge is thus the time integral of the light intensity falling on the detector. The CCD periodically and sequentially switches the charge to a video line, resulting in a series of pulses, which can be converted into a voltage signal representing the light pattern incident on the array. If the integration time is too long, the device will saturate. If the integration time is too short, the voltage signal will be lost in the noise of the device.
- One approach to adjusting sensitivity is therefore to adjust the integration time according to the intensity of light falling on the array. This can be done globally for the whole array by adjusting the switching rate, for example. This allows the array to adjust for various light levels (as in adjusting the exposure time of an analog camera), but does not increase the dynamic range within a single image.
- Another approach is to measure the time taken for the capacitor voltage to reach a reference level. An example of such a system is given in “Intensity Mappings Within The Context Of Near-Sensor Image Processing”, by Anders Åström, Robert Forchheimer and Per-Erik Danielsson, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Vol. 1, No. 12, December 1998. A large time indicates a low intensity of light falling on the array, while a short time indicates a high intensity. The voltage reference level is common to the whole array, but may be adjusted according to the overall intensity falling on the array. This approach is computationally intensive, since the integration time is measured by interrogating the output from a comparator at predetermined intervals. These intervals need to be very close together for accurate measurement. This approach also requires each pixel to have a readout circuit. In addition, each sensor element requires a precharge transistor.
- A further device called a “Locally Autoadaptive TFA Sensor” is described in “High Dynamic Range Image Sensors In Thin Film On Asic Technology For Automotive Applications”, by M. Böhm et al., inAdvanced Microsystems for Automotive Applications, D. E. Ricken, W. Gessner (Eds), Springer Verlag, Berlin, pp 157-172, 1998. In this device, the integration time is adapted for each individual pixel according to the local illumination intensity. The capacitor voltage is compared after an initial integration time to a reference voltage that is slightly less than half of the saturation voltage. If the voltage is less than the reference voltage, the integration time is doubled. This process is repeated until the reference voltage is exceeded. Thus, saturation of the capacitor is avoided and the integration time is extended to avoid under exposure. The final voltage and the integration time are together used to determine the illumination intensity. This approach requires circuitry to compare and adjust the integration time and circuitry to measure the voltage at the end of the integration time.
- In light of the foregoing discussion, it can be seen that there is still a need in the art to have image sensor arrays resulting in an image representative of the intensity distribution of an object such that portions of the image are not saturated or underexposed.
- The features of the invention believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention itself however, both as to organization and method of operation, together with objects and advantages thereof, may be best understood by reference to the following detailed description of the invention, which describes certain exemplary embodiments of the invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a photodiode sensor, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a graph of showing photo-voltage as function of integration time for a photodiode sensor, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a system utilizing a photodiode sensor array, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention.

- FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing a further method of sensing optical power in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 6 is a graph showing photo-voltage as function of integration time for a photodiode sensor, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention.
- While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail specific embodiments, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an example of the principles of the invention and not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments shown and described. In the description below, like reference numerals are used to describe the same, similar or corresponding parts in the several views of the drawings.
- Referring now to FIG. 1, a time-integrating
pixel architecture 100 of a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown. Thepixel architecture 100 comprises a photo-detector 102 and afloating diffusion capacitor 104 with capacitance Cfd. In operation, the photo-current charges the floating diffusion capacitor and produces a photo-voltage 106. The charge is allowed to move directly from the photo-detector to the diffusion capacitor without the use of a transfer gate. The photo-voltage 106, sensed by the floating diffusion capacitor, and areference voltage 108 are supplied as inputs tocomparator 110. If the system is reset at time t=0, the voltage V across the capacitor at time t is the time integral of the photo-current i, which is given by -

-
- That is, after an integration time ti the photo-voltage 106 sensed by the floating diffusion capacitor and the
reference voltage 108 are equal. In the pixel architecture shown in FIG. 1, a global counter orcode generator 118 is reset at time t=0. When the photo-voltage 106 exceeds thereference voltage 108 for a particular pixel, theoutput 112 from thecomparator 110 changes value. At that time the global counter value or code value is latched and stored in the associatedpixel data buffer 114. Latching the counter or code values avoids the need to interrogate the comparator output. In the preferred embodiment, the counter or code value is stored as a 10-bit value in thepixel data buffer 114. However, different size buffers may be used. Generally, larger buffers are more expensive but provide greater accuracy. One latch is used for each bit in the buffer and is assumed in the figure to be an integral part of the buffer. - The apparatus shown in FIG. 1 provides a direct digital value (the counter or code value) related to the illumination intensity. This is in contrast to prior systems in which an analog voltage is sensed and then converted to digital value using an analog-to-digital converter. The simplicity of the system of the present invention compared to prior systems allows for sensors that are both smaller and cheaper.
- In FIG. 1, only a single pixel sensor is shown. However, it is envisioned that an array of pixel sensors will be integrated in a single device, such as a CMOS device, may be utilized in conjunction with the present invention. Pixel
data memory decoder 116 is used to decode the data from individual pixels sensors and send it to a processor (not shown). - FIG. 2 is a graph showing photo-voltage as a function of integration time for a photodiode sensor of the present invention. In this embodiment the reference voltage is varied as a function of time. Two examples of the time-variation of the reference voltage are shown in FIG. 2. The first is denoted by the dashed line labeled “Linear Mapping;” the second is denoted by the line labeled “Nonlinear Mapping”. “Linear Mapping” may be chosen to provide a linear relationship between the stored digital codes and the power. When Nonlinear Mapping is used the dynamic range of the sensor is maximized. Nonlinear Mapping is used in the examples described below. The line labeled P1 shows the relationship between integration time and photo-voltage for light with optical power P1. In the preferred embodiment, the global counter or code generator (118 in FIG. 1) is set to zero at time t=0. At time t1, the photo-voltage reaches the reference voltage Vref, and the output from the comparator (110 in FIG. 1) switches value. At this time, the global counter is latched into the pixel data buffer (114 in FIG. 1). At a later time, the photo-voltage will reach the saturation level Vsat. The line labeled P2 shows the relationship between integration time and photo-voltage for light with optical power P2, which is less than P1. At time t2, the photo-voltage reaches the reference voltage Vref, and the output from the comparator (110 in FIG. 1) switches value. At this time, the global counter is latched into the pixel data buffer (114 in FIG. 1). Thus, when light with a lower optical power falls on the photo-detector, the integration time taken to reach the reference voltage is increased. The integration time taken to reach the reference voltage is therefore inversely proportional to the intensity or the optical power. Similarly, the line labeled P3 shows the relationship between integration time and photo-voltage for light with optical power P3, which is less than P1 or P2. At time t3, the photo-voltage reaches the reference voltage Vref, and the global counter value is latched into the pixel data buffer. If the voltage reference is increased, a longer integration time will be required. If the voltage reference is decreased, a shorter integration time will be required. Even when no light is incident upon the photo-detector, small currents and voltages will be present in the sensor because of electrical noise. Voltage levels below the voltage noise floor will be undetectable, so the minimum voltage reference level is determined by the voltage noise floor. There is an upper limit to the amount of charge that can be stored by the capacitor. The voltage corresponding to this maximum charge is called the saturation voltage. The maximum voltage reference level Vmax is determined by the saturation voltage.

data memory decoder 116 is also used to couple the global counter orcode generator 118 to the individual pixel sensors. -

- For example, for a 50 Hz frame rate and a 10 MHz clock, the maximum dynamic range is 106 dB if Vref is constant. If, in addition, the reference voltage is varied in the range 300 μV-1.5V, and an additional 74 dB of dynamic range is added, this gives a total range of 180 dB.

- The relative error is therefore inversely proportional to n. Large intensities will have the largest relative error. The error can be reduced by making n larger. This, in turn, can be achieved by increasing the clock (counter) speed or by raising the reference voltage.
- Referring to FIG. 3, the individual pixel sensors are preferably arranged in an
array 302. Each element of the array comprises a photo-detector, a floating diffusion capacitor electrically coupled to the photo-detector and a comparator. The comparator has a first input for receiving a reference voltage, a second input electrically coupled to the floating diffusion capacitor and an output. Each element also includes a pixel data buffer, which may be a random access memory (RAM). The pixel array is addressed in a manner similar to that used to address standard memory (DRAM, SRAM, etc). Each column of pixels is preferably connected to its own data bus. A row address is sent to a pixelrow address decoder 304 that selects a particular row of pixels using word lines 314. Pixelcolumn address decoder 306 also includes a data decoder that may be used to receive data from or transmit data to selected columns of pixels, according to the selected row. This allows individual pixels to be addressed, so that data can be “written into” or “read out of” the pixels via pixel bit lines 316. Aglobal sequencer 312 is coupled to thesystem controller 310. The global sequencer generates lookup table addresses 324 and 334 that are passed to lookup tables 326 and 334. Lookup table 1, 326, is used to convert the lookup table addresses 324 into voltage reference values that are passed to a digital to analog converter (DAC) 328. TheDAC 328 in turn generates thereference voltage 108 that is passed to thepixel array 302. Lookup table 2, 334, is used to convert actual counter values into system appropriate digital code values that are passed to the pixels via thepixel column decoder 306. The digital code values need not be linearly related to the actual counter values. The digital code values may correspond to the optical power level associated with each counter value for a given voltage reference. This avoids the need to compute the optical power levels later. In addition, apixel timing controller 308 is coupled to the row and column decoders to control the timing of access to the individual elements of the array. The pixel bit data is sensed by thecolumn decoder 306 via bit-lines 316 and the data is sent as a multiplexeddata stream 322 to the image processor andsystem controller 310. The image processor performs the conversion from integration time to optical power for each of the pixel sensors and may perform other image processing functions, such as color processing or compression. Data representing the processed image is output from the image processor at 318. The conversion may be performed via a lookup table or via a calculation or by a combination thereof. The system controller, included in 310, provides pixel array timing andcontrol signals 320 that are passed to a pixel timing andcontrol unit 308. The pixel timing andcontrol unit 308 controls thepixel row decoder 304 and thepixel column decoder 306. The system controller, included in 310, also provides control of the global counter orcode generator 312. - A flow chart depicting one embodiment of the method of the current invention is shown in FIG. 4. Operation begins at
start block 402. The pixel sensor is reset atblock 404, by discharging the floating diffusion capacitor for example. The output from the photo-detector is integrated atblock 406. If a floating diffusion capacitor is used, the photo-detector output current is integrated by the capacitor to produce a photo-voltage. Atdecision block 408 the photo-voltage is compared with a reference voltage. If the photo-voltage is less than the reference voltage as depicted by the positive branch fromdecision block 408, the current value of a global counter or code generator (which is supplied to the pixel sensor) is stored into a pixel data buffer atblock 410. Flow then continues todecision block 412. If the photo-voltage is greater than the reference voltage, as depicted by the negative branch fromdecision block 408, the flow continues to block 412.Decision block 408 may be implemented as a comparator. Thus the last value stored in the pixel data buffer will be the counter value at which the photo-voltage reaches the reference voltage. The value is thus latched into the pixel data buffer. Atdecision block 412, a check is made to determine if the maximum time for integration has been exceeded. If the maximum time has been exceeded, as depicted by the positive branch fromdecision block 412, the pixel data buffer is read. If the maximum time has not been exceeded, as depicted by the negative branch fromdecision block 412, the system waits until the time has been exceeded. Atblock 414, the pixel data buffer is read, whether or not the reference voltage has been reached. Atblock 416, the optical power is determined from the counter value read from the pixel data buffer (or zero if the reference voltage was not reached). This determination may be performed in an integrated processor or in a processor external to the sensor array. The determination may use the calculation - as described above.
- An alternative embodiment of the method of the invention is shown in FIG. 5. Operation begins at
start block 402. The pixel sensor is reset atblock 404, by discharging the floating diffusion capacitor for example. The output from the photo-detector is integrated atblock 406. If a floating diffusion capacitor is used, the photo-detector output current is integrated by the capacitor to produce a photo-voltage. Atdecision block 422 the photo-voltage is compared with a reference voltage. If the photo-voltage is greater than the reference voltage as depicted by the positive branch from decision block 423, the current value of a global counter (which is supplied to the pixel sensor) is stored into a pixel data buffer atblock 410. Atdecision block 424, a check is made to determine if the maximum time for integration has been exceeded. If the maximum time has been exceeded, as depicted by the positive branch fromdecision block 412, the pixel data buffer is read atblock 414. If the maximum time has not been exceeded, as depicted by the negative branch fromdecision block 424, the system waits until the time has been exceeded. If the photo-voltage is less than the reference voltage, as depicted by the negative branch fromdecision block 422, flow continues to block 412.Decision block 408 may be implemented as a comparator. Thus the value stored in the pixel data buffer will be the counter value at which the photo-voltage reaches the reference voltage. Atdecision block 412, a check is made to determine if the maximum time for integration has been exceeded. If the maximum time has been exceeded, as depicted by the positive branch fromdecision block 412, the pixel data buffer is read. If the maximum time has not been exceeded, as depicted by the negative branch fromdecision block 412, the system waits until the time has been exceeded. Atblock 414, the pixel data buffer is read, whether or not the reference voltage has been reached. Atblock 416, the optical power is determined from the counter value read from the pixel data buffer (or zero if the reference voltage was not reached). The calculation may be performed by use of a lookup table indexed by the counter difference Ni-N0, or indexed by the integration time calculated from the counter difference. - Another benefit of varying Vref during the frame is the capability of changing the range of light intensity levels accessed by a specific set of successive digital codes representing integration times. This allows the sensitivity of the sensor to be changed. This is accomplished by decreasing or increasing the average slope of Vref for that set of codes to, respectively, increase or decrease the range of accessible intensity levels. This is illustrated in FIG. 6. FIG. 6 shows a graph of voltage as a function of integration time. The integration time is represented by a digital code denoted by the variable n. Light with intensity P0 reaches the reference voltage Vref1 or Vref2 at a time denoted by the digital code m. If the voltage reference is varied as a function of time in accordance with the curve Vref1(n), light with intensity P1 reaches the reference voltage Vref1(m+k) at a time denoted by the digital code m+k. On the other hand, if the voltage reference is varied as a function of time in accordance with the curve Vref2(n), light with intensity P2 reaches the reference voltage Vref2(m+k) at a time denoted by the digital code m+k. Hence, if the voltage reference is varied as a function of time in accordance with the curve Vref1(n), the digital codes m to m+k represent light with intensities from P1 to P0, while if the voltage reference is varied as a function of time in accordance with the curve Vref2(n), the digital codes m to m+k represent light with intensities from P2 to P0. The average slope of the curve Vref1(n) is greater than that of Vref2(n), and consequently the sensitivity of a sensor using voltage reference function Vref1(n) will be higher.
