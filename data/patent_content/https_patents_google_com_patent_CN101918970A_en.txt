In some embodiments, Advertising Management System 104 can be bought the use to many unique first telephone numbers 132.Advertising Management System 104 can be associated these first telephone numbers with advertiser 102 second telephone number 134 uniquely, and shows these first telephone numbers on based on the advertisement that is used for advertiser 102 of web.Therefore, when first telephone number 132 is called out, route the call to Advertising Management System 104, and be routed to advertiser's actual phone number (second telephone number 134) then.
In some embodiments, first telephone number 132 can comprise the universal telephone number that has many extension sets.Therefore, can be associated with same universal telephone number more than an advertiser 102 or other entity.Yet, each extension set is only distributed to an entity.Therefore, for first telephone number 132 of the universal telephone number that has extension set for this telephone number and extension set associated advertisement master 102 be unique.For example, telephone number " 888-888-8888 " can be associated more than an advertiser 102; But telephone number " 888-888-8888, ext.123 " only is associated with an advertiser 102.
In some embodiments, can use first telephone number 132 to follow the tracks of the user and whether get in touch advertiser 102 because of checking by the advertisement of exhaling logical engine 130 to provide.For example, if the user gets in touch advertiser 102 by dialing first telephone number, then exhale logical engine 130 can determine that the user has checked based on first telephone number 132 in the advertisement of web.Yet,,, do not see the advertisement that shows first telephone number 132 probably based on web so can infer the user owing in advertisement, do not list second telephone number if the user gets in touch the advertiser by dialing second telephone number 134.
For example, suppose that advertiser A has the telephone number (that is second telephone number) " 222-222-2222 " that is associated.Exhale logical engine 130 first telephone number " 111-111-1111 " can be associated with advertiser A.There is not other entity to be associated with first telephone number " 111-111-1111 ".Can with advertiser A associated advertisement in list first telephone number " 111-111-1111 ".When the user uses first telephone number " 111-111-1111 " to call out advertiser A, can route the call to Advertising Management System 104.Exhale logical engine 130 can determine and the first telephone number associated advertisement master, for example advertiser A.Exhale logical engine 130 can determine second telephone number that is associated with the advertiser, for example " 222-222-2222 ", and can route the call to second telephone number " 222-222-2222 " that is associated with the advertiser of advertisement.
In some embodiments, routing engine 130 can determine whether to exhale interpreter's part in response to receiving situation about dialing to the calling of first telephone number 132.Exhaling interpreter's part can be for example to give the incident of first number 132 more than pre-determined number based on calling number with call placement.Exhale logical engine 130 for example to determine whether to exhale interpreter's part by at first discerning the calling number that is associated with the initiation of calling out.If calling number has initiated to surpass the calling of the predetermined threshold number of initiating to first phone 132, then exhale logical engine 130 can get rid of the generation of exhaling interpreter part of identification for second telephone number 134.If calling number does not initiate to surpass the calling of the predetermined threshold number of initiating to first phone 132, then exhale logical engine 130 can discern the generation of exhaling interpreter's part for second telephone number 134.
For example, also hypothesis exhales logical engine 130 to determine that the number of thresholds of initiating is five in the above example.Therefore, calling number can be initiated five times or the still less calling of number of times to first telephone number " 111-111-1111 ", exhales interpreter's part so that each calling is identified as for second telephone number " 222-222-2222 ".For example, if calling number " 888-888-8888 " has been initiated to call out more than five times to first telephone number " 111-111-1111 ", then exhale logical engine 130 to call out the back and get rid of the generation of exhaling interpreter part of identification for second telephone number " 222-222-2222 " at the 5th time.In some embodiments, if do not exhale interpreter's part, then do not route the call to second telephone number 134.
Can use threshold value to limit to get rid of improper charge to advertiser 102.Typically, advertiser 102 can provide advertiser's physical number for calling out in the future to the caller.Yet not every caller can call out advertiser's physical number, and for example the caller can print the advertisement that shows on computers.Therefore, Advertising Management System 104 can utilize threshold value to determine to avoid improper charge to advertiser 102.
In some embodiments, if do not satisfy the number of thresholds of initiating as yet, then route the call to second telephone number 134.For example, the number of thresholds that can initiate is set to ten.Therefore, calling number can be initiated ten times to first telephone number 132 and call out, and exhales logical engine 130 can route the call to second telephone number 1,340 times.When the tenth call, owing to surpassed the quantity of initiating, for example ten, so exhale logical engine 130 can not route the call to second telephone number 134.In the variant of these embodiments,, exhale logical engine 130 can announce advertiser 102 physical number 134 to the caller for the calling that surpasses the number of thresholds of initiating.For example, suppose that calling number " 888-888-8888 " initiated five times to first telephone number " 111-111-1111 " and called out, and the maximum quantity of initiating is five.When calling out for the 6th time, exhale logical engine 130 to provide second telephone number to the calling party, rather than route the call to second telephone number " 222-222-2222 " by announcement second telephone number " 222-222-2222 " during calling out.Therefore, can not route the call to second telephone number 134.
In some embodiments,, and receive engaged signal, then do not cause initiating, therefore exhale logical not owing to the call of being attempted if route the call to second telephone number 134.In this embodiment, be taken as initiation in order to make to call out, the calling party must be by the people or by replying machine or service response.
In some embodiments, if first telephone number 132 does not initiate to surpass the calling of the number of thresholds of initiating as yet to second telephone number 132, then exhale logical engine 130 can route the call to second telephone number 134.To call out when first telephone number 132 is routed to second telephone number 134, the quantity of initiation can increase once to be initiated at every turn.In some embodiments, even the engaged signal of receiving owing to routed the call to second telephone number 134, can cause initiating.
In some embodiments, exhale logical engine 130 only in scheduled time slot, first telephone number 132 to be associated with second telephone number 134.For example, advertiser's actual phone number can be associated with unique telephone number in a week or January.After scheduled time slot finishes, exhale logical engine 130 can make first telephone number 132 lose related with second phone 134.Therefore, the user can not call out first telephone number and get in touch with the advertiser.After finishing, scheduled time slot first telephone number can be associated with the 3rd telephone number 136 then.Can be for example " rest period "-for example with previous advertiser's 102 first telephone number 132 lose latter two related month-after the 3rd telephone number 136 is associated with different advertiser 102.Dormancy is included in to get rid of in the scheduled time slot this telephone number is associated with another second telephone number 134 to telephone number.For example, in case it is related that first telephone number 132 and second telephone number 134 are lost, then first telephone number 132 can be by dormancy, and can not be used in a period of time.Therefore, first telephone number 132 can be associated with any advertiser 102 at this time durations.
For example, suppose first telephone number 132 is associated with second telephone number 134 of advertiser B, and should association only continue one month.After this moon finished, first and second telephone numbers lost association each other.Therefore, first telephone number 132 no longer is associated with advertiser B.At this moment, can be freely first telephone number 132 be associated with different advertiser 102, or can makes first telephone number 132 be in time dormancy several months as an alternative.Can immediately or after rest period first telephone number be associated with the 3rd telephone number 136 that for example belongs to advertiser C.
In some embodiments, in response to routing the call to second telephone number 134, can be to collecting every capital sum of calling out into second telephone number, 134 associated advertisement masters 102.For example, when routing the call to second telephone number 134, can collect every capital sum of calling out into to the advertiser at every turn.Every capital sum of calling out into can for example comprise that advertiser 102 is because of customer call first telephone number 132 and make to call out and be routed to second telephone number 134 and route the call to the amount of money of paying under advertiser's the situation that be associated or the physical number or second telephone number 132.In some embodiments, even route the call to second telephone number 134 and receive engaged signal, can collect every capital sum of calling out into to advertiser 102.
In some embodiments, though routing call, if the engaged signal of receiving, then could be to collecting every capital sum of calling out into second telephone number, 134 associated advertisement masters 102.In some embodiments, if answer service or machine answer the call, then collect every part through reducing of calling out into capital sum to the advertiser.
