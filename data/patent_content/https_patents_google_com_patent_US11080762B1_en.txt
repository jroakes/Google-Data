Definitions
- This specification relates to content item auction bidding.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, for example, webpages, images, audio files, and videos. Such access to these resources has likewise enabled opportunities for providing relevant additional content.
- additional content is advertisements.
- resources of particular interest to a user can be identified by a search engine in response to a user query. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, it is possible to provide relevant advertisements (or other content items) to the user with search results.
- Another way to distribute content items to users is remarketing, which allows content item providers to choose particular content items to be shown to users who have performed certain actions, such as visiting a web page of the content item provider. For example, an advertiser can choose a particular advertisement to be provided to users who have recently visited the advertiser's website. As these users are likely interested in the advertiser's offerings, they are likely to be interested in the advertised product or service.
- multiple content item providers compete to have their content items provided to users. For example, advertisers may set bids for particular advertisements, and advertisement auctions may be conducted, where the advertisements of the winning bidders are provided to users.
- This specification describes technologies relating to content item auction bidding.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a request for a content item, the request including request data describing one or more request feature values and data indicating a device identifier, the device identifier being included in a remarketing list that associates timestamps with device identifiers of user devices that have performed one or more actions to be included in the remarketing list; obtaining a predicted performance measure for a remarketing content item associated with the remarketing list based on a first timestamp and a second timestamp, the first timestamp being included in the remarketing list and associated with the device identifier included in the request, and the second timestamp being for the request; determining a bid adjustment value based, at least in part, on the first timestamp and the second timestamp; obtaining a remarketing bid for the remarketing content item, the remarketing bid specifying an amount a content item provider associated with the remarketing list is willing to pay for distribution of
- Determining the bid adjustment value may comprise: accessing data specifying bins associated with the remarketing list, each bin corresponding to a unique combination of remarketing signal values, and each bin having a corresponding predicted performance measure and bid adjustment value; selecting one of the bins based on a comparison of the remarketing signal values of the bins to request feature values described by the request data and the first and second timestamps; and determining that the bid adjustment value for the remarketing content item is the bid adjustment value of the selected bin.
- Each bin of the remarketing list may be ranked according to the predicted performance measure for the bin relative to the predicted performance measure of each other bin of the remarketing list; and the bid adjustment value of the selected bin may be based on a rank of the selected bin and a rank limit that specifies a particular rank of one of the bins of the remarketing list.
- the bid adjustment value for the selected bin may be equal to unity when the selected bin is of a rank that is equal to or higher than the rank limit.
- the bid adjustment value for the selected bin may be proportional to a ratio of the performance measure of the selected bin to the performance measure of the bin having a rank equal to the rank limit when the selected bin is of a rank that is less than the rank limit. The ratio is raised to a power value.
- the rank limit and the power value for a remarketing list may be determined by: obtaining historical auction data for the remarketing list, the historical auction data including bid history and auction results associated with content item auctions in which a remarketing bid was considered; and iteratively adjusting the respective values of the rank limit and the power value during auction simulations based on the historical auction data to maximize a performance cost function.
- the performance cost function may be based on: a conversion volume change relative to historical data based on scaling a max bid by a bid adjustment value for an auction simulation; and a unit of performance per unit of cost change relative to historical data based on scaling the max bid by the bid adjustment value for the auction simulation.
- the performance cost function may be a multiple of the conversion volume change summed with the unit of performance per unit of cost change.
- One of the remarketing signals may comprise the difference between the first timestamp and second timestamp.
- Remarketing helps content item providers identify opportunities to provide content items to users who have already expressed an interest in products or services the content item providers offer. Selectively adjusting bids for remarketing content items may lead to a better return on investment for content item providers. Users, in turn, are provided with content items that are likely to be of interest the user.
- FIG. 1A is a block diagram of an example environment in which content item auction bidding occurs.
- FIG. 1B is a block diagram of an example data flow that represents a content item auction bidding process.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process for performing a content item auction bid adjustment.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for determining a rank limit and power value for a remarketing list
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example data processing apparatus.
- Content item providers such as advertisers, may run campaigns designed to provide customized content items to users who have expressed interest in the content item provider's products or services.
- the systems and methods disclosed herein adjust bids for remarketing content items.
- a request for a content item may be received from a user device.
- the request includes a device identifier that is included in a remarketing list that associates timestamps with device identifiers of users that have performed one or more actions to be included in the remarketing list. For example, a device identifier may have been added to the list when a corresponding user device requests a web page of an Internet retailer.
- the timestamp indicates the time that the device identifier was added to the list—e.g., the time that the user device requested the web page.
- a predicted performance measure such as a predicted conversion rate
- the remarketing content item may be an advertisement that is intended for distribution to user devices that have device identifiers on the remarketing list.
- the predicted performance measure is based on the timestamp included in the remarketing list and a second timestamp that represents the time request was sent or received. For example, a predicted conversion rate may be relatively high if only a short amount of time has elapsed since the device identifier was added to the remarketing list. On the other hand, if a significant amount of time has elapsed since the device identifier was added to the remarketing list, the predicted conversion rate may be relatively low.
- a bid adjustment value is determined.
- the bid adjustment value may be used to adjust a bid associated with the remarketing content item.
- the bid adjustment value has a maximum value of unity. For example, if the predicted conversion rate is relatively high, the remarketing bid adjustment value may be near unity, whereas a lower predicted conversion rate may cause the bid adjustment value to approach a lower threshold, such as 0.
- the bids that are adjusted by the bid adjustment values may be used by a content item auctioneer to determine which content item(s) will be provided in response to the content item request.
- FIG. 1A is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which content item auction bidding occurs.
- a computer network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects publisher resources 104 , user devices 106 , publishers 108 , and a content item management system 110 .
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of publishers 108 , resources 104 , and user devices 106 .
- FIG. 1B is a block diagram of an example data flow 150 that represents a content item auction process which may be performed in the example environment 100 .
- the example data flow 150 is a representation of the process by which a remarketing content item is selected and provided to a particular user device 152 . Reference is made to both FIGS. 1A and 1B in the following description.
- a resource 104 is any data that can be provided by a publisher 108 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- PDF portable document format
- the resources may be included in a web site hosted by a publisher 108 , such as publisher 160 , and the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 104 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network.
- the content item management system 110 facilitates the provisioning of content items, such as advertisements, with the resources 104 .
- the content item management system 110 allows content item providers to define selection rules that take into account attributes associated with user devices to provide specific content items for users.
- Example selection rules include keyword-based selection, in which advertisers provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries or resource content, and remarketing list based selection, in which advertisers provide bids for advertisements that will be provided to user devices that have a device identifier that is on the advertiser's remarketing list. For example, remarketing content items that are associated with a remarketing list may have bids associated with them.
- the content item management system 110 in response to receiving a content item request from a user device, selects content items to be provided to the requesting user device and displayed in content item slots of a resource.
- Content items can be provided for many different resources 106 , such as the resources of the publishers and on a search results page resource.
- a resource may include instructions that cause the user device to request content items from the content item management system 110 .
- the request may include, for example, a publisher identifier, a device identifier, and, optionally, keyword identifiers related to the content of the resource.
- the content item management system 110 provides content items to the particular user device.
- the content item management system 110 in response to each request for content items, conducts an auction to select content items to be provided in response to the request.
- the content items may be ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is proportional to a value based on a content item bid and one or more parameters specified in the content item data 112 .
- the highest ranked content items resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device.
- the user device 152 may send a search query 154 to a search engine 156 .
- the search engine 156 uses the index 158 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 154 .
- the search engine 156 identifies the resources in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user device 152 in search results page resource 162 .
- the user device 152 may send a resource request 164 to a publisher 160 .
- the publisher 160 provides the user device 152 with the requested resource 166 .
- the search results page resource 162 and/or requested resource 166 may include instructions that cause the user device 152 to send a content item request 168 to the content item management system 110 .
- the content item management system 110 provides a content item 170 to the user device 152 .
- the content item management system 110 includes a data storage system that stores content item data 112 .
- the content item data 112 stores content items, selection information, remarketing information, and budgeting information for content item providers.
- the content item data 112 may include remarketing lists, such as remarketing list 172 .
- the remarketing list 172 includes device identifiers of devices that performed a certain action or actions on a publisher's web page and timestamps of when the identifiers were added to the list.
- a device identifier may be added to a remarketing list when a user device associated with the identifier visits a particular web page of the publisher 160 , or if the user device submitted a particular keyword in a search query sent to the search engine 156 .
- the remarketing list 172 is associated with remarketing content items 174 that the owner of the remarketing list 172 has designated to be provided to devices having device identifiers that are on the remarketing list 172 .
- the remarketing list 172 may belong to the publisher 160 .
- the publisher may have caused the device identifier of the user device 152 to be added to the publisher's remarketing list 172 .
- the publisher 160 may wish to provide particular content items—e.g., the remarketing content items 172 —to users who have requested particular resources of the publisher 160 .
- the remarketing list 172 is also associated with historical data 176 that stores historical remarketing content item data.
- the historical data 176 may include historical auction data that indicates the performance of the remarketing content items 174 with respect to content item auctions, e.g., remarketing content item bids for previous auctions, bids of competing content items, results of previous auctions, and characteristics of the user device from which a content item request was received.
- a remarketing content item bid associated with a remarketing content item is used by the content item management system 110 during a content item auction.
- the content item management system 110 may adjust the remarketing content item bids.
- the content item management system 110 uses bid adjustment data to adjust the bids of content items that are provided for requests related to remarketing. Use of bid adjustment data is described in this section, and the generation of the bid adjustment data is described in the following section.
- the bid adjustment data is sorted into bins as defined by bin data 178 .
- Bin data 178 associated with the remarketing list 172 may include data that specifies bins that each correspond to a unique combination of remarketing signal values.
- Each content item request associated with a device identifier included in the remarketing list will correspond to a bin included in the bin data for the remarketing list.
- a unique combination of remarketing signal values for a particular bin may specify a time period less than 1 hour and a user device platform of desktop computer.
- the particular bin corresponds to any content item request that was received from a user device that is a desktop computer if the request was received less than 1 hour after the device identifier of the requesting user device was added to the remarketing list.
- each bin specified by the bin data 178 has a corresponding predicted performance measure, such as a predicted click through rate or a predicted conversion rate.
- a predicted click-through rate may represent an estimated rate at which a user device presented with a particular content item will select, or “click,” the content item.
- a predicted conversion rate may represent an estimated rate at which a user device presented with a particular content item will perform an action specified by the content item provider, e.g., register at the content item provider's website or purchase a particular product from the content item provider.
- Predicted performance measures may be generated by the content item management system or obtained from a separate system. In some implementations, the predicted performance measures are generated based on the historical data 176 .
- Each bin specified by the bin data 178 may also correspond to a bid adjustment value (BAV).
- BAV may be used by the content item management system 110 to adjust a remarketing bid associated with one of the remarketing content items 174 during a content item auction. For example, given a BAV of 0.9, if a remarketing advertisement has a remarketing bid of $1.00, that bid may be adjusted by multiplying it by the BAV, resulting in a bid of $0.90.
- the BAV for a particular bin may be calculated, for example, based on the predicted performance measure corresponding to the particular bin. Calculation of the BAV for each bin will be discussed in further detail in the following section.
- the bin data 178 may include other information associated with remarketing content items 174 , such as performance measures associated with each bin.
- An example table depicting bin data for a remarketing list is provided in Table 1 below.
- the bin data depicted in Table 1 shows four combinations of remarketing signal values, a pCVR for each bin, and a BAV for each bin.
- Table 1 includes a number of conversions and a cumulative number of conversions for each bin, and the bins are ranked according to their pCVR.
- the number of conversions for each bin is based on historical data for remarketing content items that correspond to the remarketing list to which the bin data corresponds.
- the number of conversions for a bin indicates how many conversions occurred as a result of providing corresponding remarketing content items to user devices having request data that corresponds to the bin's remarketing signal values.
- the number of cumulative conversions for each bin represents the conversions of the particular bin, plus the conversions of each bin ranked above the particular bin.
- the first row of Table 1 is for a bin associated with a time period less than 1 hour and a mobile platform.
- a user device associated with a content item request corresponds to the first bin if two criteria are met. First, the difference between a) the timestamp corresponding to the user device in the remarketing list, and b) a timestamp that corresponds to a time the content item request was received by the content item management system, must be less than 1 hour. Second, the request data included in the content item request from the user device must indicate that the user device is associated with a mobile platform, e.g., a mobile phone or mobile tablet computer.
- a mobile platform e.g., a mobile phone or mobile tablet computer.
- Table 1 represents the bin data 178 in the example environment 150 , and assume that the user device 152 is a desktop computer. If the content item request 168 is received less than 1 hour after the device identifier of the user device 152 was added to the remarketing list 172 , the request would correspond to the second bin ⁇ T ⁇ 1 hour, desktop ⁇ , the pCVR of one of the remarketing content items 174 would be 0.8, and the BAV used to adjust a bid for one of the remarketing content items 174 would 1 .
- the request would correspond to the third bin ⁇ T ⁇ 1 hour, desktop ⁇
- the pCVR of one of the remarketing content items 174 would be 0.7
- the BAV used to adjust a bid for one of the remarketing content items 174 would be 0.875.
- the BAV may be used to adjust a bid associated with a remarketing content item 174 during an auction conducted by the content item management system 110 . The adjustment of remarketing content item bids is further discussed below with respect to FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for performing a content item auction bid adjustment.
- the process 200 may be used by a data processing apparatus that is used to realize the content item management system.
- the process 200 receives a request for a content item ( 202 ).
- the request includes request data describing one or more request feature values and data indicating a device identifier.
- the device identifier is included in a remarketing list that associates timestamps with device identifiers of users that have performed one or more actions to be included in the remarketing list. For example, the device identifier may have been added to the remarketing list as a result of the corresponding user device visiting a web page of a publisher that controls the remarketing list.
- the request feature values include a browser platform for the user device.
- the browser platform indicates, for example, the type of user device, e.g., a mobile phone, a desktop computer, or a tablet computer.
- Other request feature values include, for example, data identifying a resource with which the requested content item is to be displayed.
- the process 200 obtains a predicted performance measure for a remarketing content item ( 204 ).
- the remarketing content item is a content item associated with the remarketing list that includes the device identifier of the user device that submitted the content item request.
- the predicted performance measure is based at least in part on a first and second timestamp.
- the first timestamp is included in the remarketing list and associated with the device identifier.
- the first timestamp may be the time that the device identifier was added to the remarketing list.
- the second timestamp is for the content item request.
- the second timestamp may be the time that the content item request is received.
- the predicted performance measure is pre-calculated based on bins that correspond to content item requests.
- a remarketing list may have three bins, one for content item requests received less than 1 hour after being added to the remarketing list, one for content item requests received less than 1 day after being added to the remarketing list, and one for content item requests received more than 1 day after being added to the remarketing list.
- Historical data associated with the remarketing list may be used to predict the performance of remarketing content items provided for requests that correspond to each of the bins.
- the process 200 determines a bid adjustment value ( 206 ).
- the bid adjustment value is based at least in part on the first and second timestamps.
- the bid adjustment value may be based on the difference between the first and second timestamps.
- the process 200 determines the bid adjustment value for a remarketing content item by accessing data that specifies bins associated with the corresponding remarketing list, where each bin has a corresponding predicted performance measure and a bid adjustment value. The process 200 selects one of the bins and determines that the bid adjustment value of the remarketing content item is the bid adjustment value of the selected bin. In some implementations, each bin corresponds to a period of time, and the process 200 selects a bin based on a comparison of the bins' period of time to the first and second timestamps.
- each bin corresponds to a combination of remarketing signal values
- the process 200 selects a bin based on a comparison of the remarketing signal values of the bins to request feature values described by the request data and the first and second timestamps.
- each bin of the remarketing list is ranked according to the predicted performance measure for the bin relative to the predicted performance measure of each other bin of the remarketing list, and the bid adjustment value of the selected bin is based on the rank of the selected bin and a rank limit that specifies a particular rank of one of the bins.
- the bid adjustment value for the selected bin may be unity when the selected bin is of a rank that is equal to or higher than the rank limit.
- the bid adjustment value for the selected bin is proportional to a ratio of the performance measure of the selected bin to the performance measure of one of the other bins of the remarketing list.
- the other bin may be the bin having a rank equal to the rank limit when the selected bin is of a rank limit that is less than the rank limit.
- the rank limit is a performance volume threshold
- the bid adjustment value for the selected bin is proportional to a ratio of the performance measure of the selected bin to the performance measure of the bin at or just above the performance volume threshold.
- the ratio is raised to a power value.
- the ratio of the performance measure of the selected bin to the performance measure of the bin having a rank equal to the rank limit may be raised to a power of 0.5 to increase the bid adjustment value, or raised to a power of 1.5 to decrease the bid adjustment value. Determination of rank limits and power values is discussed in further detail in the following section.
- the process 200 obtains a remarketing bid for the remarketing content item ( 208 ).
- the remarketing bid specifies an amount a content item provider associated with the remarketing list is willing to pay for distribution of the remarketing content item. For example, an advertiser may specify a $1.00 bid for a remarketing content item associated with the remarketing list.
- the process 200 adjusts the remarketing bid based on the bid adjustment value ( 210 ).
- the remarketing bid is multiplied by the bid adjustment value. For example, if a bid adjustment value is 0.75, a $1.00 remarketing bid will be reduced to $0.75.
- the remarketing bid may be used in a content item auction to determine which content item(s) will be provided to a user device in response to the content item request.
- the BAV of a particular bin may be based on a rank of the bin with respect to the rank of other bins that belong to the same remarketing list. For example, each bin associated with a remarketing list may be ranked based on the bin's corresponding pCVR.
- the BAV for a bin that is above a rank limit may be a particular value, e.g., unity, while the BAV for a bin below the rank limit may be proportional to a ratio of the performance measure of the bin to the performance measure of the first bin having a rank at or above the rank limit. For example, if the rank limit is 2, the two bins with the highest pCVR will have a BAV of unity.
- the BAV of each bin ranked third and below is proportional to a ratio of the pCVR of the bin to the performance measure of the bin with the second highest pCVR, e.g., the bin at rank 2. This is shown in Table 1, where the pCVR of the third ranked bin is the pCVR of the third ranked bin (0.7) divided by the pCVR of the second ranked bin (0.8).
- the rank limit is a cumulative conversion threshold, such that the BAV of each bin whose cumulative conversion count is less than the cumulative conversion threshold will have a BAV of unity. For example, if the cumulative conversion threshold is 50%, each bin corresponding to a cumulative conversion count that is less than 50% of all conversions for the remarketing list will have a BAV of unity. On the other hand, each bin corresponding to a cumulative conversion count that is above 50% of all conversions for the remarketing list will have a BAV proportional to a ratio of the performance measure of the bin to the performance measure of the first bin having a cumulative conversion count below the cumulative conversion threshold. Calculation of the rank limit will be discussed in further detail below.
- the ratio used to calculate the BAV may be raised to a power.
- Example formulas for calculating BAV are provided below, as formula (1) and formula (2):
- pCVR(bin n ) is the predicted conversion rate corresponding to the bin at rank n;
- pCVR(bin L ) is the predicted conversion rate corresponding to the bin at the rank limit, L;
- p is a power value for a remarking list.
- the rank limit and power value for a remarketing list are determined by obtaining historical auction data for the remarketing list and iteratively adjusting the respective values of the rank limit and power value during auction simulations to maximize a performance cost function.
- the auction simulations may be based on the historical auction values. For example, for a given set of historical auction data, a rank limit and power value may be determined that, when used to calculate a BAV, maximize a performance cost function.
- the performance cost function may be based on 1) a conversion volume change relative to historical data based on scaling a max bid by a BAV for an auction simulation, and 2) a unit of performance per unit of cost change relative to historical data based on scaling the max bid by the BAV for the auction simulation.
- the conversion volume change may indicate a percent change in the number of conversions that would have resulted if historical auctions used a particular BAV.
- a unit of performance per unit of cost change may indicate a percentage change in the cost per conversion that would have resulted if historical auctions used a particular BAV.
- other metrics in addition to or instead of the metrics above—could also be used in the performance cost function, such as CTR volume change.
- CVC % is a percent change in conversion volume
- PPCC % is a percent change in unit of performance per unit of cost.
- the combination of rank limit and power value that maximizes the performance cost function may be selected as the rank limit and power value for the corresponding remarketing list.
- rank limits and power values may be determined independently for each remarketing list, while in other implementations, the same rank limit and/or power value may be used for multiple remarketing lists.
- the BAV formulas (1) and (2) and the performance cost function (3) given above are examples, and other BAV formulas and performance cost functions may be used to calculate BAVs and determine a rank limit and power value used to determine BAVs.
- the particular remarketing signal values and ranges used in the example bins are examples.
- Other remarketing signal values and ranges of values may be used to create bins for various content item requests. For example, the time on a remarketing list may be broken into more specific time bins, such as T ⁇ 1 minute, T ⁇ 1 day, T ⁇ 1 week, etc.
- Other remarketing signal values may include, for example, a quality score of the resource with which the remarketing content item is to be displayed, a measure of correlation between a topic of remarketing content item and a topic of the resource with which the remarketing content item is to be displayed, and the particular action that caused the device identifier of the user device to be added to the remarketing list.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for determining a rank limit and power value for a remarketing list.
- the process 300 may be used by a data processing apparatus that is used to realize the content item management system.
- the process 300 obtains historical auction data for a remarketing list ( 302 ).
- the historical auction data includes bid history and auction results associated with content item auctions in which a remarketing bid was considered.
- the process 300 iteratively adjusts the respective values of the rank limit and the power value during auction simulations based on the historical auction data to maximize a performance cost function ( 304 ).
- the performance cost function is based on a conversion volume change relative to historical data and a unit of performance per unit of cost change relative to historical data.

Description
This application is a continuation application of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 13/687,321, filed on Nov. 28, 2012, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
This specification relates to content item auction bidding.
The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, for example, webpages, images, audio files, and videos. Such access to these resources has likewise enabled opportunities for providing relevant additional content. One example of additional content is advertisements. For example, resources of particular interest to a user can be identified by a search engine in response to a user query. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, it is possible to provide relevant advertisements (or other content items) to the user with search results.
Another way to distribute content items to users is remarketing, which allows content item providers to choose particular content items to be shown to users who have performed certain actions, such as visiting a web page of the content item provider. For example, an advertiser can choose a particular advertisement to be provided to users who have recently visited the advertiser's website. As these users are likely interested in the advertiser's offerings, they are likely to be interested in the advertised product or service.
Often, multiple content item providers compete to have their content items provided to users. For example, advertisers may set bids for particular advertisements, and advertisement auctions may be conducted, where the advertisements of the winning bidders are provided to users.
This specification describes technologies relating to content item auction bidding.
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a request for a content item, the request including request data describing one or more request feature values and data indicating a device identifier, the device identifier being included in a remarketing list that associates timestamps with device identifiers of user devices that have performed one or more actions to be included in the remarketing list; obtaining a predicted performance measure for a remarketing content item associated with the remarketing list based on a first timestamp and a second timestamp, the first timestamp being included in the remarketing list and associated with the device identifier included in the request, and the second timestamp being for the request; determining a bid adjustment value based, at least in part, on the first timestamp and the second timestamp; obtaining a remarketing bid for the remarketing content item, the remarketing bid specifying an amount a content item provider associated with the remarketing list is willing to pay for distribution of the remarketing content item; and adjusting the remarketing bid based on the bid adjustment value. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features.
Determining the bid adjustment value may comprise: accessing data specifying bins associated with the remarketing list, each bin corresponding to a unique combination of remarketing signal values, and each bin having a corresponding predicted performance measure and bid adjustment value; selecting one of the bins based on a comparison of the remarketing signal values of the bins to request feature values described by the request data and the first and second timestamps; and determining that the bid adjustment value for the remarketing content item is the bid adjustment value of the selected bin.
Each bin of the remarketing list may be ranked according to the predicted performance measure for the bin relative to the predicted performance measure of each other bin of the remarketing list; and the bid adjustment value of the selected bin may be based on a rank of the selected bin and a rank limit that specifies a particular rank of one of the bins of the remarketing list.
The bid adjustment value for the selected bin may be equal to unity when the selected bin is of a rank that is equal to or higher than the rank limit.
The bid adjustment value for the selected bin may be proportional to a ratio of the performance measure of the selected bin to the performance measure of the bin having a rank equal to the rank limit when the selected bin is of a rank that is less than the rank limit. The ratio is raised to a power value.
The rank limit and the power value for a remarketing list may be determined by: obtaining historical auction data for the remarketing list, the historical auction data including bid history and auction results associated with content item auctions in which a remarketing bid was considered; and iteratively adjusting the respective values of the rank limit and the power value during auction simulations based on the historical auction data to maximize a performance cost function.
The performance cost function may be based on: a conversion volume change relative to historical data based on scaling a max bid by a bid adjustment value for an auction simulation; and a unit of performance per unit of cost change relative to historical data based on scaling the max bid by the bid adjustment value for the auction simulation.
The performance cost function may be a multiple of the conversion volume change summed with the unit of performance per unit of cost change. One of the remarketing signals may comprise the difference between the first timestamp and second timestamp.
Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Remarketing helps content item providers identify opportunities to provide content items to users who have already expressed an interest in products or services the content item providers offer. Selectively adjusting bids for remarketing content items may lead to a better return on investment for content item providers. Users, in turn, are provided with content items that are likely to be of interest the user.
The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.
Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
Overview
Content item providers, such as advertisers, may run campaigns designed to provide customized content items to users who have expressed interest in the content item provider's products or services. The systems and methods disclosed herein adjust bids for remarketing content items.
A request for a content item may be received from a user device. The request includes a device identifier that is included in a remarketing list that associates timestamps with device identifiers of users that have performed one or more actions to be included in the remarketing list. For example, a device identifier may have been added to the list when a corresponding user device requests a web page of an Internet retailer. The timestamp indicates the time that the device identifier was added to the list—e.g., the time that the user device requested the web page.
A predicted performance measure, such as a predicted conversion rate, may be obtained for remarketing content item associated with the remarketing list. The remarketing content item may be an advertisement that is intended for distribution to user devices that have device identifiers on the remarketing list. The predicted performance measure is based on the timestamp included in the remarketing list and a second timestamp that represents the time request was sent or received. For example, a predicted conversion rate may be relatively high if only a short amount of time has elapsed since the device identifier was added to the remarketing list. On the other hand, if a significant amount of time has elapsed since the device identifier was added to the remarketing list, the predicted conversion rate may be relatively low.
Based on the predicted performance measure, a bid adjustment value is determined. The bid adjustment value may be used to adjust a bid associated with the remarketing content item. In some implementations, the bid adjustment value has a maximum value of unity. For example, if the predicted conversion rate is relatively high, the remarketing bid adjustment value may be near unity, whereas a lower predicted conversion rate may cause the bid adjustment value to approach a lower threshold, such as 0. The bids that are adjusted by the bid adjustment values may be used by a content item auctioneer to determine which content item(s) will be provided in response to the content item request.
These features and other features are described in more detail below.
Example Environment
A resource 104 is any data that can be provided by a publisher 108 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few. The resources may be included in a web site hosted by a publisher 108, such as publisher 160, and the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).
A user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 104 over the network 102. Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102. A user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102. The web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network.
The content item management system 110 facilitates the provisioning of content items, such as advertisements, with the resources 104. In particular, the content item management system 110 allows content item providers to define selection rules that take into account attributes associated with user devices to provide specific content items for users. Example selection rules include keyword-based selection, in which advertisers provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries or resource content, and remarketing list based selection, in which advertisers provide bids for advertisements that will be provided to user devices that have a device identifier that is on the advertiser's remarketing list. For example, remarketing content items that are associated with a remarketing list may have bids associated with them. The content item management system 110, in response to receiving a content item request from a user device, selects content items to be provided to the requesting user device and displayed in content item slots of a resource.
Content items can be provided for many different resources 106, such as the resources of the publishers and on a search results page resource. For example, a resource may include instructions that cause the user device to request content items from the content item management system 110. The request may include, for example, a publisher identifier, a device identifier, and, optionally, keyword identifiers related to the content of the resource. The content item management system 110, in turn, provides content items to the particular user device.
In particular, the content item management system 110, in response to each request for content items, conducts an auction to select content items to be provided in response to the request. The content items may be ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is proportional to a value based on a content item bid and one or more parameters specified in the content item data 112. The highest ranked content items resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device.
For example, the user device 152 may send a search query 154 to a search engine 156. In response to receiving the search query 154, the search engine 156 uses the index 158 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 154. The search engine 156 identifies the resources in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user device 152 in search results page resource 162. In another example, the user device 152 may send a resource request 164 to a publisher 160. In response to receiving the resource request 164, the publisher 160 provides the user device 152 with the requested resource 166. The search results page resource 162 and/or requested resource 166 may include instructions that cause the user device 152 to send a content item request 168 to the content item management system 110. In response to receiving the content item request 168, the content item management system 110 provides a content item 170 to the user device 152.
The content item management system 110 includes a data storage system that stores content item data 112. The content item data 112 stores content items, selection information, remarketing information, and budgeting information for content item providers. For example, the content item data 112 may include remarketing lists, such as remarketing list 172. In the example environment 150, the remarketing list 172 includes device identifiers of devices that performed a certain action or actions on a publisher's web page and timestamps of when the identifiers were added to the list. For example, a device identifier may be added to a remarketing list when a user device associated with the identifier visits a particular web page of the publisher 160, or if the user device submitted a particular keyword in a search query sent to the search engine 156.
The remarketing list 172 is associated with remarketing content items 174 that the owner of the remarketing list 172 has designated to be provided to devices having device identifiers that are on the remarketing list 172. For example, the remarketing list 172 may belong to the publisher 160. When the resource request 164 was received by the publisher 160, the publisher may have caused the device identifier of the user device 152 to be added to the publisher's remarketing list 172. The publisher 160 may wish to provide particular content items—e.g., the remarketing content items 172—to users who have requested particular resources of the publisher 160.
The remarketing list 172 is also associated with historical data 176 that stores historical remarketing content item data. For example, the historical data 176 may include historical auction data that indicates the performance of the remarketing content items 174 with respect to content item auctions, e.g., remarketing content item bids for previous auctions, bids of competing content items, results of previous auctions, and characteristics of the user device from which a content item request was received.
Remarketing Bid Adjustment
Generally, a remarketing content item bid associated with a remarketing content item is used by the content item management system 110 during a content item auction. As discussed below, the content item management system 110 may adjust the remarketing content item bids. The content item management system 110, in some implementations, uses bid adjustment data to adjust the bids of content items that are provided for requests related to remarketing. Use of bid adjustment data is described in this section, and the generation of the bid adjustment data is described in the following section.
In some implementations, the bid adjustment data is sorted into bins as defined by bin data 178. Bin data 178 associated with the remarketing list 172 may include data that specifies bins that each correspond to a unique combination of remarketing signal values. Each content item request associated with a device identifier included in the remarketing list will correspond to a bin included in the bin data for the remarketing list. For example, a unique combination of remarketing signal values for a particular bin may specify a time period less than 1 hour and a user device platform of desktop computer. The particular bin corresponds to any content item request that was received from a user device that is a desktop computer if the request was received less than 1 hour after the device identifier of the requesting user device was added to the remarketing list.
In some implementations, each bin specified by the bin data 178 has a corresponding predicted performance measure, such as a predicted click through rate or a predicted conversion rate. A predicted click-through rate (pCTR) may represent an estimated rate at which a user device presented with a particular content item will select, or “click,” the content item. A predicted conversion rate (pCVR) may represent an estimated rate at which a user device presented with a particular content item will perform an action specified by the content item provider, e.g., register at the content item provider's website or purchase a particular product from the content item provider. Predicted performance measures may be generated by the content item management system or obtained from a separate system. In some implementations, the predicted performance measures are generated based on the historical data 176.
Each bin specified by the bin data 178 may also correspond to a bid adjustment value (BAV). The BAV may be used by the content item management system 110 to adjust a remarketing bid associated with one of the remarketing content items 174 during a content item auction. For example, given a BAV of 0.9, if a remarketing advertisement has a remarketing bid of $1.00, that bid may be adjusted by multiplying it by the BAV, resulting in a bid of $0.90. The BAV for a particular bin may be calculated, for example, based on the predicted performance measure corresponding to the particular bin. Calculation of the BAV for each bin will be discussed in further detail in the following section.
The bin data 178 may include other information associated with remarketing content items 174, such as performance measures associated with each bin. An example table depicting bin data for a remarketing list is provided in Table 1 below.
TABLE 1 | |||||
Cum. | |||||
Conver- | Conver- | ||||
Rank | Bin Values | pCVR | sions | sions | BAV |
1 | {T < 1 hour, mobile} | 0.9 | 9 | 9 | 1 |
2 | {T < 1 hour, desktop} | 0.8 | 4 | 13 | 1 |
3 | {T ≥ 1 hour, desktop} | 0.7 | 7 | 20 | 0.7/0.8 = 0.875 |
4 | {T ≥ 1 hour, mobile} | 0.6 | 3 | 23 | 0.6/0.8 = 0.75 |
The bin data depicted in Table 1 shows four combinations of remarketing signal values, a pCVR for each bin, and a BAV for each bin. In addition, Table 1 includes a number of conversions and a cumulative number of conversions for each bin, and the bins are ranked according to their pCVR. The number of conversions for each bin is based on historical data for remarketing content items that correspond to the remarketing list to which the bin data corresponds. The number of conversions for a bin indicates how many conversions occurred as a result of providing corresponding remarketing content items to user devices having request data that corresponds to the bin's remarketing signal values. The number of cumulative conversions for each bin represents the conversions of the particular bin, plus the conversions of each bin ranked above the particular bin.
For example, the first row of Table 1 is for a bin associated with a time period less than 1 hour and a mobile platform. A user device associated with a content item request corresponds to the first bin if two criteria are met. First, the difference between a) the timestamp corresponding to the user device in the remarketing list, and b) a timestamp that corresponds to a time the content item request was received by the content item management system, must be less than 1 hour. Second, the request data included in the content item request from the user device must indicate that the user device is associated with a mobile platform, e.g., a mobile phone or mobile tablet computer.
By way of example, assume Table 1 represents the bin data 178 in the example environment 150, and assume that the user device 152 is a desktop computer. If the content item request 168 is received less than 1 hour after the device identifier of the user device 152 was added to the remarketing list 172, the request would correspond to the second bin {T<1 hour, desktop}, the pCVR of one of the remarketing content items 174 would be 0.8, and the BAV used to adjust a bid for one of the remarketing content items 174 would 1. If, on the other hand, the content item request 168 is received more than one hour after the device identifier of the user device 152 was added to the remarketing list 172, the request would correspond to the third bin {T≥1 hour, desktop}, the pCVR of one of the remarketing content items 174 would be 0.7, and the BAV used to adjust a bid for one of the remarketing content items 174 would be 0.875. As discussed above, the BAV may be used to adjust a bid associated with a remarketing content item 174 during an auction conducted by the content item management system 110. The adjustment of remarketing content item bids is further discussed below with respect to FIG. 2 .
The process 200 receives a request for a content item (202). The request includes request data describing one or more request feature values and data indicating a device identifier. The device identifier is included in a remarketing list that associates timestamps with device identifiers of users that have performed one or more actions to be included in the remarketing list. For example, the device identifier may have been added to the remarketing list as a result of the corresponding user device visiting a web page of a publisher that controls the remarketing list.
In some implementations, the request feature values include a browser platform for the user device. The browser platform indicates, for example, the type of user device, e.g., a mobile phone, a desktop computer, or a tablet computer. Other request feature values include, for example, data identifying a resource with which the requested content item is to be displayed.
The process 200 obtains a predicted performance measure for a remarketing content item (204). The remarketing content item is a content item associated with the remarketing list that includes the device identifier of the user device that submitted the content item request. The predicted performance measure is based at least in part on a first and second timestamp. The first timestamp is included in the remarketing list and associated with the device identifier. For example, the first timestamp may be the time that the device identifier was added to the remarketing list. The second timestamp is for the content item request. For example, the second timestamp may be the time that the content item request is received.
In some implementations, the predicted performance measure is pre-calculated based on bins that correspond to content item requests. For example, a remarketing list may have three bins, one for content item requests received less than 1 hour after being added to the remarketing list, one for content item requests received less than 1 day after being added to the remarketing list, and one for content item requests received more than 1 day after being added to the remarketing list. Historical data associated with the remarketing list may be used to predict the performance of remarketing content items provided for requests that correspond to each of the bins.
The process 200 determines a bid adjustment value (206). The bid adjustment value is based at least in part on the first and second timestamps. For example, the bid adjustment value may be based on the difference between the first and second timestamps.
In some implementations, the process 200 determines the bid adjustment value for a remarketing content item by accessing data that specifies bins associated with the corresponding remarketing list, where each bin has a corresponding predicted performance measure and a bid adjustment value. The process 200 selects one of the bins and determines that the bid adjustment value of the remarketing content item is the bid adjustment value of the selected bin. In some implementations, each bin corresponds to a period of time, and the process 200 selects a bin based on a comparison of the bins' period of time to the first and second timestamps. In some implementations, each bin corresponds to a combination of remarketing signal values, and the process 200 selects a bin based on a comparison of the remarketing signal values of the bins to request feature values described by the request data and the first and second timestamps.
In some implementations, each bin of the remarketing list is ranked according to the predicted performance measure for the bin relative to the predicted performance measure of each other bin of the remarketing list, and the bid adjustment value of the selected bin is based on the rank of the selected bin and a rank limit that specifies a particular rank of one of the bins. For example, the bid adjustment value for the selected bin may be unity when the selected bin is of a rank that is equal to or higher than the rank limit.
In some implementations, the bid adjustment value for the selected bin is proportional to a ratio of the performance measure of the selected bin to the performance measure of one of the other bins of the remarketing list. The other bin may be the bin having a rank equal to the rank limit when the selected bin is of a rank limit that is less than the rank limit. In some implementations, the rank limit is a performance volume threshold, and the bid adjustment value for the selected bin is proportional to a ratio of the performance measure of the selected bin to the performance measure of the bin at or just above the performance volume threshold.
In some implementations, the ratio is raised to a power value. For example, the ratio of the performance measure of the selected bin to the performance measure of the bin having a rank equal to the rank limit may be raised to a power of 0.5 to increase the bid adjustment value, or raised to a power of 1.5 to decrease the bid adjustment value. Determination of rank limits and power values is discussed in further detail in the following section.
The process 200 obtains a remarketing bid for the remarketing content item (208). The remarketing bid specifies an amount a content item provider associated with the remarketing list is willing to pay for distribution of the remarketing content item. For example, an advertiser may specify a $1.00 bid for a remarketing content item associated with the remarketing list.
The process 200 adjusts the remarketing bid based on the bid adjustment value (210). In some implementations, the remarketing bid is multiplied by the bid adjustment value. For example, if a bid adjustment value is 0.75, a $1.00 remarketing bid will be reduced to $0.75. The remarketing bid may be used in a content item auction to determine which content item(s) will be provided to a user device in response to the content item request.
Determining Rank Limit and Power Value for Bid Adjustment Values
As discussed above, the BAV of a particular bin may be based on a rank of the bin with respect to the rank of other bins that belong to the same remarketing list. For example, each bin associated with a remarketing list may be ranked based on the bin's corresponding pCVR. In some implementations, the BAV for a bin that is above a rank limit may be a particular value, e.g., unity, while the BAV for a bin below the rank limit may be proportional to a ratio of the performance measure of the bin to the performance measure of the first bin having a rank at or above the rank limit. For example, if the rank limit is 2, the two bins with the highest pCVR will have a BAV of unity. The BAV of each bin ranked third and below is proportional to a ratio of the pCVR of the bin to the performance measure of the bin with the second highest pCVR, e.g., the bin at rank 2. This is shown in Table 1, where the pCVR of the third ranked bin is the pCVR of the third ranked bin (0.7) divided by the pCVR of the second ranked bin (0.8).
In some implementations, the rank limit is a cumulative conversion threshold, such that the BAV of each bin whose cumulative conversion count is less than the cumulative conversion threshold will have a BAV of unity. For example, if the cumulative conversion threshold is 50%, each bin corresponding to a cumulative conversion count that is less than 50% of all conversions for the remarketing list will have a BAV of unity. On the other hand, each bin corresponding to a cumulative conversion count that is above 50% of all conversions for the remarketing list will have a BAV proportional to a ratio of the performance measure of the bin to the performance measure of the first bin having a cumulative conversion count below the cumulative conversion threshold. Calculation of the rank limit will be discussed in further detail below.
In some implementations, the ratio used to calculate the BAV may be raised to a power. The value of the exponent used—e.g., a “power value”—serves to either increase or decrease each BAV. For example, using a power value between 0 and 1 will increase the BAV, e.g., 0.875{circumflex over ( )}0.5=˜0.935. Using a power value greater than 1 will decrease the BAV, e.g., 0.875{circumflex over ( )}1.5=˜0.818. Example formulas for calculating BAV are provided below, as formula (1) and formula (2):
For a bin at rank n, where n is at or above the rank limit, L:
BAV(binn)=1; (1)
BAV(binn)=1; (1)
For a bin at rank n, where n is below the rank limit, L:
BAV(binn)=(pCVR(binn)/pCVR(binL))p (2)
BAV(binn)=(pCVR(binn)/pCVR(binL))p (2)
Where pCVR(binn) is the predicted conversion rate corresponding to the bin at rank n;
pCVR(binL) is the predicted conversion rate corresponding to the bin at the rank limit, L; and
p is a power value for a remarking list.
In some implementations, the rank limit and power value for a remarketing list are determined by obtaining historical auction data for the remarketing list and iteratively adjusting the respective values of the rank limit and power value during auction simulations to maximize a performance cost function. The auction simulations may be based on the historical auction values. For example, for a given set of historical auction data, a rank limit and power value may be determined that, when used to calculate a BAV, maximize a performance cost function.
In some implementations, the performance cost function may be based on 1) a conversion volume change relative to historical data based on scaling a max bid by a BAV for an auction simulation, and 2) a unit of performance per unit of cost change relative to historical data based on scaling the max bid by the BAV for the auction simulation. For example, the conversion volume change may indicate a percent change in the number of conversions that would have resulted if historical auctions used a particular BAV. A unit of performance per unit of cost change may indicate a percentage change in the cost per conversion that would have resulted if historical auctions used a particular BAV. In some implementations, other metrics—in addition to or instead of the metrics above—could also be used in the performance cost function, such as CTR volume change.
An example performance cost function, shown as formula (3) below, is a multiple of the conversion volume change summed with the unit of performance per cost unit change.
m(CVC %)+PPCC %=performance cost result (3)
m(CVC %)+PPCC %=performance cost result (3)
Where m is a multiple;
CVC % is a percent change in conversion volume; and
PPCC % is a percent change in unit of performance per unit of cost.
Given a multiple of m=2, if a particular rank limit and power value used to generate a BAV, when applied to historical auction data, would result in 20% more conversions than the actual auction results, and would result in a 10% increase in the number of conversions per dollar, the performance cost function may result a value of 2(20)+10=50. The combination of rank limit and power value that maximizes the performance cost function may be selected as the rank limit and power value for the corresponding remarketing list. In some implementations, rank limits and power values may be determined independently for each remarketing list, while in other implementations, the same rank limit and/or power value may be used for multiple remarketing lists.
The BAV formulas (1) and (2) and the performance cost function (3) given above are examples, and other BAV formulas and performance cost functions may be used to calculate BAVs and determine a rank limit and power value used to determine BAVs. In addition, the particular remarketing signal values and ranges used in the example bins are examples. Other remarketing signal values and ranges of values may be used to create bins for various content item requests. For example, the time on a remarketing list may be broken into more specific time bins, such as T<1 minute, T<1 day, T<1 week, etc. Other remarketing signal values may include, for example, a quality score of the resource with which the remarketing content item is to be displayed, a measure of correlation between a topic of remarketing content item and a topic of the resource with which the remarketing content item is to be displayed, and the particular action that caused the device identifier of the user device to be added to the remarketing list.
The process 300 obtains historical auction data for a remarketing list (302). The historical auction data includes bid history and auction results associated with content item auctions in which a remarketing bid was considered.
The process 300 iteratively adjusts the respective values of the rank limit and the power value during auction simulations based on the historical auction data to maximize a performance cost function (304). In some implementations, the performance cost function is based on a conversion volume change relative to historical data and a unit of performance per unit of cost change relative to historical data. The conversion volume change and unit of performance per unit of cost change may be based on scaling a max bid by a bid adjustment value for an auction simulation. In some implementations, the performance cost function is a multiple of the conversion volume change summed with the unit of performance per unit of cost change.
Once a rank limit and power value have been determined for a remarketing list, the particular rank limit and power value may be used to determine BAVs for the bins associated with the remarketing list. As discussed above, these BAVs may be used to adjust remarketing bids that are used in a content item auction to determine which content item(s) will be provided to a user device in response to the content item request.
