- the PCF-DO 430 connects to multiple PDSNs and BSNs allowing it to receive BCMCS programs for any BSN capable of transmitting a BCMCS program.
- a base transceiver station (data only) 436 , 438 (“BTS-DO”) is also included in the RAN 424 , 426 .
- the BTS-DO 436 , 438 provides the radio interface to the wireless devices 104 , 106 .
- BTSs are “homed” on a BSC-DO 428 , 430 .
- FIG. 4 also shows a unicast communication path 442 , a broadcast/multicast communication path 444 , and a signaling path 440 .
- the unicast communication path 442 travels from the BCMCS content server 326 through the unicast PDSN 328 to the wireless communication device 104 via the RAN 424 .
- the unicast communication path 442 represents a unicast channel on which information is being wirelessly communicated to the wireless device 104 using a unicast communication mode.
- a wireless communication unicast communication mode is used, for example, when a threshold has not been reached, e.g. not enough users requesting the information.
- Unicast communication is also used when broadcast/multicast resources are not available. Multiple unicast channels can be established to transmit information to the wireless communication devices 104 , 106 .
- the broadcast/multicast communication path 444 travels from the BCMCS content server 326 through the optional multicast router 436 and the BSN 422 to the wireless communication device 104 .
- the BSN 422 generates an IP multicast flow for the requested broadcast/multicast information.
- the BSN 422 for broadcast/multicast flows is equivalent to the unicast PDSN 328 for unicast flows.
- the signaling path 446 travels between the wireless device 104 through the RAN 424 and the unicast PDSN 328 to the BCMCS controller 324 .
- the signaling path 446 notifies the BCMCS controller 324 of the broadcast/multicast information request from the wireless device 104 .
- the BCMCS controller 324 receives the broadcast/multicast request and determines if a broadcast/multicast communication mode can be used.
- Broadcast is unidirectional toward the wireless devices.
- One method to get info from the wireless device to the BCMCS controller 324 is via a unicast channel. This unicast channel, optionally can be dropped when the wireless device is receiving a broadcast flow on the broadcast channel.
- the signaling path 444 travels from the BCMCS controller 324 to the wireless communication device 104 to signal the wireless communication device 104 to switch wireless communication modes. For example, if the wireless communication device 104 is currently communicating in a unicast mode the BCMCS controller 324 can signal the wireless communication device 104 to switch to a broadcast/multicast mode and vice versa.
- FIG. 5 is a logical flow diagram illustrating how information is wirelessly communicated to a wireless communication device using a broadcasting/multicast wireless communication mode and a wireless unicast communication mode.
- broadcast/multicast services deliver the same data to multiple subscribers.
- Communication systems such as CDMA EV-DO use maximum power to transmit data to wireless devices.
- the number of timeslots required, and the modulation and coding scheme are varied to deliver data to the requesting wireless communication devices 104 , 106 .
- the combination of media access control-index (“MAC-Index”) and timeslot(s) defines a communications channel, regardless of how many wireless communication devices share the channel.
- MAC-Index media access control-index
- timeslot(s) defines a communications channel, regardless of how many wireless communication devices share the channel.
- Wireless communication devices receiving information using a unicast communication mode are each assigned one MAC-index and one or more timeslots as shown in FIG. 5 .
- Information is transmitted to a specific wireless communication device on one or more timeslots covered by the MAC-index that is assigned to the wireless communication device.
- a single MAC-index is assigned for the broadcast/multicast channel.
- Each timeslot may be dedicated to a single flow.
- Dynamically switching from many unicast channels to a single broadcast/multicast channel saves MAC-indices and reduces the number of timeslots needed, which translates to increased channel capacity.
- CDMA EV-DO has been used as an exemplary embodiment. However, the concepts of resource optimization are applicable to other wireless systems as well.
- FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 are operational flow diagrams illustrating exemplary processes of dynamically selecting a wireless communication mode.
- the operational flow diagram of FIG. 6 begins at step 602 and flows directly to step 604 .
- the central server 108 receives at least one request (registration) for wireless communication of information.
- a wireless communication device 104 requests information from the BCMCS controller 324 .
- the BCMCS controller 324 increments the wireless device count and determines the number of wireless communication devices that are to receive the wirelessly communicated information. For example, a number of wireless devices can request the same information such as news information or information from the same source within a period of time.
- the BCMCS controller 324 maintains a count of the wireless communication devices requesting a particular type of information.
- the dynamic wireless communication mode selector 126 determines if the number of wireless communication devices to receive the information exceeds a first predefined threshold. If the result of this determination is negative, the central server, at step 610 , notifies the wireless communication device requesting service to receive the information using a unicast wireless communication mode. If the result of this determination is positive, the dynamic wireless communication mode selector 126 , at step 612 , dynamically switches the wireless communication mode to one of a broadcast or multicast communication mode. When a broadcast/multicast communication mode is used to wirelessly communicate information to a wireless communication device a common transmission of the information is sent to wireless communication devices requesting the information.
- the wireless communication mode notifier 128 informs the wireless communication controller such as the RAN 424 , 426 , the wireless communication devices communicating in the unicast mode, and any registered devices waiting to receive the information of the broadcast/multicast communication mode parameters. For example, the correct modulation and coding scheme and timeslot information to be used on the broadcast/multicast channel, switchover time, and the like are transmitted to the RAN 424 , 426 and the wireless communication devices.
- the RAN 424 , 426 , the wireless devices 104 , 106 and the wireless communications network 102 switch over to the broadcast/multicast channel using the broadcast/multicast mode parameters. For example, if the threshold is set at ten wireless communication devices, the first nine wireless communication devices are initially notified to use a unicast communication mode.
- the dynamic wireless communication mode selector 126 determines that the number of wireless communication devices is greater or equal to ten, it signals, at step 614 , all the devices including the first nine to use either a broadcast or multicast communication mode.
- a higher threshold is set for higher revenue bearing services and a lower threshold is set for non-critical services such as weather information. The control flow then exits at step 616 .
- FIG. 7 is an operational flow diagram illustrating another exemplary process of dynamically selecting a wireless communication mode.
- the operational flow diagram of FIG. 7 begins at step 702 and flows directly to step 704 .
- the central server 108 receives a deregistration request from a wireless device receiving wireless communication of information. In another embodiment, the central server 108 determines that a time out has occurred.
- the BCMCS controller 324 at step 706 , decrements the wireless device count and checks the number of remaining wireless communication devices that are receiving the wirelessly communicated information.
- the central server 108 at step 708 , determines if the number of wireless communication devices is below a second predefined threshold.
- the dynamic wireless communication mode selector 126 determines whether the wireless communication mode is unicast. If the result of this determination is negative, the use of the broadcast/multicast communication mode, at step 710 , is continued. If the result of this determination is positive, the dynamic wireless communication mode selector 126 , at step 712 , dynamically switches the wireless communication mode to unicast.
- the second predefined threshold is set below the first predefined threshold. In another embodiment, the second predefined threshold is equal to the first predefined threshold, or alternatively, only a single predefined threshold exists. For example, if the second predefined threshold is set at five and the wireless communication devices drop from ten to below five, the wireless communication mode is switched to unicast. The second threshold is set below the first threshold to avoid unnecessarily flipping between broadcast/multicast and unicast modes.
- the wireless communication mode notifier 128 informs the wireless network controller such as the RAN 424 , 426 and the wireless communication devices to be dynamically switched over to the unicast communication of the unicast communication mode parameters. For example, the timeslot information, MAC-Index, switchover time, and the like are transmitted to the RAN 424 , 426 and the wireless communication devices. At the switchover time, the RAN 424 , 426 , the wireless devices 104 , 106 and the wireless communications network 102 switch over to the unicast channel using the unicast mode parameters. The control flow then exits at step 716 .
- the foregoing embodiments of the present invention are advantageous because they provide dynamic optimization of the resources available to wireless communication information to wireless communication devices using unicast broadcast/multicast communication modes. Information can be wireless communicated to a wireless communication device in a more manner thereby optimizing network resources.
