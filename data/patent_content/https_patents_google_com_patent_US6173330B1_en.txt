Definitions
- the present invention relates to the transmission of data segments such as those used to provide data to receivers for producing an on-screen television programming guide.
- a method and apparatus are presented for allowing a receiver to acquire data segments from a data stream at a lower data rate than the nominal data rate of the data stream while also optimizing the response time of the receiver.
- Various on-screen graphical displays have become available that provide information such as program name, viewing time, and a description, such as the leading actor in a movie.
- a common display format lists the relevant programming information for a given time period, such as one or two days from the present time.
- the display may provide interactive features, for example, which allow the viewer to switch the channel to directly view a program, order a pay-per-view program, record a program, obtain additional information about a program, such as a detailed movie review, or obtain account information from the programming service provider.
- IPG interactive program guide
- data for updating the IPG may be transmitted over the same channel as the programming service.
- One such system for providing IPG data is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,801,753, issued Sep. 1, 1998 by M. Eyer and Z. Guo, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Providing an Interactive Guide to Events Available on an Information Network,” assigned to General Instrument Corporation, the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference.
- IPG data for a shorter time period (e.g., the next two days) of programming is continuously transmitted in a low rate, “trickle” data stream, while data for a longer time period (e.g., the next seven days) of programming is continuously transmitted at a higher rate in a “demand” data stream.
- the trickle data stream is automatically received and processed by the receiver to gradually update the display with current information such as last-minute programming changes or corrections in the schedule.
- the trickle data stream thus provides a continuous update capability while requiring the receiver to store only the data corresponding to two days of programming.
- the receiver will not acquire and process the high-rate demand data stream unless commanded to do so by the viewer. For example, this may be required when the viewer wishes to obtain information for programming which is scheduled for more than two days in the future. Furthermore, when the viewer commands a function that requires the demand data stream, it is desirable for the information to be retrieved and processed as quickly as possible to avoid inconvenient delays for the viewer.
- the data input buffer size and processing speed are limited. Additionally, different viewers will be requesting different portions of the IPG at any given time. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus for communicating data to receivers that provides a fast response time without exceeding the receiver's processing capability or overflowing the receiver's buffer. Additionally, the system should be compatible with a data stream protocol wherein data for a single graphical display, or page, is carried in a number of blocks and segments, and where a number of receivers may require data of different blocks or segments of the data stream at the same time. Furthermore, there should be a relatively even waiting time between different viewers who request different information at the same time.
- the present invention provides a data communication scheme having the above and other advantages.
- a method and apparatus are presented for allowing a receiver to acquire data segments from a data stream at a lower data rate than the nominal data rate of the data stream while also minimizing the response time of the receiver.
- the invention is particularly applicable to the communication of interactive program guide (IPG) data for informing television viewers of the available programming services in a particular time period.
- IPG interactive program guide
- a method for communicating pages of data of a transmission cycle over a communication channel includes the step of arranging the pages in a first page order.
- the pages may be arranged sequentially, or the even-numbered pages may be separated from the odd-numbered pages.
- the pages are partitioned into a number of subsets.
- Each page includes a number of data segments which are arranged in a first segment order.
- the data segments are re-arranged according to a perfect shuffle function to provide the segments in an order to achieve an optimal inter-segment distance.
- This optimal inter-segment distance corresponds to an order that maximizes a minimum of the inter-segment distance of respective segments which were adjacent in the first segment order.
- the minimum inter-segment distance is constrained by the maximum speed with which the receiver can receive and process data. Typically, this speed is limited by the size of the receiver's input buffer and the operating speed of the processor. Any dummy segments which are present in the data pages may be removed after this re-arranging.
- the pages may include different types of blocks.
- Each block is a grouping of segments.
- the different types of blocks may be arranged in a first transmission cycle and subsequent transmission cycles which follow such that the different types of blocks are provided at a desired relative frequency. For example, data blocks which have a higher priority may be provided at a higher relative frequency in the transmission cycles. In this way, in case the data stream is temporarily lost, the time for re-acquiring the data stream can be reduced.
- a receiver is also presented for processing a data stream which includes a plurality of data pages.
- the receiver includes means for retrieving particular segments of the pages. For example, a particular IPG page may be divided into five segments, and the receiver will accumulate the segments one by one until it has accumulated all five segments and is able to process the data and reproduce the desired image on a television screen.
- the segments in the data stream are processed in accordance with the perfect shuffle function to achieve an optimal inter-segment distance in the data stream.
- the segments are provided in an order which maximizes a minimum of the inter-segment distance of respective segments which were adjacent prior to being processed in accordance with the perfect shuffle function.
- the receiver further includes an input buffer which has a characteristic capacity for receiving the data stream. That is, the buffer may only store a limited amount of data.
- the receiver also has a processor which has a characteristic processing speed for processing the data received via the input buffer. The processor is thus limited in the speed in which it can process data. Accordingly, the optimal inter-segment distance is constrained by the processing speed.

- Interactive program guide (IPG) data can be transmitted in conjunction with a video programming data stream in a time-multiplexed manner. Time-multiplexing is particularly suitable for the transmission of digital data, wherein the data is transmitted in a number of consecutive data packets.
- Each data packet may include header data including a packet identifier (PID) which identifies the packet type.
- PID packet identifier
- a receiver may evaluate the PID of each packet, and retrieve and process only those packets which are of interest.
- the receiver may not be able to evaluate the PID of each packet if it operates at a slower rate than that of the incoming data stream.
- the receiver's data input buffer may not be large enough to store an entire page of data. In this case, an alternate approach is required to properly synchronize the retrieval of the proper data packets by a specific receiver.
- a method and apparatus for shuffling IPG data segments is presented wherein text messages which define the same page of data are spread out in time to facilitate receiver acquisition and processing.
- the present invention applies the “perfect shuffle” function to a number of data segments of a page of a data stream.
- the perfect shuffle function is known generally as a method of interconnecting processing elements and memory modules.
- shuffling may be used to enhance coding efficiency or disperse the effects of burst errors in data communications.

- the perfect shuffle function can be intuitively understood by considering the shuffling of a deck of X cards.
- the cards are partitioned into Y subsets, each of size Z.
- the Y-shuffle function perfectly interleaves the cards from different subsets by taking as an input the first card in each subset, arranging the first cards consecutively at the output, then taking the second card in each subset, arranging the second cards consecutively at the output following the first set of cards, and so on. This is done until all the input cards have been processed and arranged at the output.
- the perfect shuffle function can be characterized in terms of the distance, D x , between two cards x and x+1 in the shuffled ordering of the X cards. Note that x and x+1 are spaced apart by one card in the original ordering.

- FIG. 1 shows an ordering of pages in a data stream in accordance with the present invention.
- the data stream shown generally at 100 , includes consecutive transmission cycles, shown at 110 , 130 and 150 , respectively.
- the first transmission cycle 110 includes a foundation page 112 , a schedule_listing block 114 , and a description block 116 .
- the blocks 114 and 116 together form a page of data (e.g., page m).
- the blocks 132 and 134 also form a page (e.g., page n).
- the blocks are sub-pages since they are subsets of a complete page.
- each block includes one or more data segments, as discussed below.
- Each page of blocks within each transmission cycle describes the programming available for a given service in a specific time period.
- the blocks 114 and 116 of the first transmission cycle 110 may describe the programs that are available in the time period 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. of a given day, while blocks 132 and 134 of the first transmission cycle 110 may describe the programs that are available in a different time period. Intermediate blocks will consequently correspond to the programming in intermediate time periods.
- the time period that is spanned by a transmission cycle is known as the lookahead period.
- the time period spanned by a page is known as a time slot.
- the pages include data that is used to provide a graphical display for the IPG.
- the foundation pages 112 , 136 , and 156 of the transmission cycles 110 , 130 and 150 respectively, include untimed, globally applicable data which indicates the program theme class (e.g., music, sports, movies), program format attribute names (e.g., stereo, black and white), programming source names (e.g., NBC, HBO), Huffman tables for use in data decompression, and so on.
- the schedule_listing blocks 114 , . . . , 132 , 138 , . . . , 152 and 158 , . . . include the names of the available programs, and the description blocks 116 , . .
- an IPG page may include only one block which provides only the information on program names.
- the IPG data pages are segmented for delivery to the receivers.
- each segmented page carries the same amount of data, e.g., 1,024 bytes (one kilobyte).
- the data segments can then be shuffled to meet the hardware limitations (e.g., bandwidth) of the receivers while minimizing the time the viewer must wait to view the IPG data.
- the data stream rate may be 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps), but a receiver may have a maximum bandwidth of 0.15 Mbps. The full message will be reconstructed by the receiver only after all segments have been received.
- the segmentation approach is an “M of N” scheme involving three parameters; specifically, a “table extension” number, a count of the total number of segments (N) in the message (e.g., block), and an indication of which segment number (M) the message carries. It is possible to define for any single message type more than one table or message image.
- the table extension field separates one message from another.
- all segments of the same message must be of equal length, even if the last segment must be padded with null bytes.
- the length should be as large as possible without exceeding a predetermined maximum based on the receiver's input buffer size (e.g., 1,024 bytes). Thus, if N is the number of segments in a message, there will be at most N-1 null bytes needed.
- the RAM required to hold the whole image of the message body may be computed by simply multiplying the message body length in any received segment by the total number of segments. For example, with one kilobyte per segment and twenty segments for a given message, the total image size will be twenty kilobytes.
- N and the segment size involves finding a value of N such that the size of each segment is the maximum possible provided that it does not exceed one kilobyte.
- the computation of the RAM size needed to store the whole image may be a few bytes larger than the actual size of the full message due to the need to find an integer number of segments.
- the receiver may allocate RAM to build an image of a reassembled message, fill in the message header, which precedes the message body, and fill in one fraction (e.g., one Nth) of the message body.
- one fraction e.g., one Nth
- the Y-shuffle is then performed as described on the X segments, where the last d segments are dummy segments, and the resulting shuffled segments are compacted by deleting the dummy segments. Note that the shuffle operation does not spread out data segments between two adjacent pages, and therefore relies on the fact any two adjacent pages will be acquired using different packet identifiers (PIDs) in the respective headers.
- PIDs packet identifiers
- FIG. 2 shows the segmenting of five data pages into twenty five data segments together with three dummy segments, and the shuffled ordering of the twenty five data segments in accordance with the present invention.
- the demand IPG data is carried on five pages, including one foundation page and four schedule pages. Note that the pages are ordered sequentially.
- the five data pages, and one dummy page, are ordered as shown at 200 with the first segment being at the top of the sequence such that the schedule pages are in ascending order.
- the shuffled ordering of the segments is shown at the data sequence 250 .
- a schedule page may include only schedule_listing blocks and segments, or both schedule_listing and description blocks and segments.
- FIG. 2 does not show the distinction between the two types of segments.
- the schedule_listing segments should precede the description segments.
- pages one, two, three, four and five are segmented into three, six, four, five and seven segments, respectively.
- the first page, shown at 205 which is the foundation page, includes segments 0 - 2 ; the second page, shown at 210 , includes segments 3 - 8 , the third page, shown at 215 , includes segments 9 - 12 , the fourth page, shown at 220 , includes segments 13 - 17 , the fifth page, shown at 225 , includes segments 18 - 24 , and a dummy page, shown at 230 , includes dummy segments 25 - 27 .
- the three segments of page one are separated by three segments of other pages that are not currently of interest to the receiver.
- the receiver could retrieve all three segments of page one in a single cycle with a processing rate of only seven segments per second or faster.
- this represents an ideal case where the three segments are received in three consecutive cycles, respectively. In practical situations, the receiver may keep missing the same segment or segments in each cycle, and therefore fail to receive the complete data for page one.
- FIG. 3 shows the re-ordering of pages in accordance with the present invention.
- the sequential ordering of schedule pages in the data stream 300 requires that two or more PIDs be used to deliver segmented messages. This is because segment shuffling alone does not place segments from adjacent pages at a distance greater than one.
- two PID filters must be used to acquire the two pages which can be assigned to two different PIDs, respectively. This requirement can be circumvented by ordering the schedule pages in a shuffled fashion where all even numbered pages are arranged before all odd numbered pages, or vice-versa.
- segments on the same page are at a distance of one from each other (e.g., the segments are adjacent).
- segment shuffling the segment spacing is increased within a given page.
- segments belonging to pages i and i+1, respectively may still be at a distance of one.
- segments 14 and 21 which belong to pages 4 and 5 , respectively, in data stream 200 are adjacent to each other in the compacted ordering in data stream 280 .
- the segments from sequentially neighboring pages may still be at a distance of one even after segment shuffling is performed.
- segments from neighboring pages cannot be acquired using the same PID filter.
- Two or more PIDs would be required to split the data into two streams, with every other page on the same stream, and then one page filter could be used to handle one PID. That is, each page filter would pick up only one of two neighboring pages.
- Page one shown at 305
- Page two includes a block of two schedule_listing segments and a block of three description segments, for a total of six segments.
- Page two shown at 310
- Page three includes a block of three schedule_listing segments and a block of two description segments, for a total of five segments.
- Page four shown at 320 , includes a block of two schedule_listing segments and a block of two description segments, for a total of four segments.
- Page five shown at 325 , includes a block of four schedule_listing segments and a block of four description segments, for a total of eight segments.
- Page six shown at 330 , includes a block of four schedule_listing segments and a block of three description segments, for a total of seven segments.
- Page seven shown at 335 , includes a block of three schedule_listing segments and a block of two description segments, for a total of five segments.
- foundation page shown at 302 , is provided at the beginning of the sequence 300 .
- the foundation page 302 and the schedule pages 305 - 335 together comprise a transmission cycle.
- Data sequence 350 shows the re-ordering of data pages in accordance with the present invention. Pages one through seven are reordered in the sequence: page one, page three, page five, page seven, page two, page four, page six. Thus, the odd-numbered pages are provided before the even-numbered pages.
- the shuffled page ordering works with any number of PIDs. If only one PID is used, two adjacent pages (e.g. pages one and two) must be acquired using the same PID filter.
- FIG. 4 shows a reduced repetition frequency of description data blocks for transmission in accordance with the present invention.
- the data transmitted corresponds to the pages of data sequence 300 of FIG. 3.
- a block repetition or transmission frequency, F is defined as the average number of times a given type of data block is sent per transmission cycle.
- F is defined as the average number of times a given type of data block is sent per transmission cycle.
- F d , F t , and F f be the repetition frequencies of description, schedule_listing, and foundation pages, respectively. The following relationship shall hold:
- F t is equal to one by definition; that is, each of the schedule_listing blocks is transmitted once per transmission cycle. It is desirable, and sometimes necessary, to use different repetition frequencies as the number of channels or database lookaheads increases. For example, with an increased database size, assuming the data transmission rate R remains the same, the program title acquisition time in the receiver can increase proportionally if all block types are transmitted at the same frequency. This undesirable increase in acquisition time can be avoided by transmitting the description data at a lower frequency, in which case only some of the description blocks are transmitted in each cycle. As a result, a consumer will be able to first get program title information relatively quickly, and then acquire program descriptions, if desired. Note that the consumer may not be interested in any descriptions for the first group of program titles displayed, and may instead be interested in viewing additional program titles before making a viewing selection.
- the data sequence 450 includes both the schedule_listing blocks and data description blocks of pages four, five, six and seven, shown at 480 , 465 , 485 and 470 , respectively, but only the schedule_listing blocks of pages one, two and three, shown at 455 , 475 and 460 , respectively.
- the schedule_listing blocks will be transmitted at an effective rate of once per transmission cycle
- the description blocks will be transmitted at an effective rate of once every two transmission cycles.
- the foundation page is transmitted at a rate of once per transmission cycle. Variations on the above scheme are possible, for example, F d may be set to 1 ⁇ 3, 1 ⁇ 4 and so on, and F f may also vary.
- the desired relative acquisition times for different data block types that must be transmitted will determine the appropriate transmission frequencies.
- FIG. 5 shows a foundation page for increased repetition frequency in accordance with the present invention. Since an up-to-date foundation page is indispensable to IPG functioning, it may be desirable to transmit the foundation page more than once per cycle to allow quicker acquisition by the receiver.
- Data sequence 500 is the same as the odd cycle data sequence 400 of FIG. 4, except that an additional foundation page 502 has been provided between page seven, shown at 435 , and page two, shown at 410 .
- F f 2 since the foundation page is provided at a rate of two pages per transmission cycle.
- data sequence 550 is the same as the odd cycle data sequence 450 of FIG. 4, but an additional foundation page 503 has been provided between page seven, shown at 470 , and page two, shown at 475 .
- FIG. 6 shows the ordering of a data stream with page partitioning and all block types being transmitted at the same frequency in accordance with the present invention.
- the shuffle approach described previously was applied simultaneously to all data segments.
- the shuffle operation is performed separately on the segments of each subset of pages in order to optimize the inter-segment arrival time.
- the pages within each transmission cycle are divided into G subsets of approximately equal size.
- Data sequence 600 is the same as the re-ordered sequence 350 of FIG. 3, but the foundation page and pages one, three, five and seven are included in the first subset 640 , and pages two, four and six are included in the second subset 680 .
- FIG. 7 shows the ordering of a data stream with page partitioning and different block types being transmitted at different frequencies in accordance with the present invention.
- data sequence 700 is the same as sequence 500 of FIG. 5, but the foundation page and pages one, three, five and seven are included in the first subset, and the foundation page and pages two, four and six are included in the second subset.
- page partitioning variations are possible.
- a number of subsets may be provided in each transmission cycle, with the block types and transmission frequencies varying within each subset.
- the purpose of page partitioning is to find an optimal value of the minimum distance D.
- the minimum inter-segment distance will determine the minimum segment inter-segment arrival time, T.
- T must correspond to the receiver processing speed, which is measured by the minimum allowed time delay, T d , between two data segments of the same page.
- An optimal distance is a distance that gives the smallest T such that T ⁇ T d .
- T d 50 milliseconds (msec).
- T d 50 milliseconds (msec).
- the second partition is preferred. If two further partitions produce 70 and 40 msec inter-segment arrival times, respectively, the partition corresponding to 70 msec is considered optimal.
- the 40 msec inter-segment arrival time is unacceptable since it is incompatible with the processing speed of the receiver.
- a partition that results in an optimal inter-segment distance is therefore an optimal partition.
- Using optimal partitioning improves the best acquisition time in the receiver without increasing the worst case time, where the acquisition time of different pages may vary, for example, due to varying page sizes.
- a sub-optimal partitioning may have to be used which gives a distance greater than the minimum allowed receiver delay time, T d in order to account for variations in the data stream, communication channel and/or the receiver.
- FIG. 8 shows the procedure for optimizing inter-segment arrival time in accordance with the present invention.
- the inter-segment arrival time is optimized by finding an optimal page partition, and then shuffling the segments within each subset of pages.
- the optimization is performed at the startup of the IPG system and after changing any IPG system configuration parameter such as data rate, database lookahead period, or slot size.
- the data pages of the transmission cycle are re-ordered to separate the odd- and even-numbered pages.
- the repetition frequency for the different block types is selected.
- the number of subsets G is set to one. Blocks 805 - 815 thus define initialization steps.
- the data pages are partitioned into G subsets of approximately equal size.
- the data segments are shuffled. That is, shuffling is performed separately within each subset. Note that each subset of pages may have a different number of data segments.
- the minimum inter-segment arrival time, T i is determined for each of the G subsets, as will be discussed below.
- T 840 if 1.5 T d ⁇ T ⁇ 2.5T d , where T d is the minimum receiver interval, then the corresponding partition is considered optimal at block 860 . Otherwise, if T ⁇ 1.5T d , at block 845 , then the number of subsets G is decremented by 1 at block 850 to achieve an optimal partition at block 860 .
- the maximum of G-1 and one is taken. Otherwise, the number of subsets G is incremented by one at block 855 , and the data pages are again partitioned into G subsets at block 820 .
- the process may be modified in an experimental procedure if T d is not known.
- G can be incremented in each pass as shown in FIG. 8, and the receiver can be monitored to ensure that it is still able to acquire the data segments.
- the inter-segment arrival time can be estimated as follows.
- the estimation is a simplified illustration, and may vary from an actual implementation.
- the following variables are used in the calculations and descriptions:
- D Minimum distance between any two consecutive segments defining the same time slot; typically D ⁇ D′ (segments)
- D′ may be reduced by one segment when dummy segments are provided in the original data sequence, as in the example of FIG. 2, where three dummy segments 25 - 27 were added to the data sequence 200 .
- D′ must be reduced by at least another data segment when the pages have different sizes, as with the data sequence 350 , where page one, shown at 305 , contains six segments, page two, shown at 310 , contains five segments, page three, shown at 315 , contains five segments, page four, shown at 320 , contains four segments, page five, shown at 325 , contains eight segments, page 6 , shown at 330 , contains seven segments, and page 7 , shown at 335 , contains five segments.
- each page contains data for scheduling of a four-hour time slot.
- D′ 42
- Table 1 below shows the results for different data rates and slot sizes. As can be seen, with a fixed number of data segments in a transmission cycle, the inter-segment delay, T, will increase proportionately as the time slot size S decreases.
- the inter-segment arrival time is reduced.
- the transmission cycle is partitioned into two subsets 640 and 680 , and all block types are transmitted at the same frequency.
- T k 5.3 msec to transmit one megabyte of data (e.g., one segment)
- each subset has approximately the same number of pages since this will yield the largest D′.
- D′ the transmission cycle pages
- the forty-two data pages with the four-hour time slot were allocated in proportion to the original distribution, e.g., in the proportion of 4:3, a non-optimal partitioning would result.
- a larger minimum inter-segment distance D′ is desirable since it yields a larger inter-segment arrival time.
- Data sequence 700 includes a first subset 740 and a second subset 780 .
- the first subset 740 includes four pages, again ignoring the foundation page 402 .
- the inter-segment arrival time for the first subset 740 can be determined similarly.
- the twenty-one pages carried in the second subset 780 will include ten segments which carry both schedule and description blocks, and eleven segments which carry only description blocks.
- Table 4 shows the results for different data rates and slot sizes.
- each data segment was assumed to be one kilobyte long. If the segment length is actually smaller, the inter-segment arrival time will be shorter.
- the above examples assumed that the different pages had unequal, but similar sizes, which resulted in a reduction of inter-segment distance by one from D′, the number of pages (e.g., time slots) within the lookahead period, L. If this is not the case, for example, when one of the pages is much larger than the others, the distance D may be reduced further.
- the results in Table 4 assume a description block to be of the same size as a schedule_listing block. This may vary in a real database.
- FIG. 9 is a block diagram of an apparatus for transmitting IPG data in accordance with the present invention.
- the encoder apparatus shown may be used for assembling and transmitting interactive program guide (IPG) packets in a multiplex with various programming services to be provided over a communication network.
- a packet stream multiplexer 914 receives data packets for N different services that are input to the multiplexer via a plurality of terminals 910 , 912 .
- IPG packets are also input to the packet stream multiplexer 914 for multiplexing with the data packets for the different services after processing in accordance with the present invention.
- the packet stream multiplex output from multiplexer 914 is transmitted over the communication network by a conventional transmitter 922 .
- the communication network can comprise, for example, a satellite communication network, a cable television network or a telephone network.
- IPG scheduling information is input to an IPG data processor 916 via an operator interface 918 .
- the operator interface can comprise, for example, a workstation having a keyboard through which an operator inputs various scheduling information.
- the scheduling information is typically organized by time slots within a particular day.
- the time slots can be any size, for example two, four, six, eight or twelve hours.
- a title can be provided together with the time at which the event is available.
- a description of the event can also be provided as part of the IPG data input via the operator interface.
- the IPG processor performs the steps set forth in FIG. 8, and outputs both a demand data stream 917 and a trickle data stream 919 .
- the demand data stream comprises shuffled data segments which are provided in a plurality of data pages.
- the data pages may be arranged in subsets in the data stream.
- the trickle stream is a low rate IPG stream that is used to improve the responsiveness and user friendliness of the program guide function by ensuring that the memory in a subscriber's receiver always holds a database which is up-to-date for current programming.
- the desired portion is acquired from the high speed demand stream.
- trickle data does not need to be present for programs scheduled farther in the future than can be held in the available receivers having the largest IPG RAM allocation. All other data is provided via the demand stream.
- the trickle stream it is preferable for the trickle stream to be formatted and constructed the same as the demand stream(s). However, there is no need to process the trickle data stream in accordance with the scheme of the present invention since it is provided at a much lower rate than the demand data stream. Data blocks received from the trickle stream are filtered in firmware at the receiver to reject those representing data farther in the future than the particular receiver's RAM can hold. It is also preferable to provide only one trickle stream per multiplex, with all of the current scheduling data being carried in that single stream.
- the demand data may be provided in a plurality of different data streams carried in the multiplex output from packet stream multiplexer 914 .
- the trickle and demand streams are output separately from the IPG data processor 916 , then multiplexed together and packetized in an IPG multiplexer and packetizer 920 .
- the resultant IPG packets are input to the packet stream multiplexer 914 and combined with the packets for the various programming services carried in the transmitted multiplex.
- the receiver RAM By providing the most current schedule information (e.g., the schedules for the current day) in the receiver RAM, this information can be retrieved by a user without delay once the RAM has been loaded.
- the remaining data in the schedule database i.e., the demand data, must be retrievable with as small a delay as reasonably possible within the constraints of system cost and complexity.
- a user selects a time period of interest in the future, he must be able to see the program grid for the future time period (containing the schedule of events for that time period) in as short a time as possible. This time should not exceed several seconds.
- the program description information should be available no more than several seconds later (e.g., one to three seconds) for programs whose titles are visible on the screen.
- the necessary low acquisition time requires the delivery of IPG data not already stored in RAM at a high transmitted rate via the demand data stream.
- FIG. 10 is a block diagram of an apparatus for receiving IPG data in accordance with the present invention.
- a data receiver 1032 receives the transmitted data stream via an input terminal 1030 .
- the received data is provided to a packet stream demultiplexer 1034 that outputs the demand and trickle IPG data packets to an IPG microprocessor 1036 .
- Other packets in the transport stream which may include video and audio packets, are also output from the packet stream demultiplexer 1034 .
- Microprocessor 1036 separately processes the demand and trickle data streams. Processing of the shuffled demand data segments is provided at function 1040 .
- Trickle processing is provided at function 1044 .
- the demand processing occurs at a much higher rate than the trickle processing. For example, the data rate for the demand stream will be on the order of 1-2 Mbps, while the data rate of the trickle stream will be on the order of ten kilobits per second (Kbps). Since the trickle data is stored locally in the receiver's memory, there is no need for it to be provided in a high rate data stream as it will be instantly accessible from the receiver RAM.
- Loading of the trickle data as well as selective portions of the demand data into system RAM 1050 is controlled by a memory manager 1048 coupled to a microprocessor 1036 .
- the memory manager will address the RAM 1050 in a conventional manner to store the trickle and demand data for subsequent retrieval by the microprocessor and display on a monitor 1054 or the like coupled to a video processor 1052 .
- Selection of particular time slots of future scheduling information carried in the demand data stream is made via a user interface 1046 .
- the user interface can comprise, for example, a remote control coupled to input instructions to microprocessor 1036 .
- memory manager 1048 One function of memory manager 1048 is to monitor the amount of free memory available in the system RAM 1050 . In the event that the amount of memory available is less than that required to store the title and description records for a time slot of interest, the memory manager can purge description records from the system RAM in order to make room for all of the title records. In this manner, the title information will be immediately available to a user once it has been downloaded into the system RAM. If there is not enough room to store the corresponding description information, the description record for an event requested by a user can be obtained from the demand data stream on an as needed basis. Since the demand data is transmitted at a high rate, the acquisition time for a requested description not already stored in system RAM 1050 will be fairly short.
- the amount of system RAM 1050 allocated for IPG data will be enough to hold at least twenty four hours of current schedule information.
- schedule information for at least a full day of events at a time can be accommodated.
- all of the scheduling information for at least the current day's events may be provided in the trickle data stream for downloading into system RAM 1050 .
- microprocessor 1036 can provide first and second PID processors for acquiring schedule information spanning two consecutive time slots.
- the separate PID processors could be implemented in either hardware or firmware.
- the first PID processor will acquire schedule information contained in a first page for a first time slot.
- the second PID processor will acquire schedule information contained in a second page for a second time slot that immediately follows the first time slot. For a given length of time interval for the on-screen display, the time slot size can be selected so that any single screen of display will require no more than two pages of IPG data.
- the microprocessor will selectively combine portions of schedule information acquired by the first and second PID processors to provide a schedule of events available during a time period spanning the first and second time slots.
- the combined schedule is output to processor 1052 for display on display 1054 .
- a service carried on the information network can be divided among a plurality of different data streams, each having its own PID. Processing is simplified in such an embodiment because the individual data rates are smaller. At higher data rates, hardware filtering may also be required.
- the records describing time slots include daily schedule/title records and description records.
- the records describing time slots are carried in the form of a “schedule record” that combines title and description information into a daily schedule.
- the inter-segment arrival time of IPG data segments in a data stream is determined mainly by data transmission rate R, database lookahead period L, slot size S, the relative sizes of data pages and blocks, and segment lengths.
- the design criteria is to select the minimum inter-segment arrival time, T, that does not exceed the acquisition capability of the receiver.
- the present invention allows adjustment of various criteria, including the time slot duration and number of pages per transmission cycle, in order to arrive at an optimal solution.
- the present invention provides different formatting options regarding the partitioning of pages and the transmission frequency of different types of data blocks or segments in a page.
