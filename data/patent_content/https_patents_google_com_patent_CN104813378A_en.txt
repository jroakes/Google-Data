In some embodiments, intelligent hazard detector 104 is arranged in the out of reach position of occupant, such as, in the eminence or on the ceiling of wall.Therefore, when false alarm, occupant can not get at intelligent hazard detector 104 to press the button removing this alarm.Therefore, the embodiment of intelligent hazard detector 104 allows occupant to use " quiet gesture " to remove this alarm.Such as, intelligent hazard detector 104 detects special " quiet gesture " from one of occupant, and responsively removes this alarm.
According to embodiment, one or more sonacs 524 of intelligent hazard detector 104 can be used for detecting " the quiet gesture " of occupant.In some embodiments, each of sonac 524 can comprise multiple piezoelectricity to make sensor be " omnibearing " and to make to be easier to detect occupant when make quiet gesture.The sonac 524 in the intelligent hazard detector 104 of battery charging version is used to be particularly advantageous, this is because sonac 524 consumes considerably less electric power.Sonac 524 so works: send pulse, calculates afterwards and sends the distance that pulse and the time interval received between corresponding echo determine object.In some embodiments, the single piezoelectricity of sonac sends pulse and receives echo.In other embodiments, different piezoelectricity sends pulse and receives echo.
In normal running, the sonac 524 of intelligent hazard detector 104 only performs and takies sensing function.Such as, they determine that whether room is occupied.When performing this function, sonac 524 has the transmission and reception speed (ping rate) of about 1 hertz.This low transmission and reception speed is designed to keep battery electric power, still effectively performs simultaneously and takies detection.Such as, but when the one in other sensor (such as, smog, fire or carbon monoxide transducer) enables alarm, intelligent hazard detector 104 increases transmission and reception speed, increases to 20 hertz.The transmission and reception speed of this increase enables the detection of " quiet gesture " preferably, only carries out this detection when this alarm enlivens.When " quiet gesture " being detected, sonac 524 " searching " object (such as, staff) keeps from intelligent hazard detector 104 preset distance with at the appointed time section.
With reference to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, example " quiet gesture " is described.As shown in the frame 604 in Fig. 6, occupant stands in room 612, and the alarm in hazard detector 104 is active and send " beep " sound.Lamp 610 (such as, LED) is arranged on the outside of intelligent hazard detector 104, thus when turning on lamp 610, occupant 608 can see lamp 610.The operation of lamp 610 is described with reference to Fig. 7.Can say for Fig. 6, in frame 604 to frame 624, lamp is closed.As shown in frame 616, occupant 608 has gone to compared with the position close to intelligent hazard detector 104, and intelligent hazard detector 104 installs out of reach position on the ceiling of the room.As shown in frame 620, occupant 608 goes to the position closer to intelligent hazard detector 104, thus occupant 608 is almost immediately below intelligent hazard detector 104.As shown in the arrow 628 of frame 624, when occupant 608 almost stands in immediately below intelligent hazard detector 104, occupant 608 starts to protrude upward arm towards intelligent hazard detector 104.
Refer to now the frame 630 of Fig. 7, the arm of occupant 608 is protruded upward towards intelligent hazard detector 104, occupant almost stands in immediately below intelligent hazard detector 104 simultaneously.At alarm sounding and pulse rate increase after, the sonac " searching " of intelligent hazard detector 104 is to the triggering of " quiet gesture " period, and this period is must maintain " quiet gesture " to remove the time quantum of this alarm.According to some embodiments, this triggering is the distance change from baseline, and in order to sound all clear, must keep the change of this distance in whole " quiet gesture " period (such as, three seconds).Such as, if baseline is the distance between sensor and the floor in room, then the object entered between it and floor found by this sensor, change thus by sensor measurement to distance.In some embodiments, the change of this distance is sufficiently greatly to guarantee that someone makes alarm quiet close to also wanting.Such as, if be ten feet to the distance on floor, then the distance change needed can be 80 percent of eight feet or raw range.So, object needs to trigger " quiet gesture " period within two feet of distance sensor, and in order to sound all clear, this object must keep treating there within the duration of this period.Except other side, can based on the height of ceiling and based on occupant height and configure needs distance change.
Still reference block 630, when occupant 608 successfully triggers " quiet gesture " period, opens lamp 610, signals to occupant 608 thus to remain in this position within the period (such as three seconds) needed.Here, the hand of occupant 608 triggers " quiet gesture " period.Foundation tolerance value, if thus occupant 608 move a little and lossing signal but recapture signal very soon, then continuation does not need to restart by " quiet gesture " period.As shown in frame 634, hand remains in the required separation distance of sensor by occupant within the duration of " quiet gesture " period, therefore relieves alarm, and " beep " sound stops, and lamp 610 is closed.As shown in frame 638 and frame 642, occupant 608 can leave from intelligent hazard detector 104 and continue normal activity.
Be to be understood that, when intelligent hazard detector 104 is designed to from the reliable electric power of the wire receiver of family (but not powered battery), charge-coupled image sensor (Charge Coupled Device, CCD) chip can be used for detecting " quiet gesture ".But this layout is unsuitable for battery powered hazard detector 104, because CCD chip and relevant process consume a large amount of electric power and can exhaust battery rapidly.Other possible alternative thing of sonac 524 comprises passive IR sensor, thermoelectric pile (such as, thermoelectricity video camera), range observation laser instrument, laser instrument and camera chain (because video camera finds round dot but not time of arrival (Doppler shift)), full width video camera and image processing system.
According to some embodiments, in order to improve reliability and the validity of quiet gesture, sonac 524 can with the work of passive IR sensor synergism to make sensing better.Such as, when occupant is by being placed in place to attempt peace and quiet by hand, passive IR will sense this action, trigger " quiet gesture " period thus.Sonac 524 also can with thermoelectric pile (such as, thermoelectricity video camera) collaborative work, wherein service range change and heat detect quiet gesture.Such as, when thermoelectricity video camera detects staff and trigger " quiet gesture " period nearby.In addition, sonac 524 can with ambient light sensor collaborative work.Such as, when hand to be placed in place and to stop light, then ambient light sensor knows that occupant and therefore trigger " quiet gesture " period nearby.
Should be appreciated that according to embodiment, similar " gesture " can be controlled other smart machine be applied in family, such as, be applied to intelligent thermostat, intelligent wall switch etc.Such as, can have for increasing or reducing temperature controlled gesture, for turning on the gesture etc. of closing lamp, HVAC.
