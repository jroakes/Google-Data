Abstract
Description
- This disclosure relates to content identification.
- Content of a first type, such as web pages, can be identified by one or more content servers in response to queries. The queries can, for example, include search engine queries. Additional contents of a second type, such as advertisements, can also be identified in response to the queries. For example, advertisements can be identified based on keywords in the queries.
- Occasionally, however, content of the second type may not be identified in response to the query, or the identified content of the second type defines a small content set.
- In an implementation, content of a first type, e.g., web pages, responsive to a query is identified. One or more correlated entities based on the content of the first type are identified, and content of a second type, e.g., advertisements, based on one or more of the correlated entities is identified.
- In another implementation, one or more keywords are selected and one or more queries based on the one or more keywords are generated. Content of a first type, e.g., web pages, responsive to the one or more queries is identified, and one or more correlated entities based on the content of the first type are identified. The one or more keywords are associated with the correlated entities.

Thecontent engine 106 can, for example, generate additional content of a second type, e.g., advertisements, in response to the queries. For example, aquery 108 can be submitted from theclient device 102 to thesearch engine 104. Thequery 108 can, for example, include search terms or keywords. Thesearch engine 104 can generate content of thefirst type 110 in response to thequery 108. For example, thesearch engine 104 can identify web documents or links to web documents that include search terms. The content of thefirst type 110 can be provided to theclient device 102. - In one implementation, the
search engine 104 can provide thequery 108 and the content of thefirst type 110 to thecontent engine 106, as illustrated by the single fine dashed line. In another implementation, thecontent engine 106 can separately receive thequery 108 from theclient device 102 and the content of thefirst type 110 from thesearch engine 104, as illustrated by the pair of coarse dashed lines. - The
content engine 106 can, for example, generate content of thesecond type 112, such as advertisements, based on thequery 108 and provide the content of thesecond type 112 to theclient device 102. For example, theclient device 102 can receive advertisements related to thequery 108 from thecontent engine 106 and display the advertisements in a browsing application. - It is possible, however, that the
content engine 106 may fail to identify content of thesecond type 112, e.g., advertisements, based on thequery 108, or may only identify a small set of content of thesecond type 112, e.g., one or two advertisements, based on thequery 108. To expand the identification of content of the second type, thecontent engine 106 can also generate additional content of thesecond type 114 based on the content of thefirst type 110. For example, thecontent engine 106 can generate advertisements based on web documents identified in response to thequery 108. In an implementation, thecontent engine 106 can identify correlated entities in the content of thefirst type 110. For example, thecontent engine 106 can identify single- or multi-word expressions that frequently occur in web documents returned from thequery 108. Based on one or more of the correlated entities, thecontent engine 106 can identify content of thesecond type 114, such as advertisements. Upon receipt of the content of thesecond type 114, theclient device 102 can, for example, display the content of thesecond type 114. - In another implementation, the
search engine 104 can, for example, identify the correlated entities in the content of thefirst type 110, and provide one or more of the correlated entities to thecontent engine 106. Thecontent engine 106 can identify the content of the second type based on the one or more correlated entities. - The content of the
second type 114 can include advertisements in the form of creatives including text, graphics and/or audio associated with the advertised service or product. The content of thesecond type 114 can also include other data, including image data, such as still images or video clips, and audio data, such as music or speech. The other data may also include a link to an advertisement “landing document” that contains further details about the advertised product or service, such as promotional materials, descriptions, coupons, etc. The link may be embedded in the advertisement or may be appended to the advertisement as a separate link. - Other content types can also be used. For example, the content of the first type can be audio and/or video files and/or streams that include metadata describing the audio and/or video content. Likewise, the content of the second type can, for example, be additional content such as text content, audio content, and/or video content. In one implementation, the content of the second type can include audio and/or video advertisements.

FIG. 2 is an example screen shot of aninterface 200 to a search engine, such as thesearch engine 104, displaying content of a first type, e.g. web documents, portions of web documents, or links to web documents. Theinterface 200 can, for example, be implemented in a web browsing application, in a widget, or in some other executable process on theclient device 102. A user can, for example, type insearch terms 202 into a text field and select asearch button 204. Thesearch terms 202 can be provided to thesearch engine 104, and thesearch engine 104 can generate a list ofweb documents 206 based on thesearch terms 202. The web documents 206 can, for example, be displayed in a frame of thesearch engine interface 200. - The
content engine 106 can, for example, generate advertisements related to the search terms and display the advertisements in aframe 208 of thesearch engine interface 200. For somesearch terms 202, however, thecontent engine 106 may not be able to identify advertisements related to those search terms, and theframe 208 may be empty, as shown inFIG. 2 . -
FIG. 3 is an example screen shot of aninterface 300 to a search engine displaying content of a first type and content of a second type, e.g., advertisements. The advertisements can, for example, be identified based on correlated entities. Thecontent engine 106 can, for example, identify correlated entities in theweb documents 206, and based one or more of these correlated entities, identify one ormore advertisements 302. Theadvertisements 302 can be provided to thesearch engine interface 300 and displayed to the user. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram 400 illustrating identification of correlated entities. The content of thefirst type 110 can include several content elements such ascontent elements 404 a-c. For example, the content of thefirst type 110 can define a set of web documents andcontent elements 404 a-c can be individual web documents. In one implementation, theweb documents 404 a-c can, for example, be cached copies stored on one or more servers in communication with thesearch engine 104 and/orcontent engine 106. In another implementation, theweb documents 404 a-c can, for example, be retrieved from a publisher by thesearch engine 104 and/orcontent engine 106. Other content elements can also be used. - The
search engine 104 and/or thecontent engine 106 can process thecontent elements 404 a-c to identify one or more correlatedentities 404. For example, a set of web documents can be searched to find multi-word expressions that occur in accordance with a frequency measurement in the set of web documents, or in a subset of the web documents. Thecontent engine 106 can, for example, identify content of asecond type 114, e.g., advertisements based on the one or more correlatedentities 404. - For example, a query that includes one or more search terms can result in the identification of numerous web pages but few, if any, advertisements. By way of example only, if the query relates to soccer, such as the name of a soccer club, e.g., “Legia,” the
search engine 104 and/or thecontent engine 106 may identify multiple correlated entities related to soccer, e.g., “soccer,” “soccer club,” “soccer equipment,” “sports leagues,” etc. Such correlated entities can, for example, be utilized by thecontent engine 106 to identify advertisements. In one implementation, one or more of the correlated entities are utilized as a query by thecontent engine 106. Other identification schemes can also be used. - In one implementation, the
content engine 106 can determine if the content of the second type exceeds a threshold value, for example, five advertisements. If thecontent engine 106 determines that the content of the second type does not exceed the threshold, thecontent engine 106 can, for example, identify the multi-word expressions based on the content of web documents. Conversely, if thecontent engine 106 determines that the content of the second type does exceed the threshold, thecontent engine 106 can terminate the search process. -
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of acontent engine system 500. Thecontent engine system 500 can, for example, include acorrelation engine 502, aranking engine 504, and a keyword/correlatedentity data store 506. - The
correlation engine 504 can, for example, identify correlatedentities 404 based on the content of thefirst type 110 by identifying entities, such as single- or multi-word expressions, that occur according to, for example, a frequency measure in the content of thefirst type 110. A correlatedentity 404 can be identified based on a single document or based on multiple documents. For example, thecorrelation engine 504 can identify multi-word expressions whose frequency of occurrence in a set of web pages exceeds a threshold, e.g., a multi-word expression occurring more than a total of 50 times in one or more web documents. In one implementation, correlatedentities 404 can be identified if the average frequency per web document exceeds a threshold, e.g., if a multi-word expressions appears, on average, more than 5 times per web document in a set of web documents. Other processes and algorithms to identify correlated entities can also be used. Identified correlatedentities 404 can, for example, be stored in the keyword/correlatedentity store 506. - The
ranking engine 504 can, for example, rank correlatedentities 404 according to one or more metrics. For example, correlatedentities 404 can be ranked based on a frequency of occurrence in the content of thefirst type 110, such as a frequency of occurrence of single- or multi-word expressions in one or more web documents. In another implementation, correlatedentities 404 can be ranked based on locations of the correlatedentities 404 in the content of thefirst type 110. For example, correlatedentities 404 that are prominently displayed, such as in titles, headings, displayed in a larger font, etc., can be ranked higher than correlatedentities 404 identified in ordinary paragraph text. - In another implementation, correlated
entities 404 can be ranked based on a relevance measure between each content of thefirst type 110 and thequery 108. Thesearch engine 104 can, for example, determine a relevance measure that indicates a degree of relevance between a web document and thequery 108. For example, the content of the first type, e.g., web documents, may be presented by thesearch engine 104 based on the relevance measure. Correlatedentities 404 that are found in web documents having a higher relevance measure can be ranked higher than correlatedentities 404 found in web documents having a lower relevance measure. The ranking metrics can, for example, be stored in the keyword/correlatedentity store 506. - In one implementation, correlated
entities 404 that are associated with keywords can, for example, but utilized concurrently with the keyword to identify the content of the second type. The preprocessing of the correlatedentities 404 can, for example, facilitate a more responsive search for content of the second type. - In another implementation, correlated
entities 404 that are associated with keywords generated from a particular web page can, for example, be offered to a publishers of a web pages associated with the keywords. The offer can, for example, be implemented through an auction, or by some other offer process. -
FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of anexample process 600 for identifying content based on correlated entities. Theprocess 600 can, for example, be implemented in a system such as thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 implementing thesystem 500 ofFIG. 5 . - Stage 602 identifies content of a first type responsive to a query. For example, the
search engine 104 can identify the content of thefirst type 110, e.g., web documents, in response to thequery 108. - Stage 604 identifies one or more correlated entities based on the content of the first type. For example, the
content engine 106 can identify correlated entities, e.g., multi-word expressions, based on the content of thefirst type 110. -
Stage 606 identifies content of a second type based on one or more of the correlated entities. For example, thecontent engine 106 can identify advertisements based on one or more multi-word expressions. -
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of anexample process 700 for ranking correlated entities. Theprocess 700 can, for example, be implemented in a system such as thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 implementing thesystem 500 ofFIG. 5 . -
Stage 702 ranks the correlated entities based on a frequency of occurrence in the content of the first type. For example, thecontent engine 106 can rank multi-word expressions based on a frequency of occurrence in web documents. - Stage 704 ranks the correlated entities based on locations of the correlated entities in the content of the first type. For example, correlated entities that are found in prominent locations such as titles and headings or are displayed in a larger font can be ranked higher than correlated entities found in ordinary paragraph text.
-
Stage 706 ranks the correlated entities based on a relevance measure between each content of the first type and the query. For example, correlated entities can be ranked by a relevance measure provided by thesearch engine 104, where the relevance measure indicates how relevant a web document is to thequery 108. -
FIG. 8 is a flow diagram of anexample process 800 for filtering content based on correlated entities. Theprocess 800 can, for example, be implemented in a system such as thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 implementing thesystem 500 ofFIG. 5 . -
Stage 802 identifies content of the second type responsive to the query. For example, thecontent engine 106 can identify advertisements that are related to thequery 108. -
Stage 804 filters the content of the second type based on one or more of the correlated entities. For example, advertisements that are related to both thequery 108 and the correlatedentities 404 can be displayed first. -
FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of anexample process 900 for selectively identifying content. For example, advertisements can be identified based on correlated entities if the number of advertisements identified based on thequery 108 is less than a threshold. Theprocess 900 can, for example, be implemented in a system such as thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 implementing thesystem 500 ofFIG. 5 . -
Stage 902 identifies content of the second type based on the query. For example, thecontent engine 106 can identify advertisements that are related to thequery 108. - Stage 904 determines if the identified content exceeds a threshold. For example, the
content engine 106 can determine if the number of advertisements related to thequery 108 exceeds a threshold value, for example 5 advertisements. - If stage 904 determines that the identified content does not exceed a threshold, then stage 906 identifies one or more correlated entities based on the content of the first type. For example, the
content engine 106 can identify multi-word expressions based on the content of web documents. -
Stage 908 identifies content of a second type based on one or more of the correlated entities. For example, thecontent engine 106 can identify advertisements based on one or more multi-word expressions. The advertisements based on the correlated entities can be displayed together with the advertisements that may have been identified based on thequery 108. - After the execution of
stage 908, theprocess 900 proceeds to stage 904. If stage 904 determines that the identified content exceeds the threshold, theprocess 900 proceeds to stage 910, at which time the query processing ends. Otherwise, thestages 906 and 908 can be executed again. -
FIG. 10 is a flow diagram of anexample process 1000 for determining a relevance measure. Theprocess 1000 can, for example, be implemented in a system such as thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 implementing thesystem 500 ofFIG. 5 . - Stage 1002 determines a relevance measure between the query and the content of the second type. For example, the
content engine 106 can determine a relevance measure between thequery 108 and advertisements that have been identified based on correlated entities found in web documents. -
Stage 1004 presents the content of the second type if the relevance measure exceeds a threshold. For example, thecontent engine 106 can present advertisements that have a relevance measure of 50% or higher with thequery 108. -
FIG. 11 is a flow diagram of anexample process 1100 for associating keywords with correlated entities. Theprocess 1100 can, for example, be implemented in a system such as thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 implementing thesystem 500 ofFIG. 5 . -
Stage 1102 selects one or more keywords. For example, keywords associated with a particular web document can be selected. In one implementation, the keywords can be selected automatically, e.g., a web page can be submitted tosearch engine 104, and thesearch engine 104 can process the web page to identify relevant keywords. -
Stage 1104 generates queries based on the one or more keywords. For example, queries based on the keywords can be submitted as search queries to thesearch engine 104. -
Stage 1106 identifies content of a first type responsive to the one or more queries. For example, thesearch engine 104 can identify one or more web pages responsive to the query. -
Stage 1108 identifies one or more correlated entities based on the content of the first type. For example, thecontent engine 106 can identify multi-word expressions based on web documents returned from thequery 108; or can identify keywords associated with the web documents returned from thequery 108; or can identify correlated entities according to other identification schemes. -
Stage 1110 associates one or more keywords with the correlated entities. For example, multi-word expressions that have been identified can be added to a list of search keywords associated with a particular web document. - The one or more correlated entities, upon such association, can, for example, be utilized by the
content engine 106 to identify content of the second type when an associated keyword is submitted to thesearch engine 104. -
