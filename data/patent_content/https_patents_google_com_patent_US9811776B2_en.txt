Definitions
- the invention generally relates to knowledge items. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and systems for understanding meaning of knowledge items using information associated with the knowledge item.
- Knowledge items are anything physical or non-physical that can be represented through symbols and can be, for example, keywords, nodes, categories, people, concepts, products, phrases, documents, and other units of knowledge.
- Knowledge items can take any form, for example, a single word, a term, a short phrase, a document, or some other structured or unstructured information.
- Documents include, for example, web pages of various formats, such as HTML, XML, XHTML; Portable Document Format (PDF) files; and word processor and application program document files.
- PDF Portable Document Format
- a knowledge item such as, content from a document
- a knowledge item can be matched to another knowledge item, such as, a keyword or advertisement.
- a knowledge item, such as, a document may be associated with another document containing related content so that the two documents can be seen to be related.
- Internet advertising can take various forms. For example, a publisher of a website may allow advertising for a fee on its web pages.
- a facilitator can provide an advertisement to the publisher to display on the web page.
- the facilitator can select the advertisement by a variety of factors, such as demographic information about the user, the category of the web page, for example, sports or entertainment, or the content of the web page.
- the facilitator can also match the content of the web page to a knowledge item, such as a keyword, from a list of keywords.
- An advertisement associated with the matched keyword can then be displayed on the web page.
- a user may manipulate a mouse or another input device and “click” on the advertisement to view a web page on the advertiser's website that offers goods or services for sale.
- the actual matched keywords are displayed on a publisher's web page in a Related Links or similar section. Similar to the example above, the content of the web page is matched to the one or more keywords, which are then displayed in the Related Links section, for example.
- the user clicks on a particular keyword the user can be directed to a search results page that may contain a mixture of advertisements and regular search results. Advertisers bid on the keyword to have their advertisements appear on such a search results page for the keyword.
- a user may manipulate a mouse or another input device and “click” on the advertisement to view a web page on the advertiser's website that offers goods or services for sale.
- Advertisers desire that the content of the web page closely relate to the advertisement, because a user viewing the web page is more likely to click on the advertisement and purchase the goods or services being offered if they are highly relevant to what the user is reading on the web page.
- the publisher of the web page also wants the content of the advertisement to match the content of the web page, because the publisher is often compensated if the user clicks on the advertisement and a mismatch could be offensive to either the advertiser or the publisher in the case of sensitive content.
- the term “apple” can relate to at least two concepts.
- Apple can refer to the fruit or the computer company by the same name.
- a web page can contain a news story about Apple Computer and the most frequently used keyword on the web page, in this case “apple”, could be chosen to represent the web page.
- the highest bidder on the keyword “apple” is a seller of apples and if the keyword “apple” is matched to the web page, the advertisement about apples, the fruit, would be displayed on the web page dealing with Apple, the computer company. This is undesirable, because a reader of the web page about a computer company is likely not also interested in purchasing apples.

- the method 200 shown provides an understanding of the meaning of a keyword using information associated with the keyword.
- FIGS. 2-3 represents one or more steps carried out in the exemplary method 200 .
- the example method 200 begins.
- Block 202 is followed by block 204 in which a keyword is received by the knowledge item engine 124 .
- the keyword can for example, be received from an external database through network 106 , such as the content database 148 or can be received from other sources.
- the keyword is processed by knowledge item processor 135 to determine known information about the keyword.
- the keyword may have one or more concepts associated with it.
- Each concept may have an associated cluster or group of words.
- a concept can also be defined by various other information, such as, for example, relationships to related concepts, the strength of relationships to related concepts, parts of speech, common usage, frequency of usage, the breadth of the concept and other statistics about concept usage in language.
- apple there may be two possible associated concepts.
- the first concept of apple the fruit can be defined with relationships to related words or concepts, such as, fruit, food, pie, and eat.
- the second concept of apple the computer company can be defined with relationships to related words or concepts, such as, computer, PC, and technology.
- a keyword can be a short phrase, in which case, the phrase can be broken down by the knowledge item processor 135 , for example, into individual terms. In such example, the knowledge item processor 135 can further determine concepts associated with each term. In some embodiments, the keyword will not have any information associated with it.
- Block 206 is followed by block 208 in which related information associated with the keyword is identified by the information locator 134 and received by the information processor 136 .
- the related information can include documents, such as, the text of advertisements and destination websites from advertisers who have bid on a keyword, web search results on the keyword itself, and related data, such as, other keywords bid on by the advertisers, the cost per click that the advertisers associated with the keyword are paying, the number of times a user has bought an item after clicking through an associated advertisement to an advertiser's website.
- This related information can be located from a variety of sources, such as, for example, the server device 140 , the advertiser's websites, and search engines.
- Block 208 is followed by block 210 , in which the at least one related meaning is determined from the related information by the information processor 136 .
- a meaning could be determined or an overall meaning for all of the documents could be determined.
- documents are processed to determine a vector of weighted concepts contained in the documents.
- the vector of weighted concepts can represent the meaning of the document.
- the advertisement relates to selling Apple Computers
- the meaning of such an advertisement may be fifty percent computers, thirty percent Apple Computers and twenty percent sales.
- the related data can be used, for example, to adjust the weights of the meanings of individual documents or of the overall related meaning.
- the meaning of a document could be related clusters of words.
- Block 210 is followed by block 212 , in which the meaning of the keyword is determined based on the related meaning or meanings by meaning processor 137 .
- Meaning processor 137 receives the related meaning or meanings from information processor 136 and the processed keyword from knowledge item processor 135 .
- the meaning processor would receive the keyword apple and its related two concepts from the knowledge item processor and would receive the related meaning of the advertisement for Apple Computers from the information processor 136 .
- a variety of methods could be used to determine the meaning of the keyword based on the related meaning or meanings received from the information processor 136 .
- the related meaning can be used as a clue to determine the best concept to associate with the keyword to provide a meaning for the keyword.
- the related meaning is, for example, fifty percent computer, thirty percent Apple Computers and twenty percent sales
- the relationship between the weighted concepts of the related meaning and the concepts of the keyword could be used to indicate that the keyword apple should be associated with the concept of the computer company.
- the related meaning or meanings and related data can be used to develop a new meaning for the keyword.
- any one or more of a variety of related information may be used to determine the meaning of a keyword.
- the examples of related information that may be used to determine the meaning of a keyword include, without limitation, one or more of the following:
- this related information may be given different weights depending on some of the information. For example, the text of advertisements of current advertisers may be weighted more than the text of advertisements of former advertisers associated with the keyword. Further, the items associated with the advertiser with the highest cost per click may be weighted more based on the cost per click.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a subroutine 212 for carrying out the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 .
- the subroutine 212 determines the meaning of the keyword using a related meaning or related meanings.
- An example of subroutine 212 is as follows.
- each keyword can comprise one or more terms and each term can have one or more concepts associated with it.
- the keyword comprises a single term with at least two related concepts.
- each concept associated with the keyword is given an a priori probability of the keyword being resolved to it. This a priori probability can be based on information contained in a network of interconnected concepts and/or on previously collected data on the frequency of each term being resolved to the concept.
- probabilities are assigned to each. These values reflect the likelihood that the user really means a certain concept. Because many words have multiple meanings, probabilities for implied meanings for words may be manually preassigned. These values are used in this phase of the engine processing, in order to estimate what meanings are most likely implied by particular search words. Other factors that affect the probabilities given to meanings are: was the meaning matched by a morphed word or the word in its “pure” form (favor pure forms); was the meaning only partially matched the input word(s) (if so, reduce probability); was the meaning the result of a match on multiple words (if so, increase probability); the commonness of the meaning implied (favor more common meanings).
- Block 300 is followed by block 302 , in which the strength of the relationship is determined between the keyword concepts and the related meaning or meanings concepts.
- the related meaning may be comprised of a weighed set of concepts.
- a strength is determined for the relationship between each keyword concept and each related meaning concept.
- the weight of each related meaning concept can be used to adjust the strength of the relationship between the related meaning concepts and the keyword concept.
- the strength can reflect the probability of co-occurrence between concepts, or some measure of closeness of the two concepts, which can be derived from ontological data.
- Block 302 is followed by block 304 , in which the strengths computed in block 302 are used to adjust the probability of the keyword being resolved to each of its associated concepts. For example, the strengths determined for the relationship between each keyword concept and each related meaning concept are used to adjust the probability of each keyword concept being considered. In one embodiment, after the probabilities for the keyword concepts have been adjusted, the probabilities are normalized to one. The steps occurring in blocks 302 and 304 can be repeated a number of times to boost the impact of the strengths of the relationships on the probabilities.
- the keyword can comprise multiple concepts and multiple related meanings may each comprise multiple concepts.
- the keyword meaning can be determined by establishing a probability for each keyword concept that the keyword should be resolved in part to the keyword concept and a probability for each related meaning concept that the keyword should be resolved in part to the related meaning concept. These probabilities can be established in the manner described above with respect to FIG. 3 .
- block 212 is followed by block 214 in which the meaning of the keyword is associated with the keyword and stored.
- the keyword and its associated meaning could be stored together, for example, in the knowledge item database 120 , or could be stored separately in separate databases.
- FIG. 4 illustrates the concept of bond strength and semantic distance in one or more embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 4 illustrates how distance and closeness of meaning between meanings can be quantified within the semantic space. Distances are shown between the element “ski” and all other elements within the semantic space. Using three classes of bond strengths the degree of closeness between meanings may be discovered. A “strong relationship” exists between “ski” and “skiing” as does between “ski” and “athletic equipment.” Between “skiing” and “sport” there is a weaker than strong relationship known as a “medium relationship”. This is because when you think of the root term “skiing” one doesn't quickly think also of “sport”. Going from “ski” to “skiing” however, the average person would more likely associate or think “skiing” if given the term “ski”.
- FIG. 4 also shows semantic distances between elements. “Ski” and “skiing” have only a distance of 2 between them while “skiing” and “sport” have a distance of 5 (7 ⁇ 2). The distance between “ski” and “sport” is 7. When traveling from parent to child or vice-versa, the distances can be simply added/subtracted but when changing the direction of travel, a penalty may be imposed upon the distance calculation. Take for example the distance between “ski” and “athletic equipment company”. Judging merely on a linear basis, the distance might be 12.
