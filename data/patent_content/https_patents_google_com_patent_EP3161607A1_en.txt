- Implementations described herein facilitate storing of content items.
- a system facilitates upload of content items stored on local storage of a device (e.g., integrated or removable flash memory of a mobile device) to secondary storage (e.g., cloud storage, connected device storage, external local storage, locally networked storage), and selects content items to remove from local storage and/or add to local storage based on predetermined criteria. For example, with the user's consent but without user interaction or input, the system may automatically select content items for removal from the local storage of the mobile device
- the system may automatically select content items on local storage and secondary storage to add or remove from the local storage of the mobile device based on predetermined criteria.
- a system facilitates download of content items stored on local storage of a device (e.g., integrated flash memory of a mobile device) from secondary storage (e.g., cloud storage, connected device storage), and selects content items to add or retain on local storage based on predetermined criteria. For example, with the user's consent but without user interaction or input, the system may automatically select content items to add to the local storage of the mobile device (e.g., photos that the user would likely want to have on the local storage of the device).
- a device e.g., integrated flash memory of a mobile device
- secondary storage e.g., cloud storage, connected device storage
- a user of the mobile device can manually identify files to remove from local storage. For example, the user may manually review photos on the device and delete some of the photos stored on the device. As another example, the user may review applications installed on a device and identify applications or application data to remove.
- management of files on a mobile device can be complicated and time consuming for a user to identify files to keep on his or her mobile device. This is particularly true when the user has more files than can fit on the device. File management becomes even more complicated and time consuming when a user has multiple devices. Some implementations may be used as a complement to or instead of manual review and management by a user.
- a content item storage system receives content items, for example by a device downloading or creating content items. For example, the user may capture a series of photos at an event on their mobile device. The content items are stored in local storage on the device (e.g., the integrated flash memory that came with the device). The system then determines the available local storage capacity of the device (e.g., less than 1 GB available to store photos on local storage). The system facilitates upload (e.g., transfer of a copy) of content items from local storage to secondary storage.
- the secondary storage may be another data store in the device, or it may be another data store that is available to the mobile device, such as the storage on another mobile device, a personal computer, a home storage system, a network storage system, a cloud storage system, a photo sharing site, a social network site, etc.
- a user has ample local storage, and would like to have additional content items stored on the device, for example by the device downloading content items from secondary storage.
- the user may have captured photos and uploaded them to secondary storage from another device, such as another mobile device, or a personal computer.
- the system determines the available local storage capacity of the device (e.g., more than 2 GB available to store photos on local storage).
- the system facilitates download of content items from secondary storage to local storage.
- the secondary storage may be another data store in the device, or it may be another data store that is available to the mobile device, such as a personal computer, a home storage system, a network storage system, a cloud storage system, a photo sharing site, social network site, etc.
- the system may select content items to remove from or add to local storage based on
- the criteria may include a determination that the user is unlikely to want to access the content items from the local storage on the device (e.g., old photos that the user is unlikely to access when the device is offline). The system then removes the selected content items from local storage.
- the criteria may include a determination that the user is likely to want to access some of the content items on local storage on the device (e.g., old photos from an event that the user often refers to). The system may then add the selected content items to local storage.

- metadata associated with a content item that was or could be stored in local storage is stored in local storage even if the content item itself is not currently stored in local storage.
- the available local storage capacity of the local storage on the client device 110 is determined.
- the total capacity of local storage may be determined by an operating system for the client device 110.
- the total capacity of local storage may be determined from data that is stored on the local storage. For example, in a FAT-32 formatted data store, the capacity of the data store may be determined by accessing the File Allocation Table stored on the data store.
- the available capacity of a storage device also may be determined by the operating system and/or from data stored on the client device 110.
- an available local storage capacity may be determined based on the space available on the storage device that is currently unused and allocations and/or reservations made by the operating system and/or applications. For example, an operating system may reserve a portion of the available space for applications and for temporary storage. In this case, the available local storage capacity is the available storage space on a local storage device reduced by such reservation or allocation.
- an available local storage capacity may be determined based on an allocation for content items. For example, a configuration may indicate that a predetermined amount of storage is reserved for content items. For example, a configuration may indicate that 4GB are available for storage of content items. If content items currently take up 3GB, the available storage capacity in this example would be 1GB. In some implementations, the available local storage capacity for content items may be a specified percentage of total available storage on the device. For example, if total available storage capacity on the device is 2.2GB, and the specified percentage is 55%, the available storage capacity would be 1.21GB.
- content items from the client device 110 are uploaded to secondary storage.
- the content items may be uploaded by writing, copying, transferring, or otherwise communicating the content items to secondary storage.
- content items may be transmitted via email, file transfer protocol (ftp), hypertext transfer protocol (http, https), remote copy (rep), rsync, block-level copying (e.g., iSCSI, Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), ATA over Ethernet (AoE), etc.), using a service for file/document sharing, and/or another suitable transmission capability.
- the secondary storage may be any type of data store that is integral to or directly connected or available directly or indirectly to the client device 110 through wired or wireless communications networks, or some combination.
- the secondary storage is a flash drive, such as an SD or micro SD card, that is installed in the client device.
- the secondary storage is a flash drive that may be inserted and removed from the client device 110.
- the secondary storage is a USB stick or USB disk drive.
- the secondary storage is a network storage device that may communicate over a network using such protocols as Bluetooth, Ethernet, TCP/IP, Firewire, etc.
- the secondary storage is a cloud storage system that is available over the Internet.
- the secondary storage may be a media sharing site (e.g., photo and/or video sharing site).
- the secondary storage may be a social networking service.
- the secondary storage is presented by a storage replication service or backup service associated with an application on the client device 110. For example, files copied into a specific folder in local storage may be automatically replicated by a storage replication service.
- content items are uploaded to secondary storage by enabling a backup application and/or configuring the backup application to back up content items.
- the backup application may be an application for backup or may be integrated into another application, such as a social networking application, a photo and/or video sharing application, etc.
- the backup application may be or use a content backup service provided by the operating system of the client device.
- permission is requested from the user to enable a backup application that is already available on the client device 110 as part of the device operating system or as a separate application or a part of the functionality provided by an application.
- a user may be asked to download and install an application that is used to upload content items.
- the system automatically uploads the desired content items without any user interaction or input (e.g., an auto-upload feature enabled with user consent).
- the upload takes place based on a determination about available local storage capacity. In some implementations, the upload takes place periodically. In some implementations, upload takes place based on a predetermined schedule, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc. In some implementations, upload takes place based on a predetermined schedule and based on availability of the secondary storage to the client device 110. For example, secondary storage may be available only when the device is connected to a network. In some implementations, if a specified time period has passed and the secondary storage is available to the client device 110, the client device will upload content items. In some implementations, the upload takes place upon a triggering event, such as a storage space error.
- a triggering event such as a storage space error.
- the client device 110 will upload all content items that are stored on the client device 110. For example, the entire local storage of the client device may be uploaded, so as to provide a complete backup. In some implementations, only content items that are selected to be removed from local storage are uploaded. In some implementations, only certain types of content items are uploaded. For example, only photos and videos may be uploaded, and not audio tracks or social network messages. In some implementations, only some of the content items may be uploaded at a particular time. For example, a time criteria may be used to determine which content items to upload, such that more recent content items are uploaded first, or older content items are uploaded first. In some implementations, uploads may be limited by bandwidth constraints or time constraints, such that a limited number or amount of content items are uploaded at the time of each upload.
- information about some content items may be uploaded instead of the content items.
- information about some content items e.g., metadata
- a copy of an application is available in a marketplace, it may be sufficient to upload data describing the application in order to recover the application from the marketplace if necessary.
- a photo is already available on secondary storage or on another server (e.g., a social networking server), it may be sufficient to upload an identifier for the photo on the social networking server instead of the photo itself.
- content items are selected for removal from local storage based on predetermined criteria when the available local storage capacity of the client device meets a threshold available local storage capacity.
- content items are selected so as to keep the content items on the device that the user is likely to want on the device, and to select for removal content items that the user is not as likely to want to have on the device when the client device 110 is, for example, disconnected from the network 150. This is important for efficient network communication and also so that the user has desired content even if the user is offline, for example because network access is expensive, intermittent, or unavailable.
- the system selects content items using the predetermined criteria to, for example, retain on the device the content items the user will likely want to access offline, and remove content items the user is not as likely to want to access offline.
- the predetermined criteria includes whether the content items have been successfully uploaded to secondary storage. For example, if content items have been uploaded to secondary storage, they may be removed from local storage. In various implementations, this criteria may be determined in any suitable fashion. For example, information about where content items are stored may be included in metadata. For example, if the client device 110 has direct or indirect access to secondary storage, the client device may determine whether content items have been successfully uploaded. As another example, if a backup service is used for upload, it may be possible to query the backup service to determine whether particular content items have been successfully uploaded to secondary storage. As another example, a content replication service may be queried to provide an indication about whether content items have been replicated. For some content items, the associated applications may upload all content items to their associated servers and so once upload is complete, all content items have been uploaded.
- a social network application may store all data on its associated networked servers and leave only a subset of that data available on a client device 110. Some such applications may allow a client device to mark content items for removal from the client device 110, but those content items remain available for retrieval by a user on the client device 110 or by other access to the networked servers.
- a reduced size version of an uploaded content item e.g., a lower- resolution photo or video or a compressed file
- the reduced size version of the content item may be displayed to the user in a manner that identifies that it is a reduced sized version (e.g., size, color, highlighting, other indicators, etc.).
- a reduced-size version may have a visual indicator such as a graphic symbol that indicates that it is a reduced size version.
- a reduced-size version may have a rectangle that is used as a progress bar, and filled in to show the progress made in downloading a full sized version.
- the predetermined criteria include temporal data associated with the capture of the content items.
- the temporal data may include a date/time that the content items were created.
- this may include metadata in a file (e.g., EXIF data in a photo) or file system data recorded when a file is stored or modified.
- the predetermined criteria includes a date/time that the content item was first stored, last accessed or last modified on the client device or on other devices meeting a threshold. For example, all content items first stored prior to a threshold date/time may be selected.
- the threshold date/time may be a date/time in the past that is 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, etc. in the past. For example, content items that were last viewed more than 1 month prior may be selected.
- the predetermined criteria include the frequency of access of the content items. For example, a series of photos of a given user's newborn baby that the user views frequently on their device may have a high frequency of access.
- the frequency of access may be recorded by an application associated with the content items.
- the frequency of access may be recorded by a storage manager.
- the frequency of access may be recorded for one or more of multiple client devices accessed by a user. For example, if a given user accesses certain content items frequently on her phone, the user may want to access the same content items on her tablet. In this case the frequency of access takes into account frequency of access on multiple devices.
- content items viewed less than a number of times during the past month may be selected.
- content items viewed less than a number of times during the past month may be selected. In each example, the number of times may be, for example, 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times, 5 times, 10 times, etc.
- the predetermined criteria include the method of access of the content items. For example, if a user viewed photos on a particular device (e.g., a specific phone, tablet, personal computer, television, projector, or watch) may be associated with a desire to keep the content items. For example, if a user views certain content items on their watch, the user may want access to those content items at a later time. For example, all content items viewed on the user's watch may be selected. For example, content items viewed on a television may be selected if additional predetermined criteria are met.
- a particular device e.g., a specific phone, tablet, personal computer, television, projector, or watch
- the user may want access to those content items at a later time. For example, all content items viewed on the user's watch may be selected.
- content items viewed on a television may be selected if additional predetermined criteria are met.
- the predetermined criteria include the location of access of the content items. For example, if a user views certain content items which located in a particular location, such as at home, at work, in a studio, in a local neighborhood, or when traveling to a new location, the user may want access to those content items at a later time. The user may be required to enable permission for use of location information in this manner. The user may be asked to explicitly provide information identifying locations (e.g., home, work, studio, neighborhood, etc.).
- the predetermined criteria include the likelihood of access of the content items. This may be determined in any suitable manner.
- the likelihood of access is based on past access patterns by a user.
- the likelihood of access is based on access patterns by a user and/or by other users with social affinity to the user. For example, if other users with a high social affinity to a given user (e.g., the user's spouse) have accessed particular content items, the user may be more likely to access the same content items.
- the predetermined criteria include multiple stages, levels, or combinations. For example, a first predetermined criteria may be used. If the content items selected using the first criteria are not sufficient to achieve the desired local storage capacity level, second predetermined criteria may be used. If the content items selected using the second predetermined criteria are not sufficient to achieve the desired level of local storage capacity, a third criteria may be used, etc.
- content items are scored, and the score is used to rank content items, such that the content items with the highest scores are selected to be retained (or selected to be added to local storage). Content items with lower scores are replaced by placeholder copies. Content items with the lowest scores are selected for removal.
- the predetermined criteria include threshold criteria for
- the criteria for ranking content items are used to prioritize which content items should be removed to achieve a desired level of local storage capacity.
- the criteria may include the threshold requirement that content items be uploaded to secondary storage, and that content items be excluded from selection if they were accessed in a predetermined time period (e.g., the past week, the past month, within a number days from the current day, etc.). Rather than select all content items that meet this criteria, the predetermined criteria also may use the ranking criteria of last access time.
- the ranking criteria may be used to select and remove the least recently accessed content items until the desired available local storage capacity level is reached.
- the predetermined criteria is based at least in part on social affinity. For example, photos shared by someone with a strong social affinity to the user, such as the user's spouse, sibling, or close friend may have a high social affinity.
- social affinity is determined by at least one criterion selected from the group of a poster of a content item, a recipient of a content item, tags added to a content item, a response to a content item, check-in data associated with a content item, geographic and/or location data associated with a content item, event data associated with a content item, image recognition results, and similarity of content items to other content items.
- the predetermined criteria include events coincident with the content items. For example, if content items are associated with an event, information about the event may be used as a criteria for including/excluding those content items from selection. For example, content items related to an event that occurred some time ago may no longer be relevant to a user.
- the predetermined criteria include the importance of the content items to the user.
- the importance of the content items is based on the strength of the relationship between a user of the device and one or more persons associated with the content items. The one or more persons are referred to as a target user.
- the association between a particular content item and a target user is stored in a social network database, for example secondary storage 106 or another data store or database, so that the client device 110 may identify which content items are associated with a target user by querying secondary storage 106.
- a social network database for example secondary storage 106 or another data store or database
- the client device 110 may use predetermined criteria to associate content items with the target user. Any suitable criteria may be used.
- the criteria may be specified by the user. For example, the user may specify as the criteria that content that is posted, received and/or shared with one or more designated people or groups should not be removed.
- the criteria may be predetermined by an administrator of the client device 110.
- the predetermined criteria include social affinity.
- the predetermined criteria include filtering.
- the predetermined criteria include filtering types of content items (e.g., photos, videos, posts, etc.).
- the predetermined criteria include filtering more recent content items (e.g., items posted or viewed after a certain date/time) so that only older content items, for example, are selected to meet the criteria.
- one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos include an image of a given target user. For example, photos that include a given target user (e.g., spouse of a user, other family member of a user, or close friend of a user) may not be selected for removal.
- the client device 110 may utilize a recognition technique to determine if a given target user is in a given photo.
- the client device may use one or a variety of suitable recognition techniques to recognize faces, landmarks, objects, etc. in photos. Such recognition techniques may be integral to the client device 110 or available through communication with a server system 102.
- the techniques may be implemented in software of the client device 110 (e.g., the operating system or applications), built into hardware of the client device, provided by the server system 102, or some combination.
- the client device 110 may access recognition techniques provided by software and/or hardware that is external to the client device 110 and that the client device 110 accesses.
- text analysis may be applied to determine the subject of content items that include or are associated with text.
- Metadata may include information about the subject or features of content items.
- the metadata may include results of recognition techniques, text analysis, and tags associated with content items.
- the predetermined criteria may include the extent that photos include individuals having a degree of social affinity with a target user.
- one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos include an image of a given target user and/or that the target user is tagged in one or more photos.
- a tag may be used to determine that a photo includes an image of a target user.
- one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos were captured during an event that the target user attended.
- an event may be any meeting or gathering of people in a geographic location. Such events may include conventions, parties, celebrations, meals, classes, meetings, ceremonies, conferences, etc.
- an event may include virtual events (e.g., web conference, conference calls, etc.)
- the system may determine that the target user has attended a particular event from a list of event participants. The target user may be added to a list of event participants after having registered, SVPed, or purchased tickets for an event, etc.
- the importance of events may be determined. For example, events associated with more social activity and/or more content items may be more important. For example, events attended by other users who have high social affinity may be considered important. For example, content items associated with events that were attended by individuals with lower social affinity with the user may be selected for removal.
- one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos are attached to a post of a social networking, photo sharing or messaging application, and that a target user is associated with the post.
- the target user may be associated with the post by being a recipient of the post and/or being mentioned in the post.
- the target user may be associated with the post by being in one or more photos attached to the post.
- the system may utilize a recognition technique to determine if the target user is in one or more of the photos and/or through tags associated with a photo.
- one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos are attached to a post and the target user is included in one or more of the attached photos.
- one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that posts are made from geographic location(s) frequented by the target user.

- one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos are directly shared with the target user.
- one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more content items are shared by one or more other users who have a social affinity that meets a predetermined social affinity threshold.
- social affinity may be based on a number or frequency of information exchange between the target user and the one or more other users.
- social affinity may be based on a relationship between users, such as included in a contact or group, friend-of-a- friend relationship, in a contact or group of an individual in a contact or group, etc.
- social affinity may be based on a location of users.
- Social affinity may be based on users have shared interests.
- social affinity may be based on one, two, or a combination of some or all of these and other criteria.
- one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that a photo album containing one or more photos is manually associated with a photo library of the target user.
- the predetermined criteria include content items made available to one or more groups.
- the predetermined criteria include content items made available to one or more groups within a specified time range. For example, content items may be shared with members of a group, and a social network application may determine which content items have been shared with a group or groups that the target user belongs to.
- the predetermined criteria include content items made available to one or more groups in the time since the last time that content items were selected for this target user.
- a target user may request that content items be selected at a time frequency (e.g., once a week, once a month, a number of days, etc.) and the system 102 may determine which content items have been shared with a group or groups that the target user belongs to and were received by the system since the last time content items were selected.
- the predetermined criteria includes at least one criterion including but not limited to a poster of content items, a recipient of content items, tags added to content items, responses to content items, check-in data associated with content items, geographic and/or location data associated with content items, event data associated with content items, image recognition results, and similarity of content items to other content items.

- the target user may have responded to a content item, or expressed approval or interest in a content item.
- the target user may have clicked on a link associated with a content item, such as to request more information about a content item.
- a scoring technique may be used to calculate a social affinity score based on information associated with users and content items. For example, a higher social affinity score may be indicative of a closer and/or more direct relationship between a target user and a target user and/or between a target user and a content item.
- a social affinity score may be indicative of the degree of connection between a target user and another user and/or a target user and a content item.
- a social affinity score may be calculated based on a direct relationship, an indirect relationship, and/or a combination of one or more direct and/or indirect relationships between a target user and a content item.
- a more direct relationship would result in a higher social affinity score than an indirect relationship, and the more indirect the relationship, the lower the score.
- a one-way relationship for example, in which one user shares with the other, but not vice-versa, would result in a lower social affinity score than a bi-directional relationship.
- a social affinity score may be determined at least in part by a relationship between a target user and a content item. In various implementations, a social affinity score may be determined at least in part by a relationship between a target user and another user, where the other user has a relationship to one or more content items. In some implementations, a social affinity score may be determined at least in part by a relationship between content items and other content items.
- implementations include but are not limited to: content items received from a user, content items directed to or sent to a user, content items received from a location where the user was or is located, content items that are or include tags added to content items that reference the user, content items that are responses to content items made by a user, content items that are check-in data submitted by a user, content items that are received about a subject or location in which the user expressed interest, content items received about a subject or location in which the user had submitted similar content items, etc.
- social affinity between a target user and content item may be determined based at least in part on whether the target user submits a content item.
- social affinity between a target user and content item may be determined based at least in part on whether the target user is a subject of a content item.
- social affinity between a target user and a content item may include social affinity between the target user and another user, where the other user has a relationship with a content item.
- social affinity between a user and another user include but are not limited to: members of the same group, sharing of content items between the target user and another user, the target user and another user designated as friends, the target user and another user have friends in common, the target user and another user have friends who are friends, the target user and another user have group members who are in the same group, the target user is designated as a follower of another user or vice -versa, etc.
- a social affinity relationship between a target user and a content item is determined based at least in part on whether the content item is posted by a member of a group that the target user belongs to.
- social affinity between a target user and content items may include social affinity between content items and other content items.
- Illustrative examples of social affinity between content items and other content items include but are not limited to: tags added to content items, responses to content items, check-in data associated with content items, geographic and/or location data associated with content items, event data associated with content items, image recognition results, content items shared with the same group, content items with similar associated text or other features, etc.
- social affinity between a content item and another content item may be determined when a content item is similar to a content item posted by the target user.
- the system runs a query or queries on all or a subset of content items in local storage to determine which content items are to be associated with a target user.
- a social affinity score is determined for the target user and each of a plurality of content items.
- the predetermined criteria includes a social affinity score threshold.
- the system may present the user with a user interface that allows the user to specify one or more predetermined criteria. For example, the user may be able to select that oldest items should be removed first, except that items associated with specific users and events should not be removed or should be added. For example, a user may specify a time range (e.g., content items newer than 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, etc. should be kept) and a list of specific users such that content items that are older but are associated with the users on the list should be kept.
- a time range e.g., content items newer than 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, etc. should be kept
- the system may select additional content items to include or exclude in the selection for removal based on content items already included or excluded.
- the subject matter of selected or excluded content items is determined, and additional content items related to the determined subject matter of the included or excluded content items are also selected or excluded. For example, if content items selected for removal are about trees, additional content items about trees may be selected for removal as well. Such additional content items may include photos, drawings, text, or posts containing or about leaves, trees, fruit, forests, etc. As another example, if content items excluded for selection for removal (that is, selected to keep) are about cats, additional content items about cats may be excluded.
- Such additional content items may include photos, drawings, text, or posts, containing or about cats, cat food, cat food bowls, etc.
- additional content items about the event may be selected.
- Such additional content items may include photos, drawings, text, or posts, containing or about the location of the event, the activities taking place at the event, other participants in the event, posts or other messages sent from the event (e.g., popular messages), etc.
- the subject matter of content items may be determined from captions or text accompanying an image, system applied tags, use tags, or through image or object recognition.
- the subject matter of content items included in a composition may be matched with other content items available to the user on the server system 102, or with stock content items that have tags or that have been recognized.
- selected content items are removed from local storage.
- the content items are automatically removed with user consent or without any user interaction or input.
- user confirmation may be requested prior to deleting content items.
- permission may be requested the first time content items are deleted.
- the content items may be removed in any suitable manner.
- selected content items may be deleted from a file system.
- selected content items may be marked for deletion by an application that manages the content items. For example, social network content items may be marked for deletion from local storage by a social network application. As another example, photos may be marked for deletion from local storage by a photo sharing application.
- the client device may take the additional step of excluding from selection content items that were previously excluded. For example, if a user previously indicated that certain content items (e.g., specific photos) should be excluded from selection (e.g., not deleted), the system 160 may exclude these content items in the future.
- the system 160 may store user preferences so that a user is not asked about the same content items at a later times. For example, in some implementations a user may tag content items as favorites or assign a star indicator or color indicator to them, and such content items will then be excluded from selection and remain on the local storage of the device.
- a placeholder copy of a content item is created and stored on the device instead of removing the content item.
- This placeholder copy has the benefit of allowing the user to retain portions of the original content items or an identifier and/or other information about the original content item, which can be used as a placeholder if the secondary storage is not available.
- a placeholder content item may have a smaller size in local storage than the original content item.
- a smaller sized version may be created in any suitable manner, for example by changing characteristics of the content item, deleting portions of the content item, applying compression techniques, etc.
- placeholder content items include smaller-sized replacement content items that are created for content items that are similar to other content items by storing the differences between content items. For example, if a number of photos are similar to a first photo, the differences between them may be stored instead of the entire original content items.
- the system 160 may take into account, for example, the characteristics of the client device 110. For example, for images, the system 160 may take into account the display resolution of the client device 110. If a photo has a higher resolution than may be viewed on the device, the system 160 may reduce the photo resolution to match the actual resolution of the client device 160. The user may not initially notice a difference between the placeholder and the original if the resolution is matched to the actual resolution of the client device 160.
- a placeholder version may be created for the photo with a reduced resolution of 1920x1200 pixels, which resolution for the placeholder version matches the device screen display.
- the placeholder version is viewed by the user on the device display, the user initially would not be able to tell the difference between the original and the placeholder. If the user tried to zoom in, the resolution reduction then may become apparent.
- the original content item may be downloaded and replace the placeholder content item.
- the replacement of original for placeholder may be made without specific user direction. For example, the user may choose to look at a photo that has been replaced with a lower resolution placeholder image, the user starts by looking at the placeholder, the system determines the user is viewing the placeholder image, the original image is downloaded and the placeholder image is replaced with the original.
- the user decides to interact with the image for example to zoom in
- the download of the original is complete and the user is then viewing and may interact with the original image. This process may happen so quickly that the user may not notice that the image they chose to interact with was originally a lower resolution placeholder image and then transitioned to the download of the original image.
- a low resolution video may replace a high resolution video, or a video may be replaced with a smaller file size version of the video with a slower frame -rate, encoded with a different (e.g., lossy or with different loss characteristics) encoding scheme, etc., or with just an initial portion of the video. For example, for a 5-minute video, only the first 30 seconds of the video may be retained in local storage, encoded so as to minimize storage space. If the user chooses to play the video, the placeholder can be played unless/until the original video is available to be provided to the user from the secondary storage, the server 160, or copied back to the user's device and used to replace the placeholder content item.
- the placeholder content item does not have the same appearance as the original content item.
- the system may display a thumbnail image that has a much smaller resolution than the original.
- the thumbnail image may be sufficient for the user to identify the context of the original image but not the details. If the user wants to see the image, the user may select it and the system may provide the original image from secondary storage (if connected). Videos may be replaced with a still image, or a much smaller resolution image with or without audio.
- the placeholder By clicking on the placeholder, the user signals interest in the content item, and a higher resolution or larger size image of the same content item may be downloaded from secondary storage and made available to the user if the user's client device 110 is in communication with the secondary storage.
- context may be used to determine which content items to select to retain on the client device. For example, if a user has a number of related content items, such as content items associated with a particular date/time or event, or person, a first number of content items associated with that date/time or event may be retained on the client device 110. If the user requests the retained content items, the system 160 copies back to the client device 110 from secondary storage the other content items related to that context.
- one or more steps of determining 206, uploading 208, and selecting 210 are performed periodically. In some implementations, one or more steps of determining 206, uploading 208, and selecting 210 are performed when a preconfigured amount of content items has been received. In some implementations, one or more steps of determining 206, uploading 208, and selecting 210 are performed upon a triggering event such as an operating system or application notification related to storage availability, and/or a request by a user. In some implementations, storage management and the steps 204-212 may be initiated by a determination of storage availability such as described below with reference to FIG. 7.
- a triggering event for one or more of the steps 204-212 may be the passage of a predetermined time interval, such that one or more of steps 204-212 are performed periodically.
- the triggering event may be determined by timer logic.
- the time interval may be a whole or fractional number of hours, days, weeks, months, or years.
- a triggering event occurs once every month, such that the client device may perform the steps 204-212 for a target user at least once a month, and every month the local storage of the target user is maintained.
- the client device may perform the steps 204-212 once an hour, once every two hours, once every four hours, once a day, once every two days, once every three days, once every four days, once a week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once a month, once every two months, etc.
- steps 208-212 are performed when available local storage capacity is determined in step 206 to meet a threshold (e.g., is below a predetermined threshold level).
- a threshold e.g., is below a predetermined threshold level.
- the determination of local storage capacity 206 is performed periodically, and the uploading 208 is performed on an ongoing basis.
- content items may be uploaded 208 if not already uploaded and selected 210 for removal based on the predetermined criteria. Removal o f content items 212 may be performed immediately after the content items are selected or sometime later.
- a triggering event may be receipt of a threshold amount of content items.
- the steps may be integrated into a camera application, such that when new photos are taken, a determination of available local storage capacity is undertaken.

For example, files copied into a specific folder in local storage may be automatically replicated by a storage replication service. Copying to secondary storage assures that copies of the content items are available on the secondary storage.
- Uploading content items to secondary storage may also include uploading metadata associated with uploaded content items. Metadata may be communicated as part of the uploading process, or may be communicated separately, by communication of a document or records of metadata associated with content items. For example, metadata may be communicated as part of a communication protocol when copying content items.
- receiving content items 302 and storing content items on local storage 304 may take place on an ongoing basis, as content items are received or generated.
- Uploading local content items to secondary storage 306 may take place periodically, upon receipt of content items, upon receipt of a threshold number of content items, upon receipt of a threshold size of content items, and/or some combination, or in any other suitable manner.

- the synchronization may also allow secondary storage to have metadata associated with any content items not already uploaded to secondary storage.
- the metadata may include metadata associated with content items that have been uploaded to secondary storage by the client device, and content items that have been uploaded by other devices to secondary storage.
- the metadata may include the time/date or location that a content item was created or captured (e.g., EXIF data in a photo), file system data recorded when a file is stored or modified, a date/time that the content item was first stored, last accessed or last modified on the client device or on other devices, the date/time that a content item was received, data about the users and/or the client devices from which content items were received, such as the name of the user and geographic and/or location data about the users or the client devices, tags or other information about the subjects or locations of the content items, and any other suitable metadata that may be used for the purposes of identifying content items and determining whether to store content items on local storage.

- metadata is recorded indicating that the image was deleted.
- those devices can then delete the content item as well. In that way, the deletion is communicated to all client devices that synchronize metadata with secondary storage.
- a method for deleting a content item may include deleting a first content item from a first device.
- the method may include storing a specification of the deletion of the first content item in metadata associated with the first content item.
- the method may include synchronizing metadata associated with the first content item between the first device and secondary storage, wherein the metadata associated with a first content item includes specification of deletion of the first content item.
- the method may include synchronizing the metadata associated with the first content item between a second device and secondary storage, wherein the metadata associated with a first content item includes the specification of deletion of the first content item.
- the method may include deleting the content item from the second device in response to the specification of deletion.
- a system for deleting a content item may include one or more processors and logic encoded in one or more tangible media for execution by the one or more processors and when executed operable to perform operations.
- the operations may include storing a specification of the deletion of the first content item in metadata associated with the first content item.
- the operations may include synchronizing metadata associated with the first content item between the first device and secondary storage, wherein the metadata associated with a first content item includes specification of deletion of the first content item.
- the operations may include synchronizing the metadata associated with the first content item between a second device and secondary storage, wherein the metadata associated with a first content item includes the specification of deletion of the first content item.
- the operations may include deleting the content item from the second device in response to the specification of deletion.
- the system determines the available local storage capacity of the local storage.
- the total capacity of local storage may be determined by an operating system for a given client device 110.
- the total capacity of local storage may be determined from data that is stored on the local storage. For example, in a FAT-32 formatted data store, the capacity of the data store may be determined by accessing the File Allocation Table stored on the data store.
- the available capacity of a storage device also may be determined by the operating system and/or from data stored on the client device 110.
- the available local storage capacity may be determined based on the space available on the storage device that is currently unused and allocations and/or reservations made by the operating system and/or applications. For example, an operating system may reserve a portion of the available space for applications and for temporary storage. In this case, the available local storage capacity is the available storage space on a local storage device reduced by such reservation or allocation.
- the available local storage capacity may be determined based on an allocation for content items. For example, a configuration may indicate that a predetermined amount of storage is reserved for content items. For example, a configuration may indicate that 4GB are available for storage of content items. In this example, if content items currently take up 3GB, the available storage capacity in this example would be would be 1GB.
- the system selects content items to add to or remove from local storage based on predetermined criteria and available local storage capacity.
- the predetermined criteria is the creation date. Recently created or added items are selected to be added to local storage, and earlier content items are selected to be removed.
- each content item is scored based on the predetermined criteria.
- Content items are selected to be included in local storage based on the score, with the highest scoring content items included up to a threshold available storage capacity.
- Content items with a lower score are selected to be replaced by a placeholder or removed from local storage.
- Content items may be selected to be added or retained in local storage in the form of a placeholder copy.
- a portion of the available storage space may be allocated to full-size copies of content items, and a portion of the available storage may be allocated to placeholder copies of content items.
- placeholder copies of content items may be generated.
- a placeholder copy is a copy of a content item that may be stored in the local storage as a substitute for the content item. In some implementations, the placeholder copy has a smaller size than the actual content item.
- a placeholder copy may be intended to be a temporary substitute, used only until the original content items is retrieved from secondary storage.
- a placeholder copy may be intended to be a substitute that is sufficient for most purposes or uses of the content item.
- a placeholder copy of a content item is created and stored on the device instead of removing the content item.
- This placeholder copy of a content item has the benefit of allowing the user to retain portions of the original content items or an identifier for the original content item if the secondary storage is not available.
- a placeholder copy may have a smaller size in local storage than the original content item.
- a smaller sized version may be created in any suitable manner, for example by changing characteristics of the content item, deleting portions of the content item, applying compression techniques, etc.
- a low-resolution placeholder image may be used to replace a high resolution image, a lower- resolution video can replace a high definition video, a content item containing text can be compressed with a suitable compression technique, etc.
- placeholder content items include smaller-sized replacement content items that are created for content items that are similar to other content items by storing the differences between content items. For example, if a number of photos are similar to a first photo, the differences between them may be stored instead of the entire original content items.
- the system 160 may take into account, for example, the characteristics of the client device 110. For example, for images, the system 160 may take into account the display resolution of the client device 110. If a photo has a higher resolution than can be viewed on the device, the system 160 may reduce the photo resolution to match the actual resolution of the client device 160. The user may not initially notice a difference between the placeholder and the original if the resolution is matched to the actual resolution of the client device 160.
- the placeholder content item does not have the same appearance as the original content item.
- the system may display a thumbnail image that has a much smaller resolution than the original.
- the thumbnail image may be sufficient for the user to identify the context of the original image but not the details. If the user wants to see the image, the user may select it and the system may provide the original image from secondary storage. Videos may be replaced with a still image, or a much smaller resolution image with or without audio.
- the user signals interest in the content item, and a higher resolution or larger size image of the same content item may be downloaded from secondary storage and made available to the user if the user's client device 110 is in communication with the secondary storage.
- a placeholder copy may include a location in secondary storage of an associated content item that will allow a copy of the actual content item to be retrieved from secondary storage.
- a location (e.g., in secondary storage) of a content item may be retained in metadata.
- a placeholder copy may be generated for a content item that is located in secondary storage, such that the placeholder copy may be selected to be added to local storage. In this way, local storage will have a placeholder copy of the content item.
- content items selected to be added to local storage are copied from secondary storage, and content items selected to be removed from local storage are removed.
- content items that are removed may be replaced by a placeholder copy.
- a placeholder copy may be added to local storage rather than a full size content item.
- Metadata for content items that are removed may be retained in local storage on the client device, so that the user may be made aware of the removed content items and easily retrieve them when the client device is in communication with secondary storage.
- the removal may be transparent to the user, such that the user is not aware of which content items are stored in local storage and which are only in secondary storage.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example flow diagram for scoring content items, according to some implementations.
- content items may be selected to be removed from local storage or added to local storage based on predetermined criteria and local storage capacity.
- each content item is scored based on the predetermined criteria, and the highest-scoring content items are selected for storage in local storage. Scoring may include evaluating a small or large number of criteria, such as 1 predetermined criteria, 2 predetermined criteria, 4 predetermined criteria, 10 predetermined criteria, etc.
- a scoring system 400 is used to assign a score to each content item.
- the scoring system 400 may be implemented in software or in hardware.
- the scoring system 400 may be used to evaluate each content item for each of a number of predetermined criteria.
- Each predetermined criteria is weighted (e.g., multiplied by a weight), and the weighted predetermined criteria are summed, with a resulting score.
- a first criteria Criteria A 402 is weighted with Weight 1 404.
- a second criteria, Criteria B 406 is weighted with Weight 2 408.
- a third criteria, Criteria C 410 is weighted with Weight 3 412.
- the last criteria, Criteria n 414 is weighted with Weight n 416.
- each of the Criteria may include one or more of a user's behavior, social affinity, detection of events, image, video, or text content, similarity to other content items, metadata, dates and times, and such other criteria that may be suitable.
- the predetermined criteria may include temporal data associated with the capture of the content items. In some implementations, the predetermined criteria may include the frequency of access of the content items. In some implementations, the predetermined criteria include the likelihood of access of the content items. In some implementations, the predetermined criteria include the importance of the content items. In some implementations, the importance of the content items may be based on the strength of the relationship between a user of the device and one or more persons associated with the content items.
- Criteria A 402 is a number of days since the content item was created. The number of days is subtracted from 100, and numbers less than zero are treated as zero. Criteria A 402 is highly weighted, such that Weight 1 (404) is set to 0.5.
- Criteria B 406 is frequency of access. Criteria B 406 is set to the number of accesses by the user of this content item in the past 3 months, multiplied by 10, and capped at 100. Criteria B 406 also has a relatively high weight, such that Weight 2 (408) is set to 0.4.
- Criteria C 410 is the number of accesses by other people with a high social affinity with the user.
- Criteria C 410 has a lower weight, and so Weight 3 (412) is set to 0.15.
- Criteria n 414 is whether the content of the content item includes someone or something that might be important to the user.
- the number of entities (persons, places, objects, etc.) in the content item having a social affinity score of greater than 0.5 are totaled, and capped at 100.
- This Criteria n has an even lower weight, and so Weight n 416 is set to 0.1.
- the score is calculated for each content item, and then the content items with the highest score are selected to be retained in or added to local storage until 2 GB of data will be stored. Another 0.3 GB is allocated for placeholders, and so placeholders are created for the next highest scoring content items until 0.3 GB of placeholders has been generated. Finally, all other content items are selected for removal, but their metadata is retained.
- the predetermined criteria may be selected based on characteristics of a user.
- the criteria may be selected based on the user's profile, which may include demographic information and/or other information that the user has provided. For example, a user who indicated that he is of an age to have children, and/or who has indicated that he has children, may want to keep content items related to his children on his device.
- a criteria of content items relating to his family members generally or to his children in particular may be important and weighted more heavily.
- a user that has indicated that her hobby is "travel" may be interested in keeping content items related to her trips.
- a criteria of content items relating to a trip (e.g., whether content items are associated with a different location and/or whether the content of content items are indicative of a trip) may be important and weighted more heavily.
- the predetermined criteria may be selected based on characteristics of a user's past behavior. Characteristics of a user's behavior may be determined from patterns in the user's past access of content items. For example, if a characteristic of a user's behavior is that the user tends to access content items associated with a trip, then this is an indication that the user may want to keep content items associated with a trip. A criteria of whether content items are associated with trip (e.g., whether content items are associated with a different location and/or whether the content of content items are indicative of a trip) may be important for that user, and may be weighed more heavily for that user.
- a characteristic of a user's behavior is that a user tends to access content items related to a particular subject matter (e.g., landscape photos) or people (e.g., family, friends)
- the user may want to keep content items associated with that subject matter.
- a criteria of whether content items are associated with that particular subject matter or specific people, or people with a high social affinity with the user, may be important for that user, and may be weighed more heavily.
- the characteristics of a user's past behavior may be used to weigh some criteria more heavily than others to keep what is important to that user.
- client devices may observe the behavior of a user with respect to access of content items. For example, access of a content item by a user may be recorded as metadata associated with the content item. Correlation of access metadata with other metadata related to the content item may be used to develop a user model. The user model may then be used to select criteria to use for that particular user. Thus, the user model of a user's behavior may be used to determine what content items to keep on a user's device for that user.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example user interface of a device showing the contents of local storage.
- the local storage 502 includes 1.3GB of Apps (504), 1.2GB of Pictures (506), 0.7GB of video (508), 0.5 GB of audio (510), 0.1GB of downloads (512), and 0.1GB of uncategorized data (514).
- the total local storage is shown to be 4.0GB, with 0.1GB storage available.
- the amounts shown for each category may be measured in a variety of ways, and may include allocations or reservations of data. Also, in this example, the amount of storage shown in the "Apps" category 504 includes both application programs and data associated with specific application programs that is not otherwise classified in the other categories.
- storage management including a content item backup service is enabled, with the user's permission, and as a result the step of uploading content items to secondary storage 208 is performed regularly or periodically (e.g., a number of times per hour, day, week, or month) when the device is connected to a network.
- the predetermined criteria designate for removal all data that has not been viewed in over 6 months, and data that is not directly related to the owner of the device based on a social affinity score that meets a threshold.
- the selection step 210 and the removal step 212 are performed with the predetermined criteria, the result is shown in a second example user interface 530 shown to the right of the user interface 510.
- the user interface 530 may be a screen display that results of the operation of the techniques of FIG. 2 or FIG. 3.
- the local storage 532 includes 0.5GB of Apps (534), 0.5 GB of Pictures (536), 0.3GB of video (538), 0.5 GB of audio (540), 0.0GB of downloads (542), and 0.1GB of uncategorized data (544).
- the total local storage is shown to be 4.0GB, with 2.1GB storage available.
- all of the data that was removed from local storage is still available to the user on a cloud server due to the backup service, and may be downloaded again for use on the device if so desired.
- additional content items copied from secondary storage may be included in the local storage 532. Even with the additional items downloaded from secondary storage the amount of available local storage may still be greater due to the content items that are removed from local storage.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a block diagram of a system for storing content items, according to some implementations.
- an example mobile device 600 includes one or more processors and logic instructions encoded in one or more non-transitory tangible media for execution by the one or more processors. When executed, the logic instructions are operable to implement one or more of the modules 602-614 shown in block diagram form in the mobile device 600.
- the mobile device 600 includes an operating system 602 and media applications, shown as social media application 606, photo sharing application 608, and camera application 610.
- the mobile device includes a storage manager 612.
- the mobile device also includes a backup manager 616.
- the media applications 606, 608, 610 receive content items.
- social media application 606 is a social media application that includes posting, chat and messaging capability; photo sharing application 608 enables sharing of photos; and camera application 610 allows a user to take videos and photos.
- the videos and photos taken with the camera application 610 may be shared using the social media application 606 and the photo sharing application 608.
- the storage manager 612 and/or the backup manager 614 may be a part of the operating system 602. In some
- the storage manager 612 and/or the backup manager 614 may be a part of the social media application 606, photo sharing application 608, or camera application 610.
- the media applications 606, 608, 610 and the storage manager 612 and backup manager 614 are in communication with local storage 616.
- Local storage 616 is shown as included in the mobile device 600, but the local storage 616 may be external to the mobile device, or temporarily connected to the mobile device (e.g., a flash drive or usb drive).
- the social media application 606 store messages, photos, and videos received from and shared with other social media users on local storage 616.
- the photo sharing application 608 stores photos received from and shared with other users of the photo sharing application 608 on the local storage 616.
- the camera application 610 stores photos and videos created with the mobile device's camera on the local storage 616.
- the social media application 606 is also in communication with social media secondary storage 618. This communication may be over a network.
- the social media secondary storage is a social media server that holds copies of all of a user's social media information. Items that are sent to other users are uploaded to secondary storage 618, and content items that are sent to the social media application 606 from a social media server also uploaded to social media secondary storage 618. Thus, social content items are uploaded to secondary storage 618 in an ongoing manner.
- the photo sharing application 608 is in communication with the photo sharing secondary storage 620.
- the photo sharing secondary storage 620 is a photo sharing server that holds copies of all photos that were shared by and with a user.
- Content items that are sent to other users are uploaded to secondary storage 620, and content items that are sent to the photo sharing application 608 from a photo sharing server are also uploaded to photo sharing secondary storage 620.
- photo sharing content items are uploaded to secondary storage 620 in an ongoing manner. Metadata associated with photos may be stored in photo sharing secondary storage 620.
- the camera application 610 may be used to take pictures and videos using a camera on the mobile device and to store photos and videos on local storage 616.
- the camera application may be in communication with the photo sharing secondary storage 620 or may store photos on local storage 616 and allow photo sharing application 608 to communicate with photo sharing secondary storage 620.
- camera application 610 may be integrated into photo sharing application 608, or photo sharing application 608 may be integrated into camera application 610.
- the backup manager 614 is also in communication with cloud backup server secondary storage 622.
- the cloud backup secondary storage 622 has a copy of data from the local storage 616 as configured by the user.
- the cloud backup secondary storage 622 has a copy of application data, including data from the camera application 610, as well as with the user's consent a record of what applications are used by this mobile device.
- the backup manager 614 uploads content items to the cloud backup server secondary storage 622 on a periodic basis (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).
- the storage manager 612 is configured to monitor the available local storage capacity of the local storage 616. In this example, on a periodic basis (.e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) and/or whenever the mobile device is attached to a network, the storage manager 612 determines whether the local storage 616 capacity meets a threshold local storage 616 capacity level (e.g., is below a predetermined available local storage 616 capacity level). If the local storage 616 capacity level is below, the storage manager 612 selects content items to remove from the local storage based on predetermined criteria. In some implementations, the storage manager 612 may score content items to determine which content items to add or remove from local storage 616.
- a threshold local storage 616 capacity level e.g., is below a predetermined available local storage 616 capacity level.
- the predetermined criteria include items that are copied and available on secondary storage and are over 3 months old. These items are prioritized by their date of access, and the items that have been accessed least recently are selected until the removal would result in the desired local storage 616 capacity level. Since the social medial application 606, the photo sharing application 608 and the backup manager 614 all store copies of data on secondary storage, the content items that they replicate that fit the other predetermined criteria may be removed. [00188] In this example, to remove the social media application 606 content items, the storage manager 612 sends a message to the social media application 606 to remove those content items. In this example, to remove the photo sharing application 608 content items, the storage manager simply deletes the files from the local storage 616. The photo sharing application 608 determines that the photos have been deleted, and marks the photos as deleted from local storage 616 but available from photo sharing secondary storage 620.
- the user can obtain them from the appropriate secondary storage 618, 620, 622. In this example, this may be accomplished using the social media application 606, the photo sharing application 608 or the backup manager 614.
- the backup manager 614 and storage manager 612 are included in an application, such as photo sharing application 608. Metadata may be stored in photo sharing secondary storage 620 along with content items.
- implementations may allow users to avoid manually managing the storage of content items on their mobile devices between local storage and secondary storage, which can be a time-consuming, difficult, and error-prone process. Some implementations may ensure that users will retain given content items on the local storage of their device for offline viewing (e.g., no internet access). Some implementations may help ensure that users do not accidentally lose their content items as they move content items, which can be a source of difficulty and frustration. Some implementations may therefore encourage users to download and create more content items, because the users do not need to worry about having enough storage on their device, thereby increasing enjoyment derived from their mobile devices. Some implementations may also allow users to effectively use devices with smaller storage capacity, thereby decreasing device cost.
- any suitable component or combination of components of the client device 110 or any suitable processor or processors associated with the client device 110 may perform the steps described.
- Various implementations may engage the user in decisions such as whether to enable management of content item storage of content items and if storage management is enabled, which content items will be selected. Some implementations may assume that a user will want to use storage management, and so will implement the described steps by default. Configuration settings may be provided to give a user control over, for example, whether to enable or disable storage management, such as storage manager 612 (FIG. 6), whether to engage in storage management if it is needed, a predetermined available local storage capacity threshold to maintain, the use of certain networks or network types to upload or download content items (e.g., use wifi for upload of content items and not cellular data), and so on. In some implementations, storage management is implemented by default, and permission by the user is assumed unless explicitly declined.
- storage management is implemented by default, and permission by the user is assumed unless explicitly declined.
- permission to use storage management is solicited as part of initial system installation and configuration. In some implementations, permission to use storage management is solicited at a later time. In some implementations, storage management is not implemented until it is needed, and permission is requested at the time that it is needed.

- the available local storage capacity may be determined from data that is available on the local storage. For example, in a FAT-32 formatted data store, the capacity of the data store may be determined by accessing the File Allocation Table stored on the data store.
- the available capacity of a storage device also may be determined by the operating system and/or from other data stored on the target device.
- an available local storage capacity may be determined based on the space available on the storage device that is currently unused and allocations and/or reservations made by the operating system and/or applications or storage space that may be needed. For example, an operating system may reserve a portion of the available space for applications and for temporary storage. In this example, the available local storage capacity may be the available storage space on a local storage device reduced by such reservation or allocation.
- the method 700 may include determining 704 whether available local storage capacity meets a threshold level (e.g., is above or below a predetermined threshold level).
- This threshold level may be a percentage of total storage capacity.

For example, permission to enable storage management if needed may be disabled by default in an application program or operating system.
- the notification may include a display of current permission settings. The notification may allow a user to change the settings as part of the notification, or to go to a settings screen where permission to enable storage management may be indicated.
- the method includes determining 708 whether the user has given permission to enable storage management.
- Permission may be implicit or explicit permission.
- the user may need to supply explicit permission, or the user's permission may be implied by the user's other actions, such as registration or agreement to the operation of cloud backup or other application features.
- Storage management may include, for example, implementing some or all of the steps of method 200 of FIG. 2, method 300 of FIG. 3, and/or the Storage Manager 612 of FIG. 6.
- a method for enabling management of local storage on a mobile device includes determining available local storage capacity on a mobile device, comparing the determined available local storage capacity to a threshold, and if the determined available local storage capacity meets the threshold, enabling storage management. In some implementations, the method includes determining that permission has been granted implicitly or explicitly to enable storage management. A determination of permission may be required to enable storage management.
- a system for enabling management of local storage on a mobile device includes one or more processors and logic encoded in one or more tangible media for execution by the one or more processors that when executed is operable to determine available local storage capacity on a mobile device and compare the determined available local storage capacity to a threshold.

- the control logic may include a fourth computer-readable program code that determines that permission has been granted implicitly or explicitly to enable storage management. A determination of permission may be required to enable storage management.
- an example screen display 800 according to some implementations, for example, of a client device such as a mobile device, is shown with an example alert 802.
- the alert 802 includes an indication 804 that local available storage capacity meets a threshold (e.g., is below a predetermined threshold).
- the predetermined threshold may be a fixed amount, such as 100MB, 200MB, 1GB, a percentage of total storage capacity or assigned allocation (e.g., 5%, 10%, 15%, etc.), the amount of storage needed for a number of photos (e.g., 100 photos, 200 photos, 500 photos, 1000 photos, etc.) or an amount of video (e.g., 10 minutes of video, 20 minutes of video, 30 minutes of video), or the amount of storage needed to last a number of days at current usage patterns (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, 3, days, 7 days, etc.).
- this threshold is illustrative, and any suitable value may be used.
- the predetermined threshold value may be based at least in part on the local storage device.
- the predetermined threshold value may be based at least in part on the anticipated storage needs of the user.
- Anticipated storage needs of a user may be determined based at least in part on prior storage space usage patterns of the user. Anticipated storage needs of a user may be determined based at least in part on typical usage for the software application(s) recently used by the user.
- the example alert 802 also includes an explicit request 806 for permission to enable automatic storage management.
- Alert 802 include a first button 808 on the alert for the user to enable storage management (i.e., to give permission for storage management).
- the text on the first button 808 states "Yes, move my files to the cloud as needed.” If the user activates the first button 808, for example by pushing the button on a touch screen, or for example clicking with a mouse, storage management capability will be enabled.

- the text on the second button 810 states "No, I will manually manage file storage.” If the user activates the second button 810, storage management capability will not be enabled.
- an example of a screen display 900 includes a notification 902 that content items have been backed up to secondary storage. This is indicated by the words "All photos backed up.”
- the screen display 900 also includes an alert notification 904 indicating that available storage capacity is above a predetermined threshold.
- the screen states "Device storage almost full. You have space for about 90 more photos. You can safely remove copies without deleting them from your Photos library. Remove Copies & Free Space.”
- This alert notification 904 may be used on a touch screen, such that if the user taps on the alert 904 it will enable storage management.
- an example of a screen display 1000 includes a collection of notifications, including an alert notification 1002 indicating that available storage capacity is above a predetermined threshold.
- the alert notification 1002 states "Device storage almost full. Remove backed-up photos to save space.”
- This alert notification 1002 may be presented, for example, in a collection of alerts or notifications provided to a device user. For example, in cases where an application is running in the background, a notification may be presented in a list of notifications.
- This alert notification 1002 may be used on a touch screen, such that if a user taps on the alert 1002 it will enable storage management.
- an example of a screen display 1100 includes a notification 1102 indicating that the device is measuring available storage. For example, in some implementations if the user activates the alert notification 904 of FIG. 9 or the alert notification 1002 of FIG. 10, this screen would then be presented, to indicate that the device is determining the available storage capacity for content items. This may also include, for example, updating metadata. When storage capacity has been determined, a display such as that of FIG. 12 may be used to further communicate with the user.
- measuring available storage may take place in the background, so that a progress indicator is not used.
- an example of a screen display 1200 includes a notification 1202 that content items may be removed from the device to provide additional storage capacity.
- the notification 1202 states "Free up 2.6GB. Delete 924 copies of photos & videos that are over 30 days old. These items remain in your Photos library and remain accessible from this and any other connected device.”
- the device has determined that 924 photos and videos have already been copied to secondary storage and may be removed in order to create additional available storage capacity.
- the notification 1202 includes an option "Delete Copies,” which will continue the storage management process. As will be shown, in this example, the device will provide another notification prior to deleting content items.
- the notification 1202 also includes an option "Cancel.” If the user selects the option to cancel, the device would not remove content items from the device.
- an example of a screen display 1300 includes a notification 1302 that content items will be deleted.
- the notification 1302 states "Delete device copies. All 924 items remain in your Photos library.”
- This notification 1302 gives the user another opportunity to halt storage management and the removal of content items from the device.
- There is an option "Delete copies” that may be selected by a user, for example, by touching on a touch screen. If the user selects "Delete copies", the device will continue with storage management, for example by making placeholder copies and/or removing content items from the device. If the user selects "Cancel" the device would not remove content items from the device.
- an example of a screen display 1400 includes a notification 1402 that additional storage capacity is now available.
- the notification in this example states "2.6GB device storage recovered.” This indicates that storage management was able to free up an additional 2.6GB of storage capacity on the device. It should be understood that the 2.6GB shown is demonstrative, and that the actual amount will depend on the content items and available storage capacity.
- an example of a screen display 1500 includes a notification 1502 that the device is unable to connect to secondary storage, and so storage management is unable to continue.
- the notification 1502 may be displayed, for example, as a result of the activation of the alert 808 of FIG. 8, the alert 904 of FIG. 9, or the alert 1002 of FIG. 10, in the case where the device is unable to communicate with the secondary storage. This may occur, for example, if a network (e.g., an Internet) connection is disrupted or unavailable.
- Storage management also may not be able to operate if the device is unable to communicate with secondary storage for other reasons. In the case where secondary storage was available via another network, or was locally available on the device, a connection to a particular communications network such as the Internet may not be necessary.
