Abstract
Techniques for using a dedicated scanning radio to improve scanning and other radio operations performed during wireless communications are described. The technique includes configuring a dedicated scanning radio to collect and cache scanning results without interfering with an ongoing wireless communication task performed using a primary radio. Based on the scan results cached by the dedicated scanning radio, the computing device improves other radio operations to facilitate wireless communication. The cached scan results enable the primary radio to avoid or focus on scanning certain channels or frequencies during discovery, location, or roaming operations. By using the dedicated scan results as a starting point or seed for the function performed by the primary radio, the computing device may perform the radio function more quickly and efficiently, thereby minimizing the delay of ongoing wireless communications.
Description
Background
In wireless communications, a computing device must typically "scan" for nearby nodes. The computing device "scans" to estimate signal strength, determine capabilities, and infer the location of nearby nodes. The scan may direct the radio to cease communication on the operating channel for a period of time (e.g., dwell time) instead of listening on other channels for signals from nearby nodes. For example, the computing device performs a connectivity scan to identify a list of available wireless networks for network selection. Connectivity scanning requires an accurate received-signal-strength-intensity (RSSI) indicator to enable network selection and is typically initiated by a system-level component (e.g., an operating system) rather than an application. Roaming scans may not require, for example, accurate RSSI, and applications often initiate roaming scans although operating systems or other system level components may initiate roaming scans. Preferred Network Operations (PNO) scanning is a particular type of connectivity scan that is limited to scanning a saved list of "preferred" channels or networks previously accessed by the computing device (visit). A location scan is performed to enable location-based functions and services. As its name suggests, location scanning is not a type of connectivity scanning and therefore an accurate RSSI indicator is generally not required. During scanning, the latency of ongoing traffic within the operating channel may increase, and the amount of power consumed by the computing device to scan for nearby nodes may also increase as compared to when the computing device is not scanning.
Disclosure of Invention
Techniques for using a dedicated scanning radio to improve scanning and other radio operations performed during wireless communications are described. The technique includes configuring a dedicated scanning radio to collect and buffer scan results in the background (e.g., continuously, quasi-continuously) and without interfering with ongoing wireless communication tasks performed using a primary radio. The computing device uses the scan results cached by the dedicated scanning radio to improve other radio operations performed by the computing device to facilitate wireless communication. Maintaining the results of the scan that was recently performed in the background enables the primary radio to avoid or focus on scanning certain channels or frequencies during discovery, location, roaming, or performing other radio operations. For example, by using the dedicated scan results as a starting point or seed for performing a function by the primary radio, the computing device may operate more quickly and efficiently when performing the primary radio function than without relying on the dedicated scan results, which may minimize introducing delay to ongoing wireless communications.
In one example, a computer-implemented method includes: the method includes communicating with a first network node using a primary radio of a computing device, and storing scan results generated by a dedicated scanning radio of the computing device that repeatedly scans for first wireless signals while communicating with the first network node using the primary radio. The computer-implemented method further comprises: the method further includes scanning, using the primary radio and based on scan results generated by the dedicated scanning radio, for second wireless signals, determining second network nodes from the second wireless signals, and communicating, using the primary radio, with the second network nodes identified from the second wireless signals.
In a further example, a computing device is described that includes at least one processor configured to perform the aforementioned computer-implemented method.
In a further example, a system is described that includes means for performing the aforementioned computer-implemented method.
In another example, a computer-readable storage medium is described that includes instructions that, when executed, configure a processor of a computing device to perform previous computer-implemented methods.

Detailed Description
Fig. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example computing system 100, the example computing system 100 including an example computing device 102 configured to enhance wireless communications using a dedicated scanning radio 108. In addition to dedicated scanning radio 108, computing device 102 maintains scan results 112 and includes radio module 104 and primary radio 106. Computing system 100 further includes network nodes 110A and 110B through 110N (collectively, "network nodes 110"). Computing system 100, computing device 102, and network node 110 may each include additional or fewer components than those shown in fig. 1.
Each of the network nodes 110 represents a wireless device accessed by the computing device 102 to communicate over a wireless network. There are many examples of network nodes 110. Network node 110 may be a wireless access point for one or more networks. Network node 110A may be a router configured as an access point to a network. The network node 110B may be a base station for a cellular network. Network node 110N may be a mobile device configured as a "hot spot" or soft network node that enables another mobile device to communicate on a cellular network using the mobile device's connection.
For ease of description, each of the primary radio 106 and the dedicated scanning radio 108 of the computing device 102 are described as a single independent radio. As described herein, each of primary radio 106 and dedicated scanning radio 108 may include multiple radios (e.g., transceivers) that collectively or independently perform operations associated with primary radio 106 and dedicated scanning radio 108. The main radio 106 and the dedicated scanning radio 108 may be part of a single radio system or a radio-on-chip system (SoC). The primary radio 106 and the dedicated scanning radio 108 may occupy portions of a single hardware unit of the computing device 102, and may be operatively and/or communicatively coupled via one or more shared buses, power supplies, memory, pins, or other connections or links.
The primary radio 106 enables the computing device 102 to wirelessly communicate data with other computing devices, such as the network node 110. For example, the primary radio 106 transmits and/or receives wireless signals to and/or from the network node 110B to enable the computing device 102 to communicate over a cellular network.
The dedicated scanning radio 108 enables the computing device 102 to scan for wireless signals regardless of the operations performed with the master radio 106. The dedicated scanning radio 108 may be a dedicated radio configured for scanning. The dedicated scanning radio 108 may be a receive-only radio that is unable to transmit wireless signals and is therefore suitable for passive scanning. Alternatively, the dedicated scanning radio 108 may include transmission capabilities, e.g., for active scanning in addition to or instead of passive scanning. The dedicated scanning radio 108, for example, detects wireless signals from some or all of the network nodes 110 to facilitate the computing device 102 detecting the network or a different connection to the network.
The dedicated scan radio 108 buffers the scan results 112 obtained from performing the scan operation. The scan results 112 are buffers, data stores, databases, tables, or other data structures. Scan results 112 include information that radio module 104 (and other components of computing device 102) uses to estimate signal strength, determine capabilities, and infer the location of network node 110.
The master radio 106 and the private scan radio 108 share data (e.g., scan results 112) via a common memory, register, or other internal memory. For example, the private scan radio 108 writes the scan results 112 to an internal cache memory of the private scan radio 108. Primary radio 106 and radio module 104 may access an internal cache memory of private scan radio 108 to read scan results 112 to perform radio operations based on scan results 112.
For wireless connectivity or communication, radio module 104 controls primary radio 106 to scan for nearby nodes, including network node 110. Radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to cease communicating on the operating channel (e.g., with network node 110A) for a period of time (e.g., a dwell time), and radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to listen on other, different channels for signals from nearby nodes. During the scan, the delay of ongoing traffic intended for the master radio 106 increases when the master radio 106 is busy scanning. For example, network node 110A maintains ongoing traffic intended for primary radio 106 until communication with network node 110A resumes. The amount of power consumed by the computing device 102 to scan for nearby nodes using the primary radio 106 also increases compared to when the computing device 102 is not scanning.
To prevent communication disruptions and minimize power consumption for scanning, radio module 104 relies on dedicated scanning radio 108 to assist primary radio 106 in scanning for nearby nodes and performing other radio functions. In some cases, the dedicated scanning radio 108 scans for less power during the scan than the master radio 106 will consume. For example, the dedicated scanning radio 108 includes a weaker, less complex, or fewer receivers than the primary radio 106, and thus, listening for wireless signals consumes less power than if scanning using a more powerful, more complex, or larger number of receivers of the primary radio 106. With dedicated scanning radio 108, radio module 104 enables computing device 102 to listen to other networks or other nearby nodes without interrupting communications occurring on the operating channel between primary radio 106 and network node 110.
Using the primary radio 106, the computing device 102 communicates with a first network node from the network nodes 110. While communicating with the first network node, the computing device 102 stores the scan results 112 generated by the dedicated scanning radio 108. The dedicated scanning radio 108 may repeatedly scan for the first wireless signal. Radio module 104 and primary radio 106 perform various radio functions based on scan results 112 generated by dedicated scanning radio 108.
Depending on the particular radio function being performed by computing device 102, radio module 104 and main radio 106 utilize scan results 112 in various ways to improve efficiency and reduce latency. Radio module 104 may reconfigure primary radio 106 based on scan results 112. Maintaining the scan results 112 based on the most recently performed scan in the background with the dedicated scanning radio 108 enables the primary radio 106 to avoid or concentrate on scanning certain channels or frequencies during discovery, location, roaming, or other radio operations.
The computing device 102 may scan for second wireless signals using the primary radio 106 based on the scan results 112. Radio module 104 is capable of scanning with primary radio 106 based on scan results 112 generated by dedicated scanning radio 108. Radio module 104 may determine a second network node of network nodes 110 in response to scanning for the second wireless signal. The computing device 102 communicates with the second network node using the primary radio 106.
By using the scan results 112 as a starting point or seed for the functions performed by the primary radio 106, the computing device 102 may perform primary radio functions more quickly and efficiently to minimize the delay of ongoing wireless communications. For example, the computing device 102 performs connectivity scans more quickly or quickly by scanning some of the pre-identified signals in the scan results 112 having strong signal characteristics before scanning other signals.
Fig. 2 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a computing device 200 configured to enhance wireless communication using a dedicated scanning radio. Computing device 200 is an example of computing device 102 of fig. 2 with some additional details. For example, computing device 200 includes radio module 104, primary radio 106, dedicated scanning radio 108, and scan results 112 from fig. 1. As some non-limiting examples, the computing device 200 may be a mobile phone, laptop computer, television/display, desktop computer, tablet device, computerized watch, or other wearable device, or a computing system installed in a vehicle.
In addition to radio module 104, primary radio 106, dedicated scanning radio 108, and scan results 112 from fig. 1, computing device 200 includes one or more processors 202, computer-readable media 204, one or more communication devices 210, and one or more input/output (I/O) devices 212. The computer-readable medium 204 includes instructions that, when executed by the processor 202, execute the application 206 and the operating system 208. Operating system 208 includes radio module 104. In other examples, radio module 104 is separate from operating system 208. The communication device 210 includes a primary radio 106 and a dedicated scanning radio 108. The communication device 210 contains the scan results 112 (or a copy of the scan results 112) generated by the private scan radio 108 in response to the completed scan. The I/O devices 212 include one or more sensors 214 and user interface devices 216. An output component 218 of the user interface device 216 in addition to the input component 220.
The processor 202 may include any combination of one or more controllers, microcontrollers, processors, microprocessors, hardware processors, hardware processing units, digital signal processors, graphics processing units, or the like. Processor 202 may be an integrated processor and memory subsystem (e.g., implemented as a SoC) that processes computer-executable instructions to control the operation of computing device 200.
The computer-readable medium 204 is configured to provide persistent and/or non-persistent storage of executable instructions (e.g., firmware, recovery firmware, software, applications, modules, programs, functions, etc.) and data (e.g., user data, operational data, scan results, etc.) to the computing device 200 to support execution of the executable instructions. Examples of computer-readable media 204 include volatile and non-volatile memory, fixed and removable media devices, and any suitable memory device or electronic data storage that maintains executable instructions and supporting data. Computer-readable media 204 can include various embodiments of Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), flash memory, and other types of storage memory in various storage device configurations. The computer-readable medium 204 excludes propagated signals. The computer-readable medium 204 may be a Solid State Drive (SSD) or a Hard Disk Drive (HDD). The computer-readable media 204 in the example of fig. 2 includes an application 206 and an operating system 208. The computer-readable medium 204 may include or be configured as a cache.
The application 206 may be any type of executable or program that executes within or is accessible from the operating environment of the computing device 200. Examples of applications 206 include a camera application, a messaging application, a photo editing application, a social media application, a virtual reality or augmented reality application, a video conferencing application, or other application that communicates with a network over a connection managed by radio module 104. For example, the application 206 is a game that relies on the radio module 104 to maintain a connection between the computing device 200 and the internet.
The operating system 208 generally controls the functionality of the computing device 200. Operating system 208 provides an execution environment for applications, such as application 206. The operating system 208 controls task scheduling and other conventional functionality, and typically does so through a system level user interface. The operating system 208 delegates functionality to other components of the computing device 200. For example, operating system 208 dispatches user interface device 216 to tasks of managing user input and output to operating system 208, as well as user input and output associated with other applications and services executing at computing device 200, including application 206. Operating system 208 assigns radio module 104 to manage network connections that rely on operating system 208 and tasks of other applications and services executing at computing device 200, including application 206.
The I/O device 212 provides connectivity to the computing device 200. The user interface device 216 of the I/O device 212 manages input and output to the user interface of the computing device 200, for example, to manage connections to nearby networks. For example, user interface device 216 receives instructions from radio module 104 that cause output component 218 to present a user interface. In response to presenting the user interface, user interface device 216 sends information to radio module 104 regarding user input related to the user interface detected by user interface device 216. Radio module 104 controls primary radio 106 and dedicated scanning radio 108 in response to user input.
The user interface device 216 includes an output component 218 for providing output, and the user interface device 216 includes an input component 220 for receiving input. The input component 220 may be integrated with the output component 218 or operatively coupled to the output component 218. In other examples, the input component 220 operates independently of the output component 218. For example, user interface device 216 may operate as a presence-sensitive display or touch screen, where output component 218 includes a display and input component 220 includes a presence-sensitive input or touch input component operatively coupled to the display (and in some cases physically integrated with the display).
The I/O device 212 provides additional connectivity only outside of the user interface device 216. When the computing device 102 is functioning in a physical operating environment (e.g., the computing system 100), the sensors 214 of the I/O device 212 obtain context information indicative of the physical operating environment of the computing device 200 and/or characteristics of the computing device 200. Examples of sensors 214 include camera sensors, optical sensors, infrared sensors, radar sensors, motion sensors, temperature sensors, position sensors, proximity sensors, other light sensors, humidity sensors, pressure sensors, and the like. The application 206, operating system 208, and radio module 104 may customize operation according to sensor information obtained by the sensors 214. The processor 202 may include a sensor hub that controls the sensors 214 and provides information obtained by the sensors 214 to the interface. The sensor hub may be a low power processor from the processor 202, for example, relative to an application processor or a graphics processor from the processor 202.
The I/O device 212 may provide additional connectivity beyond only the user interface device 216 and the sensor 214. The input/output device 212 may also include a data interface or data input port for receiving data, including user input, communication data, audio data, video data, image data, and the like.
In operation, processor 202 executes instructions associated with radio module 104. Radio module 104 directs dedicated scanning radio 108, including by continuously directing dedicated scanning radio 108 to regenerate scan results 112. Radio module 104 and primary radio 106 may rely on dedicated scanning radio 108 to update scanning results 112 to perform various radio functions. By using the scan results 112 as a starting point or seed for the functions performed by the primary radio 106, the computing device 200 may perform primary radio functions more quickly and efficiently, thereby minimizing delays in ongoing wireless communications.
The dedicated scanning radio 108 may continuously collect the scanning results 112. However, for power sensitive applications such as mobile devices, continuously scanning may be unacceptable. Instead of directing dedicated scanning radio 108 to scan continuously, radio module 104 may cause dedicated scanning radio 108 to scan at a particular duty cycle or frequency that enables computing device 102 to adjust the power consumption of computing device 102.
In some cases, prior to comparing scan result 112 with previous scan results, radio module 104 may filter scan result 112 to remove wireless signals associated with weak RSSI (e.g., RSSI values less than-80 dBm). Radio module 104 may compensate for fluctuations in RSSI values between successive scans by determining that scan results 112 are equal unless scan results 112 deviate by more than a certain threshold. Radio module 104 may further consider that network nodes may be lost during successive scans, e.g., due to a noisy environment, and thus radio module 104 may compare scan results 112 to multiple previous scans before determining whether computing device 102 is moving or stationary.
Fig. 3-8 are flow diagrams illustrating example operations of a computing device configured to enhance wireless communication using a dedicated scanning radio. The operations illustrated in each of fig. 3-8 are described as being performed by computing device 102 and in the context of computing system 100 of fig. 1. The operations illustrated in each of fig. 3-8 may be performed in a different order than illustrated or in additional or fewer operations than illustrated.
Fig. 3 presents a high-level view of operations performed by computing device 102 to enhance wireless communication using dedicated scanning radio 108. Fig. 4-8 illustrate in more detail some operations performed by the computing device 102 to enhance wireless communications using the dedicated scanning radio 108.
At 302, the computing device 102 communicates with a first network node using the primary radio 106. For example, network node 110A of computing system 100 may be an access node of a WLAN communicating over a 5GHz frequency band. Radio module 104 may direct primary radio 106 to communicate with network node 110A by transmitting first data to network node 110A or receiving first data from network node 110A on a first operating channel.
At 304, when the computing device 102 communicates with the first network node using the primary radio 106, the computing device 102 stores the scan results 112 generated by the dedicated scanning radio 108, the dedicated scanning radio 108 repeatedly scanning for the first wireless signal. For example, when computing device 102 communicates with network node 110A over a first operating channel, radio module 104 directs dedicated scanning radio 108 to scan and collect information about a first wireless signal on the first channel and a second wireless signal on other channels on the 5GHz band. The dedicated scanning radio 108 stores the information as a scanning result 112.
At 306, the computing device 102 scans for a second wireless signal using the primary radio 106 and based on the scan results 112 generated by the dedicated scanning radio 108. Using scan results 112 collected while the primary radio 106 is communicating with the network node 110A, the radio module 104 may reconfigure the primary radio 106 to enhance or improve connectivity to the WLAN. For example, the scan results 112 may include information about the nodes 110B to 110N. Radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to scan for a better connection to the WLAN than through network node 110A using some of scan results 112. For example, the primary radio 106 uses some of the scan results 112 to scan for a better connection periodically or in response to detecting a problem with the connection to the network node 110 a.
Fig. 4-8 illustrate in detail how computing device 102 performs operation 306 to scan for second wireless signals using primary radio 106 and based on scan results 112 generated by dedicated scanning radio 108. As one example, the primary radio 106 may adapt the scanning based on the scan results 112 from the dedicated scanning radio 108. For example, the primary radio 106 scans a subset of the second wireless signals, rather than scanning all of the second wireless signals that have been scanned by the dedicated scanning radio 108. In other words, the primary radio 106 refrains from scanning for at least one of the first wireless signals based on the scanning results 112.
For example, if, for example, the primary radio 106 or the radio module 104 determines that the network nodes 110A, 110B, and 110N are associated with the strongest signals from the scan results 112, the primary radio 106 may scan within the operating channels associated with the network nodes 110A, 110B, and 110N. In other words, the primary radio 106 may scan for at least one of the first wireless signals based on the scan results 112.
In some cases, radio module 104 uses scan results 112 to accelerate conventional scanning using primary radio 106. The computing device 102 scans for the second wireless signal using the primary radio 106 by scanning for non-dynamic frequency selection signals from the second wireless signal while simultaneously scanning for non-dynamic frequency selection signals from the second wireless signal using the dedicated scanning radio 108. For example, radio module 104 may direct master radio 106 to perform active scanning for 2.4GHz and non-DFS (dynamic frequency selection) 5GHz wireless signals, and rely on a dedicated scanning radio to perform passive scanning for any DFS 5GHz wireless signal simultaneously. In this manner, the primary radio 106 and the dedicated scanning radio 108 may be used in parallel to speed up the scanning operation. The computing device 102 may rely on the dedicated scanning radio 108 to minimize scanning done with the primary radio 106 to complete the DFS 5GHz scan in the background.
The computing device 102 may support an access point (e.g., SoftAP) mode in which the primary radio 106 facilitates connections from other devices to the network node 110. In other words, the computing device 102 may be a hotspot that provides internet access through its own connection to a service provider. To determine which channel to use for the access point, the computing device 102 may rely on the scan results 112 to identify channels that are not currently being used to transmit wireless signals. Without performing a separate scan, radio module 104 may configure primary radio 106 to provide an access point through one or more of the channels identified in scan results 112.
At 308, the computing device 102 determines a second network node from the second wireless signal. In response to the scan performed by primary radio 106, radio module 104 can determine whether network node 110B communicating on a different operating channel on the 5GHz band has a better signal than network node 110A.
At 310, the computing device 102 communicates with the second network node using the primary radio. In response to the scan performed by primary radio 106, radio module 104 may reconfigure primary radio 106 to communicate over a different operating channel on the 5GHz band to communicate with network node 110B to access the WLAN. As another example, in response to the scan performed by primary radio 106, radio module 104 may configure primary radio 106 to maintain communication over the same operating channel to communicate with network node 110A to access the WLAN.
Fig. 4 illustrates in detail how computing device 102 performs operation 306A as an example of operation 306. Specifically, for example, if computing device 102 is not connected to or in communication with any of network nodes 110, computing device 102 may perform operation 306A when radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to perform a connectivity scan.
The dedicated scanning radio 108 may be a low power radio relative to the primary radio 106. For example, the dedicated scanning radio 108 may include a single receiver, while the primary radio 106 may include multiple transceivers. In general, connectivity scanning requires that the RSSI be determined with a high degree of accuracy from nearby network nodes 110. As such, the scan results 112 generated by the dedicated scanning radio 108 may not be sufficient to replace the connectivity scan performed by the primary radio 106. However, the cached scan results 112 the primary radio 106 may improve the efficiency of the connectivity scan when used as a seed for the connectivity scan operation performed by the primary radio 106.
At 400, the computing device 102 initiates a connectivity scan for nearby network nodes. For example, radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to perform a connectivity scan to connect to a WLAN associated with one of network nodes 110. Radio module 104 accesses scan results 112 to seed connectivity scans.
At 402, the computing device 102 determines whether the channel indicated in the scan results 112 is omitted and thus may be ignored. For example, radio module 104 focuses the connectivity scan to occur using only channels identifiable from scan results 112 because channels that do not have scan results 112 are ignored during the connectivity scan.
At 404, the computing device 102 determines whether the channel indicated in the scan results 112 has insufficient RSSI indicated in the scan results 112 and is therefore negligible. For example, radio module 104 focuses the connectivity scan to occur only using channels that have RSSI derived from information in scan results 112 that exceeds a minimum RSSI threshold.
At 406, the computing device 102 determines an order for scanning channels that are not ignored from the connectivity scan. For example, radio module 104 reorders the scan results based on the RSSI inferred from scan results 112 to configure primary radio 106 to scan a channel with a greater RSSI value before scanning any other channels that are not ignored.
At 408, the computing device 102 performs a connectivity scan by scanning channels in the determined order. For example, the primary radio 106 scans the channels determined from the scan results, starting first with the channel having the higher RSSI value, ignoring channels that do not appear in the scan results 112, and also ignoring channels that do not have sufficient RSSI values. In this way, the computing device 102 more efficiently performs connectivity scans without wasting power and time scanning channels that are unlikely to be suitable connections.
Fig. 5 illustrates in detail how computing device 102 performs operation 306B as an example of operation 306. Specifically, computing device 102 may perform operation 306B when radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to perform a network selection operation or when performing a roaming operation. For example, the computing device 102 is connected to the internet through a cellular connection to one of the network nodes 110 and is seeking a better connection to the internet through a different cellular connection. Likewise, computing device 102 may alternatively disconnect from a cellular connection to one of network nodes 110, and may need to perform a network search or roaming operation to search for or roam a new connection.
At 500, the computing device 102 initiates a network selection or roaming scan for nearby network nodes. In general, computing device 102 may perform network selection or roaming operations when radio module 104 determines that the quality of the operating channel degrades below a quality threshold. Radio module 104 may use various quality metrics associated with operating channels, including current RSSI and Cooperative Collision Avoidance (CCA) busy status, as conditions for performing network selection operations to scan for other channels and new access points. Rather than interrupting ongoing communication with primary radio 106, and rather than requiring primary radio 106 to blindly perform network scanning or roaming operations, radio module 104 directs private scanning radio 108 to listen to compile scan results 112. Radio module 104 configures primary radio 106 to perform enhanced network selection and roaming as directed by the cached scan results 112 and the RSSI and CCA values continuously updated by radio module 104 and the dedicated scanning radio.
With respect to CCA busy, the computing device 102 may rely on the buffered scan results 112 to determine a CCA busy status for inferring channel congestion. For example, to determine a CCA busy status, the radio module 104 may need to take CCA measurements for a longer amount of time than the normal dwell time for scanning. Using scan results 112, computing device 102 may report a CCA busy status more quickly than computing device 102 relying on master radio 106 to complete a CCA scan.
At 502, the computing device 102 increases the accuracy of RSSI inferences made from the cached scan results 112. For example, radio module 104 modifies scan results 112 in preparation for roaming or network selection scanning. If the RSSI values inferred from scan results 112 have a deviation (positive or negative) due to certain radio frequency factors, radio module 104 may compensate scan results 112 for the deviation by adding or subtracting a delta value corresponding to the deviation to produce more accurate RSSI values.
At 504, the computing device 102 determines whether the channel in the scan results having an RSSI value has insufficient RSSI to perform a network selection or roaming scan. For example, if the RSSI values inferred from the scan results 112 lack accuracy, the radio module 104 directs the primary radio 106 to first perform a network selection or roaming scan on channels with inaccurate RSSI measurements. The primary radio 106 obtains accurate RSSI measurements to evaluate against previously taken and compensated RSSI measurements for other channels.
At 506, the computing device 102 first ranks the channels with less accurate RSSI measurements. For example, radio module 104 causes primary radio 106 to perform a network selection or roaming scan on channels that initially have less accurate RSSI measurements to obtain more accurate RSSI measurements. When more accurate RSSI measurements are obtained during a scan with the primary radio 106, the radio module 104 evaluates the more accurate RSSI measurements with reference to any previously recorded RSSI measurements when the scan is completed.
At 508, the computing device 102 performs a network selection or roaming scan by scanning channels in the determined order. For example, first starting with a channel having a less accurate RSSI measurement, radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to scan each of the less accurate channels for a more accurate RSSI measurement.
In some examples, computing device 102 performs network selection or roaming scanning by performing operations similar to operations 402-406 of fig. 4. For example, with more accurate RSSI measurements for other channels identified in scan 112, radio module 104 determines whether the channel indicated in scan 112 is omitted and therefore can be ignored (402), determines whether the channel indicated in scan 112 has too low an RSSI and therefore can be ignored (404), and determines the order in which to scan the non-ignored channels from a network selection or roaming scan. In this manner, the computing device 102 more efficiently and quickly performs network selection scans without wasting power and time scanning channels that are unlikely to be suitable connections.
Fig. 6 illustrates in detail how computing device 102 performs operation 306C as an example of operation 306. Specifically, computing device 102 may perform operation 306C when radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to perform sensing or location scanning operations. For example, an application executing at the computing device 102 uses the location information and the context information to perform context-related functions. The computing device 102 may perform radio scanning to determine the location of the computing device 102, and may also perform radio scanning to define a general context of the computing device. For example, the computing device 102 may rely on the runtime environment of a sensor hub or context hub to obtain sensor information and other information about the operating environment of the computing device 102 and use that information to define the environment of the computing device 102. The sensor hub may rely on radio scanning to better define the context and operating environment.
At 600, the computing device 102 initiates a sensing or position scanning operation. A requester of a sensing or location scanning operation (e.g., a sensor hub or an application) may not require a highly accurate RSSI value to define a location or context. However, the requester may require that the scan results be recently obtained. In order to perform sensing or position-related functions, the initiator of the sensing or position scanning needs to obtain the scanning results quickly. For example, in response to radio module 104 determining that a timestamp of scan result 112 exceeds a certain time threshold or age, scan result 112 may become stale. Radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to scan only channels with old or stale data without rescanning to obtain all new scan results 112.
At 602, the computing device 102 rescans channels with stale scan results. For example, radio module 104 determines from the timestamps associated with scan results 112 which, if any, of scan results 112 are too old to be used in response to sensing or location scanning. The radio module 104 identifies a communication channel from the first version of the scan results 112 having a corresponding timestamp that exceeds a time threshold. For scan results with timestamps exceeding a threshold, radio module 104 may direct primary radio 106 or dedicated scanning radio 108 to perform a rescan. For other scan results that are not as old and have a timestamp that does not exceed a threshold, radio module 104 may refrain from directing either primary radio 106 or dedicated scanning radio 108 to perform a rescan. Radio module 104 generates the second version of scan results 112 by scanning communication channels from the first version of scan results 112 having respective timestamps that exceed the time threshold without rescanning other communication channels from the first version of scan results 112.
The radio module 104 can determine the age of the scan results 112 in other ways. The scan results 112 may be stored as a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer. Radio module 104 may determine the age of the scan results in the FIFO buffer based on the location of the scan results within the FIFO buffer. Radio module 104 may determine the age of a particular result based on the frequency with which old scan results are removed from the FIFO buffer when new scan results are added to the FIFO buffer. Based on the update frequency, radio module 104 may assign a duration to each location in the FIFO buffer and determine the age of the scan results based on the duration assigned to the location of the scan results in the FIFO buffer. For example, the duration at the input or first position of the buffer is a minimum time threshold, the duration at the output or last position of the buffer is a maximum time threshold, and the duration of each position between the first and last positions is continuously increased by a fixed amount equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum time thresholds divided by the number of positions between the first and last positions.
At 604, the computing device 102 returns a combination of the cached scan results and the results from the rescan. Radio module 104 may deliver scan results 112 modified by any rescan performed at 602 to a requester or initiator of a sensing or location scanning operation. Radio module 104 returns a combination of the second version of scan results 112 and a portion of the first version of scan results 112 associated with other communication channels from the first version of scan results 112 that were not rescanned when the second version of scan results 112 was generated.
Fig. 7 illustrates in detail how computing device 102 performs operation 306D, which is an example of operation 306. Specifically, when radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to perform a PNO scan, computing device 102 may perform operation 306D.
At 700, the computing device 102 initiates a preferred network operations scan. For example, when the computing device 102 is in a sleep mode or a standby mode and a display (e.g., the output component 218 of the user interface device 216) is turned off, the computing device 102 may occasionally need to connect to the internet or other network to obtain information to update an operating system or other application executing at the computing device 102. Rather than relying on the master radio 106 to perform a PNO scan to identify a preferred network, the computing device 102 may utilize the private scan radio 108 and the cached scan results 112 to find a preferred network connection without requiring the master radio 106 to scan.
At 702, the computing device 102 determines whether to initiate a connected PNO scan or a disconnected PNO scan. For example, radio module 104 determines whether primary radio 106 is connected to any network node 110. If connected to any network node, the radio module 104 performs a PNO scan of the connection at 706. Otherwise, the radio module 104 performs a disconnected PNO scan at 704.
At 704, the computing device 102 uses the cached scan results to satisfy the preferred network operation scan. For example, in response to determining that the primary radio 106 is disconnected, the radio module 104 performs the disconnected PNO scan by directing the primary radio 106 and the private scan radio 108 using the scan results 112 that have been buffered in the background, without scanning additional scan results using the private scan radio 108 or the primary radio 106. The scan results 112 may indicate a list of networks or network nodes 110 having corresponding RSSI values and other characteristics. Radio module 104 may use scan results 112 to perform preferred network operations without having to perform scans using primary radio 106. The dedicated scanning radio 108 may collect in the background the scan results 112 that will satisfy the disconnected PNO scan. In some cases, the dedicated scanning radio 108 consumes less power than the primary radio 106. The dedicated scanning radio 108 may update the scan results 112 to perform preferred network operations using less power than the primary radio 106 to wake up to perform the scan.
At 706, the computing device 102 uses the cached scan results to perform a primary radio scan operation that satisfies the preferred network operation scan. For example, in response to determining that the primary radio 106 is connected to any network node 110, the radio module 104 directs the primary radio 106 and the private scanning radio 108 to implement a connected PNO scan using the scan results 112 that have been cached in the background.
In a connected PNO, radio module 104 may obtain a list of networks or network nodes of interest (e.g., service set identifiers or SSIDs). Radio module 104 may occasionally direct dedicated scanning radio 108 to scan again and regenerate scan results 112. In response to identifying a network or network node from the list of networks or network nodes of interest in scan results 112, radio module 104 may evaluate whether to recommend a network to, for example, an operating system.
At 708, the computing device 102 identifies, from the cached scan results, RSSI values associated with the networks of interest that are also found in the list of networks or network nodes of interest. For example, when connected to network node 110A, radio module 104 determines from scan results 112 that network node 110B has a particular RSSI value. Radio module 104 may determine that network node 110B is on a list of networks or network nodes of interest. In response to identifying network node 110B on the list of networks or network nodes of interest, radio module 104 evaluates whether computing device 102 should maintain a connection to network node 110A or switch to network node 110B without requiring a scanning operation by primary radio 106.
At 710, the computing device 102 determines whether the RSSI value is sufficient to recommend a switching network. For example, where radio module 104 determines that network node 110B has a respective RSSI value that may be inferred from scan results 112, radio module 104 determines whether the respective RSSI value satisfies a threshold sufficient to recommend a handover from network node 110A to network node 110B. The RSSI threshold may correspond to an RSSI value of a current network connection with network node 110A. The RSSI threshold may be an amount or percentage greater than the RSSI value of the current network connection to ensure that the computing device 102 achieves sufficient benefit when making connection changes.
At 712, in response to determining that the RSSI values from the cached scan results are sufficient, the computing device 102 recommends a new connection to the network of interest in place of the current connection. For example, if the RSSI value of network node 110B exceeds the RSSI value of network node 110A, radio module 104 may direct or recommend that the operating system direct primary radio 106 to cease communicating with network node 110A, to instead establish communication with network node 110B.
At 714, the computing device 102 does not recommend replacing the current connection with the new connection and instead takes no further action with respect to the preferred network scanning operation. For example, if the RSSI value of network node 110B does not exceed the RSSI value of network node 110A by a sufficient amount, radio module 104 may refrain from instructing or recommending primary radio 106 to establish communication with network node 110B.
Even if the difference in RSSI values between the current connection and the possible new connection is not sufficient to warrant a recommended change, it is still worth establishing a new connection if the current connection deteriorates. In this scenario, when the connection to network node 110A deteriorates, radio module 104 maintains information for establishing communication with network node 110B as the immediate preferred network connection. For example, a poor connection of computing device 102 to network node 110A wakes up, and radio module 104 directs primary radio 106 to immediately establish a connection with network node 110B, which radio module 104 has previously identified network node 110B from cached scan results 112.
Fig. 8 illustrates in detail how computing device 102 performs operation 306E as an example of operation 306. In particular, the computing device 102 may perform operation 306E to conserve power, thereby minimizing the time it takes to respond to a traffic indication message or deliver a traffic indication message (DTIM) using the primary radio 106.
In some wireless communications, such as communications based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, a computing device may sleep for a period of time (e.g., DTIM periods, TIM periods). DTIM is used to communicate multicast or broadcast frames and TIM is used to communicate unicast frames. The TIM is included in each beacon or communication frame, while the DTIM appears only in the final beacon or communication frame after receiving one or more previous beacon or communication frames. Depending on whether the DTIM or TIM bit in the beacon or communication frame is set, the computing device 102 sleeps or refrains from sleeping.
When the computing device sleeps, the network node buffers data intended for sleeping the computing device. The network node broadcasts the DTIM so that the computing device can obtain buffered data in response to the DTIM when the computing device wakes up. For lower DTIMs, the computing device may be more responsive because the computing device receives data faster because the data is not buffered that long, but at the cost of higher power consumption because the computing device is operating outside of a sleep or power saving mode. For higher DTIMs, the computing device may be more power efficient, but the traffic delay increases as the computing device's data is buffered and does not respond while the computing device remains asleep. For example, at the end of each DTIM period, the master radio 106 may check whether any buffered data is waiting for the computing device 102, whereas if no data is waiting, waking up the master radio 106 frequently according to the DTIM period may unnecessarily consume power.
Rather than waking the primary radio 106 at the end of each DTIM to check whether any buffered data is waiting for the computing device 102, the dedicated scanning radio 108 may be used to check for waiting data in the background. At the end of the DTIM, the radio module 104 may refrain from waking up the primary radio 106 unless the buffered scan results 112 indicate waiting for buffered data.
At 802, when the DTIM period ends, the computing device 102 checks the cached scan results for the corresponding DTIM. For example, radio module 104 may determine whether a DTIM has been set for traffic associated with the current operating channel.
At 804, in response to not detecting the DTIM presence, the radio module 104 directs the master radio 106 to sleep for another DTIM period. Instead, at 806, the radio module 104 directs the primary radio 106 to wake up in response to detecting the presence of a DTIM at 804. In other words, in response to determining that the DTIM period is over, radio module 104 wakes up the main radio 106 in response to the DTIM identified from scan results 112, or radio module 104 refrains from waking up the main radio 106 for another DTIM period.
In this manner, the dedicated scanning radio 108 optimizes DTIM operations performed by the master radio 106. At the end of the DTIM period, dedicated scanning radio 108 scans only the operating channels, and based on the scan results 112, radio module 104 selectively wakes up or refrains from waking up the primary radio. The DTIM may be set short to ensure low latency in network traffic, thereby minimizing the power consumed to activate and use the primary radio 106 for scanning.
