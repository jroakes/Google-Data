Abstract
A mobile device associated with a mobile asset (and a method operating on such a mobile device) determines the location of the mobile asset and reports the location to a tracking server. To conserve power and bandwidth resources, the mobile device reports the current location and movement data of the mobile asset initially and then upon determination of the existence of one or more conditions. Potential conditions that could cause the mobile device to send an update to the server are a change from one road to another, a change in velocity or direction greater than a predetermined threshold, a deviation from an assigned or predicted route, or a difference between a current location and a predicted location.
