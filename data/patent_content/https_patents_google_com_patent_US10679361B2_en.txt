Definitions
- the present document relates to improved techniques for propagating contours, such as rotoscope contours, from one view to another.
- Rotoscoping a post-production technique that traditionally involves hand-drawing shapes to match each individual view, does not scale well to multi-view video streams because with traditional techniques, such scaling would generally require the manual generation of the rotoscope contour for each view.
- a method for processing a video stream may be provided.
- a video stream may be captured.
- the video stream may have a plurality of frames including at least a first frame and a second frame.
- Each of the frames may have a plurality of views obtained from viewpoints that are offset from each other.

- the source contour may include a first closed shape defining a first interior within the first closed shape and a first exterior outside the first closed shape.
- the destination contour may include a second closed shape defining a second interior within the second closed shape and a second exterior outside the second closed shape.
- the method may further include applying an image processing technique to the source view such that the image processing technique is applied differently to the first interior than to the first exterior, and applying the image processing technique to the destination view such that the image processing technique is applied differently to the second interior than to the second exterior.
- the method may further include, at an input device, receiving user input designating the source contour. Further, the method may include, at the input device, receiving second user input modifying the destination contour.

- the method may further include, at the processor, using at least the additional offsets to project the source contour to each of the additional destination views to generate a plurality of additional destination contours, each of which is associated with one of the additional destination views.
- Using at least the first offset to project the source contour to the destination view may include, for each source point of a plurality of source points on the source contour, designating a source window of the source view containing the source point, identifying one or more source features of the source view within the source window, using the first offset to designate a destination window of the destination view that is believed to contain a destination point on the destination contour, the destination point corresponding to the source point, identifying one or more destination features, corresponding to the source features, within the destination window, and using the destination features to locate the destination point within the destination window.
- Identifying the source features and identifying the destination features may include applying at least one image analysis technique selected from the group consisting of photometric matching, gradient magnitude analysis, foreground/background modeling, and shape consistency/connectedness analysis.
- Identifying the source features and identifying the destination features may include assessing one or more metrics selected from the group consisting of a photometric similarity score, an object segmentation score, and a snap-to-edge score. Assessing one or more of the metrics may include assessing a plurality of the metrics. Identifying the source features and identifying the destination features may further include computing a weighted average of the metrics and using the weighted average of the metrics to determine that the destination features are similar to the source features.
- Capturing the video stream may include capturing source depth information indicative of depths of objects in the source view, and capturing destination depth information indicative of depths of objects in the destination view.
- Using at least the first offset to project the source contour to the destination view may include further using the source depth information and the destination depth information to project the source contour to the destination view.
- Using the source depth information and the destination depth information to project the source contour to the destination view may include using the source depth information for the source point to un-project the source point from 2D space to 3D space, and using the destination depth information to re-project the source point back to the destination view as the destination point.
- the image capture device may be a tiled camera array with a plurality of cameras, each of which captures one of the views of the first frame.
- the method may further include calibrating the image capture device to obtain the camera parameters.
- the camera parameters may include a plurality of 3D transformations usable to transform a first position and/or orientation of each of the cameras to a second position and/or orientation of any other of the cameras.
- the 3D transformations may include an epipolar line that provides a 1D line across the destination view, corresponding to the source view.
- the method may further include, from the data store, retrieving one or more additional source contours, each of which is associated with one of one or more additional source views of the first frame.
- the camera parameters may further include one or more additional offsets between the one or more additional source views and the destination view.
- Using at least the first offset to project the source contour to the destination view may further include using the one or more additional offsets to generate the destination contour.

- FIG. 1 is a schematic view 100 depicting the views of one frame of a video stream, according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 1 depicts an example in which a source view 00000 is denoted by a red square, and other desired views (such as 00007 and 00037, for example) are denoted by green squares.
- These views may represent different views as captured via a multi-camera capture rig or other apparatus, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 15/582,237 and 15/590,877, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
- a contour transfer solver may be implemented in software and/or hardware, and may be executed by a post-processing system, such as the post-processing system 300 of FIG. 3 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/605,037, which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the contour transfer solver may run on the post-processing circuitry 204 of the post-processing system 300.
- the solver may take into account the relative camera geometry between a reference camera view (a “source view” such as view 00000 of FIG. 1 ) and any of the other views (“destination views”).
- a source contour such as a rotoscope contour
- the solver takes as input a source contour, such as a rotoscope contour, in the source view, learns foreground and background color models, and uses calibrated epipolar camera geometry to produce an initial rotoscope contour (a “destination contour”) for each of the destination views.
- the source contour may be propagated to all other views; thus, all of the other views may be destination views.
- the resulting destination contours may optionally be exported in an artist-friendly editable format to facilitate manual modification by a user.
- the destination contours may be used for image processing without manual modification.
- FIGS. 2A and 2B are screenshot diagrams depicting a source view 200 (the view 00000 of FIG. 1 ) and a first destination view 250 (the view 00007 of FIG. 1 ), respectively, according to one embodiment.
- the source view 200 and the first destination view 250 depict the scene from viewpoints that are slightly offset from each other, causing the two views to be slightly different. If the video stream was captured by a tiled camera array, as in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/582,237 or 15/590,877, the source view 200 and the first destination view 250 may have been captured by different cameras, and the offset between them may be a result of the displacement between the two cameras in the tiled camera array.
- the source view 200 and the first destination view 250 may have been captured by a single image sensor, through different microlenses of a microlens array, and the offset between them may be a result of the displacement between the microlenses.
- FIGS. 3A and 3B are screenshot diagrams depicting the source view 200 and the first destination view 250 of FIGS. 2A and 2B , respectively, with a source contour 300 drawn in the source view 200 and propagated to the first destination view 250 , according to one embodiment. This may result in the generation of a destination contour 350 in the first destination view 250 .
- the destination contour 350 may correspond relatively closely to the source contour 300 , as both contours designate an interior 360 containing the astronaut, and an exterior 370 surrounding the astronaut.
- the source contour 300 and the destination contour 350 may be used to apply a post-processing technique to the source view 200 and the first destination view, with differential application between the interior 360 and the exterior 370 .
- this may entail applying the post-processing technique only to the interior 360 or only to the exterior 370 .
- the interior 360 may be replaced with an alternative interior (not shown—such as a computer-generated or separately-filmed astronaut), or the exterior 370 may be replaced with an alternative exterior (not shown—such a computer-generated or separately-filmed environment).
- the post-processing technique may be applied with different settings to the interior 360 than those with which it is applied to the exterior 370 . For example, if lighting were to be added to the scene to simulate another light source near the astronaut, the lighting may be added in post-processing with greater application to the interior 360 than to the exterior.
- the destination contour 350 is not identical to the source contour 300 .
- the destination contour 350 is shifted, vertically and laterally, relative to the source contour 300 .
- the orientation of the astronaut differs slightly between the source view 200 and the first destination view 250 .
- FIGS. 4A and 4B are screenshot diagrams depicting the source view 200 of FIG. 2A and a second destination view 400 (the view 00037 of FIG. 1 ), respectively, with the source contour 300 drawn in the source view 200 and propagated to the second destination view 400 , according to one embodiment. Propagation of the source contour 300 to the second destination view 400 may lead to the generation of a destination contour 450 in the second destination view 400 .
- the destination contour 450 may also separate the astronaut from the surrounding environment, leading to the designation of the interior 360 and the exterior 370 in the second destination view 400 .
- the fact that the astronaut is oriented slightly differently in the source view 200 and in the second destination view 400 may mean that the destination contour 450 needs to be re-drawn for the second destination view 400 , based on the source contour 300 .
- Contours may be propagated between views in a multi-view video stream according to various methods, one example of which will be shown and described in connection with FIG. 5 . Such propagation may be carried out through the use of various hardware elements. Some examples are depicted in the post-processing system 300 described in U.S. application Ser. No. 15/605,037, as mentioned above.
- the post-processing circuitry 204 , memory 211 , user input 215 , user interface 305 , and display screen 216 of the post-processing system 300 of FIG. 3 of U.S. application Ser. No. 15/605,037 may be used to implement the steps of a method of propagating contours between views of a multi-view video stream.
- these hardware elements may be supplemented or replaced by other elements, within the understanding of a person skilled in the art.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram depicting a method 500 for processing a video stream, according to one embodiment.
- the method 500 may start 510 with a step 520 in which an image capture device is calibrated.
- the image capture device may be designed to capture light-field data.
- the image capture device may be a tiled camera array or a plenoptic light-field camera.
- Calibration may entail collecting information regarding the parameters of the image capture device (“camera parameters”), such as the offsets (in terms of translation and/or rotation) between each pair of cameras of the image capture device, wherein the image capture device is a tiled camera array.
- the offsets may simply specify the x and y coordinates by which each camera is displaced on the plane from each of the other cameras.
- the camera parameters may be stored in a data store, such as the memory 211 of the post-processing system 300 of U.S. application Ser. No. 15/605,037.
- the video stream may be captured with the image capture device.
- the video stream may have light-field data that can be used to render a scene from any virtual viewpoint within a predetermined viewing volume.
- the video stream captured in the step 530 may be usable for presenting a virtual reality or augmented reality experience.
- a step 540 user input may be received to designate a source contour for a source view of a frame of the video stream.
- Any of a variety of input devices may be used to accomplish this, including the user input 215 of the post-processing system 300 of U.S. application Ser. No. 15/605,037.
- a mouse, stylus, or other pointing device may be used by an artist to draw the source contour around one or more objects appearing in the source frame. Any input method known in the rotoscoping arts may be used.
- the source contour may be a closed curve that defines a shape with an interior and an exterior, as depicted in FIGS. 3A through 4B .
- the source contour may be stored in a data store, such as the memory 211 of the post-processing system 300 of U.S. application Ser. No. 15/605,037. In alternative embodiments, more than one source contour may be received and stored.
- the source contour may be retrieved from the data store.
- the camera parameters for example, obtained in the step 520 , may be retrieved. These items may be retrieved, for example, from the memory 211 of the post-processing system 300 of U.S. application Ser. No. 15/605,037.
- the source contour(s) may be projected to one or more destination views.
- the destination view(s) may all be in the same frame of the video stream as the source view(s).
- the destination view(s) may include all views of the frame that are not source views.
- the source contour(s) may be projected to one or more destination views in different frames from the source view(s). Exemplary methods for accomplishing this will be set forth subsequently.
- a step 580 user input may optionally be received for one or more destination contours to modify the destination contours.
- each destination contour may be stored in a user-editable format.
- the artist may have the option of reviewing the destination contour for each destination frame, and then making any adjustments needed.
- the automatic propagation of the source contour(s) may be accurate enough that no user modification of the destination contour(s) is needed.
- one or more image processing techniques may be applied to the source view(s) and destination view(s). These image processing techniques may be applied differentially to the interiors and exteriors of the source contour(s) and destination contour(s), as described above. Any of a wide variety of image processing techniques may be used, including but not limited to color adjustment, luminance adjustment, lighting adjustment, addition of computer-generated or separately filmed elements, and/or the like.
- the method 500 may then end 596 .
- the step 570 of the method 500 of FIG. 5 may be carried out in various ways. According to some embodiments, points on the destination contour may be treated as unknowns to be solved. FIG. 6 depicts an example.
- FIG. 6 is a pair of screenshot diagrams depicting propagation of the source contour 610 in a source view 600 to generate a destination contour 660 in a destination view 650 , according to one embodiment.
- the source contour 610 may be a closed shape that defines an interior 620 and an exterior 630 .
- a point 640 on the source contour 610 may reside within a window 642 .
- the destination contour 660 may be a closed shape similar, but not identical, to the source contour 610 .
- the destination contour 660 may define an interior 670 and an exterior 680 .
- a point 690 on the destination contour 660 may reside within a window 692 .
- the point 690 may not initially be known, but may be located by first locating the window 692 .
- the window 692 may, for example, be located by referencing the location of the window 642 that contains the point 640 on the source contour 610 .
- multiple candidate windows 694 may be identified, and the window 692 may be selected from the candidate windows 694 .
- the system solves for the depth and direction using stereo geometry.
- parameters of the calibration that defines relative positions of cameras of the image capture device i.e., the camera parameters
- the system is able to determine a line along which the matching destination point for a particular source point lies.
- the system may first consider a window defined around the source point (for example, the window 642 of FIG. 6 ), and analyze image data within that window so as to identify a corresponding location along the line for the destination point. For example, the system can consider whether there is a gradient, indicating an edge within the image; a gradient found in the source view generally corresponds to a gradient in the destination view.
- Any suitable metric, or set of metrics, can be used to identify the destination point based on analysis of the source point. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- any or all of the above metrics can be combined with each other.
- weights can be assigned to the various metrics when combining them.
- a user or operator can adjust the weights as desired.
- the method is made more efficient by restricting the search range for a corresponding destination point to those locations where the point is likely to be, thereby avoiding a search across the entire domain of possible locations.
- input depth can be used to narrow the search range.
- the destination contour can be generated.
- the destination contour is exported in editable form so as to allow a human user to fine tune the destination contour as desired, as in the step 580 of the method 500 .
- a mechanism can be provided for fitting a cubic spline curve so as to facilitate such fine-tuning.
- a feedback loop can be introduced so that the edits made by the human user can be employed to train the model and thereby achieve improved results at each iteration. Any of a wide variety of known machine learning algorithms may be used to accomplish this.
- step 570 of the method 500 of FIG. 5 Further details regarding performance of the step 570 of the method 500 of FIG. 5 will be provided below. Again, these details represent only certain embodiments; the step 570 may be carried out in other ways.
- a set of N source cameras may be defined: ⁇ S 1 ,S 2 , . . . ,S N ⁇ (1)
- the corresponding 2-D images captured by these cameras may be described as follows: ⁇ I 1 ,I 2 , . . . I N ⁇ (2)
- a contour of length M may be defined as a closed sequence of neighboring points on any image I j :
- C j ⁇ x j,1 ,x j,2 , . . . ,X j,M / ⁇ k> 1, X j,k ⁇ nbd ( x j,k ⁇ 1 ) ⁇ (4)
- a contour may be a closed curve, with x j,1 ⁇ nbd(x j,M ).
- the function nbd( ⁇ ) can denote a 4-pixel or 8-pixel neighborhood in image space, or it can be any other size if desired.
- the system solves the contour transfer problem by generating an unknown contour C u given one or more contours ⁇ C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C L ⁇ as input, where u is different from all of the input camera indices ⁇ 1, 2, . . . , L ⁇ .
- view-dependent lighting effects are a function of viewing position and direction
- the object 710 may appear to have slightly different color components in the view generated by each camera.
- these are unified prior to analysis.
- colors may be unified, or view-dependent lighting effects may be removed for contour propagation.
- estimates may be generated for 3D transforms between any pair of cameras on the rig.
- this calibration may define an epipolar geometry that reduces the search space for point correspondences from two dimensions (2D) to one dimension (1D).
- F is known in stereo vision literature as the fundamental matrix.
- contour transfer problem can be reduced to a problem of solving for epipolar arc lengths ⁇ d 1 , d 2 , . . . , d M ⁇ :
- C u ⁇ epi ( x j,1 ,d 1 ), epi ( x j,2 ,d 2 ), . . . , epi ( x j,M ,d M ) ⁇
- the epipolar arc length may be different from what is known as disparity in stereo vision literature because usage of the epipolar arc length may not involve stereo rectification.
- each cell in the 2-D discrete table T j [0, M] ⁇ [d min , d max ] may define a corresponding point in the desired image I u .
- a set of quantitative objective functions O* may be defined, to evaluate how well they correspond.
- These functions can include, for example:
- O pho ⁇ ( x j , x u ⁇ ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ x ⁇ CensusDiff ⁇ ( I j ⁇ ( x j + ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ x ) , I u ⁇ ( x u + ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ x ) )
- each cell of the table can be populated as follows: T j : [0, M] ⁇ [d min , d max ].
- the solution for the unknown contour may then be the closed curve of minimum accumulated cost that connects cells in table T j .
- a constant neighborhood penalty ⁇ is imposed, where deviations from the previous choice cost increasingly more.
- a cost table T j can be constructed, with cells indexed as (r, c) for (row, column), where rows correspond to points on the input contour (range [0, M]) and columns correspond to the unknown epipolar arc length (range [d min , d max ]). The following steps can be performed:
- FIGS. 8A, 8B, and 8C are an exemplary source contour in a source view 800 , destination contour in a destination view 830 , and cost table 860 , respectively, according to one embodiment.
- the source view 800 , destination view 830 , and cost table 860 of FIGS. 8A, 8B, and 8C may pertain to the example of FIG. 7 .
- the left-hand column 870 corresponds to the value d min
- the right-hand column 880 corresponds to the value d max
- the green cells 890 represent the selection of minimum cost cells from bottom-to-top.
- the result may be generation of a destination contour 840 , designated C u , in the destination view 830 , from the minimum cost cells.
- the values of d min and d max may be selected so as to avoid deleterious effects. A large range could lead to spurious photometric matches from unrelated parts of the two images, whereas a small range might not be sufficient to account for the wide-baseline geometry of the cameras.
- post-production artists can provide multiple input contours.
- the above description sets forth the objective function in pairwise form, one skilled in the art will recognize that it can be extended to multiple source views via accumulation.
- the Object Segmentation Score has a model that can be updated with the interior contours of all source views.
- the Snap-to-Edge Score is defined in the output image raster space, so that it remains unchanged.
- the Photometric Score is updated to accumulate the mismatch cost across all input sources. In this manner, the above-described techniques can be extended to apply to multiple source images.
- the system is implemented in connection with a light-field capture rig including multiple cameras.
- Results derived from such a rig can include a per-pixel depth map, which indicates how far each pixel is from the camera that captured it.
- such a depth map can be used as input to the system, for example by determining appropriate column ranges for each row of the table T as follows:
- This method may provide robustness to minor depth estimation errors, while simultaneously picking an appropriate search space for each output pixel.
- solving for the contour seeded by an initial depth range in turn, can help refine depth values.
- the depth values in the entire interior of that contour may be used to transfer the contour mask from the source view to the destination view. This is an alternative to the epipolar solution method mentioned in the previous section.
- the aforementioned techniques and method can be re-applied when any of the input parameters change.
- the solution can be made variably sensitive to, for example, scene lighting, color differences between cameras, or how important edge alignment is.
- the output contours are rasterized to pixel level.
- a spline curve can be fit to the raster curve, thereby exposing fewer control points.
- Rotoscope artists can draw a handful of views instead of all of them.
- the described system can then use those initial views as reference views, performing automated propagation of the rotoscope contour to any view of their choice. This may bootstrap their process, reducing the effort required to draw on each view from scratch.
- the system can be implemented as a standalone back-end, and in at least one embodiment can interface with other software such as The Foundry's Nuke tool suite.
- This modular design may facilitate generation of new plug-ins as needed for other tools without having to redo the solver logic in the core system.
- the system exports curves generated by the solver in simplified spline format. This may enable artists to edit them more easily.
- Some embodiments may include a system or a method for performing the above-described techniques, either singly or in any combination.

- Psrc represents the 2-D point on the source curve;
- Pdest represents the 2-D point on the destination curve;
- d represents a depth value; and
- v represents a unit vector in a particular direction.

- Photometric matching, or color similarity: This can be determined, for example, by calculating a sum of square differences (SSD), normalized cross-correlation (NCC), and/or rank and census transforms. See, for example, H. Hirschmuller and D. Scharstein, Evaluation of Cost Functions for Stereo Matching, in Proceeding, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, June 2007.
- Gradient magnitude, for example by determining a similarity score over gradient to look for match between source and destination. This metric can help to ensure that there is clear separation between foreground and background.
- Foreground/background model: A probabilistic model can be used to indicate the probability that a particular pixel belongs to foreground as opposed to background.
- Shape consistency/connectedness: This technique involves analyzing whether two elements are connected in the source; if so, they are more likely to be connected in the destination.

- Photometric Similarity. A color-channel-based measure that combines values in a local window around each pixel in Ij and Iu. Common photometric similarity methods used in literature include Sum of Squared Differences (SSD), Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC), and the Census transform. In at least one embodiment, window size is selected to be small enough not to mix too many features together, but large enough to capture intensity variations across object edges:
-
- Object Segmentation Score: Each closed contour curve Cj may define an interior and an exterior set of pixels for its image Ij. A foreground-background color model may be generated from the inputs Ij based on this segmentation. This probabilistic model may then be used to predict whether or not an unknown pixel xu belongs to the foreground (FG), i.e. the interior of the object-of-interest:
O seg(x j ,x u)=Pr(x u in FG|I u(x u)) - Traditionally, a color model can be built using either color histograms or Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), each of which define their own formulae for computing the foreground probability denoted in the equation above.
- Snap-to-Edge Score: To address the visibility changes in the unknown view Su, in at least one embodiment, the unknown contour Cu is gravitated toward image edges as measured by a gradient function:
- Object Segmentation Score: Each closed contour curve Cj may define an interior and an exterior set of pixels for its image Ij. A foreground-background color model may be generated from the inputs Ij based on this segmentation. This probabilistic model may then be used to predict whether or not an unknown pixel xu belongs to the foreground (FG), i.e. the interior of the object-of-interest:
O(x j ,x u)=w pho O pho(x j ,x u)+w seg O seg(e j ,x u)+w edg O edg(x j ,x u)

T j(r,c)=T j(r,c)+min{T j(r−1,c−1)+η,T j(r−1,c),T j(r−1,c+1)+η} - Find the cell of smallest cost in the last row (row M). This may be the first solved point for Cu.
- Backtrace the solution by going from bottom-to-top in the table, at each step selecting the cell of minimum cost. Substituting the column that yields this minimum value in each row back into the epipolar equation may yield the remaining points for Cu.
- Compute:
-
- Unproject the point from 2-D to 3-D camera space using the pixel location and the depth map value; and
- Then reproject the point back to the desired camera image Iu and search along a range of pixels around that projected point.
