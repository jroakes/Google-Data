Definitions
- This document relates to advertising.
- Advertisements can be identified by one or more content servers in response to queries.
- the queries can, for example, include search engine queries.
- Such queries may not readily identify a particular context that is of interest to the user.
- the query “Blazers” could be used in a clothing context, an automobile context, a sports context, a pop-culture context, etc.
- advertisements or other content items related to the context of the query are not identified, then the advertisements may not reflect relevant content to a user.
- a user may be interested in a pop-culture context related to the term “Blazer,” but may receive advertisements relevant only to other contexts, such as a clothing and sports context, as advertisements related to these other contexts may be deemed more relevant by an advertisement serving engine.
- search results identified in response to a query are clustered according to context and the advertisements identified in response to the query are also clustered according to context.
- Each advertisement cluster is scored based on the advertisements in the cluster, and each search results cluster is also scored based on the search results in the cluster.
- Corresponding advertisement cluster scores and search result cluster scores are combined to determine a context score.
- the advertisements presented can be modified based on the context scores.
- one or more first groups of one or more first content items are identified.
- a first score is determined for each of the one or more first groups.
- One or more second groups of one or more second content items e.g., search results, are identified. At least one of the one or more second groups correspond to at least one of the one or more first groups.
- a second score is determined for each of the one or more second groups.
- a third score is determined for the first groups and the corresponding second group based on the first scores and second scores. An adjustment is made to a ranking of the one or more first content items based on the third scores.
- one or more first groups of one or more first content items are identified.
- One or more second groups of one or more second content items are identified.
- the one or more first content items in each of the first groups and the one or more second content items in each of the second groups are ranked.
- a determination is made on the evaluation as whether to modify the one or more first content items based on the ranking.
- one or more first content items e.g., advertisements
- One or more second content items e.g., web pages
- One or more first context clusters for each of the first content items are identified.
- One or more second context clusters for each of the second content items are identified.
- a score for each of the first context clusters and second context clusters is determined.
- a determination is made based on the evaluation as to whether to modify the one or more first content items based on a combined score of the one or more first context clusters and a corresponding second context cluster.
- one or more advertisements and one or more search results are identified.
- the one or more advertisements and one or more search results are each associated with a rank.
- One or more advertisements are mapped to one or more advertisement clusters. Advertisement scores that are substantially inversely proportional to a rank of the advertisements are assigned to each of the advertisements. Advertisement cluster scores are determined by adding the advertisement scores of the advertisements in each of the advertisement clusters together.
- the one or more search results are mapped to one or more search clusters.
- the search scores are assigned to each of the search results that are substantially inversely proportional to a rank of the search result.
- Search cluster scores are determined by adding the search scores of the search results in each of the search clusters together.
- a context score is determined by combining an advertisement cluster score and a corresponding search cluster score.
- the rank of the one or more advertisements is modified based on the context score.
- a system in another implementation, includes a clustering engine and a scoring engine.
- the clustering engine identifies one or more first groups of one or more first content items, e.g., advertisements, and identifies one or more second groups of one or more second content items, e.g., search results. At least one of the one or more second groups correspond to at least one of the one or more first groups.
- the scoring engine determines first scores for each of the one or more first groups, determines second scores for each of the one or more second groups, and determines third scores for the first groups and the corresponding second groups based on the first scores and second scores.
- the scoring engine can also adjust a ranking of the one or more first content items based on the third scores.
- the disclosed systems and methods can optionally realize one or more of the following advantages.
- Increasing targeted advertisements diversity to display advertisements with multiple topics can result in an optimization of advertisement consumption, as one of the multiple topics may correspond to a user's current interest.
- the advertisement selection process can be augmented by using context associated with a user to select advertisement contexts and can give users more options in a particular advertisement space. Updating a ranking process, e.g., ranking according to advertisement context and, if augmented, according to the user context, can cause the advertisement list to be reordered to optimize advertisement consumption.

- FIG. 7 is a schematic diagram of an example computer system that can be utilized to implement the systems and methods described herein.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an implementation of an online advertising system 100 .
- a computer network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 102 , an advertising system 104 , publishers 106 , and users 108 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet or a combination thereof
- one or more advertisers 102 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track advertisement (“ad”) information in an advertisement system 104 .
- the advertisements may be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, advertisements combining one of more of any of such components, etc.
- the advertisements may also include embedded information, such as links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more publishers 106 may submit requests for advertisements to the system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending advertisements (e.g., when an associated publication is rendered) to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content). While reference is made to advertisements, other content items can be provided by the system 104 .
- Other entities such as users 108 and the advertisers 102 , can provide usage information to the system 104 , such as, for example, whether a click-through related to an advertisement has occurred, whether a conversion has occurred, or whether some other defined event has occurred.
- usage information can be processed to measure performance metrics, such as click-through rates, conversion rates, etc.
- a click-through can occur, for example, when a user of a user device, selects or “clicks” on an advertisement.
- the click-through rate can be a performance metric that is obtained by dividing the number of users that clicked on the advertisement or a link associated with the advertisement by the number of times the advertisement was delivered. For example, if an advertisement is delivered 100 times, and three persons clicked on the advertisement, then the click-through rate for that advertisement is 3%.
- a “conversion” occurs when a user, for example, consummates a transaction related to a previously served advertisement. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. Alternatively, a conversion may be defined as a user being shown an advertisement, and making a purchase on the advertiser's web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days).
- a conversion may be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or web page, registering on a website, dialing a telephone number, sending a product or service inquiry, etc.
- an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or web page, registering on a website, dialing a telephone number, sending a product or service inquiry, etc.
- Other definitions of what constitutes a conversion are possible.
- a conversion rate can be defined as the ratio of the number of conversions to the number of impressions of the advertisement (i.e., the number of times an advertisement is rendered) or the ratio of the number of conversions to the number of selections (or the number of some other earlier event).
- the type of conversion rate can be apparent from the context in which it is used. If a conversion is defined to be able to occur within a predetermined time since the serving of an advertisement, one possible definition of the conversion rate might only consider advertisements that have been served more than the predetermined time in the past.
- usage information and/or performance metrics can also be used.
- the usage information and/or performance metrics can, for example, be revenue related or non-revenue related.
- the performance metrics can be parsed according to time, e.g., the performance of a particular content item may be determined to be very high on weekends, moderate on weekday evenings, but very low on weekday mornings and afternoons.
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served.
- the system 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- a publisher 106 is a content server (e.g., domain name registrar) that places content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.) on one or more domains.
- the domain registrar server may submit a request for advertisements to an advertisement server in the system 104 .
- the advertisement request may include a number of advertisements desired.
- the advertisement request may also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page or other content document
- category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- the content server can combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104 .
- This combined content and advertisements can be sent to the user 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can transmit information about the advertisements back to the advertisement server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- the advertising management system 104 can serve publishers 106 such as content servers.
- the system 104 permits serving of advertisements targeted to content (e.g., documents) served by content servers.
- content e.g., documents
- a network or inter-network may include an advertisement server serving targeted advertisements in response to requests from a content server with advertisement spots.
- the inter-network is the World Wide Web.
- One or more content servers may include one or more documents.
- Documents may include web pages, email, content, embedded information (e.g., embedded media), meta-information and machine executable instructions, and advertisement spots.
- the advertisements inserted into advertisement spots in a document can vary each time the document is served or, alternatively, can have a static association with a given document.
- the advertisement management system 104 may include an auction process to select advertisements. Advertisers may be permitted to select, or bid, an amount the advertisers are willing to pay for each click of an advertisement, e.g., a cost-per-click amount an advertiser pays when, for example, a user clicks on an advertisement.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay for each click of advertisement based on a keyword. For example, advertisers A, B, and C all select, or bid, a maximum cost-per-click of $0.50, $0.75, and $1.00, respectively.
- the maximum amount advertiser A will pay for a click is $0.50
- the maximum amount advertiser B will pay is $1.00
- the maximum amount advertiser C will pay is $0.75.
- the rank of an advertisement that is displayed can be determined by multiplying the maximum cost-per-click for the advertisement by a quality score of the advertisement.
- the advertisement can then be placed among other advertisements in order of increasing or decreasing rank. For example, suppose the quality score of advertisers A, B, and C are “3,” “1,” and “1,” respectively.
- the advertisers can be ranked as follows:
- An advertisement can also be associated with an actual cost-per-click.
- the actual cost-per-click of the advertisement can be determined by the maximum cost-per-click of the advertisement, quality score of the advertisement, and by the amount selected or bid by the advertiser directly below.
- the actual cost-per-click can be the price that is necessary to keep the advertisement's position above the next advertisement.
- the system 104 can determine how much the advertiser in position 1 would have to pay to give them a rank equal to the advertiser in position 2 , and then the system 104 adds a unit amount, e.g., $0.01, to this determined amount.
- the rank of position 2 can be divided by the quality score of position 1 and $0.01 can be added to that amount.
- the last advertiser in the list can pay a minimum cost-per-click to hold the position in the list. For example, suppose the minimum cost-per-click is $0.20.
- A would only have to pay $0.34 to hold the first position in the list of advertisements.
- C would have to pay $0.76 to hold the second position.
- Advertiser B would be required to pay the minimum cost-per-click amount of $0.20.
- Keywords that are associated with advertisements can also have a separate quality score.
- the keyword quality score can be the basis for measuring the quality and relevance of an advertisement and determining a minimum cost-per-click.
- the quality score can, for example, be determined by the advertisement's click-through rate, the relevance of the advertisement text, overall historical keyword performance, and the user experience on a landing page associated with the advertisement.
- a minimum cost-per-click can be determined for each advertisement, and can be based on quality of the advertisement.
- the minimum cost-per-click is the minimum amount the advertiser must pay for each advertisement, e.g., the minimum amount the advertiser must pay for use of a keyword.
- the system 104 can utilize a quality-based bidding auction that can determine a minimum cost per click bid requirement.
- a keyword's quality score can, for example, be based on the click-through rate and relevance of the keyword, the advertisement text, and the advertisement landing page.
- keywords having a low quality score which is indicative of a poorly performing keyword and/or likewise indicative of a poor user experience
- the minimum cost per click is increased. Accordingly, the poorly performing keywords can become inactive for an advertiser's account if the advertiser is not willing to pay the minimum cost per click.
- a high quality keyword has a lower minimum cost per click, and thus the higher quality keyword is used more often, enriching the user experience.
- a context can, for example, define a specific context of a query, web page, document, or content item.
- the query “jaguar” can have the following contexts: jaguar car, jaguar animal, or jaguar game system.
- a particular web page would generally be associated with one of the above general contexts.
- a context cluster can be defined by one or more content items, e.g., web pages, grouped under a similar context or topic.
- web pages related to “jaguar” in a sports context may define a cluster; web pages related to “jaguar” in a wildlife context may define a cluster; advertisements related to “jaguar” in a sports context may define a cluster; advertisements related to “jaguar” in a wildlife context may define a cluster, etc.
- a context score can, for example, be a value resulting from the combining of an advertisement cluster score and a corresponding content cluster score.
- the context score may be calculated by combining an advertisement score and the content score of a particular search query or web page.
- the advertisement score can be calculated to be substantially inversely proportional to a rank of the advertisements.
- context scores can be calculated by extracting, ranking, clustering, and/or scoring one or more similarities between topics within the content items or clusters. The context scores can be used to adjust advertisement rankings and/or advertisement presentations.
- the advertisement system 104 can augment the advertisement rankings based on context scores by utilizing data related to user-specific topics. For example, the advertisement system 104 can provide advertisements corresponding to information accessed from a user-accessed search query, web page, web log, profile, or other user-associated feature or context. In some implementations, providing a variety of user-specific advertisement topics can maximize the probability that the user will find some of the advertisements relevant.
- the advertisement system 104 can use context or content scores (e.g., in a user's search query or web page content) to maximize targeted advertisement diversity as well as display advertisements with topics that appropriately match a user's current context. For example, if a user search session indicates a sports context for the query “Jaguar,” then the advertisement system 104 may serve four advertisements in a sports context, two advertisements in a wildlife context, two advertisements in a pop-culture context, etc.
- context or content scores e.g., in a user's search query or web page content
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram of an example content scoring system 200 .
- the content scoring system 200 can, for example, be implemented in the advertisement system 104 utilizing one or more computing devices that include memory devices storing processing instructions and processing devices for executing the processing instructions.
- An example computing system is shown and described with reference to FIG. 7 . Other implementations, however, can also be used.
- one or more first groups e.g., clusters 212 , 214 , 216 and 218 of first content items 237 , e.g., content items 208 , 210 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 and 234 , such as advertisements, are identified.
- the advertisements can, for example, be identified in response to a search query.
- a first score 236 is determined for each of the one or more first groups 212 , 214 , 216 and 218 .
- one or more second groups e.g., clusters, for second content items 239 , e.g., search results, are also identified, and corresponding second scores 238 for each of the second groups are identified.
- the search results can also be identified in response to the search query.
- Clusters for the first content items 237 and the second content items 239 can correspond by being associated with the same context or topic.
- first content items e.g., web page search results related to “jaguar” in a sports context may define a first group.
- Second content items e.g., advertisements related to “jaguar” in the sports context may define a corresponding second group.
- a third score 240 is determined for each of the first groups and a corresponding second group based on the first scores 236 and second scores 238 .
- An adjustment is made to a ranking of the one or more first content items 208 , 210 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 and 234 based on the third scores.
- the score for the “jaguar” advertisement cluster of the sports context and the score for the “jaguar” search results cluster of the sports context can be used to generate a third score related to a sports context.
- scores for other context clusters can also be used to generate other third scores.
- These thirds scores can be used to diversify the presentation of first content items 237 , e.g., advertisements, with the second content items 239 , e.g., search results.
- the content scoring system 200 can score content items by comparing search results with advertising content from system 104 , for example.
- the content scoring system 200 can determine content scores for the search results and the advertising content related to a search query.
- the content scores can be used to generate context scores that are used to rank the content items according to context similarities. For example, when a search query results in a variety of distinct topics identified by a search engine, the content scoring system 200 can provide relevant and contextually ranked advertisements to the user by diversifying the advertisements based on the distinct topics. In other words, the content scoring system 200 can match advertisement topics with search results, and further can implement a scoring/ranking mechanism that will provide the user with one or more diversified advertisements.
- the ranking can provide a diversified selection of advertisements. For example, rather than serving advertisements that are deemed most relevant to search query, the content scoring system 200 can use the ranking information to include advertisements for some of the other contexts in appropriately ranked positions.
- the content scoring system 200 can identify resulting clusters that define topic contexts, e.g., sports, wildlife, pop-culture, etc.
- the content scoring system 200 can deem the search results clusters as currently relevant for whomever/wherever the search query was performed.
- system 200 can use the content scores of each content item in each cluster to generate corresponding cluster scores to ensure the ranked list of scored advertisement clusters reflects the ranked list of scored search result clusters.
- the content scoring system 200 can re-rank one or more ranked advertisement lists based on cluster scores. To illustrate, suppose a search query for “Italian restaurants” is entered into a search engine.
- System 200 can use the search results created from the query “Italian restaurants” and the advertisements created from the query “Italian restaurants” to generate topic clusters for the advertisements and search results.
- the topic clusters can be scored, and the resulting cluster scores can be used to provide advertisements that not only relate to Italian restaurants, but also advertisements that relate to other restaurants, restaurant coupons, Italy vacations, other entertainment categories, etc.
- the first column search results
- the second column undiversified advertisements
- the third column diversified advertisements
- the third scores can be used to adjust the ranking of set of advertisements responsive to a query to present advertisements related to different topics.
- Such diversification can thus increase the likelihood that a user may select an advertisement.
- the user that submitted a query to a search engine that resulted in the search results of Table 1 may not be interested in a sports topic, but may instead be interested in a fashion topic.
- the list of undiversified advertisements do not include any fashion-related advertisements.
- the diversified list of advertisements does include fashion related advertisements that may be of interest to the user.
- search results and advertisements Although only ten search results and advertisements are shown, the clustering, scoring and ranking of content items can be carried out on an entire set of search results and advertisements identified in response to a query. Fewer or more search results and/or advertisements can be shown.
- the content scoring system 200 can, for example, score web page content.
- content such as a web page related to mp3 player reviews, may have many contexts (e.g., context based on brand names, or generic descriptors, such as “media player,” etc.) with which content scoring 200 can score and/or rank.
- the score and rank can be used to determine which advertisements are significantly relevant to a particular website.
- the rank can be based on one or more context or content scores created by system 100 , 200 , or another system, for example.
- the content scoring system 200 can, for example, include a clustering engine 202 , a scoring engine 204 , and a content item data store 206 .
- the content item data store 206 can comprise a unitary data store, such as a hard drive.
- the content data store 206 can comprise a distributed data store, such as a storage system that is distributed over a network. Other implementations, however, can also be used.
- the content data store 206 can, for example, store one or more advertisements. Each advertisement in the content data store 206 can be associated with one or more performance metrics, e.g., click-through rates, and auction metrics, e.g., cost-per-clicks, etc.
- the scoring engine 204 can determine ranking metrics for content items such as advertisements, e.g., content items 208 , 210 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 , according to corresponding context clusters, e.g., clusters 212 , 214 , 216 and 218 .
- scoring engine 204 is described as providing ranking metrics and scoring metrics, system 200 can call upon engine 202 , engine 204 , or another software and/or hardware entity to perform any or all of the disclosed tasks.
- the clustering engine 202 can, for example, identify similarities within various groups of content items.
- the similar groups of content items 208 , 210 can be stored in the context cluster 212 .
- Each context cluster (e.g., cluster 212 , 214 , 216 , and 218 ) can include one or more content items.
- the clustering engine 202 can, for example, cluster content items 208 and 210 in the context cluster 212 by identifying that the content items are generally related to one another by topic, genre, category, or other context.
- the context clusters for advertisements of search results pages can be pre-computed by a page classifier.
- the context clusters for advertisements can be computed at run-time.
- the clustering engine 202 can, for example, identify and/or receive the content items in response to a search query. For example, the clustering engine 202 can identify relevant advertisements based on user entered search terms. In some implementations, the clustering engine 202 can, for example, identify one or more clusters 212 , 214 , 216 , 218 based on web page content associated with the advertisements. For example, the identified content items 208 , 210 can be grouped into cluster 212 based on their context in a landing page associated with the advertisement, e.g., pages on an advertiser website that a user is directed to when the user clicks an advertisement.
- the clustering engine 202 can group content items 224 , 226 into cluster 216 ; content items 228 , 230 into cluster 214 ; content items 232 , 234 into cluster 218 , and so on.
- Other clustering techniques can also be used.
- clustering engine 202 can generate a cluster score for a content item cluster based on content item scores of the content items, e.g., scoring ranks 220 and 222 of the content items 208 and 210 .
- the scoring engine 204 can rank content items according to relevancy for a particular topic, context, or available advertisement, for example.
- the ranks 220 and 222 can, for example, be determined by advertisement system 104 , or the content scoring system 200 , or another system.
- a similar clustering and ranking process can be used to identify cluster scores for second content items 239 , such as search results, and generate corresponding second scores 238 .
- the corresponding clusters for the first and second content items 237 and 239 and the first and second scores 236 and 238 can be used to generate third scores 240 , as will be described below.
- the third scores are used to adjust a raking and/or presentation of the first content items, e.g., advertisements.
- FIG. 2B is a block diagram of the ranking and scoring logic 203 of the content scoring system 200 .
- the scoring logic 203 can be implemented in the clustering engine 202 and scoring engine 204 of FIG. 2A .
- the scoring engine 204 can, for example, determine the first scores 236 , the second scores 238 , and the third scores 240 .
- search results 250 that are responsive to a query: (1) SR —1 ; (2) SR —2 ; (3) SR —3 ; (4) SR —4 ; (5) SR —5 ; (6) SR — 6; (7) SR — 7; (8) SR — 8; (9) SR — 9; and (10) SR_k.
- Each search result SR and advertisement AD can have an associated ranking.
- each SR and AD can have a ranking value that represents the ranking of the corresponding search result and advertisement in response to the query.
- the advertisements could be presented according to their respective rankings, e.g., as similarly illustrated by the columns “Search Results” and “Undiversified Advertisements” of Table 1. However, to diversify the advertisement presentation, the advertisements may be re-ranked and/or selected according to the advertisement contexts and the search result contexts.
- the clustering engine 202 can identify search result clusters 256 and advertisement clusters 254 .
- K-means and singular value decomposition (SVD) clustering techniques can be used to generate the clusters 254 and 256 .
- Other clustering techniques can also be used.
- the scoring engine 204 can generate a corresponding content score for each search result SR and advertisement AD that is substantially inversely proportional to the corresponding ranking of the search result or advertisement. These content scores can be summed to generate the first scores 236 and the second scores 238 .
- weight_search_results and weight_ads represents the importance of the search results clusters and ad clusters.
- the weight_search_results and weight_ads can be calculated through experimentation to determine which weight_search_results and weight_ads to use in the calculation. For example, the weight_search_results and weight_ads can be calculated based on a statistical analysis of advertisement click-through rates as the variables weight_search_results and weight_ads are adjusted during a testing period. The variables weight_search_results and weight_ads that maximize overall click-through rates can then be selected. Other evaluation techniques can also be used.
- the third scores 240 can, for example, be used to rank the clusters according to relevancy for a particular user.
- advertisements in contexts that were under-represented (or not represented at all) in the original ranking 252 can be displayed according to the adjusted advertisement ranking 260 (e.g., the diversified advertisements column of Table 1).
