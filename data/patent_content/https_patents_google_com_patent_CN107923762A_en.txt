The action that border would generally take.By learning and modeling action for different contexts, prediction module 164 can be generated for pre-
The one or more rule for the action that the user of measurement and calculation 110 takes for specific context.
For example, it is directed to different contexts using on the user from computing device 110 and the user of other computing devices
Calculating can be guessed or be inferred to the rule generation prediction module 164 for the relevant past observing of action taken, prediction module 164
What the user of device 110 does for specific context.As an example, prediction module 164 can be inferred that when calculating
User's just " working of driving " or " commuting is gone home " just when being moved along specific route of travel the specific date of device 110.As
Another example, prediction module 164 can be determined when computing device 110 is located at the parlor of user with winter in afternoon on Sunday in the fall
User is watching specific sport broadcast when middle.As another example, prediction module 164 can be predicted when computing device 110 exists
User is sleeping when being static in the late into the night or longer period early in the morning.And as another example, prediction module 164 can
With prediction, when computing device 100, the user when airport is linear upright is being moved through safety check door.
In addition, by learning and modeling action for different contexts, prediction module 164 can be generated to be calculated for predicting
Whether the user of device 110 can cause the user of computing device 110 in future for the current action that current context is being taken
One or more ancillary rules of successful execution future-action in context.The one or more ancillary rules can be led to output indication
Cross execution current action, user whether remain able to be successfully executed future-action possibility degree (for example, score, probability,
Value etc.).Prediction module 164 can be by the possibility degree exported from one or more ancillary rules and one or more threshold value
It is compared, and if possible property degree meets that instruction user will be unable to perform the threshold value of future-action, then prediction module 164
The notice data for warning its potential failure or following mistake to user can be exported.
According to the technology of the disclosure, ISS 160 can be detected and be attempted correction may be huge to the life of user generation
The user error of influence.For example, ISS 160 may infer that the expected following destination of the user of computing device 110, then,
It was observed that the instruction user of the position and movement track of the user of computing device 110 can not actually reach expected following destination
Change, intervene and warn its latent fault to user.
Consider that the user of computing device 110 plans time in early morning in the specific date from the example field in london to Zurich
Scape.The electronic calendar or confirmation Email received by computing device 110 can indicate that the flight is predefined in the morning 7:10
Take off.In a worst case scenario, user accidentally may close alarm clock in day early morning of taking off, and as a result sleep too late so that nothing
Method arrives at the airport and takes flight on time.And non-permitted user gets up late and potentially misses flight, according to the technology of the disclosure,
ISS 160 can predict that user slept on the same day of taking off and will notify data sending to computing device 110 so that meter automatically
Device 110 is calculated to user's warning and wake-up user takes flight in time.
In operation, for example, taking the calendar of computing device 110 to warn the user of computing device 110 to wake up in time
On flight, ISS 160 can pre- measurement and calculation 110 the future-action to be taken of user.For example, prediction module 164 can
Periodically or occasionally to inquire about the following context of computing device 110 to context module 162.In response to from prediction module
164 inquiry, context module 162 can be based on the context informations received from computing device 110 (for example, day as described above
Go through information, the communication information or other context informations) determine the following context of computing device 110 and by the future context
Send to prediction module 164.
Based on the following context received from context module 162, prediction module 164 can by using machine learning or
Infer that user gives the future-action that the future context may be taken based on the system of Else Rule.For example, in response to connecing
The user for receiving instruction computing device 110 will be in morning 6:Before 00 the morning 7 is taken positioned at airport:The future of 10 flights left
Context, the machine learning of prediction module 164 or system based on Else Rule can the user of pre- measurement and calculation 110 will be
Morning 5：30, which set out, goes to the airport to drive 30 minutes to airport.
ISS 160 can determine current action that user takes based on the context information associated with computing device 110,
And determine whether user can take the possibility degree of future-action based on the current action.For example, it is contemplated that arrive prediction
Module 164 may expect the user of computing device 110 in morning 5:Start to march to airport before 30, prediction module 164 can be with
In morning 5:Whether 00 information that the current context on computing device 110 is inquired about to context module 162 is gone on definite user
The right path starts to perform the expected action for marching to airport in time to take flight.The current context determined by context module 162 can
To indicate to lack the movement associated with computing device at the home location of user, and can be simulated to prediction module 164
The Move Mode (or lacking Move Mode) that user may sleep.
ISS 160 can determine whether user can take the possibility degree (example of future-action based on current action
Such as, probability, score, binary value etc.).In order to facilitate above-mentioned example, prediction module 164 can be by current action (for example, sleeping
Feel), future-action is (for example, in morning 5：30, which set out, goes to the airport), current context and following context be input to and calculated for predicting
Whether the user of device 110 will cause the user of computing device 110 in future for the current action that current context is being taken
It is successfully executed in context in the one or more rule of future-action.
ISS 160 can predict that user will not be able to take future-action based on possibility degree, and in response,
It will cause user that the information of future-action can not be taken to send to computing device 110 current action that instruction user is taken.Example
Such as, prediction module 164 can by the possibility degree exported from one or more ancillary rules and one or more threshold value into
Row compares.If possible property degree meets threshold value (if for example, user is currently sleeping, if one or more rules are given
Go out user and set out the probability gone to the airport on time more than 50%), then prediction module 164 can be logical to avoid being exported to computing device 110
Primary data.On the contrary, if possible property degree is unsatisfactory for threshold value (if for example, user is currently sleeping, if one or more
Rule provides user and sets out the probability gone to the airport on time less than 50%), then prediction module 164 can be exported for being warned to user
Its potential failure or the notice data of following mistake.Prediction module 164 can learn and tune by machine learning and be based on
The threshold value that the system time-out of rule uses, its fallible probability is informed the user to improve.
In some instances, prediction module 164 can by response to current time in the threshold time of future time
And reduce possibility degree and in response to determine current time not in the threshold time of future time without reduce possibility
Degree or increase possibility degree, to determine whether user can take the possibility degree of future-action.For example, prediction mould
Block 164 can may exit off current location with the half of the departure time at the latest to arrive at the airport before arrival time at the latest in user
Determine that user is sleeping in the threshold amount of time of hour.In response to determining that user is sleeping in half an hour threshold value, predict
Module 164 can reduce the possibility that the user of computing device 110 is able to carry out future-action and leaves on time.In response to true
Determine user sleeping outside half an hour threshold value, prediction module 164 can increase computing device 110 to avoid reduction or even
The possibility that user is able to carry out future-action and leaves on time.
Computing device 110 will be unable to perform the logical of future-action in response to the instruction user for determining possibility degree and exporting
Primary data can make 110 loud jingle bell of computing device or sound the alarm to call out once being received by computing device 110
Wake up user.In some instances, computing device 110 can connect the notice of lamp, TV or other forms to wake up use
Family.In some instances, notice data can be such that notification module 122 is used by the figure that UI modules 120 are exported at UID112
Family interface, leaves to notify user to wake up on time.In other words, ISS 160 can be by notice data sending to computing device
110 so that when the user of computing device 110 has early morning flight and user fails to move initially towards airport, calculate dress
Put 110 and warn (for example, by producing audible alarm) to user on one's own initiative as follows：User is signaled, until
Computing device 110 detect user interacted with computing device 110 untill (for example, hear, watch as user,
Or feel the instruction of alarm).
Therefore, when the user of computing device is from the exemplary computing system receive information for performing technique described herein, use
Family, which is less likely to continue to execute, may lead to not the dynamic of the future-action that execution system expectation user takes in following context
Make.On the contrary, example system can infer that user may make a mistake automatically, and inform the user its potential failure.
In this manner it is achieved that with being provided solely for prompting and access information but still user's entrance can be allowed to cause it
Direction that daily life is made a mistake or take the action that its daily life may be caused to make a mistake other computing devices and system not
Together, example system takes additional steps to ensure that mistake is avoided by and actually realizes associated not with prompting and information
To act.Even if user does not know that it is being made a mistake, but example system will automatically provide information to guide user to avoid to keep away
Exempt to make a mistake.
Therefore, for user even without knowing that it is making a mistake, computing system can be in the absence of user input
It is inferred to whether user needs to take corrective action to current action.User can be subjected to the pressure of smaller, and spend less
Time leads to future-action along erroneous path and spends less time trimming process to avoid making a mistake.By earlier and
It is not to correct latent fault later, example system can enable computing device from search information to attempt to correct or correct
The user of mistake receives less input.Potential failure is corrected using less input, is carried with only providing a user reception
Wake up or other systems of the ability of search information are compared, example system can enable computing device save energy and use
Less electricity.

In the threshold time of time (for example, being less than) and increase possibility degree.For example, even if prediction module 164 can determine to pass through
Take the path 304B of through position 302B, the user of computing device 310 certainly will in-position 303 on time.
In different examples, when computing device 310 is moved along the track of path 304D towards position 302C, ISS
160 context module 162 can detect the movement associated with computing device 310, and will be associated with computing device 310
The current context of renewal send to prediction module 164.Prediction module 164 can by current time towards position 302C rows
Come in determine computing device 310 user whether can before future time in-position 303 possibility degree.For example,
Prediction module 164 can determine marching to position 302C from position 301 while continuing on it on the track of path 304D
The user of computing device 310 reaches the arrival time of the estimation of Future Positions 303 afterwards.Prediction module 164 can be in response to determining
The arrival time of estimation is not in threshold time (for example, outside the tolerance of acceptable arrival time at position 303, to use
Family reaches on time) and reduce possibility degree.For example, prediction module 164 can determine to take the path of through position 302C
304D, the user of computing device 310 certainly cannot in-position 303 on time.User in response to determining computing device 310 very may be used
It will not can reach on time, prediction module 164 can send information to computing device 310 to continue on path to user's warning
The latent fault that 304D advances.
In addition to alerting its latent fault to user, prediction module 164 can also determine that user can be taken to increase

Fig. 4 be a diagram that according to the disclosure one or more in terms of the user by being configured to pre- measurement and calculation
Whether the flow chart of exemplary operations 410 to 420 that the exemplary computing system of future-action perform can be taken.Hereafter Fig. 1's
Fig. 4 is described in the context of system 100.For example, according to one or more aspect of the disclosure, ISS 160 can perform behaviour
Whether make the user of 410 to 420 computing devices 110 can take future-action, and provide to computing device 110 be used for
Whether family warning can take the information of future-action on prediction user.
As shown in figure 4, in operation, ISS 160 can pre- measurement and calculation 410 the future-action to be taken of user
(410).For example, the context module 162 of ISS 160 can receive the instruction computing device 110 associated with computing device 110
User usually watches the context information of the program of scheduling, and the user for generating definition computing device 110 watches the section of the scheduling
The following context of the following broadcast of purpose.Prediction module 162 can receive the instruction to following context, and predict that user will be not
Carry out the program of time viewing scheduling.
ISS 160 can determine current action that user takes based on the context information associated with computing device 110
(412).For example, context module 162 can receive data via network 130, the user of data instruction computing device 110 is
Navigated via some of web browser or graphic user interface other forms using computing device 110 and be directed to and row with renting
Pay-per-view (PPV) broadcast of the sport event of the identical future time arrangement of the program of journey, and generate and computing device 110
The associated current context for defining user and watching graphic user interface.Prediction module 164 can be from the reception pair of context module 162
The instruction of current context, and predict that user just buys or rent PPV broadcast for future time.
ISS 160 can determine whether user can take the possibility degree of future-action based on current action
(414).For example, prediction module 164 can will watch scheduling program future-action and purchase PPV broadcast current action it is defeated
Enter into the one or more rule of machine learning system, and receive on by buying whether PPV programs user is more likely to
Or it can unlikely watch the instruction conduct output of the possibility degree of the program of its scheduling usually watched.Since PPV is saved
Mesh can be run within the time started or at the end between before start, it is possible that property degree may it is very low (for example,
10%).
ISS 160 can determine whether possibility degree meets threshold value (416).Prediction module 162 can determine possibility
Degree not high enough (for example, more than 90%) is to being enough to indicate that user is able to carry out not if user continues to execute current action
To act.
ISS 160 can predict that user will be unable to take future-action (418) based on possibility degree.In response to determining
Possibility degree is not high enough (for example, more than 90%), and prediction module 162 can determine that user will be unable to the program of viewing scheduling.
The information for causing user and can not taking future-action can be sent out current action that instruction user is taken by ISS 160
Send to computing device 110 (420).For example, before the purchase that user completes PPV programs, computing device 110 can be from prediction mould
Block 162 receives the information that instruction purchase PPV programs may be inconsistent with the ability for the program for watching scheduling, and to UID 112
The alarm of output indication such case.
There are pre- measurement and calculation 110 user current action whether the ISS compatible with the future-action of the user
160 some other examples.For example, ISS 160 can determine user interacted with computing device 110 with buy will with it is another
Event it is overlapping and prevent participate in user's booking another event an event ticket, and make computing device 110 to
User alerts latent fault.ISS 160 is it is known that more than event start time and dwell time are for definite potential punching
It is prominent.For example, the rule of prediction module 164 can from the previous observation learning of other users of other computing devices to, although
It is in special time between at the beginning of event, but the reserved seat of event opening for 15 minutes before the actual time started
Put, and event is in if participant cannot shift to an earlier date 15 minutes, make a reservation and other event participants are opened.Cause
This, is even if the formal starting and end time of two events is not overlapping, if the end time of more early event and event
" unofficial " time started (for example, making a reservation the time) is overlapping, then ISS 160 can be alerted to the user of computing device 110
Ordering the tickets of the two events, there are potential conflict.
Fig. 5 be a diagram that according to the disclosure one or more in terms of exemplary computing system such as Fig. 1 ISS 160
Whether the user of the computing device of the computing device 110 of such as Fig. 1 is predicted with the ISS 260 of Fig. 2 can take future-action
The concept map of example time shaft 500.Fig. 5 is described in the context of Fig. 1 to Fig. 4.
The example time shaft of Fig. 5 is followed in time tSWith tFBetween the following scene that occurs.The user of computing device 110 can
Can just it fly to New York from city of London.As many big city area, city of London has more than one International airport.Though
Usually from airport, B's right user flies out, but in the example of hgure 5, user is in time tsReceive on its order from the A of airport
The email confirmation of winged flight.
Time shaft 500 is divided into time tsWith t1Between planning stage early stage, in time t1With t2Between later stage
Planning stage and in time t2With tFBetween the execution stage.During early stage and planning stage in later stage, ISS 160 can be looked into
Seeing not necessarily includes the context information of the mobile message for future-action, can be forbidden with predicting when user may do
Some things of the execution of the future-action.
For example, as shown in time shaft 500, context module 162 can be in time tFFlight is made a reservation for take off record from airport A
In the following context history associated with the user of computing device 110.During planning stage early stage of time shaft 500, meter
The search inquiry for the navigation way guide that the user of device 110 can be inputted to airport B is calculated, later, can be initially towards airport B
It is mobile.Because planning stage early stage is not close enough in time with performing the stage, ISS 160 can determine to pass through search engine
B drives to go to the airport party B-subscriber and may make the wrong possibility journey that user may be prevented to take a flight at the A of airport
Spend relatively low.ISS 160 can be to avoid any potential conflict of the output indication between the current action of user and expected action
Alarm.
During the planning stage in later stage of time shaft 500, the user of computing device 110 can input the navigation to airport B
The search inquiry of route guiding, later, can move initially towards airport B.Because the planning stage in later stage with perform the stage when
Between on be closer to, so some actions can be regarded as being likely to hindering the future-action to take off from airport A by ISS 160.
For example, ISS 160, which can receive instruction user, is searching for the context information that the navigation way of airport B guides, at this time, response
In the afoul search inquiry of desired path or destination with airport A, ISS 160 can determine to use by searching for airport B
It is higher that family may make the wrong possibility degree that user may be prevented to take a flight at the A of airport.When user is soon
When the desired location in future is airport A, ISS 160 can search for the current action of the route guiding of airport B with output indication user
There are the alarm of potential conflict therewith.
ISS 160 can receive the context information that instruction user is being advanced towards airport B, at this time, although will arrive
The airport of destination B reached conflicts with desired path or airport of destination A phases, but there is user the sufficient time to march to machine
B and A is still gone to the airport, therefore ISS 160 can determine violate by marching to airport party B-subscriber prevent to use
The wrong possibility degree that family takes a flight at the A of airport is relatively low.ISS 160 can be to avoid output indication user when user's
Desired location marches to the current action of airport B when being airport A there are the alarm of potential conflict therewith.
During the execution stage, compared with other types of context information, ISS 160 can rely more heavily on computing device
110 movement (or more weights are given to it), to infer that user is possible to violate user may be prevented to take expected act
Mistake still may not make mistakes.ISS160 can determine to calculate dress based on the context information associated with computing device 110
110 are put to be along moving towards the track of airport B.ISS 160 can be by the position of the current track of computing device 110 and airport A
Put, the position of airport B and other users usually mistake other potential sites of airport A and B and be compared.In response to determining
The path of computing device 110 is with airport B (for example, airport B is the position identical with the Future Positions type being associated with future-action
Put) it is closest or be likely to intersect with airport B, ISS 160 can pre- measurement and calculation 110 user driving before
Toward airport B.Driving it is expected user to drive to go to the airport when A takes flight in response to the user of definite computing device 110
B is gone to the airport, ISS 160 can sound the alarm to the transmission triggering computing device 110 of computing device 110 or output indication is used
Just potentially drive to go to some other tactiles, vision or the data of audible alarm on wrong airport in family.
Although different " airport " may mistakenly be searched for or navigated towards it by described example as user
The first and second position of example, but there are other examples position.For example, when it is expected that user reaches the second place, Yong Huke
With the current action for performing search first position or navigating to first position, wherein, first position and the second place are specific
The diverse location of type transportation service (for example, bus stop, railway station, airport, marine station etc.).In other examples,
One position and the second place can be different each offices of single commercial undertaking (for example, identical coffee or fast food
Two different positions of chain store, two different positions, department stores of the cinema of similar brand etc.).Show other
In example, the first and second positions can be two different states or different each cities of country.In other examples,
One and the second place can be shared two different cities, state or country identical street address different each things
Manage position.
In this manner it is achieved that be provided solely for reminding and access information but still user can be allowed into route guiding or
Person takes the other computing devices for the action that its daily life may be caused to make a mistake different with system, and example system takes extra step
It is rapid to ensure that mistake is avoided by and actually realizes the future-action associated with prompting and information.Even if user does not know
It is being made a mistake, but example system will automatically provide information and be made a mistake with guiding user to return.
For example, example system can detect when user is searched for the thing incompatible with daily life, and
The alarm that potential incompatibility is alerted to user is triggered at computing device.Other examples include：When detection user advances
To the appointment position (that is, going to errors present) of mistake, search, either purchase or be able to will take current with user
The incompatible medicine of medicine, search for winery when system has deduced that user should not drink, buy mistake to previously shopping
The error section of adapter is bought, orders itinerary with inconsistent date or position etc..
Therefore, for user even without knowing that it is making a mistake, computing system can be in the absence of user input
It is inferred to whether user needs to take corrective action to current action.User can be subjected to the pressure of smaller, and spend less
Time leads to future-action along erroneous path and spends less time trimming process to avoid making a mistake.By earlier and
It is not to correct latent fault later, example system can enable computing device from search information to attempt to correct or correct
The user of mistake receives less input.Potential failure is corrected using less input, is carried with only providing a user reception
Wake up or other systems of the ability of search information are compared, example system can enable computing device save energy and use
Less electricity.
