Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in transporting passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- a manual mode where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle

- FIGS. 4A-4D illustrate example data associated with a cyclist.
- FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram illustrating a conceptual partial view of an example computer program.
- human drivers can make driving decisions based on a variety of properties of a current traffic situation in the environment of the driver's vehicle, such as the positions and velocities of other cars, cyclists and pedestrians, the state of traffic lights, and human hand/arm gestures. Similar decision making may be desirable for autonomous vehicles as well.
- methods and devices for an autonomous vehicle to detect hand signals of cyclists that are in the vicinity of the autonomous vehicle are described.
- An example computing device may be configured to receive a plurality of data points corresponding to an environment of the autonomous vehicle.
- the plurality of data points may be obtained by one or more cameras and/or sensors.
- the plurality of data points may take the form of a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud obtained by laser scanners (e.g., LIDAR sensors).
- the computing device may then be configured to determine one or more subsets of data points that are indicative of at least a body region of a cyclist within the vicinity of the autonomous vehicle.
- the body region of the cyclist may include at least an upper-body region of the cyclist, such as the head, hands, and arms of the cyclist.
- the one or more subsets of data points may vary depending on the posture of the cyclist and the distance and angle at which the cyclist is detected by the autonomous vehicle's sensors.
- the computing device may also be configured to determine an expected adjustment of one or more of a speed of the cyclist and a direction of travel of the cyclist based on a comparison of the one or more subsets with one or more predetermined sets of cyclist signals.
- the one or more predetermined sets of cycling signals may include training sets of data points built from other autonomous vehicles detecting cyclists in various scenarios. For instance, each particular set of cycling signals can be classified and labeled by the computing device based on various features, such as identifying features of a cyclist (e.g., an average height of a cyclist while travelling on a road) and an activity of the cyclist that the particular set of cycling signals is associated with (e.g., whether the cyclist is providing a hand signal or not, and what type of hand signal the cyclist is providing).
- identifying features of a cyclist e.g., an average height of a cyclist while travelling on a road
- an activity of the cyclist that the particular set of cycling signals is associated with e.g., whether the cyclist is providing a hand signal or not, and what
- features may take the form of labeled feature vectors which may be determined using a clustering algorithm or other type of algorithm.
- the labeled feature vectors can then be compared with the one or more subsets by the computing device in order to determine a probability distribution of what signal the cyclist is providing, if any signal at all.
- the expected adjustment of the speed and/or direction of travel of the detected cyclist can be determined based on what signal the cyclist is providing. For instance, a detected left turn hand signal may be associated with an expected decrease in speed of the cyclist and an expected leftward steering of the cyclist.
- the computing device may determine (and/or make changes to) or operate according to a decision tree based on labeled feature vectors. Such a decision tree may be implemented by the computing device in order to determine how closely the one or more subsets match the one or more predetermined sets of cycling signals.
- the first decision of the decision tree may be, for instance, whether the environment of the vehicle includes a cyclist or not.
- the computing device may determine a confidence score associated with each possible cyclist signal, or associated with whether there is a cyclist in the vicinity of the autonomous vehicle in general.
- Other classification and/or clustering algorithms are possible as well, and may include one or more supervised and unsupervised learning-based algorithms.
- the computing device may be configured to provide instructions to adjust one or more of a speed of the autonomous vehicle and a direction of travel of the autonomous vehicle based on the expected adjustment. For instance, if a cyclist travelling directly in front of the autonomous vehicle provides a slow/stop signal, the cyclist will be expected to either slow his or her speed or come to a stop, and thus the instructions may comprise a decrease in speed of the autonomous vehicle, among other possible adjustments to the autonomous vehicle.
- An example vehicle control system may be implemented in or may take the form of an automobile.
- a vehicle control system may be implemented in or take the form of other vehicles, such as cars, trucks, bicycles, motorcycles, buses, boats, airplanes, helicopters, lawn mowers, recreational vehicles, amusement park vehicles, farm equipment, construction equipment, trams, golf carts, trains, and trolleys. Other vehicles are possible as well.
- an example system may take the form of a non-transitory computer-readable medium, which has program instructions stored thereon that are executable by at least one processor to provide the functionality described herein.
- An example system may also take the form of an automobile or a subsystem of an automobile that includes such a non-transitory computer-readable medium having such program instructions stored thereon.

Classification of the one or more subsets of data points associated with the autonomous vehicle may be performed using one or more machine learning algorithms and statistical classification algorithms.
- a set of classes e.g., left or right hand signal
- Classification of the one or more subsets of data points associated with the autonomous vehicle may be performed using one or more machine learning algorithms and statistical classification algorithms.
- Example algorithms may include linear classifiers (e.g., Fisher's linear discriminant, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and perceptron), support vector machines (e.g., least squares support vector machines), clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means clustering), quadratic classifiers, multi-class classifiers, kernel estimation (e.g., k-nearest neighbor), boosting, decision trees (e.g., random forests), neural networks, Gene Expression Programming, Bayesian networks, hidden Markov models, binary classifiers, and learning vector quantization. Other example classification algorithms are also possible.
- linear classifiers e.g., Fisher's linear discriminant, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and perceptron
- support vector machines e.g., least squares support vector machines
- clustering algorithms e.g., k-means clustering
- quadratic classifiers e.g., multi-class classifiers
- kernel estimation e.g., k
- the process of the classification may involve the computing device determining, based on the output of the comparison of the one or more subsets with the one or more predetermined sets of cycling signals, a probability distribution (e.g., a Gaussian distribution) of possible hand signals associated with the one or more subsets.
- a probability distribution e.g., a Gaussian distribution
- Such a probability distribution may take the form of a discrete probability distribution, continuous probability distribution, and/or mixed continuous-discrete distributions. Other types of probability distributions are possible as well.
- the probability distribution of possible hand signals may include respective probabilities assigned to each class.
- the one or more subsets of data points may include a 70% probability that the cyclist is providing a right hand turn signal and a 30% probability that the cyclist is providing no hand turn signal.
- the computing device may identify one or more candidate hand signals (e.g., classes) whose assigned probabilities exceed a probability threshold. The computing device may then select a hand signal from the one or more candidate hand signals. For instance, in the example just provided, the probability threshold may be 60%, and thus the computing device may select a right hand turn signal as the most likely hand signal provided by the cyclist. Other probability thresholds are possible as well.
- multiple classes may exceed a given probability threshold, and such examples, the class with the highest assigned probability may be selected.
- the computing device may determine a classification of the one or more subsets of data points to be inconclusive. Other scenarios are also possible.
- the computing device may output a confidence value associated with one or more of the classes. Other means of determining which hand signal, if any, is being provided are possible as well.
- the computing device may store a given label associated with the determined class for the plurality of data points.
- the plurality of data points may then become part of the training data which may be used for future determinations of cyclists and cyclist hand signals.
- the computing device may identify patterns using the machine learning algorithm to optimize cyclist hand signal detection, and/or cyclist detection in general.
- the machine learning algorithm may indicate that an average cyclist is about three meters tall (e.g., from the road to the top of the cyclists' head while the cyclist is moving, and/or from the road to the top of the cyclist's head while the cyclist is stationary and at least partially standing with their vehicle), a respective height of a given cyclist being a possible feature vector utilized by the computing device (e.g., by the machine learning algorithm) to identify the average cyclist height.
- such identified patterns may be used to determine, update, and/or verify the classes. For example, if the computing device has determined using the machine learning algorithm that a cyclist averages a height of three meters tall, and the computing device has determined, based on the one or more subsets of data points, that no object in the autonomous vehicle's environment is about three meters tall, the computing device may conclude that there is no cyclist in the autonomous vehicle's environment.
- each of the one or more predetermined sets of cycling signals may include a respective distance from a left hand of a cyclist to a head of the cyclist and further include a respective distance from a right hand of that cyclist to the head of that cyclist.
- the computing device may determine a first distance from the left hand of the cyclist to the head of the cyclist and a second distance from the right hand of the cyclist to the head of the cyclist.
- the computing device may then compare the first and second distances with a pattern (e.g., average distance from hands-to-head) determined from the training data in order to classify the plurality of data points. For instance, a shorter distance from the cyclist's hand(s) to the cyclist's head may indicate a left or right hand turn signal, while a longer distance may indicate a slow/stop turn signal. Other example patterns are possible as well.
- the output of the comparison may be determined by a device configured to classify received pluralities of data points, such as the classifier module described above. Further, the output may be provided to an object tracing module, such as the RADAR unit 130 .
- the object tracing module may be included as part of the computing device or may be a separate entity, and may be configured to determine one or more parameters of objects within the environment of the autonomous vehicle. For instance, the object tracing module may be configured to determine one or more parameters of a cyclist, such as a current speed of the cyclist, a current acceleration of the cyclist, and/or a current direction of movement of the cyclist (e.g., travelling towards the autonomous vehicle or travelling away from the autonomous vehicle). Other parameters are possible as well.
- the computing device may be configured to map the determined hand signal of the cyclist to the direction of movement of the cyclist. The computing device can then determine the expected adjustment of one or more of the cyclist's speed and direction of movement.
- the method 300 includes, based on the expected adjustment, the computing device providing instructions to adjust one or more of a speed of the autonomous vehicle and a direction of movement of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., a trajectory of the autonomous vehicle).
- the computing device may be configured to generally determine, based on the situational context (e.g., a cyclist's hand signal), a control strategy comprising rules for actions that control speed, steering angle, and lane of the autonomous vehicle.
- a given control strategy may comprise a program or computer instructions that characterize actuators controlling the autonomous vehicle (e.g., throttle, steering gear, brake, accelerator, or transmission shifter).
- FIGS. 4A-4D illustrate data 400 A-D (i.e., 3D point cloud data, a plurality of data points, etc.) associated with a cyclist, in accordance with the example method. Further, each of FIGS. 4A-4D is associated with respective example scenarios in which the computing device can determine an expected adjustment of the cyclist's speed and/or direction of movement.
- the data 400 A-D is representative of respective environments of an autonomous vehicle, and FIGS. 4A-4D also include images 402 A-D of the respective environments containing a cyclist.
- the data 400 A indicates a cyclist in close proximity to the autonomous vehicle with an arm of the cyclist extending in the +x direction.
- a classifier module of the computing device configured to perform the classification/learning/etc. functions noted above may not be able to determine whether the arm of the cyclist is a right arm or a left arm.
- the classifier module may output to the object tracing module an indication that the arm of the cyclist is extending in the +x direction. Such an output may be determined based on training data and one or more of the algorithms, techniques, and parameters described above. Further, the object tracing module may determine that the cyclist is travelling away from the autonomous vehicle, as shown in the image 402 A.
- the computing device may then determine that the arm extending in the +x direction is the right arm of the cyclist, and thereby determine that the cyclist is providing a right turn signal indicating that there will be an expected adjustment of the cyclist's speed and direction in order to for the cyclist to make a right turn.
- the computing device may then provide instructions to the autonomous vehicle for the autonomous vehicle to adjust its speed, trajectory, and/or other parameters accordingly.
- the data 400 B indicates a cyclist further in proximity from the autonomous vehicle than the cyclist in FIG. 4A and an arm of the cyclist extending in the ⁇ x direction.
- the classifier module may output to the object tracing module an indication that the arm of the cyclist is extending in the ⁇ x direction.
- the object tracing module may determine that the cyclist is travelling away from the autonomous vehicle, as shown in the image 402 B.
- the computing device may then determine that the arm extending in the ⁇ x direction is the left arm of the cyclist, and thereby determine that the cyclist is providing a left turn signal indicating that there will be an expected adjustment of the cyclist's speed and direction in order to for the cyclist to make a left turn.
- the data 400 B indicates a cyclist that is further in proximity from the autonomous vehicle than the cyclists in FIGS. 4A-B and providing no hand signal.
- the classifier module may output to the object tracing module an indication that the cyclist is providing no hand signal.
- the computing device may use different patterns, measurements, classes, etc. for classifying the cyclist than the scenarios in FIGS. 4A-B .
- a probability distribution associated with possible classes may include lower probabilities for left/right/slow/stop hand turn signals than the following classes: a cyclist providing no hand signal, and an environment containing no cyclist.
- the object tracing module may determine that the cyclist is travelling away from the autonomous vehicle, as shown in the image 402 C. As such, the computing device may then determine that the cyclist is indicating that there will be an expected adjustment of the cyclist's speed, but likely little to no expected adjustment of the cyclist's direction of movement.
- the data 400 D indicates a cyclist further in proximity from the autonomous vehicle than the cyclists in FIGS. 4A-C and an arm of the cyclist extending in the ⁇ x direction.
- the classifier module may output to the object tracing module an indication that the arm of the cyclist is extending in the ⁇ x direction. Further, the object tracing module may determine that the cyclist is travelling towards the autonomous vehicle, as shown in the image 402 D.
- the computing device may then determine that the arm extending in the ⁇ x direction is the right arm of the cyclist, and thereby determine that the cyclist is providing a right turn signal indicating that there will be an expected adjustment of the cyclist's speed and direction in order to for the cyclist to make a right turn (e.g., turn in the ⁇ x direction, from the autonomous vehicle's point of view).
- a right turn e.g., turn in the ⁇ x direction, from the autonomous vehicle's point of view.
- At least one of the classes noted above may not correspond to whether a cyclist is giving a right hand signal or a left hand signal, but rather may correspond to whether a cyclist is extending an arm/hand in the +x or ⁇ x direction (or other direction in a 3D coordinate system).
- the object tracing module may perform functions in accordance with the classifier module in order to determine whether the cyclist is travelling in the same direction as the autonomous vehicle and intends to turn right/left, travelling in the opposite direction as the autonomous vehicle and intends to turn left/right, etc.
