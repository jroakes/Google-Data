- This disclosure provides for systems and methods for determining when a previously stored map is inaccurate.

For example, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may detect and track vehicles at an intersection, on the various types of roadways, and in other such driving environments. As another example, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may detect and track vehicles entering and/or exiting a highway, such as vehicles entering the highway via an on-ramp, exiting the highway via an off-ramp and other such behaviors.

More specifically, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may cross-reference the position of a detected vehicle with a location in the detailed map information 114 . Based on this cross-reference, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may then determine the trajectory that a detected vehicle takes based on its detected position. For example, where the autonomous driving computer system 144 detects vehicle on a highway, such as a motorcycle, light trunk, or other vehicle, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may cross-reference the position of the detected vehicle and determine the trajectory of the detected vehicle, such as by tracking the positions of the vehicle as it continues along the highway.

- the vehicle data 116 may include parameters that define the type of vehicle when the vehicle is detected by one or more of the camera sensors, one or more of the laser sensors, and so forth.
- Vehicles may be identified through a vehicle detection algorithm 124 , which the processor 106 may use to classify vehicles based on various characteristics, such as the size of the vehicle (bicycles are larger than a breadbox and smaller than a car), the speed of the vehicle (bicycles do not tend to go faster than 40 miles per hour or slower than 0.1 miles per hour), and other such characteristics.
- the vehicle may be classified based on specific attributes of the vehicle, such as information contained on a license plate, bumper sticker, or logos that appear on the vehicle.
- the vehicle data 116 may also include state, positional, and/or trajectory information collected by the autonomous driving computer system 144 when a vehicle is detected.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may collect the state and/or positional information about a detected vehicle to assist in the determination of the vehicle trajectory.

- the vehicle trajectory may also define the past positions, directions, and speed that the detected vehicle had while in the driving environment.
- the vehicle trajectory for a detected vehicle may be derived from state information that the autonomous driving computer system 144 records.
- State information may include characteristics about the detected vehicle. Examples of state information include, but are not limited to, the detected vehicle's speed, the path traveled by the vehicle, the driving environment in which the vehicle is traveling, any directional or orientation changes by the vehicle, or other such state information.
- the state information may also be associated with one or more segments of the detailed map information 114 to further refine the state of the detected vehicle. For example, where the detected vehicle is detected as being on a highway (as defined by the detailed map information 114 ), the collected state information may identify that the detected vehicle was traveling in a highway, and may further identify the direction of the detected vehicle, various positional information or changes about the detected vehicle (e.g., the original starting lane of the detected vehicle, the ending lane of the detected vehicle), and other such state information.
- the state information collected by the autonomous driving computer system 144 may be used to determine a trajectory for the detected vehicle. As discussed previously, based on the detected positions and speed of the detected vehicle, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may derive a trajectory for the detected vehicle. As discussed below, this determined vehicle trajectory may be compared against an expected vehicle trajectory (which may be stored as part of, or derived from, the detailed map information 114 ) to determine whether the driving environment has changed.
- the instructions 110 may include a map discrepancy algorithm 146 that facilitates the determination by the autonomous driving computer system 144 as to whether the driving environment has changed.
- the autonomous vehicle 104 may collect state information about detected vehicles regardless of whether the autonomous vehicle 104 is operating in an autonomous mode or a non-autonomous mode. Thus, whether the autonomous vehicle 104 is operating by itself or has a driver, the autonomous vehicle 104 may collect state and object information to determine the aforementioned vehicle trajectories.
- the autonomous vehicle 104 may also communicate with a map provider server 142 via a network 140 .
- the network 140 may be implemented as any combination or type of networks.
- the network 140 may be one or more of a Wide Area Network (“WAN”), such as the Internet; a Local Area Network (“LAN”); a Personal Area Network (“PAN”), or a combination of WANs, LANs, and PANs.

- the trajectories 704 - 710 may represent the paths the corresponding vehicles 604 - 610 traveled in the driving environment and their location relative to the detailed map information 114 .
- the trajectories 704 - 710 may include slight lateral shifts as it is generally understood that vehicles do not typically travel in absolutely straight lines. These slight lateral shifts are generally due to corrections by a human driver (e.g., a driver turning a steering wheel slightly to the right or left to keep a vehicle driving in a relatively straight path). Each of the trajectories 704 - 710 may be determined based on the collected state information for the corresponding vehicles 604 - 610 .
- a trajectory may include positional information for a corresponding vehicle (e.g., a series of latitudinal and longitudinal points), where the positional information is associated with one or more timestamps (e.g., relative timestamps or absolute timestamps). Further still, a trajectory may be derived as an interpolated series of positions based on the detected positions of the corresponding vehicle.
- positional information for a corresponding vehicle e.g., a series of latitudinal and longitudinal points
- timestamps e.g., relative timestamps or absolute timestamps
- the trajectories 704 - 710 may be determined based on one or more conditions, such as distance, time, or other such factors.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may determine the trajectories 704 - 710 based on having sufficient distance information for a corresponding vehicle (e.g., 100 feet, 300 meters, two miles, or other distance information).

For example, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may determine individually or consolidated average trajectories from the trajectories 704 - 710 , compare the averaged trajectories with the detailed map information 144 , and then determine whether there is a consistent bias in the averaged trajectories.
- the consistent bias may indicate that a change (e.g., a shift in one or more lanes) in the detailed map information 144 has occurred.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may use the individual trajectories 704 - 710 to determine whether any changes have occurred.
- FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate examples 802 - 804 of the autonomous driving computer system 144 using the individual trajectories 704 - 710 to determine whether the driving environment has changed.
- the autonomous vehicle computer system 144 has individually averaged the determined trajectories 704 - 710 to produce corresponding smoothed trajectories 806 - 812 .
- the smoothed trajectories may lack some of the lateral shifts (e.g., oscillations) that are present in the determined trajectories 704 - 710 .
- the smoothed trajectories 806 - 812 may be used to determine whether there is a consistent bias in the trajectories of the corresponding vehicles 604 - 610 relative to the detailed map information 114 . While the autonomous driving computer system 144 may use the smoothed trajectories 806 - 812 to determine whether the detailed map information 114 is inaccurate, it is also possible that the autonomous driving computer system 114 may use the unsmoothed (i.e., raw) trajectories 704 - 710 to make this determination.

- an expected trajectory such as the trajectory 814 of FIG. 8A
- an expected trajectory such as the trajectory 816 of FIG. 8B
- the expected trajectory may be based on empirical data from prior observations and tracking of one or more vehicles in the driving environment.
- the smoothed trajectories 806 - 808 may then be compared with the one or more expected trajectories 814 - 816 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may determine which expected trajectory to compare with the smoothed trajectories 806 - 808 by comparing the positional information of the corresponding vehicles 604 , 610 with the positional information of the autonomous vehicle 104 .
- the result of comparing the positional information of the vehicles 604 , 610 with the positional information of the autonomous vehicle 104 may indicate whether the vehicles are traveling within the same lane of the autonomous vehicle 104 or a different lane.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may determine one or more sets of deviation values. These deviation values may be determined by comparing one or more of the expected trajectories with one or more of the determined trajectories (i.e., the smoothed and/or unsmoothed trajectories).
- a first set of deviation values 818 may correspond to the difference in distance between one or more positions along the smoothed trajectory 806 (or unsmoothed/raw trajectory 706 ) and corresponding one or more positions along the expected trajectory 814 .
- a second set of deviation values 820 may correspond to the difference in distance between one or more positions along the smoothed trajectory 808 and corresponding one or more positions along the expected trajectory 814 .
- the first set of deviation values 818 and/or the second set of deviation values 820 may be measured by any distance type, such as millimeters, centimeters, feet, yards, inches, and so forth.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may obtain deviation values 822 - 824 by comparing smoothed trajectories 810 , 812 with a second expected trajectory 816 .
- a third set of deviation values 822 may correspond to the difference in distance between one or more positions along the smoothed trajectory 810 and corresponding one or more positions along the expected trajectory 816
- a fourth set of deviation values 824 may correspond to the difference in distance between one or more positions along the smoothed trajectory 812 and corresponding one or more positions along the expected trajectory 816 .
- FIGS. 8A-8B illustrate examples involving two trajectories each (here, trajectories 806 - 808 and trajectories 810 - 812 ), the autonomous driving computer system 144 may determine more or fewer trajectories for comparing with an expected trajectory.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may be configured to determine a threshold number of trajectories for comparing with an expected trajectory.
- the threshold number of trajectories may be any number of trajectories, e.g., one, two, ten, or any other number.
- the number of trajectories may include any combination of unique trajectories, where each trajectory corresponds to a unique vehicle, or non-unique trajectories, where different trajectories may correspond to the same vehicle.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may obtain a variety of metrics for determining whether the driving environment has changed, and thus, whether the detailed map information 114 is inaccurate. These metrics may include, for example, a maximum deviation metric, an average deviation metric, and an average signed deviation metric.
- the maximum deviation metric may indicate the maximum difference between a determined trajectory and an expected trajectory.
- the second set of deviation values 820 and the fourth set of deviation values 824 may each include a maximum deviation value for each set of compared trajectories (i.e., trajectories 806 - 808 and trajectories 810 - 812 ).
- the average deviation metric may indicate the average difference between the determined trajectory and the expected trajectory.
- the average deviation for example 802 may be determined by averaging, individually or combined, the first set of deviation values 818 and the second set of deviation values 820 .
- the average deviation for the example 804 may be determined by averaging, individually or combined, the third set of deviation values 822 and the fourth set of deviation values 824 .
- the average signed deviation metric may indicate whether the difference between the determined trajectory and the expected trajectory is negative (i.e., the trajectories have been laterally shifted to the left), positive (i.e., the trajectories have been laterally shifted to the right), or neutral (i.e., the trajectories have not been shifted).
- the average signed deviation for the example 802 may be determined based on determining a signed average, individually or combined, of the first set of deviation values 818 and the second set of deviation values 820 . A similar determination may also be made for the example 804 .
- One or more of the foregoing metrics may be used to determine whether, and to what extent, a change has occurred in the driving environment. For example, the maximum deviation metric and/or the average deviation metric(s) may be compared with a threshold deviation metric to indicate whether a changed has, in fact, occurred. Where the maximum deviation metric and/or the average deviation metric exceeds the threshold deviation metric, the autonomous vehicle computer system 144 may determine that there has been a change in the driving environment. Moreover, the average signed deviation metric(s) may indicate the degree and direction of the change in the driving environment.
- the average signed deviation metric(s) may be positive, since the smoothed trajectories 806 - 808 are illustrated to the right of the expected trajectory 814 .
- the average signed deviation metric(s) for FIG. 8B may be positive since the smoothed trajectories 810 - 812 are also to the right of the expected trajectory 816 .

- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may also store one or more probability models, such as a probability model for a highway, a probability model for a parkway, and so forth, and the autonomous driving computer system 144 may select which of the probability models to use in the probability function based on the location, or driving environment, of the autonomous vehicle 104 .
- the probability function may provide a more granular determination of whether the driving environment has changed (e.g., 83%) in contrast to the determination of whether the driving environment has changed based on comparing the deviation metric values with corresponding thresholds (e.g., yes, where the deviation metric is greater than the threshold; no, where the deviation metric is not greater than the threshold).
- the autonomous vehicle computer system 144 may determine metrics for trajectories where the corresponding vehicles are within a predetermined distance, or distance threshold, to the autonomous vehicle 104 .

- the autonomous driving computer system 144 determines whether a driving environment has changed relative to previously stored detailed map information 114 . As the driving environment may changed since the detailed map information was last updated in the autonomous driving computer system 144 , the autonomous driving computer system 144 may rely monitoring the behavior of surrounding vehicles to determine whether a change has occurred. Further still, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may monitor for consistent behavior changes by the surrounding vehicles to determine whether the driving environment has changed. In particular, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may determine one or more trajectories for the surrounding vehicles, and then may compare these trajectories to an expected trajectory for a hypothetical vehicle. Where there are consistent differences between the determined trajectories and the expected trajectory, indicated by various types of deviation metrics, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may determine whether the driving environment has changed.
