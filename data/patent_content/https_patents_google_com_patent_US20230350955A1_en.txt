- FIG. 8 shows an example of a computer device that can be used to implement the described techniques.
- FIG. 9 shows an example of a distributed computer device that can be used to implement the described techniques.
- a user may search a corpus of entities (e.g., a product catalog, a service product catalog, webpages, etc.) to obtain a list of entities responsive to a primary search query. For example, a user may search a database of products for “display monitor” and then receive a list of display monitors, or the user may perform a web search for “hotels in Milwaukee” and then receive a list of different hotels in Milwaukee.
- the user is able to filter the search result of the primary search query based on keyword searching within the user-generated reviews to obtain a review search result, which may include a filtered list of entities and/or relevant portions of user-generated reviews that correspond to the search term(s) of the filter.
- the user can submit a secondary search query to search for “lake view” within the user-generated reviews across the list of entities (which was the result of the primary search query), and then receive a list of hotels (e.g., a filtered list) whose user-generated reviews are responsive to the search criteria “lake view.”
- a list of hotels e.g., a filtered list
- a user can select which entities to compare, and then submit a keyword search to search the user-generated reviews for the entities selected by the user. For example, the user may view a product list or a service product list, and then select which entities from that list to search within the user-generated reviews. Also, the user may perform one or more searches within the corpus of entities, and then select which entities to compare based on the results of those searches. With respect to the hotel example, a user may select five hotels in the Milwaukee area, and then search the user-generated reviews across the five hotels according to any type of search criteria (e.g., beaches, bed bugs, pools, etc.).
- search criteria e.g., beaches, bed bugs, pools, etc.
- the search engine may rank the list of entities based on each entity’s user-generated reviews relevance to the search term. For example, a user may submit a search query such as “lake view” and the search engine may search the user-generated reviews for the search criteria “lake view” and identify the user-generated reviews that contain the search criteria “lake view.” The search engine may identify which entities correspond to the user-generated reviews that contain the search criteria “lake view.” In some examples, the search engine may rank the identified entities based on the entity’s user-generated reviews relevance to the search term(s).
- the ranking may be based on the occurrence of the search term(s) within a respective entity’s user-generated reviews. For example, if the occurrence of the term “lake view” in the user-generated reviews pertaining to the first entity is relatively high, the first entity may be ranked higher than other entities.
- the search engine may rank the identified entities based on other signals related to the user-generated reviews such as helpfulness, review quality, review length, and/or the time associated when the user-generated reviews were posted.
- the review search results can be provided in a comparison layout that identifies user-generated reviews for multiple entities that correspond to the search term(s).
- a user can search within and compare user-generated reviews for several entities at once.
- a user may submit a query (e.g., “pools”), and a search engine obtains user-generated reviews for multiple entities (e.g., hotel A, hotel B, hotel C, etc.) that meet the search criteria.
- hotel A, hotel B, and hotel C may be selected by the user or these hotels may be identified from a previous search.
- the search engine may provide these user-generated reviews (or portions thereof) in a comparison layout so that the user can compare the entities in a single place/page (e.g., without having to switch between tabs).
- user-generated reviews pertinent to “pools” for multiple different hotels are identified and displayed in a manner that allows the user to compare different hotels.
- the criteria for evaluating different hotels may widely vary from user to user, where some users may want to search user-generated reviews for bed cleanliness or whether a hotel has a restaurant that has vegan options.
- the techniques described herein enable searching within user-generated reviews across multiple different entities according to any type of search criteria and then displaying the comparison results in a single place/place to help the user decide between different options.
- implementations provide a novel way to search for entities, which uses user-generated content as a primary way to surface entities and as a way to filter entities responsive to a primary query.
- the comparison layout may include a first column that corresponds to a first entity (e.g., a first hotel) and a second column that corresponds to a second entity (e.g., a second hotel), where the first column is populated with user-generated reviews (or portions thereof) about the first entity that meet the search criteria, and the second column is populated with user-generated reviews (or portions thereof) about the second entity that meet the search criteria.
- the embodiments encompass any type of comparison layout that allows users to compare user-generated reviews across multiple entities.
- the comparison layout may include any number of entities to be compared such as three entities, four entities, five entities, or any number greater than five. The user may submit another search, which repopulates the list of entities within the comparison layout with the user-generated reviews (or portions thereof) that meet the new search criteria.
- the user enters text into a search box to submit a query.
- one or more keywords or phrases (or most (or all) of the words) of the displayed user-generated review portions are selectable, which, when selected, can cause submission of another query to search the user-generated reviews.
- users can click on keywords within the reviews to repopulate the comparison layout with a new list of entities having user-generated reviews related to whichever word is clicked (e.g., all or some of the words within a review can function like pivot/search-chips), so the user does not have to type a new query.
- the user can remove/eliminate one or more entities from the comparison layout that they are no longer interested in seeing.
- an alternative entity may be suggested to the user and take the previous entity’s place.
- the comparison layout is populated with snippets (e.g., portions of the user-generated reviews) that include the search term.
- the search engine may obtain only relevant snippets from the user-generated reviews so users can see many reviews at once, and they do not have to sift through a long review to find the relevant sentence.
- only the relevant portion is surfaced, and users may click to see the full review.
- the first column may include snippets of user-generated reviews that correspond to the first entity
- the second column may include snippets of user-generated reviews that correspond to the second entity. In this manner, for a single entity, users will have the ability to see several short, on-topic sentences pertinent to their search query.
- users will have the ability to quickly compare the relevant review snippets related to the first entity to relevant review snippets related to other entities to assist the user with deciding between the various entities.
- users can access the full review by either expanding in-line or going to a different page. For example, in response to a user-provided action taken with respect to a snippet of a user-generated review (e.g., the user clicks on the snippet or a user interface element associated with the snippet), the entire contents of the user-generated review is displayed. In some examples, snippets are not created, but rather the entire contents of the user-generated review are displayed in the comparison layout.
- Implementations include systems and methods that enable searching web pages and generating a search result to be displayed as a ranked list of web pages in which one or more of the ranking signals are derived from the user-generated reviews.
- a query system may identify the entities associated with web pages determined to be responsive to a query. For example, if the ranked list of web pages identifies a first web page corresponding to a first hotel, a second web page corresponding to a second hotel, and a third web page corresponding to a third hotel, the query system may identify the first hotel, the second hotel, and the third hotel as the entities associated with the responsive items. Then, the query system may obtain the user-generated reviews associated with the identified entities. The query system may derive one or more ranking signals from the user-generated reviews.
- the query system may obtain rating scores associated with the relevant user-generated reviews and/or analyze the content of the user-generated reviews to provide one or more signals indicating a level of user impression of the underlying entity.
- the ranking signals related to the user-generated reviews may include signals related to helpfulness, review quality, review length, and/or the time associated when the user-generated reviews were posted. Based on the ranking signal(s) associated with the user-generated reviews (in conjunction with other types of ranking signals), the query system may rank the list of web pages to generate the ranked list.
- FIGS. 1 A through 1 H illustrate a search system 100 that implements a search service to search within user-generated reviews 126 across multiple entities 128 according to an aspect.
- the search system 100 enables searching within user-generated reviews 126 across multiple entities 128 of a particular type.
- the search system 100 includes an online platform 101 in which users (using a client device 152 ) can submit user-generated reviews 126 about various entities 128 associated with the online platform 101 .
- An entity 128 may refer to an item that can be reviewed by a particular user.
- the entities 128 may include accommodations, restaurants, products, and/or services.
- the entities 128 may include web pages.
- Entities 128 of a particular type may refer to entities 128 within a certain category (e.g., hotels, restaurants, car rental companies, etc.).
- the entities 128 may include persons (e.g., groups of people, political candidates, celebrities, etc.) or locations (e.g., geographical locations, structures, places of interest, etc.).
- the entities 128 may include opinions and/or ideas.
- the entities 128 may represent any item capable of being reviewed by a user.
- the search system 100 may be used to filter and/or rank entities based on user-generated reviews 126 .
- a user may build an itinerary of things to do based on reviews from other travelers. For example, an English soccer fan visiting New York could search for user-generated reviews 126 that mention “Premier League” or “English breakfast,” which may facilitate surfacing establishments liked by other English soccer fans.
- Other examples include shopping, e.g., searching for inspirations, searching for comparisons or narrowing down the choices based on what other shoppers say in the user-generated reviews 126 .
- Other examples include searching and comparing what people say about a certain topic, e.g., comparing policies from different politicians on an issue, comparing schools based on what parents and educators say in user-generated reviews 126 , comparing health care options, doctors, etc.
- the user-generated reviews 126 are stored in a product catalog and/or a service product catalog. In some examples, the user-generated reviews 126 are stored in a database associated with the online platform 101 . In some examples, the user-generated reviews 126 are stored in a collection of databases.
- the user-generated reviews 126 are indexed and searchable.
- the user-generated reviews 126 are not necessarily stored within a traditional database, but rather can be stored as a synthetic corpus of web documents that are indexed and searchable (e.g., similar to the way web pages are indexed and searchable by a web browser).
- the user-generated review 126 may be stored as a web document, and a review index 118 is updated by an indexing engine 116 to add the user-generated review 126 to the review index 118 .
- the online platform 101 may incorporate techniques that provide increased semantic understanding of the underlying text to understand colloquial speech since reviews sometimes can be less well written than web pages. Also, a review may be relatively short as compared to a web page, and, therefore, a review may have less text to develop the semantic understanding (e.g., what about this particular item or hotel is the review referring to and what is the sentiment being expressed). For web pages, in terms of trustworthiness, there may be signals reflecting user behavior and signals that use the trustworthiness of other links to inform popularity and trust. However, since determining trustworthiness for reviews can be difficult, in some examples, the online platform 101 may utilize a variety of signals (e.g., signals about the underlying user and/or the particular review) to determine the quality of a particular review.
- signals e.g., signals about the underlying user and/or the particular review
- the review index 118 can be quickly searched to identify the user-generated reviews 126 that correspond to one or more search term(s) 110 of the search query 108 .
- the corpus of user-generated reviews 126 include user-generated reviews 126 for a plurality of entities 128 .
- the user-generated reviews 126 include one or more user-generated reviews 126 for a first entity 128 - 1 , one or more user-generated reviews 126 for a second entity 128 - 2 , and one or more user-generated reviews 126 for a third entity 128 - 3 through an N entity 128 -N.
- the search system 100 may enable searching within the user-generated reviews 126 across multiple entities 128 of a particular type. In other words, disclosed implementations enable the user-generated reviews 126 to determine which entities 128 are responsive to a search query 108 .
- a user-generated review 126 may include any type of content that has been submitted to the online platform 101 by a user about a particular entity 128 .
- a user-generated review 126 refers to any type of user-generated content (UGC).
- a user-generated review 126 can include any publicly accessible information generated by humans.
- the user is a person that submits a review about his/her experiences associated with the entity 128 .
- the user-generated reviews 126 include editorial reviews and/or professional reviews.
- the user-generated reviews 126 include social media comments and posts (e.g., comments and posts that are made public).
- the user-generated reviews 126 when searching within the user-generated reviews 126 , include social media posts from users connected to the user in a connection graph (e.g., are following or friends of the user).
- a user-generated review 126 includes a description (e.g., text) of a particular user’s experience, thoughts, and/or impressions about a particular entity 128 .
- a user-generated review 126 includes a rating or a score provided by the user.
- the user-generated review 126 includes an image and/or video about the entity 128 or related to the user’s experience about the entity 128 .
- the user-generated reviews 126 include video reviews in which users’ post to the online platform 101 about the underlying entity 128 .
- a user may create and submit a video about the entity 128 .

- a user may submit a search query 108 (e.g., “kitchen”), and the search engine 102 obtains user-generated reviews 126 for multiple entities 128 (e.g., hotel A, hotel B, hotel C, etc.) that meet the search term(s) 110 .
- the search engine 102 provides these user-generated reviews 126 (or portions thereof) in the comparison layout 162 so that the user can compare the entities 128 in a single place/page (e.g., without having to switch between tabs).
- the query system 112 may receive the search query 108 over the network 150 from the client device 152 .
- the user-generated reviews 126 are indexed (e.g., an inverted index) and searchable.
- the user-generated reviews 126 are not necessarily stored within a traditional database, but rather can be stored as a synthetic corpus of web documents that are indexed and searchable (e.g., similar to the way web pages are indexed and searchable by a web browser).
- the query engine 114 searches a review index 118 associated with the user-generated reviews 126 to identify the set of user-generated reviews. For example, in response to a user posting a user-generated review 126 to the online platform 101 , the user-generated review 126 is parsed and a review index 118 is updated by an indexing engine 116 to add a review to the review index 118 . In response to the search query 108 , the review index 118 can be quickly searched to identify the user-generated reviews 126 that contain one or more search term(s) 110 of the search query 108 .

- the comparison layout 162 may be a user interface design that is populated with user-generated reviews 126 (or portions thereof) for multiple entities 128 in a manner that allows the user to compare the relevant user-generated reviews 126 for multiple entities 128 .
- the comparison layout 162 includes user-generated reviews 126 (or snippets) for a first entity 128 - 1 and user-generated reviews 126 (or snippets) for a second entity 128 - 2 , where the user-generated reviews 126 relate to one or more search terms 110 of the search query 108 .
- the comparison layout 162 includes a column grid layout of entities 128 (e.g., side by side), which allows users to compare the entities 128 in a single place/page. Users can query for another term, thereby repopulating the list of entities based on the user-generated reviews 126 that are responsive to the new query.

- the ranking may be based on the occurrence of the search term(s) 110 within a respective entity’s user-generated reviews 126 . For example, if the occurrence of terms “free breakfast” in the user-generated reviews 126 pertaining to the first entity 128 - 1 is relatively high, the first entity 128 - 1 may be ranked higher than other entities 128 .
- Operation 604 includes identifying, in response to the search query 108 , a set of user-generated reviews 126 from the plurality of user-generated reviews 126 that corresponds to one or more search terms 110 of the search query 108 .

Abstract
According to an aspect, a method for searching within user-generated reviews includes receiving, from a client device, a search query to search within a plurality of user-generated reviews relating to a plurality of entities, and identifying, in response to the search query, a set of user-generated reviews from the plurality of user-generated reviews that correspond to one or more search terms of the search query, where the set of user-generated reviews includes a user-generated review for a first entity and a user-generated review for a second entity. The first entity is different from the second entity. The method includes providing at least a portion of the user-generated review for the first entity and at least a portion of the user-generated review for the second entity for simultaneous display on a comparison layout of a user interface of the client device.
Description
- This application is a continuation of, and claims priority to, U.S. Pat. Application No. 16/946,981, filed on Jul. 14, 2020, entitled “COMPARATIVE SEARCH WITHIN USER-GENERATED CONTENT,” the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- People often consult user-generated reviews when making purchase decisions such as choosing a hotel, restaurant, or product. In addition, to discover various options (e.g., find a hotel in a certain area, learn of restaurants nearby), users may use web search engines to search web content. Some web search engines display high-level information about reviews (overall rating score, number of ratings, etc.).
- Implementations include systems and methods for comparing and/or locating different entities (e.g., accommodations, restaurants, products, services, web pages, etc.) based on user-generated reviews. Some existing review search tools allow users to search within reviews for a single entity at once. However, the systems and methods discussed herein enable searching within user-generated reviews across multiple entities of a particular type and/or discovering or generating results based on user-generated reviews.
- According to an aspect, a method for searching within user-generated reviews includes receiving, from a client device, a search query to search within a plurality of user-generated reviews relating to a plurality of entities, and identifying, in response to the search query, a set of user-generated reviews from the plurality of user-generated reviews that correspond to one or more search terms of the search query, where the set of user-generated reviews includes a user-generated review for a first entity and a user-generated review for a second entity. The first entity is different from the second entity. The method includes providing at least a portion of the user-generated review for the first entity and at least a portion of the user-generated review for the second entity for simultaneous display on a comparison layout of a user interface of the client device.
- According to some aspects, the method may include one or more of the following features (or any combination thereof). The identifying step may include searching a review index associated with the plurality of user-generated reviews to identify the set of user-generated reviews. The plurality of user-generated reviews are indexed and searchable. The method may include obtaining a first snippet from the user-generated review for the first entity and obtaining a second snippet from the user-generated review for the second entity, where the first and second snippets are configured to be simultaneously displayed on the client device. The method may include providing the entire contents of the user-generated review for the first entity in response to receipt of a user-provided action taken with respect to the first snippet. The method may include generating a list of entities based on each entity’s user-generated reviews relevance to the one or more search terms and providing portions of the user-generated reviews for the list of entities in the comparison layout on the user interface of the client device. The method may include receiving a second search query to search the plurality of user-generated reviews, where the second search query includes one or more search terms different from the one or more search terms of the search query, and obtaining, in response to the second search query, a new set of user-generated reviews from the plurality of user-generated reviews that correspond to the one or more search terms of the second search query, where the new set of user-generated reviews includes reviews about new entities, and providing portions of the new set of user-generated reviews on the user interface such that the comparison layout is repopulated with the new entities along with portions from the new set of user-generated reviews that correspond to the one or more search terms of the second search query. The method may include receiving receipt of a user-provided action taken with respect to a selectable keyword included within the user-generated review for the first entity, obtaining a new set of user-generated reviews from the plurality of user-generated reviews that correspond to the selectable keyword, where the new set of user-generated reviews includes reviews about new entities, and providing portions of the new set of user-generated reviews on the user interface such that the comparison layout is repopulated with the new entities along with portions of the new set of user-generated reviews that correspond to the selectable keyword. The method may include receiving receipt of a user-provided action taken with respect to the second entity to remove the second entity from the comparison layout, identifying, in response to the receipt of the user-provided action, a third entity as a suggested option, and providing, in replacement of the second entity, at least a portion of a user-generated review for the third entity as the suggested option for display on the comparison layout.
- According to an aspect, a method for searching within user-generated reviews for multiple entities includes receiving, from a client device, a search query to search within a plurality of user-generated reviews relating to a plurality of entities, the search query including one or more search terms, identifying, in response to the search query, a set of user-generated reviews from the plurality of user-generated reviews that correspond to the one or more search terms of the search query, and generating a list of entities based on the set of user-generated reviews, where the list of entities includes a first entity and a second entity. The second entity is different from the first entity. The method includes providing the list of entities for display on a user interface of a client device.
- According to some aspects, the method may include one or more of the following features (or any combination thereof). The search query is a filter on a search of entities. The identifying step includes searching a review index associated with the plurality of user-generated reviews to identify the set of user-generated reviews. The method may include ranking the list of entities based on each entity’s user-generated reviews relevance to the one or more search terms included within the search query. The set of user-generated reviews may include first user-generated reviews for the first entity and second user-generated reviews for the second entity. The method may include providing snippets of the first user-generated reviews and for the second user-generated reviews for simultaneous display on a comparison layout of the user interface of the client device. The method may include receiving receipt of a user-provided action taken with respect to a selectable keyword included within one of the snippets, obtaining a new set of user-generated reviews from the plurality of user-generated reviews that correspond to the selectable keyword, where the new set of user-generated reviews includes reviews about a new list of entities, and providing snippets of the new set of user-generated reviews on the user interface such that the comparison layout is updated with the new list of entities along with the snippets of the new set of user-generated reviews that correspond to the selectable keyword.
- According to an aspect, a method for searching within user-generated reviews for multiple entities includes receiving a primary search query to search of corpus of entities, obtaining, in response to the primary search query, a search result including a list of entities that are responsive to the primary search query, receiving a secondary search query to search a plurality of user-generated reviews for the list of entities such that the secondary search query functions as a filter on the search result, identifying a set of user-generated reviews associated with the list of entities from the plurality of user-generated reviews, generating a filtered list of entities based on the set of user-generated reviews, where the filtered list of entities includes a first entity and a second entity and the second entity is different from the first entity, and providing the filtered list of entities for display on a user interface of a client device.
- According to some aspects, the method may include one or more of the following features (or any combination thereof). The plurality of user-generated reviews are indexed and searchable. The set of user-generated reviews includes first user-generated reviews for the first entity and second user-generated reviews for the second entity. The method may include providing snippets of the first user-generated reviews and for the second user-generated reviews for simultaneous display on a comparison layout of the user interface of the client device. The method may include receiving receipt of a user-provided action taken with respect to a selectable keyword included within one of the snippets, obtaining a new set of user-generated reviews from the plurality of user-generated reviews that correspond to the selectable keyword, where the new set of user-generated reviews includes reviews about a new list of entities, and providing snippets of the new set of user-generated reviews on the user interface such that the comparison layout is updated with the new list of entities along with the snippets of the new set of user-generated reviews that correspond to the selectable keyword. The identifying step includes searching a review index associated with the plurality of user-generated reviews to obtain the set of user-generated reviews.

- A user may search a corpus of entities (e.g., a product catalog, a service product catalog, webpages, etc.) to obtain a list of entities responsive to a primary search query. For example, a user may search a database of products for “display monitor” and then receive a list of display monitors, or the user may perform a web search for “hotels in Milwaukee” and then receive a list of different hotels in Milwaukee. In some examples, the user is able to filter the search result of the primary search query based on keyword searching within the user-generated reviews to obtain a review search result, which may include a filtered list of entities and/or relevant portions of user-generated reviews that correspond to the search term(s) of the filter. For example, the user can submit a secondary search query to search for “lake view” within the user-generated reviews across the list of entities (which was the result of the primary search query), and then receive a list of hotels (e.g., a filtered list) whose user-generated reviews are responsive to the search criteria “lake view.”
- In some examples, a user can select which entities to compare, and then submit a keyword search to search the user-generated reviews for the entities selected by the user. For example, the user may view a product list or a service product list, and then select which entities from that list to search within the user-generated reviews. Also, the user may perform one or more searches within the corpus of entities, and then select which entities to compare based on the results of those searches. With respect to the hotel example, a user may select five hotels in the Milwaukee area, and then search the user-generated reviews across the five hotels according to any type of search criteria (e.g., beaches, bed bugs, pools, etc.).
- In some examples, in response to the user-generated reviews being searched within the context of a primary search query or a secondary search query, the search engine may rank the list of entities based on each entity’s user-generated reviews relevance to the search term. For example, a user may submit a search query such as “lake view” and the search engine may search the user-generated reviews for the search criteria “lake view” and identify the user-generated reviews that contain the search criteria “lake view.” The search engine may identify which entities correspond to the user-generated reviews that contain the search criteria “lake view.” In some examples, the search engine may rank the identified entities based on the entity’s user-generated reviews relevance to the search term(s). In some examples, the ranking may be based on the occurrence of the search term(s) within a respective entity’s user-generated reviews. For example, if the occurrence of the term “lake view” in the user-generated reviews pertaining to the first entity is relatively high, the first entity may be ranked higher than other entities. In some examples, the search engine may rank the identified entities based on other signals related to the user-generated reviews such as helpfulness, review quality, review length, and/or the time associated when the user-generated reviews were posted.
- In some examples, the review search results can be provided in a comparison layout that identifies user-generated reviews for multiple entities that correspond to the search term(s). In other words, a user can search within and compare user-generated reviews for several entities at once. A user may submit a query (e.g., “pools”), and a search engine obtains user-generated reviews for multiple entities (e.g., hotel A, hotel B, hotel C, etc.) that meet the search criteria. As indicated above, hotel A, hotel B, and hotel C may be selected by the user or these hotels may be identified from a previous search. The search engine may provide these user-generated reviews (or portions thereof) in a comparison layout so that the user can compare the entities in a single place/page (e.g., without having to switch between tabs). Using the above example, user-generated reviews pertinent to “pools” for multiple different hotels are identified and displayed in a manner that allows the user to compare different hotels. However, it is noted that the criteria for evaluating different hotels may widely vary from user to user, where some users may want to search user-generated reviews for bed cleanliness or whether a hotel has a restaurant that has vegan options. The techniques described herein enable searching within user-generated reviews across multiple different entities according to any type of search criteria and then displaying the comparison results in a single place/place to help the user decide between different options. Thus, implementations provide a novel way to search for entities, which uses user-generated content as a primary way to surface entities and as a way to filter entities responsive to a primary query.
- In some examples, the comparison layout may include a first column that corresponds to a first entity (e.g., a first hotel) and a second column that corresponds to a second entity (e.g., a second hotel), where the first column is populated with user-generated reviews (or portions thereof) about the first entity that meet the search criteria, and the second column is populated with user-generated reviews (or portions thereof) about the second entity that meet the search criteria. However, the embodiments encompass any type of comparison layout that allows users to compare user-generated reviews across multiple entities. In addition, the comparison layout may include any number of entities to be compared such as three entities, four entities, five entities, or any number greater than five. The user may submit another search, which repopulates the list of entities within the comparison layout with the user-generated reviews (or portions thereof) that meet the new search criteria.
- In some examples, the user enters text into a search box to submit a query. In some examples, one or more keywords or phrases (or most (or all) of the words) of the displayed user-generated review portions are selectable, which, when selected, can cause submission of another query to search the user-generated reviews. For example, users can click on keywords within the reviews to repopulate the comparison layout with a new list of entities having user-generated reviews related to whichever word is clicked (e.g., all or some of the words within a review can function like pivot/search-chips), so the user does not have to type a new query. In some examples, the user can remove/eliminate one or more entities from the comparison layout that they are no longer interested in seeing. In some examples, when an entity is removed from the comparison layout, an alternative entity may be suggested to the user and take the previous entity’s place.
- In some examples, the comparison layout is populated with snippets (e.g., portions of the user-generated reviews) that include the search term. For example, the search engine may obtain only relevant snippets from the user-generated reviews so users can see many reviews at once, and they do not have to sift through a long review to find the relevant sentence. In some examples, only the relevant portion is surfaced, and users may click to see the full review. In further detail, the first column may include snippets of user-generated reviews that correspond to the first entity, and the second column may include snippets of user-generated reviews that correspond to the second entity. In this manner, for a single entity, users will have the ability to see several short, on-topic sentences pertinent to their search query. Also, users will have the ability to quickly compare the relevant review snippets related to the first entity to relevant review snippets related to other entities to assist the user with deciding between the various entities. In some implementations, users can access the full review by either expanding in-line or going to a different page. For example, in response to a user-provided action taken with respect to a snippet of a user-generated review (e.g., the user clicks on the snippet or a user interface element associated with the snippet), the entire contents of the user-generated review is displayed. In some examples, snippets are not created, but rather the entire contents of the user-generated review are displayed in the comparison layout.
- Implementations include systems and methods that enable searching web pages and generating a search result to be displayed as a ranked list of web pages in which one or more of the ranking signals are derived from the user-generated reviews. A query system may identify the entities associated with web pages determined to be responsive to a query. For example, if the ranked list of web pages identifies a first web page corresponding to a first hotel, a second web page corresponding to a second hotel, and a third web page corresponding to a third hotel, the query system may identify the first hotel, the second hotel, and the third hotel as the entities associated with the responsive items. Then, the query system may obtain the user-generated reviews associated with the identified entities. The query system may derive one or more ranking signals from the user-generated reviews. For example, the query system may obtain rating scores associated with the relevant user-generated reviews and/or analyze the content of the user-generated reviews to provide one or more signals indicating a level of user impression of the underlying entity. In addition, the ranking signals related to the user-generated reviews may include signals related to helpfulness, review quality, review length, and/or the time associated when the user-generated reviews were posted. Based on the ranking signal(s) associated with the user-generated reviews (in conjunction with other types of ranking signals), the query system may rank the list of web pages to generate the ranked list.

FIGS. 1A through 1H illustrate asearch system 100 that implements a search service to search within user-generatedreviews 126 acrossmultiple entities 128 according to an aspect. Thesearch system 100 enables searching within user-generatedreviews 126 acrossmultiple entities 128 of a particular type. Thesearch system 100 includes anonline platform 101 in which users (using a client device 152) can submit user-generatedreviews 126 aboutvarious entities 128 associated with theonline platform 101. - An
entity 128 may refer to an item that can be reviewed by a particular user. In some examples, theentities 128 may include accommodations, restaurants, products, and/or services. In some examples, theentities 128 may include web pages.Entities 128 of a particular type may refer toentities 128 within a certain category (e.g., hotels, restaurants, car rental companies, etc.). In some examples, theentities 128 may include persons (e.g., groups of people, political candidates, celebrities, etc.) or locations (e.g., geographical locations, structures, places of interest, etc.). In some examples, theentities 128 may include opinions and/or ideas. Generally, theentities 128 may represent any item capable of being reviewed by a user. Thesearch system 100 may be used to filter and/or rank entities based on user-generatedreviews 126. For instance, a user may build an itinerary of things to do based on reviews from other travelers. For example, an English soccer fan visiting New York could search for user-generatedreviews 126 that mention “Premier League” or “English breakfast,” which may facilitate surfacing establishments liked by other English soccer fans. Other examples include shopping, e.g., searching for inspirations, searching for comparisons or narrowing down the choices based on what other shoppers say in the user-generatedreviews 126. Other examples include searching and comparing what people say about a certain topic, e.g., comparing policies from different politicians on an issue, comparing schools based on what parents and educators say in user-generatedreviews 126, comparing health care options, doctors, etc. - In some examples, the user-generated
reviews 126 are stored in a product catalog and/or a service product catalog. In some examples, the user-generatedreviews 126 are stored in a database associated with theonline platform 101. In some examples, the user-generatedreviews 126 are stored in a collection of databases. - In some examples, the user-generated
reviews 126 are indexed and searchable. In some examples, the user-generatedreviews 126 are not necessarily stored within a traditional database, but rather can be stored as a synthetic corpus of web documents that are indexed and searchable (e.g., similar to the way web pages are indexed and searchable by a web browser). For example, in response to a user posting a user-generatedreview 126 to theonline platform 101, the user-generatedreview 126 may be stored as a web document, and areview index 118 is updated by anindexing engine 116 to add the user-generatedreview 126 to thereview index 118. - Providing user-generated
reviews 126 that are indexed and searchable may overcome technical challenges that are not typically encountered when indexing and understanding web pages. In some examples, theonline platform 101 may incorporate techniques that provide increased semantic understanding of the underlying text to understand colloquial speech since reviews sometimes can be less well written than web pages. Also, a review may be relatively short as compared to a web page, and, therefore, a review may have less text to develop the semantic understanding (e.g., what about this particular item or hotel is the review referring to and what is the sentiment being expressed). For web pages, in terms of trustworthiness, there may be signals reflecting user behavior and signals that use the trustworthiness of other links to inform popularity and trust. However, since determining trustworthiness for reviews can be difficult, in some examples, theonline platform 101 may utilize a variety of signals (e.g., signals about the underlying user and/or the particular review) to determine the quality of a particular review. - In response to a
search query 108, thereview index 118 can be quickly searched to identify the user-generatedreviews 126 that correspond to one or more search term(s) 110 of thesearch query 108. The corpus of user-generatedreviews 126 include user-generatedreviews 126 for a plurality ofentities 128. For example, the user-generatedreviews 126 include one or more user-generatedreviews 126 for a first entity 128-1, one or more user-generatedreviews 126 for a second entity 128-2, and one or more user-generatedreviews 126 for a third entity 128-3 through an N entity 128-N. However, unlike some conventional search tools, thesearch system 100 may enable searching within the user-generatedreviews 126 acrossmultiple entities 128 of a particular type. In other words, disclosed implementations enable the user-generatedreviews 126 to determine whichentities 128 are responsive to asearch query 108. - A user-generated
review 126 may include any type of content that has been submitted to theonline platform 101 by a user about aparticular entity 128. In some examples, a user-generatedreview 126 refers to any type of user-generated content (UGC). In some examples, a user-generatedreview 126 can include any publicly accessible information generated by humans. In some examples, the user is a person that submits a review about his/her experiences associated with theentity 128. In some examples, the user-generatedreviews 126 include editorial reviews and/or professional reviews. In some examples, the user-generatedreviews 126 include social media comments and posts (e.g., comments and posts that are made public). In some examples, when searching within the user-generatedreviews 126, the user-generatedreviews 126 include social media posts from users connected to the user in a connection graph (e.g., are following or friends of the user). In some examples, a user-generatedreview 126 includes a description (e.g., text) of a particular user’s experience, thoughts, and/or impressions about aparticular entity 128. In some examples, a user-generatedreview 126 includes a rating or a score provided by the user. In some examples, the user-generatedreview 126 includes an image and/or video about theentity 128 or related to the user’s experience about theentity 128. In some examples, the user-generatedreviews 126 include video reviews in which users’ post to theonline platform 101 about theunderlying entity 128. For example, a user may create and submit a video about theentity 128. The video may be provided along with text and/or an image. In some examples, users can record an audio (or a video) of themselves or record an audio (or a video) related to the particular entity 128 (e.g., the ambiance of the hotel, the sounds of the restaurant downstairs, the sounds of the hallways, the sounds of the elevator, the sounds of creaking floors), and those can be searchable and compiled. In some examples, a user-generatedreview 126 may include ideograms or smileys (e.g., emojis) or other user-inserted or created content. - In some examples, in order to submit a user-generated
review 126, the user locates an entity 128 (e.g., a hotel, product, business, etc.) on theonline platform 101. The user may select a user interface element to create a review about theentity 128. Then, the user submits the review (e.g., the user-generated review 126) to theonline platform 101 so that other users of theonline platform 101 can see what the person has posted about theentity 128. In some examples, theonline platform 101 includes a website or a collection of websites. In some examples, theonline platform 101 includes one or more web services. In some examples, theonline platform 101 includes a website or web service that identifiesvarious entities 128 for review, comparison, and/or purchase. For example, theonline platform 101 may be a website or web service that allows users to search and identify hotels and submit user-generatedreviews 126 about the different hotels. However, theonline platform 101 may be associated with any type of entity 128 (e.g., besides hotels) or multiple different types ofentities 128. In some examples, theonline platform 101 is associated with multiple services such as web searching, email, data storage that are in addition to the user-generatedreviews 126. - The
online platform 101 includes asearch engine 102 configured to receive asearch query 108 from a client device 152 (e.g., a requestor) to search the user-generatedreviews 126. Thesearch query 108 may specify one ormore search terms 110 identified by a user. In response to thesearch query 108, thesearch engine 102 obtains areview search result 120. For example, thesearch engine 102 obtains thereview search result 120 by searching thereview index 118 associated with the user-generatedreviews 126. Thereview search result 120 is then returned to theclient device 152. In some examples, thereview search result 120 is provided in acomparison layout 162 as shown with respect toFIGS. 1B through 1D . In some examples, thereview search result 120 is provided as a list of entities (or ranked list of entities) whose user-generatedreviews 126 correspond to the search term(s) 110 of thesearch query 108. In some examples, thereview search result 120 is provided as a filtered list of entities (or ranked (and filtered) list of entities) whose user-generatedreviews 126 correspond to the search term(s) 110 of thesearch query 108. In some examples, the list of entities is provided in thecomparison layout 162 along with the relevant portions of the user-generatedreviews 126. These aspects are further explained later in the disclosure. - The
search engine 102 may be computing devices that take the form of a number of different devices, for example a standard server, a group of such servers, or a rack server system. In some examples, thesearch engine 102 may be a single system sharing components such as processors and memories. In addition, thesearch engine 102 may be implemented in a personal computer, for example a laptop computer. Thesearch engine 102 may be an example ofcomputer device 900, as depicted inFIG. 9 . Thesearch engine 102 may include one or more servers that receive queries (e.g., query 108) from a requestor, such asclient device 152, and provide search results (e.g., search result 120) to the requestor. - The
search engine 102 may include one ormore processors 104 formed in a substrate, an operating system (not shown) and one ormore computer memories 106. Thecomputer memories 106 may represent any kind of memory (e.g., RAM, flash, cache, disk, tape, etc.). Thememory 106 may represent multiple kinds of memory. In some examples (not shown), thememory 106 may include external storage, e.g., memory physically remote from but accessible by thesearch engine 102. Thesearch engine 102 may include one or more modules or engines representing specially programmed software. For example, thesearch engine 102 may include aquery system 112 that enables thesearch engine 102 to receive and respond to queries. - The
query system 112 may include aquery engine 114 and anindexing engine 116. Theindexing engine 116 may update areview index 118 relating to the user-generatedreviews 126. For example, theindexing engine 116 may index the user-generatedreviews 126 to generate and/or update thereview index 118 so that asearch query 108 can be processed relatively quickly. Theindexing engine 116 may add reviews to thereview index 118, update reviews in thereview index 118 and delete reviews from thereview index 118. For example, after a user submits a user-generatedreview 126, theindexing engine 116 may add that review to thereview index 118. - The
review index 118 may include a web document index, e.g., an inverted index that associates terms, phrases, and/or n-grams with web documents. Web documents can be any user-generatedreviews 126 submitted to theonline platform 101 and accessible over the Internet. In some examples, theindexing engine 116 may work with one or more crawlers. A crawler searches for user-generatedreviews 126 accessible via the Internet and returns content (including metadata) for the user-generatedreviews 126. In some implementations, the user-generatedreviews 126 are part of theonline platform 101 and accessible to theindexing engine 116 without a crawler. Theindexing engine 116 may use the content and/or metadata to generate and update thereview index 118. Thereview index 118 may be stored on a tangible computer-readable storage device, for instance disk, flash, cache memory, or a combination of these, configured to store data in a semi-permanent or non-transient form. In some examples, thereview index 118 may be stored in a combination of various memories. - The
query engine 114 may receivesearch queries 108 from requestors, such as theclient device 152, analyze the search queries 108 to determine how to search thereview index 118, and to initiate the search of thereview index 118. A user may submit asearch query 108, e.g., a word, a phrase, a list of words, etc. to thesearch engine 102. Thesearch engine 102, specifically thequery engine 114, uses thereview index 118 to identify the items that are returned in response to thesearch query 108. - The
query system 112 may be in communication with client device(s) 152 over anetwork 150.Network 150 may be for example, the Internet, a cellular network, a wired or wireless local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), etc. Thenetwork 150 may represent multiple types of networks. Via thenetwork 150, thequery system 112 may communicate with and transmit data to/fromclient devices 152. - The
client device 152 may be an example ofcomputer device 800, as depicted inFIG. 8 . For example, theclient device 152 may be a personal computer, a mobile phone, a tablet, a laptop, a wearable device, a smart television, or the like. Theclient device 152 may include one ormore processors 154 formed in a substrate configured to execute one or more machine executable instructions or pieces of software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Theprocessors 154 can be semiconductor-based - that is, the processors can include semiconductor material that can perform digital logic. Theclient device 152 can also include one ormore computer memories 155. Thememories 155, for example, a main memory, may be configured to store one or more pieces of data, either temporarily, permanently, semi-permanently, or a combination thereof. Thememories 155 may include any type of storage device that stores information in a format that can be read and/or executed by the one ormore processors 154. Thememories 155 may store applications, modules and/or engines that, when executed by the one ormore processors 154, perform certain operations. In some implementations, the applications, modules, or engines, may be stored in an external storage device and loaded into thememory 155. - The applications may include any number of applications configured to execute on the
client device 152, such as an operating system, a messaging application, shopping applications, editing applications, search assistants, maps, etc. In particular, the applications include asearch application 156. In some examples, thesearch application 156 may be a browser application that is operable to receive web page code (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, etc.) and render the web page for presentation to a user of theclient device 152. In some examples, thesearch application 156 may be operable to search a specific corpus, e.g., items offered for sale, properties for rent, restaurants, etc. In some examples, thesearch application 156 can display a map with a list ofentities 128, where thesearch application 156 can identify one or more review search results 120 on the map. - The
client device 152 may include one or more input devices, such as touch screen, keyboard, mouse, pointer, a microphone, a camera, one or more physical buttons, etc. The input devices may initiate input events, such as scrolling, link selection, cursor movement, which can be received and analyzed by thesearch application 156. Theclient device 152 may also include communications devices operable to send and receive data from other computing devices, such as another client, servers,search engine 102, etc., over one or more networks, such asnetwork 150. - In some examples, as shown in
FIG. 1B , thereview search result 120 identifies or includes a set of user-generatedreviews 126, where each user-generatedreview 126 includes content that is responsive to the search term(s) 110 specified by thesearch query 108. For example, thequery engine 114 may receive the search term(s) 110 specified by thesearch query 108 and obtain the relevant user-generatedreviews 126 by searching thereview index 118. In some examples, thereview search result 120 includes video reviews (or links to the video reviews). For example, thesearch engine 102 may obtain (or search) transcriptions of the video reviews, and, if the transcriptions include the search term(s) 110, those video results are identified. In some examples, thereview search result 120 includes images (or photos) that are responsive to the search term(s) 110. For example, thesearch engine 102 may employ one or more image recognition comparison tools to search within the images (or photos) of the user-generated reviews (e.g., a search within photos for “golden retriever” to see the UGR photos of golden retrievers). - In some examples, the
search engine 102 provides these user-generated reviews 126 (or portions thereof) in acomparison layout 162 on the user interface 160 of theclient device 152 so that the user can compare theentities 128 in a single place/page (e.g., without having to switch between tabs). Thecomparison layout 162 may be a user interface design that is populated with user-generated reviews 126 (or portions thereof) formultiple entities 128 in a manner that allows the user to compare the relevant user-generatedreviews 126 formultiple entities 128. As shown inFIG. 1B , thecomparison layout 162 includes user-generated reviews 126 (or portions thereof) for a first entity 128-1 and user-generated reviews 126 (or portion thereof) for a second entity 128-2, where the user-generatedreviews 126 relate to one ormore search terms 110 of thesearch query 108. In some examples, thecomparison layout 162 includes a column grid layout of entities 128 (e.g., side by side), which allows users to compare theentities 128 in a single place/page (rather than having to switch between tabs, for example). Users can issue a query with another term, thereby repopulating the list of hotels based on the user-generatedreviews 126 that are responsive to the new query. - In some examples, the
comparison layout 162 is populated with snippets (e.g., portions of the user-generated reviews 126) that relate to the search term(s) 110). For example, thequery engine 114 may obtain relevant snippets from the user-generatedreviews 126 so users can see many reviews at once without having to sift through a long review to find the relevant sentence. In some examples, only the relevant portion is surfaced, and users may click to see the full review. In further detail, the group of user-generatedreviews 126 relating to the first entity 128-1 may include snippets of user-generatedreviews 126 that correspond to the first entity 128-1, and the group of user-generatedreviews 126 relating to the second entity 128-2 may include snippets of user-generatedreviews 126 that correspond to the second entity 128-2. In this manner, for a single entity, users will have the ability to see several short, on-topic sentences pertinent to theirsearch query 108. - Also, the user will have the ability to quickly compare the relevant portions of the first entity 128-1 to relevant portions of the second entity 128-2 to assist the user in comparing the
various entities 128. In some examples, users can access the full review by either expanding a review snippet in-line or by linking to a different page. For example, in response to a user-provided action taken with respect to a snippet of a user-generated review 126 (e.g., the user clicks on the snippet), the entire contents of the user-generatedreview 126 is displayed. In some examples, snippets are not created, but rather the entire contents of the user-generatedreview 126 are displayed in thecomparison layout 162. - In some examples, the user may select the list of
entities 128 used in populating thecomparison layout 162. In a hotel example, the user may select five hotels for comparison and then submit a search query 108 (e.g., “bed bugs”), resulting in population of thecomparison layout 162 with the user-generated reviews 126 (or snippets) that pertain to thesearch query 108 across the five selected hotels. If no user reviews are responsive to thesearch query 108, thesearch system 100 may indicate in thecomparison layout 162 that no such reviews were found. - In some examples, as further explained with respect to
FIGS. 1E through 1H , the user can use the user-generatedreviews 126 to filter the results of a primary search. For example, a user may search a corpus of entities 128 (e.g., a product catalog, a service product catalog, webpages, etc.) to obtain alist 121 ofentities 128 responsive to a primary query (e.g.,search query 108A). For example, a user may search a database of products for “display monitor” and then receive alist 121 of display monitors, or the user may perform a web search for “hotels in Milwaukee” and then receive alist 121 of different hotels in Milwaukee. In some examples, the user is able to filter thesearch result 120A of thesearch query 108A based on keyword searching within the user-generatedreviews 126 to obtain thereview search result 120. For example, the user can submit asearch query 108B to search for “bed bugs” within the user-generatedreviews 126 across the list 121 (which was the result of thesearch query 108A), and then receive a list of hotels (e.g., a filtered list) whose user-generatedreviews 126 are responsive to the search criteria “bed bugs.” The filteredlist 123 and the relevant portions of the user-generatedreviews 126 may be populated within thecomparison layout 162, - In some examples, the user can remove/eliminate one or
more entities 128 from thecomparison layout 162. In some examples, when anentity 128 is removed from thecomparison layout 162, analternative entity 128 may be suggested to the user and take the previous entity’s place. For example, referring toFIG. 1C , the user has removed the second entity 128-2. In some examples, in response to the removal of the second entity 128-2, thesearch engine 102 may identify a suggested entity 151 (e.g., entity 128-3) to take the place of the removed second entity 128-2. Then, if the user selects the suggestedentity 151, as shown inFIG. 1D , thesearch engine 102 may populate thecomparison layout 162 with the third entity’s user-generatedreviews 126 pertaining to the search terms(s) 110. -
FIGS. 1E through 1G illustrate various examples of filtering primary search results using the user-generatedreviews 126. For example, referring toFIG. 1E , thesearch engine 102 may receive asearch query 108A (e.g., a primary search query) to search a plurality of entities 128 (e.g., a product catalog, a service product catalog, webpages, etc.) and obtain asearch result 120A responsive to thesearch query 108A. Thesearch query 108A may be an example of thesearch query 108 ofFIG. 1A . Referring toFIG. 1F , a user may enter one or more search terms into asearch box 113 defined on the user interface 160 of thesearch application 156 of theclient device 152 to submit thesearch query 108A. The search result 120A includes alist 121 that identifies two ormore entities 128 that correspond to one or more search terms of thesearch query 108A. For example, thelist 121 may include a list ofentities 128 such as a first entity 128-1, a second entity 128-2, and a third entity 128-3 through entity 128-M. - Also, referring to
FIG. 1F , the user interface 160 may displayentity information 129 about eachrespective entity 128 included within thelist 121. In some examples, theentity information 129 may be similar to information included in a search result for the entity on a search result page. In some examples, theentity information 129 displays a link that, when selected, initiates an action such as taking the user to the web page for/about theentity 128. In some examples, theentity information 129 includes other information about theentity 128 such as a short description and/or location of theentity 128. With respect to the hotel example, thelist 121 may identify the relevant hotels pertaining to thesearch query 108 as well as other information about the hotels such as the location, an image, a link to the hotel’s webpage, etc. For example, a user may search for “hotels in Milwaukee” and obtain a list of hotels in the Milwaukee area. - Referring to
FIG. 1E , thesearch engine 102 may receive asearch query 108B (e.g., a secondary search query) to filter thesearch result 120A to obtain a filteredlist 123. The filteredlist 123 may identify the list ofentities 128, and eachentity 128 may be associated withentity information 129 as described above. Thesearch query 108B may be an example of thesearch query 108 ofFIG. 1A . The filteredlist 123 identifies theentities 128 whose user-generatedreviews 126 are responsive to thesearch query 108B. Referring toFIG. 1F , the user interface 160 of thesearch application 156 may define areview search box 115 in which the user enters one or more search terms to submit thesearch query 108B, which filters thesearch result 120B. In some examples, the user interface 160 defines a plurality offilters 131, where one of thefilters 131 is thereview search box 115 to search the user-generatedreviews 126. Thesearch engine 102 may search thereview index 118 to identify the user-generatedreviews 126 for theentities 128 included within thelist 121 that correspond to the search terms(s) of thesearch query 108B. Referring toFIG. 1G , thesearch engine 102 may return a filteredlist 123 that identifies theentities 128 whose user-generatedreviews 126 are responsive to the search terms(s) of thesearch query 108B. In some examples, the filtered list 123 (and relevant portions of the user-generated reviews 126) are provided on thecomparison layout 162 ofFIG. 1B . The filteredlist 123 may be a subset of thelist 121, e.g., a first entity 128-1, a third entity 128-3 and a fourth entity 128-4 through P entity 128-P, where P is less than M. In some examples, the user can search the user-generatedreviews 126 to identify a list ofentities 128 by submitting a primary search query (e.g.,search query 108A). - In some examples, in response to the user-generated
reviews 126 being searched within the context of a primary search (e.g.,search query 108A) or a secondary search query (e.g.,search query 108B), thesearch engine 102 may rank the list ofentities 128 based on each entity’s user-generatedreviews 126 relevance to the search term(s) 110. For example, a user may submit asearch query 108 such as “bed bugs” and thesearch engine 102 may search the user-generatedreviews 126 for the search criteria “bed bugs” and identify the user-generatedreviews 126 that contain the search criteria “bed bugs.” Thesearch engine 102 may identify whichentities 128 correspond to the user-generatedreviews 126 that contain the search criteria “bed bugs.” In some examples, thesearch engine 102 may rank the identifiedentities 128 based on the entity’s user-generatedreviews 126 relevance to the search term(s) 110. In some examples, the ranking may be based on the occurrence of the search term(s) 110 within a respective entity’s user-generatedreviews 126. For example, if the occurrence of term “bed bugs” in the user-generatedreviews 126 pertaining to the first entity 128-1 is relatively high, the first entity 128-1 may be ranked higher thanother entities 128. In some examples, thesearch engine 102 may rank the identifiedentities 128 based on other signals related to the user-generatedreviews 126 such as helpfulness, review quality, review length, and/or the time associated when the user-generatedreviews 126 were posted. - Referring to
FIG. 1H , in some examples, thesearch application 156 is configured to display aninteractive map 183 and the locations of one ormore entities 128. Theinteractive map 183 may be provided as part of a web mapping service that is used in conjunction with thesearch application 156. Theinteractive map 183 may provide detailed information about geographical regions and sites around the world. For example, if the user is looking for accommodation options (or any type of entity 128), theinteractive map 183 may be populated with entities 128 (e.g., hotels, vacation rentals, campgrounds, etc.) within a certain region (e.g., based on a previous search or interactions with the interactive map 183). As shown inFIG. 1H , theinteractive map 183 displays the location of a first entity 128-1, a second entity 128-2, and a third entity 128-3. - The
search system 100 may provide the ability to search within the user-generatedreviews 126 and provide that search result on the interactive map 183 (in conjunction with the location of a particular entity 128). For example, the search result for the first entity 128-1 is provided in a location proximate to the location of the first entity 128-1. In some examples, a user can choose which terms to search within the user-generatedreviews 126. For example, a user may enter one or more search terms within areview search box 181 on the user interface 160, and then receive the user-generated reviews 126 (or snippets) for theentities 128 on theinterface map 183. Theinteractive map 183 may display the user-generated reviews 126 (or snippets) for the first entity 128-1, the second entity 128-2, and the third entity 128-3. In some examples, theinteractive map 183 provides the search results as aggregated summaries. - In some examples, if the user searches for “wifi”, the
interactive map 183 may display the user-generated reviews 126 (or snippets) that are responsive to the term “wifi” for the first entity 128-1, the second entity 128-1, and the third entity 128-3. In some examples, for eachentity 128 displayed on theinteractive map 183, an aggregated summary may be displayed. For example, with respect to the first entity 128-1, theinteractive map 183 may display a UI element (next to the location of the first entity 128-1) that indicates “fast wifi (18)”, where the number 18 indicates the number of reviews that contain the term “fast wifi.” In some examples, the user can then click on the user interface 160 to show all the reviews relating to the term “fast wifi.” With respect to the second entity 128-2, theinteractive map 183 may display a UI element (next to the location of the second entity 128-2) that indicates “slow wifi (6)”, where the number 6 indicates the number of reviews that contain the term “slow wifi.” In some examples, the user can then click on the user interface 160 to show all the reviews relating to the term “slow wifi.” - In some examples, review sentiments (whether as aggregated summaries or individual quotes) may be provided on the
interactive map 183. The review sentiments may be keywords (e.g.,keywords 313 ofFIG. 3 ), which can be terms that are most often mentioned in user reviews. For example, with respect to hotels, the review sentiments may be beach, atmosphere, food, fitness, etc. In some examples, in response to theentities 128 being populated on theinteractive map 183, the user-generatedreviews 126 may be searched according to one or more review sentiments (e.g., keywords), and those search results may be provided on theinteractive map 183. For example, with respect to the first entity 128-1, theinteractive map 183 may provide a UI element that indicates “close to grocery store (12)” and/or “comfortable beds (3).” - In some examples, the
search system 100 may provide individual snippets and/or provide various types of aggregate data. In some examples, thesearch system 100 may identify one or more categories or sub-categories pertaining to a search query. For example, if a user queries “wifi”, thesearch system 100 may provide aggregates of categories pertaining to wifi (e.g. speed, reliability, cost), where the categories can be predefined or generated based on a text analysis. In some examples, thesearch system 100 may provide sentiment aggregates for one or more of those categories (or each of those categories), as well as an overall aggregation of whether the wifi was good or bad, based on all those factors. For example, in response to a search for “wifi”, thesearch system 100 may provide aggregate data with respect to how many users say the wifi is fast, how many users say the wifi is slow, how many users say the wifi is reliable versus spotty, how many users say the wifi expensive versus free, how many users just say “nice/good/great” wifi versus “bad/poor” wifi, etc. In some examples, thesearch system 100 can determine and provide how many (or what percent of) users say overall good wifi versus overall bad wifi. As such, thesearch system 100 may provide the ability to aggregate queries by sub-category (e.g. speed, reliability, cost) and provide a holistic aggregate across all sub-categories. - In some examples, the
review search result 120 includes audio summaries. For example, thesearch system 100 may perform text-to-speech on the relevant portions of the user-generatedreviews 126 and/or obtain the relevant moments from videos to construct audio compilations of what people say about aparticular entity 128 or what they say about a particular thing about theentity 128. In some examples, thesearch system 100 provides the ability to search within video reviews left by users, and, in some examples, thesearch system 100 can compile video clips on those keywords or topics for people (e.g., “show me video clips of room exteriors in a compilation”, “show me clips of people talking about the wifi in a compilation”, etc.). - In some examples, the
online platform 101 and/or thesearch engine 102 is configured to operate in conjunction with an augmented reality (AR) application and/or a virtual reality (VR) application. In some examples, the AR/VR application may provide any of the review searching and display techniques discussed herein. In some examples, the user ofclient device 152 may execute an AR application that analyzes image data captured by theclient device 152. Anentity 128 within the image data may be identified, and thesearch engine 102 may obtain and display user-generated reviews 126 (or information about the user-generated reviews 126) that pertain to the identifiedentity 128. In some examples, thesearch query 108 is identified based on image data (e.g., review results may be obtained based on image recognition). For example, a user may be capturing image data within a store, and for one or more products identified within the image data, the user-generatedreviews 126 may be obtained and displayed by theclient device 152. In some examples, theclient device 152 is a wearable product that can display and interact with the search results as theclient device 152encounters entities 128. These techniques could be used in real time to compare products in a store or entities on the street (for example), but also a user could identify entities 128 (e.g., “pin” entities) to create a comparison grip to search within. - In some examples, reviews can be searched and obtained based on map (e.g., geo-based) coordinates of a user (which may be an AR user). In some examples, the
search system 100 can provide suggestions (e.g., intelligent or smart suggestions) based on the searchable user-generated reviews 126 (e.g., without the user submitting a search). - In some examples, using the
online platform 101, users can submit indications of tips (or suggestions) (also referred to as “UGC tips”) with respect to locations (e.g., using the interactive map 183). For example, a user can drop a pin (e.g., mark a location on the interactive map 183) and leave a UGC tip (e.g., “this path right here is a shortcut and really pretty walk”, “careful of pickpockets in this area”, etc.). In some examples, the user can walk down the street, and thesearch system 100 may provide the UGC tips as the user walks around. Furthermore, in some examples, users may submit audio clips of themselves talking about something at a particular place, and a user may have the ability, based on geo-coordinates, to search within those audio files. In some examples, the user can be physically walking around and can hear audio summaries or read aggregated summaries. In some examples, the user is on a computer, and can hover over a map entity and can search within the reviews to learn about what people are saying about a particular tree or bench in central park. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an example of acomparison layout 262 of auser interface 260 according to an aspect. Thesearch engine 102 ofFIG. 1A may provide asearch result 220 in thecomparison layout 262 in response to a search query (e.g.,search query 108A orsearch query 108B. As shown inFIG. 2 , theuser interface 260 may define asearch box 211 in which the user can enter one or more search terms 210 (e.g., “beaches”). In response to the submission of the search term(s) 210, thecomparison layout 262 is populated with portions of user-generatedreviews 226 so that the user can compare theentities 128 in a single place/page (e.g., without having to switch between tabs). Thecomparison layout 262 includes snippets of the user-generatedreviews 226, where a particular snippet (from one user-generated review 226) is indicated by a dot. Thecomparison layout 262 includes relevant snippets of user-generatedreviews 226 for a first entity 228-1 (e.g., Hotel A), relevant snippets of user-generatedreviews 226 for a second entity 228-2 (e.g., Hotel B), relevant snippets of user-generatedreviews 226 for a third entity 228-3 (e.g., Hotel C), and relevant snippets of user-generatedreviews 226 for a fourth entity 228-4 (e.g., Hotel D). In some examples, thecomparison layout 262 includes a column grid layout of entities (e.g., side by side), which lets users compare the entities in a single place/page (rather than having to switch between tabs). Users can query for another term using thesearch box 211, thereby repopulating the list of hotels based on the user-generatedreviews 126 that are responsive to the new query. In some examples, users can click on words within the user-generatedreviews 226 to repopulate thecomparison layout 262 with relevant snippets related to whatever word is selected. -
FIG. 3 illustrates an example of auser interface 360 depicting asearch box 311 and a plurality ofselectable keywords 313. Theuser interface 360 may be an example of a search box used in the user interface 160 ofFIGS. 1A through 1H and/or theuser interface 260 ofFIG. 2 and may include any of the details discussed with reference to those figures. In some examples, a user may enter one or more search terms into thesearch box 311 to search the user-generated reviews. Also, in the example ofFIG. 3 , instead of typing search terms, a user may select one of theselectable keywords 313, which then returns user-generated reviews that include the selectedkeyword 313. For example, thesearch engine 102 ofFIG. 1A may determinekeywords 313 from the user-generated reviews, and then provide thosekeywords 313 on theuser interface 360, where thekeywords 313 function as pivot/search-chips, so the user does not have to actually type the query. In the example ofFIG. 3 , thekeywords 313 are those mentioned most often in user reviews. Also, theuser interface 360 may define a “most helpful”selectable option 315 that, when selected, causes theuser interface 360 to display a select number of user-generated reviews that are determined as “most helpful” based on one or more signals such as helpfulness, review quality, review length, and/or the time associated when the user-generated reviews were posted. Also, theuser interface 360 may define a “all reviews”selectable option 317 that, when selected, causes theuser interface 360 to display all the reviews. -
FIG. 4 illustrates an example of asearch system 400 that searches a primary corpus (e.g., web pages, product, catalog, service provider catalog, etc.) and generates a search result to be displayed as aranked list 485 of responsive entities on a user interface 460 of asearch application 456 of aclient device 452 in which one or more of the ranking signals are derived from user-generated reviews 426 according to an aspect. Thesearch system 400 may be an example of thesearch system 100 ofFIGS. 1A through 1H and may include any of the details discussed with respect to those figures as well as the details fromFIGS. 2 through 3 . - The
search system 400 includes asearch engine 470 and asearch engine 410. In some examples, thesearch engine 470 is a separate module from thesearch engine 410, where thesearch engine 470 is communicatively coupled to thesearch engine 410 in order to exchange information between the two modules. In some examples, thesearch engine 410 and thesearch engine 470 are included in the same module (e.g., the search engine 410 (or the functionalities of the search engine 410) are part of the search engine 470). For example, thesearch engine 470 may search the entities as well as the user-generated reviews 426 according to any of the techniques described with respect to the previous figures. In some examples, thesearch engine 410 may be an example of thesearch engine 102 ofFIGS. 1A through 1H and may include any of the details discussed with respect to those figures. - If the
search system 400 receives a query that relates to “Hotels in Milwaukee,” thesearch engine 470 may obtain a list of entities from the primary corpus related to “Hotels in Milwaukee.” Thesearch engine 470 may then rank the list of entities (e.g., web pages) according to a plurality of ranking signals, where at least some of the ranking signals are derived from the user-generated reviews 426. For example, if the list of entities identifies a first web page corresponding to a first hotel, a second web page corresponding to a second hotel, and a third web page corresponding to a third hotel, the list of entities may be ranked according to the user-generated reviews 426 about the first hotel, the second hotel, and the third hotel. For instance, if the rating score (e.g., an overall or average rating score) and/or an analysis about the content of the user-generated reviews 426 indicates that users have a relatively low impression of the first hotel, the first hotel may be down-ranked. Conversely, if the rating score and/or an analysis about the content of the user-generated reviews 426 indicates that the users have a relatively high impression of the first hotel, the first hotel may be up-ranked. In another example, asearch system 400 that searches a product database may receive a query of “headphones for running” and may identify several items responsive to “headphones” but not “running.” In such an example thesearch system 400 may rank a responsive item where “running” or “run” is mentioned in user reviews for the item ahead of other responsive items that lack user reviews mentioning “running” or “run”. - The
search engine 470 includes aquery system 476. Thequery system 476 enables thesearch engine 470 to receive and respond to queries. Also, thequery system 476 may be responsible for searching one or more indices, represented collectively as item index 486. The item index 486 may include a web document index, e.g., an inverted index that associates terms, phrases, and/or n-grams with web documents. Web documents can be any content accessible over the Internet, such as web pages, images, videos, PDF documents, word processing documents, audio recordings, etc. - The
query system 476 includes aquery engine 478 and anindexing engine 480. For example, theindexing engine 480 may add items to an item index 486, update items in the item index 486, and delete items from the item index 486. In some examples, theindexing engine 480 may work with one or more crawlers. A crawler searches for items accessible via the Internet and returns content (including metadata) for the items. Theindexing engine 480 may use the content and/or metadata to generate and update the item index 486. In some examples, theitem index 484 used for searching entities (e.g., web content) is different from thereview index 118 ofFIG. 1A . - Generally, the
query engine 478 may obtain responsive items from the item index 486, rank the responsive items, generate a search result for at least some of the responsive items, and provide the search results to the query requestor, e.g. theclient device 452. For example, thequery engine 478 may receive queries from requestors, such as theclient device 452, analyze the query to determine how to search item index 486, and to initiate the search of the item index 486. A user may submit a query, e.g., a word, a phrase, a list of words, an image, a recording etc., tosearch engine 470. Thesearch engine 470, specifically thequery engine 478, uses one or more indices (e.g., the item index 486) to identify items that are returned in response to the query. Items returned to thequery engine 478 in response to the query may also be referred to as responsive items. Thequery engine 478 may generate a search result for some or all of the responsive items. - The
query engine 478 may rank the responsive items. Ranking can include applying one or more ranking signals to a responsive item. Ranking signals can include many factors. Non-limiting examples are a PageRank for the item, a relevance score for the item, a source of the item, and many others. In addition, the ranking signals may include one or more ranking signals derived from the user-generated reviews 426 associated with the entities of the responsive items found by thequery engine 478. For example, thequery engine 478 may identify the entities associated with the responsive items. For example, if the list of entities identifies a first hotel, a second hotel, and a third hotel, thequery engine 478 may identify the first hotel, the second hotel, and the third hotel as the entities associated with the responsive items. - Then, the
query engine 478 or thesearch engine 410 may obtain the user-generated reviews 426 associated with the identified entities. For example, thequery engine 478 or thesearch engine 410 may search thereview index 118 ofFIG. 1A using the identified entities as search criteria to obtain the user-generated reviews 426 that correspond to the identified entities. Thequery system 476 or thesearch engine 410 may derive one or more ranking signals based on the user-generated reviews 426. For example, thequery system 476 or thesearch engine 410 may obtain rating scores associated with the relevant user-generated reviews and/or analyze the content of the user-generated reviews to provide a signal indicating a level of user impression of the underlying entity. In addition, the ranking signals related to the user-generated reviews 426 may include signals related to helpfulness, review quality, review length, and/or the time associated when the user-generated reviews were posted. Based on the ranking signal(s) associated with the user-generated reviews (in conjunction with other types of ranking signals), thequery engine 478 may rank the list of web items to generate the rankedlist 485. - The
search engine 470 may include one ormore processors 472 formed in a substrate, an operating system (not shown) and one ormore computer memories 474. Thecomputer memories 474 may represent any kind of memory (e.g., RAM, flash, cache, disk, tape, etc.). Thememory 474 may represent multiple kinds of memory. In some examples (not shown), thememory 474 may include external storage, e.g., memory physically remote from but accessible bysearch engine 470. - The
query system 476 may be in communication with client device(s) 452 over anetwork 450.Network 450 may be for example, the Internet, a cellular network, a wired or wireless local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), etc. Thenetwork 450 may represent multiple types of networks. Via thenetwork 450, thequery system 476 may communicate with and transmit data to/fromclient devices 452. Theclient device 452 may be an example of theclient device 152 ofFIGS. 1A through 1H and may include any of the details discussed with respect to those figures. Theclient device 452 may include one ormore processors 454 formed in a substrate configured to execute one or more machine executable instructions or pieces of software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Theprocessors 454 can be semiconductor-based - that is, the processors can include semiconductor material that can perform digital logic. Theclient device 452 can also include one ormore computer memories 455. Thememories 455, for example, a main memory, may be configured to store one or more pieces of data, either temporarily, permanently, semi-permanently, or a combination thereof. Thememories 455 may include any type of storage device that stores information in a format that can be read and/or executed by the one ormore processors 454. Thememories 455 may store applications, modules and/or engines that, when executed by the one ormore processors 454, perform certain operations. In some examples, the applications, modules, or engines, may be stored in an external storage device and loaded into thememory 455. - The applications may include any number of applications configured to execute on the
client device 452, such as an operating system, a messaging application, shopping applications, editing applications, search assistants, maps, etc. In particular, the applications include asearch application 456. Thesearch application 456 is operable to receive web page code (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, etc.) and render the web page for presentation to a user of theclient device 452. -
FIG. 5 illustrates aflowchart 500 depicting example operation of a search system according to an aspect. Although theflowchart 500 ofFIG. 5 illustrates the operations in sequential order, it will be appreciated that this is merely an example, and that additional or alternative operations may be included. Further, operations ofFIG. 5 and related operations may be executed in a different order than that shown, or in a parallel or overlapping fashion. In some examples, the operations of theflowchart 500 may be combined with one or more of the operations of theflowchart 600 ofFIG. 6A , theflowchart 650 ofFIG. 6B , and/or theflowchart 700 ofFIG. 7 . Although theflowchart 500 is described with reference to the search system ofFIGS. 1A through 1H , theflowchart 500 may be applicable to any of the embodiments discussed herein. Theflowchart 500 relates to a method for searching within user-generated reviews for multiple entities. - The
flowchart 500 describes operations that enable searching within user-generatedreviews 126 acrossmultiple entities 128 of a particular type. Themultiple entities 128 may be selected by the user or identified as a result of a previous search. Thereview search result 120 can be provided in acomparison layout 162 that identifies user-generatedreviews 126 formultiple entities 128 that corresponds to the search term(s) 110. In other words, a user can search within and compare user-generatedreviews 126 for several entities at once. A user may submit a search query 108 (e.g., “kitchen”), and thesearch engine 102 obtains user-generatedreviews 126 for multiple entities 128 (e.g., hotel A, hotel B, hotel C, etc.) that meet the search term(s) 110. Then, thesearch engine 102 provides these user-generated reviews 126 (or portions thereof) in thecomparison layout 162 so that the user can compare theentities 128 in a single place/page (e.g., without having to switch between tabs). -
Operation 502 includes receiving asearch query 108 to search within a plurality of user-generatedreviews 126 relating to a plurality ofentities 128 from aclient device 152. The user may enter text into a search box (e.g.,search box 211 ofFIG. 2 orsearch box 311 ofFIG. 3 ) on the user interface 160 of asearch application 156 to submit asearch query 108. In some examples, selection of a selectable keyword (e.g.,selectable keywords 313 ofFIG. 3 ) provided on the user interface 160 causes the submission of asearch query 108. In response to the submission of thesearch query 108, the query system 112 (e.g., the query engine 114) may receive thesearch query 108 over thenetwork 150 from theclient device 152. The user-generatedreviews 126 are indexed (e.g., an inverted index) and searchable. In some examples, the user-generatedreviews 126 are not necessarily stored within a traditional database, but rather can be stored as a synthetic corpus of web documents that are indexed and searchable (e.g., similar to the way web pages are indexed and searchable by a web browser). -
Operation 504 includes identifying, in response to thesearch query 108, a set of user-generatedreviews 126 from the plurality of user-generatedreviews 126 that corresponds to one ormore search terms 110 of thesearch query 108, where the set of user-generatedreviews 126 includes a user-generatedreview 126 for a first entity 128-1 and a user-generatedreview 126 for a second entity 128-2. The first entity 128-1 is different from the second entity 128-2 but relates to the same type of entity as the second entity 128-2. For example, thequery engine 114 may search the user-generatedreviews 126 to identify the user-generatedreviews 126 that meet the search term(s) 110 of thesearch query 108. In some examples, thequery engine 114 searches areview index 118 associated with the user-generatedreviews 126 to identify the set of user-generated reviews. For example, in response to a user posting a user-generatedreview 126 to theonline platform 101, the user-generatedreview 126 is parsed and areview index 118 is updated by anindexing engine 116 to add a review to thereview index 118. In response to thesearch query 108, thereview index 118 can be quickly searched to identify the user-generatedreviews 126 that contain one or more search term(s) 110 of thesearch query 108. In this manner, although the corpus of user-generatedreviews 126 may quickly change over time, thesearch system 100 may still retrieve the relevant user-generatedreviews 126 acrossmultiple entities 128 in a relatively quick manner. -
Operation 506 includes providing at least a portion of the user-generatedreview 126 for the first entity 128-1 and at least a portion of the user-generatedreview 126 for the second entity 128-2 for simultaneous display on acomparison layout 162 of a user interface 160 of theclient device 152. For example, thesearch engine 102 provides these user-generated reviews 126 (or portions thereof) in acomparison layout 162 on the user interface 160 of theclient device 152 so that the user can compare theentities 128 in a single place/page (e.g., without having to switch between tabs). Thecomparison layout 162 may be a user interface design that is populated with user-generated reviews 126 (or portions thereof) formultiple entities 128 in a manner that allows the user to compare the relevant user-generatedreviews 126 formultiple entities 128. As shown inFIG. 1B , thecomparison layout 162 includes user-generated reviews 126 (or snippets) for a first entity 128-1 and user-generated reviews 126 (or snippets) for a second entity 128-2, where the user-generatedreviews 126 relate to one ormore search terms 110 of thesearch query 108. In some examples, thecomparison layout 162 includes a column grid layout of entities 128 (e.g., side by side), which allows users to compare theentities 128 in a single place/page. Users can query for another term, thereby repopulating the list of entities based on the user-generatedreviews 126 that are responsive to the new query. - In some examples, the
search engine 102 may obtain relevant snippets from the user-generatedreviews 126 so users can see many reviews at once, and they do not have to sift through a long review to find the relevant sentence. In some examples, the relevant portion is surfaced, and users may click to see the full review. Users can access the full review by either expanding in-line or going to a different page. For example, in response to a user-provided action taken with respect to a snippet of a user-generated review 126 (e.g., the user clicks on the snippet), the entire contents of the user-generatedreview 126 is displayed. In some examples, snippets are not created, but rather the entire contents of the user-generatedreview 126 are displayed in thecomparison layout 162. -
FIG. 6A illustrates aflowchart 600 depicting example operation of a search system according to an aspect. Although theflowchart 600 ofFIG. 6A illustrates the operations in sequential order, it will be appreciated that this is merely an example, and that additional or alternative operations may be included. Further, operations ofFIG. 6A and related operations may be executed in a different order than that shown, or in a parallel or overlapping fashion. In some examples, the operations of theflowchart 600 may be combined with one or more of the operations of theflowchart 500 ofFIG. 5 , theflowchart 650 ofFIG. 6B , and/or theflowchart 700 ofFIG. 7 . Although theflowchart 600 is described with reference to the search system ofFIGS. 1A through 1H , theflowchart 600 may be applicable to any of the embodiments discussed herein. Theflowchart 600 relates to generating (and ranking) a list ofentities 128 based on each entity’s user-generatedreviews 126 relevance to the search term(s) 110. - For example, a list of
entities 128 may be generated (and perhaps ranked) based on searching within the user-generatedreviews 126 and/or on the search term(s) 110 relevance to each entity’s user-generatedreviews 126. In some examples, the list ofentities 128 is the filteredlist 123 as a result of a secondary search query. In some examples, the list ofentities 128 is a list that was generated as a result of a primary search query. The list ofentities 128 identifies two or more entities as a result of thesearch query 108 within the user-generatedreviews 126. For example, a user may submit a search query 108 (e.g.,search query 108A orsearch query 108B) such as “free breakfast” and thesearch engine 102 may search the user-generatedreviews 126 for the search criteria “free breakfast” and identify the user-generatedreviews 126 that contain the search criteria “free breakfast.” Thesearch engine 102 may identify whichentities 128 correspond to the user-generatedreviews 126 that contain the search criteria “breakfast” using thereview index 118. For example, thereview index 118 may associate a web document (corresponding to a particular user-generated review 126) with an entity 128-1. - In some examples, the
search engine 102 may rank the identifiedentities 128 based on the entity’s user-generatedreviews 126 relevance to the search term(s) 110. In some examples, the ranking may be based on the occurrence of the search term(s) 110 within a respective entity’s user-generatedreviews 126. For example, if the occurrence of terms “free breakfast” in the user-generatedreviews 126 pertaining to the first entity 128-1 is relatively high, the first entity 128-1 may be ranked higher thanother entities 128. -
Operation 602 includes receiving asearch query 108 to search within a plurality of user-generatedreviews 126 relating to a plurality ofentities 128 from aclient device 152. Thesearch query 108 includes one ormore search terms 110. The user may enter text into a search box (e.g.,review search box 115 ofFIGS. 1F and 1G ,search box 211 ofFIG. 2 , orsearch box 311 ofFIG. 3 ) on the user interface 160 of thesearch application 156 to submit a search query 108 (e.g.,search query 108A orsearch query 108B). In some examples, selection of a selectable word or keyword (e.g.,selectable keywords 313 ofFIG. 3 ) provided on a user interface 160 causes the submission of asearch query 108. In response to the submission of thesearch query 108, the query system 112 (e.g., the query engine 114) may receive thesearch query 108 over thenetwork 150 from theclient device 152. The user-generatedreviews 126 are indexed and searchable. -
Operation 604 includes identifying, in response to thesearch query 108, a set of user-generatedreviews 126 from the plurality of user-generatedreviews 126 that corresponds to one ormore search terms 110 of thesearch query 108. For example, thequery engine 114 may search the user-generatedreviews 126 to identify the user-generatedreviews 126 that meet the search term(s) 110 of thesearch query 108. In some examples, thequery engine 114 searches areview index 118 associated with the user-generatedreviews 126 to identify the set of user-generatedreviews 126. For example, in response to a user posting a user-generatedreview 126 to theonline platform 101, the user-generatedreview 126 is stored as a web document, and areview index 118 is updated by anindexing engine 116 to add an item to thereview index 118. In response to thesearch query 108, thereview index 118 can be quickly searched to identify the user-generatedreviews 126 that contain one or more search term(s) 110 of thesearch query 108. In this manner, although the corpus of user-generatedreviews 126 may quickly change over time, thesearch system 100 may still retrieve the relevant user-generatedreviews 126 acrossmultiple entities 128 in a relatively quick manner. -
Operation 606 includes generating a list ofentities 128 based on the set of user-generatedreviews 126, where the list ofentities 128 includes a first entity 128-1 and a second entity 128-2. The second entity 128-2 is different from the first entity 128-1. For example, thesearch engine 102 may generate (or discover)entities 128 based on the search term(s) 110 of thesearch query 108. For example, a user may submit asearch query 108 such as “beaches” and thesearch engine 102 may search the user-generatedreviews 126 for the search criteria “beaches” and identify the user-generatedreviews 126 that contain the search criteria “beaches.” Then, thesearch engine 102 may identify whichentities 128 correspond to the user-generatedreviews 126 that contain the search criteria “beaches” using thereview index 118. In some examples, thesearch engine 102 may rank the identifiedentities 128 based on the entity’s user-generatedreviews 126 relevance to the search term(s) 110. In some examples, the ranking may be based on the occurrence of the search term(s) 110 within a respective entity’s user-generatedreviews 126. For example, if the occurrence of term “beaches” in the user-generatedreviews 126 pertaining to the first entity 128-1 is relatively high, the first entity 128-1 may be ranked higher thanother entities 128. -
Operation 608 includes providing the list ofentities 128 for display on a user interface 160 of aclient device 152. In some examples, thesearch engine 102 may provide the list ofentities 128 for display on the user interface 160 of thesearch application 156 of theclient device 152. In some examples, the list ofentities 128 is populated within thecomparison layout 162. In some examples, eachentity 128 on the list may includeentity information 129 that displays information about therespective entity 128 on the user interface 160. In some examples, theentity information 129 displays a link that when selected initiates an action such as taking the user to the web page of theentity 128. In some examples, theentity information 129 includes other information about theentity 128 such as a short description and/or location of theentity 128. With respect to the hotel example, the list ofentities 128 may identify the relevant hotels pertaining to thesearch query 108 as well as other information about the hotels such as the location, a link to the hotel’s webpage, etc. -
FIG. 6B illustrates aflowchart 650 depicting example operation of a search system according to an aspect. Although theflowchart 650 ofFIG. 6B illustrates the operations in sequential order, it will be appreciated that this is merely an example, and that additional or alternative operations may be included. Further, operations ofFIG. 6B and related operations may be executed in a different order than that shown, or in a parallel or overlapping fashion. In some examples, the operations of theflowchart 650 may be combined with one or more of the operations of theflowchart 500 ofFIG. 5 , theflowchart 600 ofFIG. 6A , and/or theflowchart 700 ofFIG. 7 . Although theflowchart 650 is described with reference to the search system ofFIGS. 1A through 1H , theflowchart 650 may be applicable to any of the embodiments discussed herein. Theflowchart 650 relates to generating a filteredlist 123 ofentities 128 based on searching within user-generatedreviews 126. - A user may search a corpus of entities 128 (e.g., a product catalog, a service product catalog, webpages, etc.) to obtain a
list 121 ofentities 128 that are responsive to asearch query 108A. For example, a user may search a database of products for “display monitor” and then receive alist 121 of display monitors, or the user may perform a web search for “hotels in Milwaukee” and then receive alist 121 of different hotels in Milwaukee. In some implementations, the query may just be a location, e.g., “Milwaukee” because the index being searched only includes hotels. In some examples, the user is able to filter thesearch result 120A of thesearch query 108A based on keyword searching within the user-generatedreviews 126 to obtain asearch result 120B, where thesearch result 120B includes a filteredlist 123 ofentities 128. For example, the user can submit a secondary query (e.g., thesearch query 108B) to search for “bed bugs” within the user-generatedreviews 126 across thelist 121 of hotels (which was the result of the primary search query (e.g.,search query 108A)), and then receive a filteredlist 123 whose user-generatedreviews 126 are responsive to the search criteria “bed bugs.” In some examples, the filteredlist 123 is populated on acomparison layout 162 along with snippets of the relevant portions of the user-generatedreviews 126. -
Operation 652 includes receiving a primary search query (e.g.,search query 108A) to search the corpus ofentities 128.Operation 654 includes obtaining, in response to the primary search query, asearch result 120A including alist 121 ofentities 128 that are responsive to the primary search query.Operation 656 includes receiving a secondary search query (e.g.,search query 108B) to search a plurality of user-generatedreviews 126 for thelist 121 ofentities 128 such that the secondary search query functions as a filter on thesearch result 120A.Operation 658 includes identifying a set of user-generatedreviews 126 associated with thelist 121 ofentities 128 from the plurality of user-generatedreviews 126.Operation 660 includes generating a filteredlist 123 ofentities 128 based on the set of user-generatedreviews 126, where the filteredlist 123 ofentities 128 includes a first entity 128-1 and a second entity 128-2. The second entity 128-2 is different from the first entity 128-1.Operation 662 includes providing the filteredlist 123 ofentities 128 for display on a user interface 160 of aclient device 152. -
FIG. 7 illustrates aflowchart 700 depicting example operation of a search system according to an aspect. Although theflowchart 700 ofFIG. 7 illustrates the operations in sequential order, it will be appreciated that this is merely an example, and that additional or alternative operations may be included. Further, operations ofFIG. 7 and related operations may be executed in a different order than that shown, or in a parallel or overlapping fashion. In some examples, the operations of theflowchart 700 may be combined with one or more of the operations of theflowchart 500 ofFIG. 5 , theflowchart 600 ofFIG. 6A , and/or theflowchart 650 ofFIG. 6B . Although theflowchart 700 is described with reference to thesearch system 400 ofFIG. 4 , theflowchart 700 may be applicable to any of the embodiments discussed herein. Theflowchart 700 describes operations that enable searching web pages and generating a search result to be displayed as aranked list 485 of web items on a user interface 460 of asearch application 456 of aclient device 452 in which one or more of the ranking signals are derived from the user-generated reviews 426 according to an aspect. - For example, the
query engine 478 may identify the entities associated with the responsive items. Then, thequery engine 478 or thesearch engine 410 may obtain the user-generated reviews 426 associated with the identified entities. Thequery system 476 or thesearch engine 410 may derive one or more ranking signals based on the user-generated reviews 426. For example, thequery system 476 or thesearch engine 410 may obtain rating scores associated with the relevant user-generated reviews and/or analyze the content of the user-generated reviews 426 to provide a signal indicating a level of user impression of the underlying entity. In addition, the ranking signals related to the user-generated reviews 426 may include signals related to helpfulness, review quality, review length, and/or the time associated when the user-generated reviews 426 were posted. Based on the ranking signal(s) associated with the user-generated reviews 426 (in conjunction with other types of ranking signals), thequery engine 478 may rank the list of web items to generate the rankedlist 485. -
Operation 702 includes receiving a search query to search web content from aclient device 452. For example, a user may enter text into a search box of asearch application 456 to search for content on the internet. The query system 476 (e.g., the query engine 478) may receive the search query over thenetwork 450 from theclient device 452. -
Operation 704 includes obtaining, in response to the search query, a list of responsive items. For example, thequery system 476 may search one or more indices, represented collectively as item index 486. The item index 486 may include a web document index, e.g., an inverted index that associates terms, phrases, and/or n-grams with web documents. Thequery engine 478 may obtain responsive items from the item index 486. -
Operation 706 includes identifying a plurality of entities associated with the list of responsive items. For example, thequery engine 478 may identify the entities associated with the responsive items. If the list of responsive items identifies a first hotel, a second hotel, and a third hotel, thequery engine 478 may identify the first hotel, the second hotel, and the third hotel as the entities associated with the responsive items. -
Operation 708 includes identifying a set of user-generated reviews associated with the plurality of entities from a plurality of user-generated reviews. Thequery engine 478 or thesearch engine 410 may obtain the user-generated reviews associated with the identified entities. For example, thequery engine 478 or thesearch engine 410 may search thereview index 118 ofFIG. 1A using the identified entities as search criteria to obtain the user-generated reviews that correspond to the identified entities. -
Operation 710 includes ranking the list of responsive items based on a plurality of ranking signals, where the plurality of ranking signals include one or more ranking signals derived from the set of user-generated reviews 426. For example, thequery system 476 or thesearch engine 410 may derive one or more ranking signals based on the user-generated reviews 426. For example, thequery system 476 or thesearch engine 410 may obtain rating scores associated with the relevant user-generated reviews and/or analyze the content of the user-generated reviews to provide a signal indicating a level of user impression of the underlying entity. In addition, the ranking signals related to the user-generated reviews 426 may include signals related to helpfulness, review quality, review length, and/or the time associated when the user-generated reviews 426 were posted. Based on the ranking signal(s) associated with the user-generated reviews 426 (in conjunction with other types of ranking signals), thequery engine 478 may rank the list of web items to generate the rankedlist 485. -
