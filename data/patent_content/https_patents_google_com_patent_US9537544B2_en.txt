Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to the field of wireless communications, and more specifically to methods, systems and apparatus for transmit diversity control related to propagation path conditions.
- Wireless transmission systems may use transmit diversity, whereby signals are transmitted to a receiver using a plurality of transmit antennas.
- a receiving communication device extracts the information from the transmitted signals.
- Multiple antenna elements may enhance spectral efficiency and capacity, allowing for more users to be simultaneously served over a given frequency band, while reducing signal degradation caused by multi-path and fading.
- Transmit diversity parameters may be applied to signals transmitted from two or more antennas, and may modify an effective power distribution detected by receivers, such as base stations.
- the transmitted signals may propagate along different paths and may reach the receiving communication device with different phases that may destructively interfere.
- the received signal quality may change at a receiver that may be attempting to detect a transmission from a mobile terminal, as well as a noise level created by a wireless terminal transmission in base stations attempting to detect signals from other wireless terminals.
- a signal-to-noise ratio perceived by base stations may change with varying parameters of transmit diversity control.
- the present invention applies to wireless communication systems that provide transmit diversity control algorithms related to the propagation path conditions, including systems that use uplink power control.
- transmit diversity control may achieve improved performance by, for example, allowing a larger change in a transmit diversity control algorithm parameter.
- a transmit diversity parameter may be, for example, a step size in a phase difference between signals transmitted on the respective plurality of antennas, or may be a smaller interval between changes in parameters.
- a faster rate of change of a transmit diversity parameter may allow faster adaptation of a transmit diversity control parameter to a varying propagation condition.
- a mobility parameter may characterize the stability of the propagation path.
- a mobility parameter may be related to changes in actual propagation and network conditions, and may apply to variability in a propagation path due to any conditions. Higher values of mobility parameter may correspond to fast variation in uplink propagation path loss, characteristic of a moving mobile terminal. However, a stationary mobile terminal may also experience varying path loss as a result of changes in the environment, such as other moving objects, movement of the holder of the terminal, rotation of the terminal, etc.
- Determination of a mobility parameter may be conducted using one or more of multiple parameters available to the mobile terminal.
- a mobility parameter that may be used may be a measure of signal quality, for example, a standard deviation of a signal quality of a received parameter across a window. This parameter may be used, for example, in lieu or in addition to a power difference. Other power differences or other similar parameters may be selected within the scope of this invention.
- the value of a mobility parameter may be determined by observing variations in power in the transmitted or received signals. For example, one method according to embodiments of the invention may detect a difference in power within a time window to detect changes in dynamics of propagation path. In some embodiments of the invention, one or both of phase difference and power ratio may be used to compute the value of the mobility parameter, which in turn may be used to provide flexibility and/or adaptability in cases where the channel amplitude and phase vary at different rates. For example, a phase-based mobility parameter may be used to adjust the transmit diversity phase difference step size and/or a power-based mobility parameter may be used to adjust the transmit diversity power ratio step size.
- Certain embodiments of the invention may provide one or more technical advantages.
- Implementation of the transmit diversity systems embodying the present invention may provide one or more technical advantages, including, for example, optimizing transmit signal power, improving effectiveness of transmit diversity control, improving power consumption at the transmitting communication device by lowering power needed to transmit signals, improving wireless communication system capacity by reducing interference among wireless communication users, improving transmission efficiency by selecting optimal algorithms and parameters that will mitigate fading and improve beam-forming, and/or improving performance in other ways as a result of implementation of embodiments of the present invention.
- a first communication device with a plurality of antenna elements may receive a quality-indication signal from a second communication device, for example, a base station.
- the first communication device may then apply phase changes to signals to be transmitted, which transmitted signals add up to the total power signal divided into two or more parts. These signals may be transmitted through the plurality of antennas.
- different changes in phase difference between two or more antennas, or phase steps may be associated with different values of a mobility parameter. Phase changes may be applied, for example, until a desired combined signal is detected with desirably low power consumption.
- a transmit signal may be adjusted using a change to the ratio of power, or a power ratio step, transmitted by the two or more antennas, instead of or in addition to a phase step.
- Different power ratio steps may be associated with different values of a mobility parameter. Power ratio changes may be applied, for example, until a desired combined signal is detected with desirably low power consumption.
- the desired transmit diversity control algorithm may be selected for the present conditions based on the value of a mobility parameter.
- Another embodiment of the present invention may test power ratios different than the one being used, when the value of the mobility parameter indicates that the propagation path is stable (stationary or near stationary conditions). This embodiment may also apply to a mobile terminal using selective transmit diversity, i.e. transmission from a single antenna port that may be selected among two or more available antenna ports.
- embodiments of the invention may combine the above features into a single system, method or apparatus. It will further be recognized that the transmit diversity controls may be based on one mobility parameter, or more than one mobility parameter. In some embodiments of the invention, different transmit diversity controls may be based on respectively different mobility parameters.

- step 1140 a decision is made as to the value of the mobility parameter. If the mobility parameter value is low, then proceed to step 1150 . However, if the mobility parameter value is high, then proceed to step 1160 . It will be recognized that high and low may mean higher or lower than a defined threshold value.
- a decision is made in step 1170 whether to continue the computational cycle or stop the iterations and remain in the current state.
- FIG. 12 illustrates an embodiment of a power ratio probing scheme, which may test power ratios different than the one being used, when the value of the mobility parameter indicates that the propagation path may be stable (stationary or near stationary conditions). Since the relative propagation path loss from different antennas varies widely when the mobile terminal moves, the time required to determine the optimal ratio may be longer than the time until this optimal ratio changed significantly.
- the ratio probing scheme 1200 shows a longer sequence of slots 1210 where the presently preferred ratio is used, followed by 2 slots 1220 when a different probed ratio is applied.
- the system responses i.e., the uplink power control corresponding to the slots when this different power ratio is transmitted, as well as the system response in the slots immediately following the slots when this different power ratio is transmitted, provide a statistical indication of whether this proving power ratio is better or worse than the one being used for the majority of the slots. If the statistics of the uplink power control during the probing slots indicate power up, the present ratio is better; then a probing ratio may be transmitted in the opposite direction as explained below. If the statistics of the uplink power control during the probing slots indicate power down, it means the probing ratio is better and it may be applied to the majority of the slots.
- a new probing ratio may be defined in the opposite direction using the above definitions.
- R 2 R ⁇ s*k ( s,R )*sign( R 1 ⁇ R ), where s is 1 if the probing ratio was unsuccessful and ⁇ 1 if the probing ratio was successful. k(s, R) now allows for dependency on both the success and the present ratio.

- step 1340 a decision is made as to the value of the mobility parameter. If the mobility parameter value is high, then proceed to step 1350 , trying a different algorithm. However, if the mobility parameter value is low, then proceed to step 1360 and use the power ratio method.

- FIG. 14 further illustrates the method of FIG. 12 .
- FIG. 15 is a timing diagram example corresponding to FIG. 14 .
- FIG. 16 illustrates an embodiment of a low duty cycle test of antenna selection, and is similar to the embodiment of FIG. 12 .
- This embodiment also applies to a mobile terminal using selective transmit diversity, for example a transmission from a single antenna port that may be selected among two or more available antenna ports.
- FIG. 16 shows allocation 1600 of a short transmission time 1610 to the antenna that is not presently used (the secondary antenna), for example by transmitting during 1 or 2 slots (shown with the pattern) out of every 10 to 20 slots where most slots 1620 are transmitted out of the other antenna (the primary antenna).
- the mobile analyzes the uplink power control response to this test, for example whether the system response (uplink reverse control) is mostly “power up” or “power down”.
- the former indicates the signal received by the base station when this secondary antenna is transmitting, is weaker; therefore the primary antenna should be preferred.
- the latter indicates the reception of transmissions from the secondary antenna is better, therefore the antennas should be switched—the secondary antenna becoming the new primary one and vice versa.
- Switching decision may prefer the better antenna, or it may use a hysteresis threshold value so that switching may be carried out after the secondary antenna proves better than the first antenna by a certain power gain, for example 3 dB, or as determined over a certain number of past slots, for example, over the past 80 slots, or over a certain time period, for example, 100 msec, or any combination using single or multiple thresholds.
- FIG. 17 is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of a method in accordance with the present invention for selecting a single antenna port among two or more available antenna ports.

- step 1730 mobility parameter values are computed.
- step 1740 a decision is made as to the value of the mobility parameter. If the mobility parameter value is high, then proceed to step 1750 , trying a different algorithm. However, if the mobility parameter value is low, then proceed to step 1760 and use the selective antenna method.
- FIG. 18 is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of selective transmit diversity method according to embodiments of the present invention.

Abstract
Description
PHASE STEP=function(MOBILITY)
PS(k+1)=function{MOBILITY(k,k−1, . . . ,k−n),PS(k,k−1, . . . ,k−m)}
A(k)=10*log 10(a(k)), where A(k)<0.
A(k+1)=min{A(k)+fp(MOBILITY),0},
where k+1 is the index of value after adjustment, k is the present index of value before adjustment, fp is the function used to determine the adjustment per the mobility parameter value, with the maximum value limited to 0 dB when total power is transmitted from one antenna.
A(k+1)=fp{(MOBILITY),A(k)}.
A(k+1)=fp{MOBILITY(k,k−1, . . . ,k−n),A(k,k−1, . . . ,k−m)}
r(k)=a(k)/b(k)
and on a logarithmic scale
R(K)=A(k)−B(k)
R(k+1)=fp{MOBILITY(k,k−1, . . . ,k−n),R(k,k−1, . . . ,k−m)}
R2=R−k*ign(R1−R),
where k is some factor that may be constant but preferably is a function of R so the rate of change is not constant but may be adapted to any scale.
R2=R−s*k(s,R)*sign(R1−R),
where s is 1 if the probing ratio was unsuccessful and −1 if the probing ratio was successful. k(s, R) now allows for dependency on both the success and the present ratio.
