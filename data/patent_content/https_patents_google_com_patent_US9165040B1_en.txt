Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to techniques for ranking pages on the web. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method for producing a ranking for pages on the web by computing shortest distances from a set of seed pages to each of the pages to be ranked, wherein the seed pages and the pages to be ranked are interconnected with links.
- PageRank® A popular search engine developed by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. uses PageRank® as a page-quality metric for efficiently guiding the processes of web crawling, index selection, and web page ranking.
- PageRank computes and assigns a PageRank score to each web page it encounters on the web, wherein the PageRank score serves as a measure of the relative quality of a given web page with respect to other web pages.
- PageRank generally ensures that important and high-quality web pages receive high PageRank scores, which enables a search engine to efficiently rank the search results based on their associated PageRank scores.
- PageRank scores are computed based on the web link-graph structure, wherein the web pages are the nodes of the link-graph which are interconnected with hyperlinks.
- PageRank R for a given web page p can be computed as:
- Equation (1) for computing the PageRank is vulnerable to manipulations.
- Some web pages can be designed to use various techniques to obtain artificially inflated PageRanks, for example, by forming “link farms” or creating “loops.”
- PageRank One possible variation of PageRank that would reduce the effect of these techniques is to select a few “trusted” pages (also referred to as the seed pages) and discovers other pages which are likely to be good by following the links from the trusted pages.
- R i ⁇ ( p ) d ⁇ ⁇ q ⁇ p ⁇ R i ⁇ ( q ) ⁇ q ⁇ out ⁇ w ⁇ ( q ⁇ p ) , ( 2 )
- R i (s i ) 1
- w(q ⁇ p) is an optional weight given to the link q ⁇ p based on its properties (with the default weight of 1).
- One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that produces a ranking for pages on the web.
- the system receives a set of pages to be ranked, wherein the set of pages are interconnected with links.
- receives a set of seed pages which include outgoing links to the set of pages.
- the system assigns lengths to the links based on properties of the links and properties of the pages attached to the links.
- the system next computes shortest distances from the set of seed pages to each page in the set of pages based on the lengths of the links between the pages.
- the system determines a ranking score for each page in the set of pages based on the computed shortest distances.
- the system then produces a ranking for the set of pages based on the ranking scores for the set of pages.
- the system assigns a length to a link by computing a function of the number of outgoing links from the source page of the link.
- the function is a monotonic non-decreasing function of the number of outgoing links from the source page, so that the length of the link increases as the number of outgoing links from the source page increases.
- the system computes a shortest distance from a seed page to a given page by summing lengths of individual links along a shortest path from the seed page to the given page.
- the system computes the length of a link q ⁇ p by adding a term ( ⁇ +log(
- ⁇ ⁇ log(d), wherein d is a damping factor.
- the computed shortest distance from the seed page s i to a given page includes the initial distance d i .
- the system determines the ranking score for a given page based on the computed shortest distances by using k shortest distances from the k nearest seed pages to each page, wherein k is a predetermined positive integer.
- the system determines the ranking score for a given page based on the computed shortest distances by using the kth shortest distance among the computed shortest distances.
- the ranking score for the given page can be proportional to e ⁇ D(p) , wherein D(p) is the kth shortest distance.
- the function for the length of the link includes a weight of the link.
- the links associated with the computed shortest distances constitute a reduced link-graph.
- FIG. 1 graphically illustrates a link-graph structure of a set of pages on the web in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 presents a flowchart illustrating the process of ranking pages on the web based on shortest distances in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 illustrates the crawling, ranking and searching processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- a computer-readable storage medium which may be any device or medium that can store code and/or data for use by a computer system. This includes, but is not limited to, magnetic and optical storage devices such as disk drives, magnetic tape, CDs (compact discs), DVDs (digital versatile discs or digital video discs), or any device capable of storing data usable by a computer system.
- One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that ranks pages on the web based on distances between the pages, wherein the pages are interconnected with links to form a link-graph. More specifically, a set of high-quality seed pages are chosen as references for ranking the pages in the link-graph, and shortest distances from the set of seed pages to each given page in the link-graph are computed. Each of the shortest distances is obtained by summing lengths of a set of links which follows the shortest path from a seed page to a given page, wherein the length of a given link is assigned to the link based on properties of the link and properties of the page attached to the link. The computed shortest distances are then used to determine the ranking scores of the associated pages.
- FIG. 1 graphically illustrates a link-graph structure 100 of a set of pages on the web in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- Link-graph 100 comprises a collection of pages which correspond to the nodes of the link-graph, and a collection of directed links between the pages, wherein these directed links correspond to the arcs of the link-graph. Note that each link is a directed connection from a “source” page to a “destination” page.
- seed pages 102 form the “root” nodes of link-graph 100 , which comprise: seed 106 , seed 108 , and seed 110 .
- FIG. 1 is described in the context of three seeds, generally the present invention can use much more than three seeds. Note that seeds 102 are interconnected with link 107 and link 109 .
- Non-seed pages 104 include pages 112 - 130 , wherein each page is either directly or indirectly connected to one or more seeds through the links in the link-graph.
- seeds 102 are specially selected high-quality pages which provide good web connectivity to other non-seed pages.
- seeds in seeds 102 need to be reliable, diverse to cover a wide range of fields of public interests, as well as well-connected with other pages (i.e., having a large number of outgoing links).
- Google Directory and The New York Times are both good seeds which possess such properties. It is typically assumed that these seeds are also “closer” to other high-quality pages on the web.
- seeds with large number of useful outgoing links facilitate identifying other useful and high-quality pages, thereby acting as “hubs” on the web.
- One approach for choosing seeds involves selecting a diverse set of trusted seeds. Choosing a more diverse set of seeds can shorten the paths from the seeds to a given page. Hence, it would be desirable to have a largest possible set of seeds that include as many different types of seeds as possible.
- selecting the seeds involves a human manually identifying these high-quality pages, the total number of the seeds is typically limited. Moreover, having too many seeds can make the selected seeds vulnerable to manipulation. Consequently, the actual number of the selected set of seeds is limited.
- a link from a seed to a page is represented by an arrow pointing from the seed to the page.
- seed 106 links to page 112 and page 114 through links 132 and 134 , respectively.
- Such links assert a “support” from the seed to the linked pages.
- the set of non-seed pages 104 are also interconnected with links.
- page 112 has three outgoing links 136 , 137 , and 138 , which target at pages 118 , 116 and 122 , respectively.
- page 114 has two outgoing links 140 and 142 , which connect to pages 118 and 120 , respectively.
- page 120 links to page 118 through link 144 as shown.
- pages 118 , 120 and 128 form a loop, wherein these pages point to each other in a circular manner though links 144 , 146 , and 148 . Furthermore, page 126 and page 128 also form a loop in which they point to each other through links 150 and 152 .
- k is a small integer, for example, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- the length of a link can be a function of any set of properties of the link and the source of the link. These properties can include, but are not limited to, the link's position, the link's font, and the source page's out-degree.
- Equation (6) provides a reasonable approximation of the PageRank for p.
- the length equation (10) includes a term log(
- Equation (16) a larger PageRank score for page p is corresponding to a shorter distance from seed s i to page p.
- the meaning of Equation (16) is that instead of calculating the PageRank score R(p), one can alternatively calculate D(p), which is the distance from the k th nearest seed top (where the distance from seed s i can include an optional initial distance d i 0 ).
- D(p) is the distance from the k th nearest seed top (where the distance from seed s i can include an optional initial distance d i 0 ).
- FIG. 2 presents a flowchart illustrating the process of ranking pages on the web based on shortest distances in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the system first receives a set of pages to be ranked, wherein the set of pages are interconnected with links (step 202 ).
- the system receives a set of n seed pages or “seeds”, wherein the seeds include outgoing links reaching out to the set of pages to be ranked (step 204 ).
- the system assigns length values to the links based on properties of the links and properties of the pages attached to the links (step 206 ).
- the length of a given link is computed using Equation (10), wherein the length is a function of the number of outgoing links from the source page of the link.
- the system computes shortest distances from the set of seeds to each page in the set of pages based on the lengths of the links between the pages (step 208 ). More specifically, for each given page in the set of pages, the system identifies k “nearest” seeds among the set of seeds, wherein k ⁇ n. In other words, these k nearest seeds produce the k shortest distances to the given page among the set of n seeds. For example in FIG. 1 , we can choose k to be 1.
- the shortest path from the seed to any target page will be defined as the shortest path from any of the seed's pages to the target page.
- the system next determines a ranking score for each page in the set of pages based on the computed shortest distances (step 210 ).
- the system first identifies the kth nearest seed in the computed shorted distances for the give page, and subsequently computes a ranking score for the given page based on Equation (16).
- the system produces a ranking for the set of pages based on the ranking scores for the set of pages (step 212 ). Note that however, not all the pages in the set of pages receive ranking scores through this process. For example, a page that cannot be reached by any of the seed pages will not be ranked.
- the results from above ranking process can be used for seed tuning. Specifically, the ranking process produces lists of the nearest seeds and the lengths of the shortest paths for all the ranked pages. The system can process these results to extract information for each of the seeds with respect to the ranked pages. Next, the system can use this information to evaluate the quality and the contribution of the seeds, and then modify the list of seeds and/or the weights of the seeds based on this information.
- the links participating in the k shortest paths from the seeds to the pages constitute a sub-graph that includes all the links that are “flow” ranked from the seeds. Although this sub-graph includes much less links than the original link-graph, the k shortest paths from the seeds to each page in this sub-graph have the same lengths as the paths in the original graph. For each page p, the maximum number of links to page p in this sub-graph is at most k. Furthermore, the rank flow to each page can be backtracked to the nearest k seeds through the paths in this sub-graph.
- FIG. 3 illustrates the crawling, ranking and searching processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- web crawler 304 crawls or otherwise searches through websites on web 302 to select web pages to be stored in indexed form in data center 308 .
- web crawler 304 can prioritize the crawling process by using the page rank scores.
- the selected web pages are then compressed, indexed and ranked in 305 (using the ranking process described above) before being stored in data center 308 .
- a search engine 312 receives a query 313 from a user 311 through a web browser 314 .
- This query 313 specifies a number of terms to be searched for in the set of documents.
- search engine 312 uses the ranking information to identify highly-ranked documents that satisfy the query.
- Search engine 312 then returns a response 315 through web browser 314 , wherein the response 315 contains matching pages along with ranking information and references to the identified documents.
- the application of the present invention is not limited to the web and web pages.
- the general technique of producing ranking scores can be expanded to any hyperlinked database, which can include, but is not limited to, hyperlinked documents of an enterprise.
Abstract
Description
wherein P is the set of all the web pages, |q|out is the out-degree of a specific page q in the set P, and 0≦d≦1 is a damping factor.
where Ri(si)=1, and w(q→p) is an optional weight given to the link q→p based on its properties (with the default weight of 1).
R(p)=k_maxi=1, . . . n R i(p), (3)
where k is a positive integer between 1 and n, and k_max represents the kth largest value.
R(p)=k_maxi=1, . . . n w i R i(p) (4)
In practice, it is found that the incoming contributions for a page have a significantly skewed distribution such that the sum of the all the incoming contributions is dominated by one or very few terms. Hence, one can make an approximation of the PageRank score for page p with respect to seed si by replacing Equation (2) with the dominant term in (2), that is:
∀1≦i≦n, R i(s i)=w i; (7)
∀pεP, R(p)=k_maxi=1, . . . n R i(p). (9)
∀1≦i≦n, D i(s i)=d i 0; (11)
∀pεP, D(p)=k_mini=1, . . . n D i(p), (13)
∀1≦i≦n, pεP, R i(p)=e −D
∀pεP, R(p)=e −D(p). (16)
wherein 0≦α=−log(d).
-
- 1. The page q directly links to n pages;
- 2. The page q′ is a root of a directed tree with n leaves.
We expect that the distance between q and any of the pages it links to will not be greater than the maximum distance between q′ and its leaves. In particular, for the case where q′ links to n1 pages which each additionally links to n2 pages, we get:
ƒ(n 1 n 2)≦ƒ(n 1)+ƒ(n 2). (18)
g(log(n 1 n 2))−g(log(n 2))=g(log(n 1)+log(n 2))−g(log(n 2))≦g(log(n 1))−g(0)≦g(log(n i)). (20)
