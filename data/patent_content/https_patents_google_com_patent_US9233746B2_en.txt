- FIG. 7 is a method, according to an example embodiment.
- Example methods and systems are described herein. Any example embodiment or feature described herein is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or features.
- the example embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. It will be readily understood that certain aspects of the disclosed systems and methods can be arranged and combined in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are contemplated herein.
- Example embodiments help to provide a data network that includes a plurality of balloons; for example, a mesh network formed by high-altitude balloons deployed in the stratosphere. Since winds in the stratosphere may affect the locations of the balloons in a differential manner, each balloon in an example network may be configured to change its horizontal position by adjusting its vertical position (i.e., altitude). For instance, by adjusting its altitude, a balloon may be able find winds that will carry it horizontally (e.g., latitudinally and/or longitudinally) to a desired horizontal location. Further, in an example balloon network, the balloons may communicate with one another using free-space optical communications.
- the balloons may be configured for optical communications using ultra-bright LEDs (which are also referred to as “high-power” or “high-output” LEDs).
- ultra-bright LEDs which are also referred to as “high-power” or “high-output” LEDs.
- lasers could be used instead of or in addition to LEDs, although regulations for laser communications may restrict laser usage.
- the balloons may communicate with ground-based station(s) using radio-frequency (RF) communications.
- RF radio-frequency
- a high-altitude-balloon network may be homogenous. That is, the balloons in a high-altitude-balloon network could be substantially similar to each other in one or more ways. More specifically, in a homogenous high-altitude-balloon network, each balloon is configured to communicate with one or more other balloons via free-space optical links. Further, some or all of the balloons in such a network, may additionally be configured to communicate with ground-based and/or satellite-based station(s) using RF and/or optical communications. Thus, in some embodiments, the balloons may be homogenous in so far as each balloon is configured for free-space optical communication with other balloons, but heterogeneous with regard to RF communications with ground-based stations.
- a high-altitude-balloon network may be heterogeneous, and thus may include two or more different types of balloons.
- some balloons in a heterogeneous network may be configured as super-nodes, while other balloons may be configured as sub-nodes.
- some balloons in a heterogeneous network may be configured to function as both a super-node and a sub-node.
- Such balloons may function as either a super-node or a sub-node at a particular time, or, alternatively, act as both simultaneously depending on the context.
- an example balloon could aggregate search requests of a first type to transmit to a ground-based station.
- the example balloon could also send search requests of a second type to another balloon, which could act as a super-node in that context.
- some balloons which may be super-nodes in an example embodiment, can be configured to communicate via optical links with ground-based stations and/or satellites.
- the super-node balloons may be configured to communicate with nearby super-node balloons via free-space optical links.
- the sub-node balloons may not be configured for free-space optical communication, and may instead be configured for some other type of communication, such as RF communications.
- a super-node may be further configured to communicate with sub-nodes using RF communications.
- the sub-nodes may relay communications between the super-nodes and one or more ground-based stations using RF communications.
- the super-nodes may collectively function as backhaul for the balloon network, while the sub-nodes function to relay communications from the super-nodes to ground-based stations.
- the buoyancy of the balloon may be controlled by adjusting the temperature of the gas within an envelope of the balloon. It should be pointed out that the temperature of the gas within the envelope itself does not change the buoyancy of the balloon. In order for temperature to change buoyancy, the envelope can be somewhat elastic so that it expands when heated, or the gas inside is heated, since it is the density change of the gas within the balloon that, by definition, is what changes the buoyancy of the balloon. In any event, under proper circumstances, the altitude of balloon may be controlled by increasing or decreasing the temperature of the gas within the envelope.
- the amount of solar energy absorbed by the gas within the balloon envelope, and thus the temperature of the gas, may be controlled if the absorptive/reflective properties of the surface of the balloon envelope are adjusted.
- the absorptive/reflective properties of the surface of the balloon envelope may be adjusted, or varied, by providing a balloon with an envelope having a first portion of the envelope having a property different from a second portion of the envelope, with respect to reflecting or absorbing solar energy.
- a first portion of the envelope may be colored white, or some other light color, which reflects more solar energy than a dark colored surface to help prevent the temperature of the gas within the envelope from rising.
- a second portion of the envelope could be colored black, or some other dark color, which absorbs more solar energy than a lightly colored surface to allow more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope, causing the temperature of the gas within the envelope to rise.
- the temperature of the gas within the balloon envelope may be controlled.
- the balloon may be equipped with the ability to rotate the balloon envelope so that the first portion of the envelope or the second portion of the envelope is positioned facing the sun.
- the first portion of the balloon envelope that allows for more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope may be positioned facing the sun to increase the temperature of the gas within envelope (and increase the altitude of the balloon).
- the second portion of the envelope that allows for less solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the balloon envelope may be positioned facing the sun to decrease the temperature of the gas within the balloon envelope (and decrease the altitude of the balloon). Relying on solar heat to raise and lower the balloon may not be the most reliable way to accomplish the goal of station keeping of the balloon.
- the use of solar energy has the advantage that it is very energy efficient. Specifically, it can take less energy to turn the balloon than to change altitude by some other means such as by running an electric air compressor.
- the use of solar energy to control balloon altitude may advantageously use less energy than other methods of controlling balloon altitude.
- FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram illustrating a balloon network 100 , according to an example embodiment.
- balloon network 100 includes balloons 102 A to 102 F, which are configured to communicate with one another via free-space optical links 104 .
- Balloons 102 A to 102 F could additionally or alternatively be configured to communicate with one another via RF links 114 .
- Balloons 102 A to 102 F may collectively function as a mesh network for packet-data communications.
- at least some of balloons 102 A and 102 B may be configured for RF communications with ground-based stations 106 and 112 via respective RF links 108 .
- some balloons, such as balloon 102 F could be configured to communicate via optical link 110 with ground-based station 112 .
- balloons 102 A to 102 F are high-altitude balloons, which are deployed in the stratosphere.
- the stratosphere includes altitudes between approximately 10 kilometers (km) and 50 km altitude above the surface.
- the stratosphere starts at an altitude of approximately 8 km.
- high-altitude balloons may be generally configured to operate in an altitude range within the stratosphere that has relatively low wind speed (e.g., between 5 and 20 miles per hour (mph)).
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may generally be configured to operate at altitudes between 18 km and 25 km (although other altitudes are possible). This altitude range may be advantageous for several reasons.
- this layer of the stratosphere generally has relatively low wind speeds (e.g., winds between 5 and 20 mph) and relatively little turbulence.
- winds between 18 km and 25 km may vary with latitude and by season, the variations can be modeled in a reasonably accurate manner.
- altitudes above 18 km are typically above the maximum flight level designated for commercial air traffic. Therefore, interference with commercial flights is not a concern when balloons are deployed between 18 km and 25 km.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may be configured to transmit an optical signal via an optical link 104 .
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may use one or more high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to transmit an optical signal.
- LEDs high-power light-emitting diodes
- some or all of balloons 102 A to 102 F may include laser systems for free-space optical communications over optical links 104 . Other types of free-space optical communication are possible.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may include one or more optical receivers. Additional details of example balloons are discussed in greater detail below, with reference to FIG. 3 .
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may utilize one or more of various different RF air-interface protocols for communication with ground-based stations 106 and 112 via respective RF links 108 .
- some or all of balloons 102 A to 102 F may be configured to communicate with ground-based stations 106 and 112 using protocols described in IEEE 802.11 (including any of the IEEE 802.11 revisions), various cellular protocols such as GSM, CDMA, UMTS, EV-DO, WiMAX, and/or LTE, and/or one or more propriety protocols developed for balloon-ground RF communication, among other possibilities.
- an example network may also include downlink balloons, which could provide a high-capacity air-ground link.
- balloon 102 F is configured as a downlink balloon.
- a downlink balloon 102 F may be operable for optical communication with other balloons via optical links 104 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may also be configured for free-space optical communication with a ground-based station 112 via an optical link 110 .
- Optical link 110 may therefore serve as a high-capacity link (as compared to an RF link 108 ) between the balloon network 100 and the ground-based station 112 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may additionally be operable for RF communication with ground-based stations 106 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may only use an optical link for balloon-to-ground communications.
- an example balloon network can also include multiple downlink balloons.
- a balloon network can also be implemented without any downlink balloons.
- a downlink balloon may be equipped with a specialized, high-bandwidth RF communication system for balloon-to-ground communications, instead of, or in addition to, a free-space optical communication system.
- the high-bandwidth RF communication system may take the form of an ultra-wideband system, which may provide an RF link with substantially the same capacity as one of the optical links 104 .
- Other forms are also possible.
- Ground-based stations such as ground-based stations 106 and/or 112
- a ground-based station may include components such as transceivers, transmitters, and/or receivers for communication via RF links and/or optical links with a balloon network.
- a ground-based station may use various air-interface protocols in order to communicate with a balloon 102 A to 102 F over an RF link 108 .
- ground-based stations 106 and 112 may be configured as an access point via which various devices can connect to balloon network 100 .
- Ground-based stations 106 and 112 may have other configurations and/or serve other purposes without departing from the scope of the invention.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F could be configured to establish a communication link with space-based satellites in addition to, or as an alternative to, a ground-based communication link.
- a balloon may communicate with a satellite via an optical link.
- other types of satellite communications are possible.
- ground-based stations such as ground-based stations 106 and 112
- Such ground-based stations 106 and 112 may thus serve as an interface between the balloon network and the Internet, a cellular service provider's network, and/or other types of networks. Variations on this configuration and other configurations of ground-based stations 106 and 112 are also possible.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may collectively function as a mesh network. More specifically, since balloons 102 A to 102 F may communicate with one another using free-space optical links, the balloons may collectively function as a free-space optical mesh network.
- each balloon 102 A to 102 F may function as a node of the mesh network, which is operable to receive data directed to it and to route data to other balloons.
- data may be routed from a source balloon to a destination balloon by determining an appropriate sequence of optical links between the source balloon and the destination balloon.
- These optical links may be collectively referred to as a “lightpath” for the connection between the source and destination balloons.
- each of the optical links may be referred to as a “hop” on the lightpath.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may employ various routing techniques and self-healing algorithms.
- a balloon network 100 may employ adaptive or dynamic routing, where a lightpath between a source and destination balloon is determined and set-up when the connection is needed, and released at a later time. Further, when adaptive routing is used, the lightpath may be determined dynamically depending upon the current state, past state, and/or predicted state of the balloon network.
- an example balloon network 100 may apply a mesh protocol to update the state of the network as the topology of the network changes.
- balloon network 100 may employ and/or adapt various techniques that are employed in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Other examples are possible as well.
- MANETs mobile ad hoc networks
- a balloon network 100 may be configured as a transparent mesh network. More specifically, in a transparent balloon network, the balloons may include components for physical switching that is entirely optical, without any electrical components involved in the physical routing of optical signals. Thus, in a transparent configuration with optical switching, signals travel through a multi-hop lightpath that is entirely optical.
- the balloon network 100 may implement a free-space optical mesh network that is opaque.
- some or all balloons 102 A to 102 F may implement optical-electrical-optical (OEO) switching.
- some or all balloons may include optical cross-connects (OXCs) for OEO conversion of optical signals.
- OEO optical-electrical-optical
- Other opaque configurations are also possible.
- network configurations are possible that include routing paths with both transparent and opaque sections.
- balloons in an example balloon network 100 may implement wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which may help to increase link capacity.
- WDM wavelength division multiplexing
- physical lightpaths through the balloon network may be subject to the “wavelength continuity constraint.” More specifically, because the switching in a transparent network is entirely optical, it may be necessary to assign the same wavelength for all optical links on a given lightpath.
- An opaque configuration may avoid the wavelength continuity constraint.
- balloons in an opaque balloon network may include the OEO switching systems operable for wavelength conversion.
- balloons can convert the wavelength of an optical signal at each hop along a lightpath.
- optical wavelength conversion could take place at only selected hops along the lightpath.
- various routing algorithms may be employed in an opaque configuration. For example, to determine a primary lightpath and/or one or more diverse backup lightpaths for a given connection, example balloons may apply or consider shortest-path routing techniques such as Dijkstra's algorithm and k-shortest path, and/or edge and node-diverse or disjoint routing such as Suurballe's algorithm, among others. Additionally or alternatively, techniques for maintaining a particular quality of service (QoS) may be employed when determining a lightpath. Other techniques are also possible.
- QoS quality of service
- a balloon network 100 may implement station-keeping functions to help provide a desired network topology. For example, station-keeping may involve each balloon 102 A to 102 F maintaining and/or moving into a certain position relative to one or more other balloons in the network (and possibly in a certain position relative to the ground). As part of this process, each balloon 102 A to 102 F may implement station-keeping functions to determine its desired positioning within the desired topology, and if necessary, to determine how to move to the desired position.
- the desired topology may vary depending upon the particular implementation.
- balloons may implement station-keeping to provide a substantially uniform topology.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may implement station-keeping functions to position itself at substantially the same distance (or within a certain range of distances) from adjacent balloons in the balloon network 100 .
- a balloon network 100 may have a non-uniform topology.
- example embodiments may involve topologies where balloons are distributed more or less densely in certain areas, for various reasons.
- balloons may be clustered more densely over urban areas.
- the distribution of balloons may be denser over land than over large bodies of water.
- Many other examples of non-uniform topologies are possible.
- the topology of an example balloon network may be adaptable.
- station-keeping functionality of example balloons may allow the balloons to adjust their respective positioning in accordance with a change in the desired topology of the network. For example, one or more balloons could move to new positions to increase or decrease the density of balloons in a given area. Other examples are possible.
- a balloon network 100 may employ an energy function to determine if and/or how balloons should move to provide a desired topology.
- the state of a given balloon and the states of some or all nearby balloons may be input to an energy function.
- the energy function may apply the current states of the given balloon and the nearby balloons to a desired network state (e.g., a state corresponding to the desired topology).
- a vector indicating a desired movement of the given balloon may then be determined by determining the gradient of the energy function.
- the given balloon may then determine appropriate actions to take in order to effectuate the desired movement. For example, a balloon may determine an altitude adjustment or adjustments such that winds will move the balloon in the desired manner.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a balloon-network control system, according to an example embodiment.
- FIG. 2 shows a distributed control system, which includes a central control system 200 and a number of regional control-systems 202 A to 202 B.
- Such a control system may be configured to coordinate certain functionality for balloon network 204 , and as such, may be configured to control and/or coordinate certain functions for balloons 206 A to 206 I.
- central control system 200 may be configured to communicate with balloons 206 A to 206 I via a number of regional control systems 202 A to 202 C. These regional control systems 202 A to 202 C may be configured to receive communications and/or aggregate data from balloons in the respective geographic areas that they cover, and to relay the communications and/or data to central control system 200 . Further, regional control systems 202 A to 202 C may be configured to route communications from central control system 200 to the balloons in their respective geographic areas. For instance, as shown in FIG.
- regional control system 202 A may relay communications and/or data between balloons 206 A to 206 C and central control system 200

- balloons 206 A, 206 F, and 206 I are configured as downlink balloons.
- regional control systems 202 A to 202 C may respectively communicate with balloons 206 A, 206 F, and 206 I via optical links 206 , 208 , and 210 , respectively.
- balloons 206 A to 206 I are configured as downlink balloons.
- the balloons 206 A, 206 F, and 206 I that are configured as downlink balloons may relay communications from central control system 200 to other balloons in the balloon network, such as balloons 206 B to 206 E, 206 G, and 206 H.
- all balloons may function as downlink balloons.
- FIG. 2 shows multiple balloons configured as downlink balloons, it is also possible for a balloon network to include only one downlink balloon, or possibly even no downlink balloons.
- a regional control system 202 A to 202 C may in fact just be a particular type of ground-based station that is configured to communicate with downlink balloons (e.g., such as ground-based station 112 of FIG. 1 ).
- a control system may be implemented in conjunction with other types of ground-based stations (e.g., access points, gateways, etc.).
- the central control system 200 may coordinate certain mesh-networking functions for balloon network 204 .
- balloons 206 A to 206 I may send the central control system 200 certain state information, which the central control system 200 may utilize to determine the state of balloon network 204 .
- the state information from a given balloon may include location data, optical-link information (e.g., the identity of other balloons with which the balloon has established an optical link, the bandwidth of the link, wavelength usage and/or availability on a link, etc.), wind data collected by the balloon, and/or other types of information.
- the central control system 200 may aggregate state information from some or all of the balloons 206 A to 206 I in order to determine an overall state of the network.
- the overall state of the network may then be used to coordinate and/or facilitate certain mesh-networking functions such as determining lightpaths for connections.
- the central control system 200 may determine a current topology based on the aggregate state information from some or all of the balloons 206 A to 206 I.
- the topology may provide a picture of the current optical links that are available in balloon network and/or the wavelength availability on the links. This topology may then be sent to some or all of the balloons so that a routing technique may be employed to select appropriate lightpaths (and possibly backup lightpaths) for communications through the balloon network 204 .
- the central control system 200 may also coordinate certain station-keeping functions for balloon network 204 .
- the central control system 200 may input state information that is received from balloons 206 A to 206 I to an energy function, which may effectively compare the current topology of the network to a desired topology, and provide a vector indicating a direction of movement (if any) for each balloon, such that the balloons can move towards the desired topology.
- the central control system 200 may use latitudinal wind data to determine respective altitude adjustments that may be initiated to achieve the movement towards the desired topology.
- the central control system 200 may provide and/or support other station-keeping functions as well.
- FIG. 2 shows a distributed arrangement that provides centralized control, with regional control systems 202 A to 202 C coordinating communications between a central control system 200 and a balloon network 204 .
- Such an arrangement may be useful to provide centralized control for a balloon network that covers a large geographic area.
- a distributed arrangement may even support a global balloon network that provides coverage everywhere on earth.
- a distributed-control arrangement may be useful in other scenarios as well.
- control-system arrangements are also possible.
- some implementations may involve a centralized control system with additional layers (e.g., sub-region systems within the regional control systems, and so on).
- control functions may be provided by a single, centralized, control system, which communicates directly with one or more downlink balloons.
- control and coordination of a balloon network may be shared by a ground-based control system and a balloon network to varying degrees, depending upon the implementation. In fact, in some embodiments, there may be no ground-based control systems. In such an embodiment, all network control and coordination functions may be implemented by the balloon network itself. For example, certain balloons may be configured to provide the same or similar functions as central control system 200 and/or regional control systems 202 A to 202 C. Other examples are also possible.
- control and/or coordination of a balloon network may be de-centralized.
- each balloon may relay state information to, and receive state information from, some or all nearby balloons.
- each balloon may relay state information that it receives from a nearby balloon to some or all nearby balloons.
- each balloon may be able to individually determine the state of the network.
- certain balloons may be designated to aggregate state information for a given portion of the network. These balloons may then coordinate with one another to determine the overall state of the network.
- control of a balloon network may be partially or entirely localized, such that it is not dependent on the overall state of the network.
- individual balloons may implement station-keeping functions that only consider nearby balloons.
- each balloon may implement an energy function that takes into account its own state and the states of nearby balloons. The energy function may be used to maintain and/or move to a desired position with respect to the nearby balloons, without necessarily considering the desired topology of the network as a whole.
- the balloon network as a whole may maintain and/or move towards the desired topology.
- each balloon A may receive distance information d 1 to d k with respect to each of its k closest neighbors.
- Each balloon A may treat the distance to each of the k balloons as a virtual spring with vector representing a force direction from the first nearest neighbor balloon i toward balloon A and with force magnitude proportional to d i .
- the balloon A may sum each of the k vectors and the summed vector is the vector of desired movement for balloon A. Balloon A may attempt to achieve the desired movement by controlling its altitude.
- this process could assign the force magnitude of each of these virtual forces equal to d i ⁇ d i , for instance.
- Other algorithms for assigning force magnitudes for respective balloons in a mesh network are possible.
- each balloon could transmit its planned movement vector to its local neighbors. Further rounds of refinement to each balloon's planned movement vector can be made based on the corresponding planned movement vectors of its neighbors. It will be evident to those skilled in the art that other algorithms could be implemented in a balloon network in an effort to maintain a set of balloon spacings and/or a specific network capacity level over a given geographic location.

- the buoyancy of the balloon 500 (and thus the altitude of the balloon) may be controlled by adjusting the temperature of the gas within envelope 502 . As the temperature of the gas within envelope 502 increases, the relative density of the gas within the envelope 502 decreases and the volume of the gas increases, which may result in a more buoyant (or upward) force on the balloon 500 , which may cause the altitude of the balloon to increase.
- the altitude of balloon 500 may be controlled by increasing or decreasing the temperature of the gas within the envelope 502 .
- the amount of solar energy absorbed by the gas within envelope 502 may be controlled if the absorptive/reflective properties of the surface of the envelope 502 may be adjusted.

- a first portion of the envelope 502 a could be colored white, or some other light color, which reflects more solar energy than a dark colored surface to help prevent the temperature of the gas within the envelope 502 from rising.
- a second portion of the envelope 502 b could be colored black, or some other dark color, which absorbs more solar energy than a lightly colored surface to allow more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 502 , causing the temperature of the gas within the envelope 502 to rise.

- a first portion of the envelope 602 a could be colored white, or some other light color, which reflects more solar energy than a dark colored surface to help prevent the temperature of the gas within the envelope 602 from rising.
- a second portion of the envelope 602 b could be colored black, or some other dark color, which absorbs more solar energy than a lightly colored surface to allow more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 602 , causing the temperature of the gas within the envelope 602 to rise.
- envelope 602 may include a third portion of the envelope 602 c having different reflective/absorptive properties than first and second portions of the envelope 602 a and 602 b .
- the reflective/absorptive properties of the third portion of the envelope 602 c may fall between those of the first and second portions of the envelope 602 a and 602 b such that when the third portion of the envelope 602 c is positioned facing the sun, it allows for the absorption of more solar energy by the gas within the envelope 602 than when the first portion of the envelope 602 a is positioned facing the sun, but less than when the second portion of the envelope 602 b is positioned facing the sun.
- a first portion of the envelope 602 a could be colored white, or some other light color, which reflects more solar energy than a dark colored surface to help prevent the temperature of the gas within the envelope 602 from rising.
- a second portion of the envelope 602 b could be colored black, or some other dark color, which absorbs more solar energy than a lightly colored surface to allow more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 602 , causing the temperature of the gas within the envelope 602 to rise.
- the first portion of the envelope 602 a could be opaque or reflective, thereby preventing sunlight from passing into the envelope 602 , to help prevent the temperature of the gas within envelope 602 from rising.
- the second portion of the envelope 602 b could be translucent, or transmissive, allowing sunlight to more easily pass through the second portion of envelope 602 b and thereby more solar energy to be absorbed by the gas within the envelope 602 , to cause the temperature of the gas within the envelope 602 to rise.
- the third portion of the envelope 602 c could have a gray color 606 , or a color somewhere between the white, lightly colored first portion of the envelope 602 a and the black, or darkly colored second portion of the envelope 602 b .

If desired, additional portions of the envelope with further differing reflective/absorptive properties could be added to provide for additional variations of solar energy that may be absorbed by the gas within the envelope. It will be appreciated that it may be desirable to have a preferred ratio of the first or second (or even third or more portions) of the envelope facing the sun.
- the amount of solar energy absorbed or reflected by the balloon envelope may be controlled and/or adjusted by controlling and/or adjusting the ratio of the portions of the balloon envelope that are facing the sun. In this manner, the energy absorption of the gas or air within the balloon may be controlled in a continuous fashion by altering the ratios of the portions of the balloon envelope facing the sun.
- FIGS. 5 , 5 A, 6 , and 6 A show sharp dividing lines between the different portions of the envelope.
- the division between the first and section portions of the envelope could be gradual, allowing for a continuously decreasing amount of solar energy absorbed by the gas within the envelope as the darker or more transmissive portion of the envelope is rotated away from a position facing the sun to a position where the lighter or more opaque or reflective portion of the envelope is positioned facing the sun.

- the bladder may be used to act as a type of ballast to further control the altitude of the balloon 500 or 600 .
- the density of the gas within the envelope increases resulting in a decrease in the buoyant, upward force of the balloon, which also results in a decrease in the altitude of the balloon.
- the air may be removed, or bled, from the bladder, resulting in a lower density of the gas in the envelope and a higher buoyant, upward force of the balloon, which results in an increase in the altitude of the balloon.
- the natural environment and/or natural temperature changes to control the temperature of the gas and/or air within the balloon (in the balloon envelope or bladder) to control or change the altitude of the balloon.
- a heat sink which could take the form of a metal fin, or a fin made of a thermally conductive material such as Beryllium Copper
- the fin could be positioned below the balloon and thermally coupled to the gas within the balloon (via a rod, for example).
- the heat sink when it is desired to cool the gas within the balloon (in the bladder or envelope) more quickly, the heat sink could be deployed and the metal fin extended into the atmosphere where heat from within the balloon may be transferred to the atmosphere.
- the heat sink or fin when it desired to cool the air or gas within the balloon more slowly, the heat sink or fin could be retracted so that less heat is transferred from the gas or air within the balloon to the atmosphere.
