Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to a method for controlling the transmit power of a communication device operating in a wireless communication system.
- Wireless communication systems such as analog and digital cellular communication systems, personal communication systems (PCS) and other similar wireless communication systems, provide a great deal of freedom to their users.
- a wireless communication system user is always in touch. And, in spite of the complexity underlying the wireless communication system, to the user using the system is as easy as dialing a phone number.
- a user will be unable to place or receive a call, or an ongoing call will be unexpectedly disconnected.
- RF radio frequency
- CDMA code division multiple access
- a CDMA communication system implemented in accordance with the IS-95-A standard, land- and mobile-originated calls are prone to failure during the signaling protocol required to establish or complete a call. That is, the communications between the MS and the base station (BS) to place the MS on a Traffic Channel (TCH, i.e., a communication link used for transmitting and receiving data, typically coded speech, between the system and the mobile station).
- TCH Traffic Channel
- call failure rates may be as unacceptably high as 2-4% of all call attempts.
- the conventional preamble acquisition search algorithm is a single-dwell serial search technique applied to one or both receiving antennas at the BS. If a search statistic associated with any multiple signal component exceeds a threshold, acquisition is declared with the multiple signal component generating that statistic being used for subsequent demodulation of the received signals.
- a search statistic associated with any multiple signal component exceeds a threshold
- acquisition is declared with the multiple signal component generating that statistic being used for subsequent demodulation of the received signals.
- dB decibels
- Eb/No information bit energy/noise density
- rake fingers are assigned to the delays at which the preamble acquisition search algorithm indicated valid multiple signal components to be present, and demodulation begins. After a correct or false preamble acquisition, however, the BS will signal to the MS that acquisition has occurred.
- the MS Upon receipt of the BS Ack. Order indicating valid preamble acquisition, the MS ceases preamble transmission. In the case of false acquisitions, this deprives the BS receiver of the optimal signal to use to attempt proper acquisition. The BS receiver then has to attempt to re-acquire the MS using the modulated null traffic frame sequence that—according to the IS-95-A specification—follows the preamble phase. However, this frame sequence is an 1 ⁇ 8-rate transmission, and the efficiency of the re-acquisition attempt is highly reduced since signal is not present on the channel 7 ⁇ 8's of the time.
- the BS receiver If the BS receiver has falsely acquired the preamble signal the first MS Ack. Order transmitted by the MS in response to the BS Ack. Order declaring acquisition may be lost. This is because the BS receiver may be unable to successfully demodulate the MS Ack. Order, which depends on whether the BS modulated data search has successfully reacquired the MS before transmission of this message. Retransmission of the MS Ack. Order unnecessarily extends the call set-up time.
- the idle pattern initially transmitted to the MS via the traffic channel power control sub-channel is replaced with power control decisions based on the demodulated power control metric upon detection that at least one of the four available rake fingers is in the “lock” state.
- the initial finger assignments that drive this decision may be made prior to the demodulation phase at the same time that preamble acquisition is declared.
- the filters controlling the lock status of these assignments are updated, on average, every 10 ms at the rate of the 1 ⁇ 8-rate power control groups (PCGs).
- PCGs power control groups
- the lock filter state variables are initialized, and the delay between the finger assignments and the first 1 ⁇ 8-rate PCG, it is possible for fingers that have been falsely assigned during the preamble acquisition search algorithm to delays at which no signal components exist to remain in lock for several 10's of milliseconds before lock filtering changes their status to the “unlocked” state. At this point, the idle pattern is restored.
- the MS may receive several consecutive +1 dB power control decisions until a) all the falsely assigned fingers autonomously exit lock under lock filter control thus restoring the power control idle pattern, or b) a subsequent modulated data or “multipath” search detects the true signal delay and assigns an available finger, thus correcting the power control metric estimate.
- the response of the rate determination algorithm to frames comprising the preamble sequence depends on the SNR of the received frames and the algorithm implementation. If acquisition has been properly achieved, and if the preamble signal SNR is high, the rate determination algorithm for rate set 1 may, for example, identify preamble frames as rate-1 ⁇ 4. Depending on the implementation of the algorithm low SNR, classification of preamble frames as rate-1 ⁇ 4, rate-1 ⁇ 8 or erasure is possible. The result is that preamble frames received at high SNR may be reported not as erasures but as valid rate-1 ⁇ 4 frames. The BS may therefore not acknowledge a successful preamble acquisition, especially if the acquisition is made at high SNR. Since this acknowledgment must be delivered within 2 seconds of the start of preamble transmission by the MS, there exists a possibility that the call setup will fail, unless the preamble signal SNR at the receiver drops sufficiently to cause the required erasure to be generated.
- the preamble acquisition search algorithm may be slow and—although it is nominally designed to meet the required false acquisition probability—may be insufficiently robust to account for equipment tolerances (e.g. AGC setpoint error) and implementation error. It is therefore prone to false preamble acquisition.
- the penalties for false acquisition can be severe, including transmitter power transients at the MS, erroneous acknowledgement of acquisition and hence premature termination of the desirable preamble sequence before successful acquisition, layer-2 errors and signaling delays, and ultimately failed or dropped calls.
- the rate determination algorithm can cause the BS to fail to acknowledge preamble acquisition, even at high SNR.
- the preamble acquisition procedure would provide for early preamble acquisition and acknowledgement with reduced probability of false acknowledgment and premature termination. Additionally, the procedure would guard against MS transient power spikes and provide for MS power control during call setup. The procedure would also reduce the possibility of acknowledgement errors due to BS processing functions.
- FIG. 1 is a of a wireless communication system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a signal flow diagram illustrating origination call processing.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a prior art preamble acquisition procedure.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a preamble acquisition procedure in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the present invention provides a call setup process for a wireless communication system having a fast preamble signal acquisition and acknowledgment procedure.
- the call setup process of the present invention includes a preamble acquisition procedure based upon a multi-stage search technique and includes power control procedures and rate determination functionality as will be described.
- the invention is described in terms of a preferred implementation as part of a CDMA communication system, however, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that its teachings extend beyond the preferred embodiment described herein.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a communication system 100 that preferably operates in accordance with a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system protocol (e.g., IS-95-A).
- Communication system 100 includes a base station (BS) 102 , a BS 104 , a mobile station (MS) 106 , a centralized base station controller (CBSC) 108 , and a mobile switching center (MSC) 110 .
- BS 102 and BS 104 are preferably Motorola SC9600 base stations
- MSC 110 is preferably a Motorola EMX2500 MSC
- CBSC 108 is preferably a Motorola SG1128BF CBSC component.
- BS 102 and BS 104 are suitably coupled to CBSC 108
- CBSC 108 is suitably coupled to MSC 110
- Mobile station 106 is preferably a mobile radiotelephone such as a cellular radiotelephone or a personal communication system (PCS) handset, which communicates via uplink signals 112 and downlink signals 114 with BS 102 and BS 104 .
- PCS personal communication system
- FIG. 2 illustrates such a call setup process 200 .
- MS 106 is in the MS idle state.
- the MS enters a mobile station origination substate of the system access state.
- MS 106 transmits an Origination Message 20 —as an Access channel (ACC) burst or probe—to the BS transceiver (part of BS 102 and BS 104 ) dedicated to the Paging and Access channels (PCH-ACC), implemented on the PCH-ACC MCC (Multiple channel card) card (not shown) portion of BS 102 / 104 .
- ACC Access channel
- PCH-ACC Paging and Access channels
- BS 102 / 104 After successful reception of Origination Message 202 , BS 102 / 104 transmits, via the Paging channel card, an acknowledgement 204 (Base Station Ack. Order) to MS 106 via the Paging channel.
- MS 106 receives acknowledgement 204 and waits for a Channel Assignment Message 206 from BS 102 / 104 .
- BS 102 / 104 following higher-layer network activity 208 at the XCDR and mobility manager (MM) portions of CBSC 108 , assigns a traffic channel transmitter-receiver (TCH MCC) card (not shown) to handle the call and sends a Channel Assignment Message 206 .
- TCH MCC traffic channel transmitter-receiver
- BS 102 / 104 also be gins several activities associated with preamble acquisition 210 .
- BS 102 / 104 begins transmission of null frames on the assigned traffic channel.
- BS 102 / 104 begins transmission of 1.25 ms-spaced power control bits on the traffic channel power control sub-channel, where there are 16 power control bits transmitted per 20 ms frame, or 1 bit per 1.25 ms Power Control Group (PCG). Since BS 102 / 104 has not received signals from MS 106 , the transmit ted bit sequence is usually the so called “idle” pattern consisting of alternate +1, ⁇ 1 bits.
- each bit orders MS 106 to increase or decrease, respectively, its transmitted power level by 1 dB in delta-modulation fashion.
- BS 102 / 104 also initializes a STRAU (i.e. encoded speech) link to the XCDR to the STRAU idle pattern and commences a search for the preamble transmission.
- MS activates closed power loop control 212 and begins preamble transmission 214 following receipt of the Channel Assignment Message 206 .
- the search procedure resolves the delay of exploitable multipath components at which the spread-spectrum transmission from MS 106 is received.
- Channel Assignment message 206 If Channel Assignment message 206 is successfully received by MS 106 , it enters the Mobile Station Control on the Traffic Channel State. MS 106 then sets the assigned forward traffic channel Walsh cover, sets the reverse traffic channel long code mask, and attempts to demodulate the extant forward traffic channel null traffic channel frame sequence.
- MS 106 If MS 106 successfully demodulates two (2) consecutive good null traffic frames within 200 ms of beginning demodulation, it initiates the preamble transmission 214 using the specified long code mask and commences taking action on the bit pattern transmitted on the traffic channel power control subchannel. Note that the IS-95-A specification requires that MS 106 act on any power control bit corresponding to a valid PCG. Since all transmitted PCGs are valid during preamble transmission, the slew rate of MS 106 transmitted power level in this state is up to 16 dB per 20 ms frame. If MS 106 cannot demodulate the forward TCH, the call fails.
- Channel Assignment message 204 fails to be delivered successfully by the Paging channel (due, for example, to excess interference at MS 106 ) that message may be retransmitted up to 3 more times by the PCH-ACH MCC before the call is declared to have failed. This means that, depending on the message erasure rate of the PCH, BS 102 / 104 may attempt to acquire preamble for several seconds before MS 106 begins preamble transmission. This exposes BS 102 / 104 to increased risk of false detection.
- BS 102 / 104 acquires 216 the MS 106 transmission and informs 218 the PCH-ACH-MCC that acquisition has been successfully achieved.
- BS 102 / 104 sends a BS Ack.
- the MS 106 state is then changed to the Conversation State. Once in the Conversation State, MS 106 sends a MS Ack.
- Order 222 to BS 102 / 104 as a 1-frame Traffic channel signaling message 222 . This appears as a full-rate frame to the BS 102 / 104 receiver with information bit tags to indicate a signaling message.
- MS 106 also terminates preamble transmission and begins transmission of the null Traffic sequence 224 .
- the BS Ack. Order used to indicate successful preamble acquisition to MS 106 is generated by the XCDR. Transmission of this message by the XCDR is triggered by the observation at the XCDR of five or more consecutive STRAU IDLE frames followed by one STRAU SPEECH frame with “erasure” frame quality. This is based on the assumption that preamble frames successfully demodulated following acquisition will be declared by the rate-determination algorithm to be erasures, in place of the previous STRAU IDLE frames sent prior to acquisition by BS 102 / 104 .
- the change in transmission by MS 106 from preamble to idle traffic transmission is similarly detected by the XCDR as three or more consecutive STRAU SPEECH frames with “non-erasure” frame quality 226 (additionally a network entity may also verify reception of the MS Ack. Order 222 ).
- This change in STRAU frame type is required by the XCDR to send the Service Option Response Order 228 specifying the service option to be used (usually Service Option 1, the default speech service option).
- MS 106 After acknowledgement by MS 106 , MS 106 begins variable-speech transmission 230 on the Traffic Channel.
- BS 102 / 104 begins the preamble acquisition procedure 208 .
- BS preamble acquisition procedure 300 begins transmission of the as described “idle” power control sequence.
- the BS search engine generates statistics for the multipath signal delays. Delays for which the statistic exceeds a threshold T are identified, step 308 .
- step 310 rake fingers are accordingly assigned to the identified delays, step 312 . That is, preamble acquisition is declared. Otherwise the search continues. With assignment of the rake fingers, the “inner” power control loop is closed, step 314 , and demodulation begins using rate set 1, step 316 . As described, however, the foregoing procedure 300 suffers numerous disadvantages.
- the preamble acquisition procedure is a multi-stage search technique.
- a signal search engine implemented as part of the call processing components of BS 102 / 104 (e.g., using the CSM IS-95-A demodulator application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) available from Qualcomm, Inc. of San Diego, Calif.) is used to identify candidate delays at which multipath components of the preamble signal are indicated to be present.
- ASIC application specific integrated circuit
- Generation of these search results is termed phase 1, 402 , of the preamble search procedure.
- the search engine continues to generate this search data for use by the subsequent phases of the procedure until acquisition is declared.
- phase 2 404 , as the search engine seeks additional multipath components to those already identified, the search engine demodulator rake fingers are configured as a secondary search engine in order to verify the multipath components or “candidates” located during phase 1 search.
- Phase 3, 406 completes the verification process by checking the known information content of the preamble frames to declare preamble acquisition with high reliability.
- BS 102 / 104 begins transmission of the preamble power control “idle” sequence on the traffic channel power control subchannel, step 408 .
- the preamble acquisition search procedure generates search statistics for both antennas at each of a uniformly spaced array of delays (each such delay is commonly termed a search “bin”), step 410 .
- search “bin” a uniformly spaced array of delays
- a process of continuously searching on both antennas the entire region of possible delays—termed the uncertainty region—within which MS 106 should be located is undertaken.
- a single such search is defined as a single examination of both antennas observing the sector at _-chip resolution.
- a directed search utilizes a reliable preamble location indicator from the ACC indicating the delay at which the strongest mean multipath component for the origination message was demodulated.
- a “non-directed” search does not have the a-priori knowledge of MS 106 delay available, and the entire access window is searched.
- a first timer preferably about 300 milliseconds (ms) is started. If the directed search has not acquired within T1, the search mode is switched to non-directed. This allows for recovery from an erroneous preamble location indication.
- the idle power control pattern is replaced by a previously generated pattern instructing a net “D” dB, preferably about 5 dB, change in MS 106 transmit power level uniformly distributed over a time period T2, preferably about 500 ms.
- a net “D” dB preferably about 5 dB
- change in MS 106 transmit power level uniformly distributed over a time period T2 preferably about 500 ms.
- at least one search of the of the uncertainty region is executed before every discrete increase in MS 106 transmit power. Also, by providing a non-directed search following a directed search, the possibility that the search window does not contain the actual MS 106 delays is reduced. After complete transmission of the total power increase pattern, the idle pattern is restored.
- the lock filters and delay lock loops associated with each finger are configured to update during every PCG, rather than every 1 ⁇ 8-rate PCG as in the prior art implementation.
- the fingers are also configured to operate on the zeroth Walsh symbol output. This maintains the use of the preamble signal—the preferred acquisition signal—as input to the phase 2 verification test.
- Phase 3 begins at step 420 with an attempt to demodulate a 20 ms frame consisting of the preamble sequence.
- the assigned fingers remaining after phase 2 are reconfigured to select the maximum energy Walsh symbol rather than Walsh symbol zero.
- a delay period is provided.
- the information bits recovered from the Viterbi decoder should be the all-zero information sequence, or at least have a small number of “ones”. If fewer than L1 (a typical value would be 140) of the 172 information bits recovered from the full-rate Viterbi decode operation are demodulated as zero, the finger assignments are again abandoned, new candidates are obtained from the most recent search, and phase 2 of the preamble acquisition procedure 400 is re-entered, step 422 .
- so-called “inner-loop” power control may be initialized at this point with a setpoint designed to achieve 1% full-rate frame erasure rate (for example, an 8 db Eb/No initial setpoint would be sufficient), step 428 .
- a more robust and conservative approach, at the expense of 2-5 20 ms frames of further delay, is to re-program the power control pattern register to generate a +D dB (typically +2 dB) sequence over a single 20 ms frame, step 426 , and then revert to the idle sequence. Preamble frame demodulation is re-attempted on the next received frame.
- the assigned fingers are re-configured to update at 1 ⁇ 8-rate.
- the power control outer loop is configured to execute for the first time on the next frame boundary, and multipath searching commences.
- a modified rate determination function for convenience termed the Signaling Rate Determinate (SRD) function—is used instead.
- SRD Signaling Rate Determinate
- the SRD remains in use until the Service Option Response Order signaling MS 106 to change to variable-rate transmission is sent, after which the SRD is replaced by the rate set 1 or rate set 2 rate determination function.
- preamble Composed of all-zeros information sequence
- idle frames Composed of all-ones information sequence
- full-rate used to convey the MS Ack.
- Order following BS Ack Order used to indicate preamble acquisition. This is transmitted along with a reliable 12-bit CRC.
- the present invention encompasses a method and associated apparatus for call setup, a particularly, for preamble transmission acquisition and acknowledgement.
- the procedure advantageously provides for early, during call setup, mobile station transmit power control and reduces the likelihood of false preamble acquisition.
- the teachings of the present invention will find application beyond the specific embodiments discussed herein.
