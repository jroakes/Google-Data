Description
Technical field
Present disclose relates generally to the list for providing available program, and it is location-based more particularly, to providing
The rendition list.
Background technology
Industry report shows that spectators are being spent more more time viewing TVs than once and taken using the delivering of other media
Business.In response, new service is almost developed daily.Interactive and social networking application is added to traditional " content consumption " experience
(for example, broadcast TV program).For example, video screen can show which the interactive use in the traditional broadcast content for overlapping onto TV
Family interface, the user interface support the application of supplement broadcasted content (for example, overlapping onto the interactive physical on physical culture web feeds
Interface).
Meanwhile the source of media content is promptly increased sharply.The program and internet of user's storage provide even for spectators
More selections.Track full content provider and track their various services and have become difficult.Even user has been
It is also likely to be heavy to determine that the content item of viewing finds best source.
All these problems are exaggerated for traveller.In the position of the family away from user known to user
Some items of media content or delivery service may not be available.As many or even it is accustomed to even if new position provides than user
In more content sources, user, which may also find, is difficult to rationalize all these new sources so as to which they are efficiently used, especially
It is when he has less time to learn how to browse the available source in new position.
Brief description of the drawings
, can be following from being carried out with reference to attached drawing although appended claims are set forth with particularly in the feature of this technology
These technologies and its objects and advantages are best understood in specific descriptions, in the accompanying drawings：
Fig. 1 is the general introduction for the representative environment that can put into practice this technology；
Fig. 2 is the schematic diagram of representative access manager；
Fig. 3 is the flow chart for the method for the rendition list to be presented based on the current location of user；

Embodiment
Attached drawing is turned to, wherein same reference numeral refers to same element, the technology of the disclosure is illustrated as implemented in
In suitable environment.The embodiment based on claim, and the replacement on being not explicitly described herein is described below
Embodiment should not be regarded as limitation claim.
Disclosed method help user especially user of the temporal persistence in the long-range position positioned at family find and
Access media content.It is being customized for the current location of user and the practically section of available service is shown only at the position
Mesh list is created and is presented to user.In certain embodiments, user is interacted with list to access available media content
.If user has expressed specific location-based preference, those preferences can be considered when creating list.If by user
The service of subscription is disabled at this remote location, then will search for the provider for replacing, and if it is found, then can
It is enough most to like performance to be added to created the rendition list user.The spy of these designs is described below with reference to Fig. 3 to Fig. 5
Determine embodiment.
Before ad hoc approach is started, the representative communication environment 100 of Fig. 1 is considered.Via various known networking technologies 102
In any or all links together is such as server of content information source 104 and access manager 106.Such as under
What face was discussed, these multiple servers 104,106 can have and can work together.
Content information source 104 provides the information on the available media content of user via networking technology 102.It is such
Content can include such as film, TV programme, audio (for example, radio) program, internet media and download and play.Institute
The information of offer can include description media content and the access information useful when user desires access to items of media content (can
Can include marked price or subscription information) metadata.
(notice that it is the offer on the information of main items of media content for purposes of this discussion.In many situations
Under, identical content information source 104 not only provides the information on items of media content but also provides items of media content in itself.)
The home communications environment of the illustrated user of the first half such as by Fig. 1 is considered first.At least one content information source
104 be the head end server that subscription cable television services are supplied to user.Traditional end user device is by " Wireline "
Network technology (for example, optical fiber, electric wire and cable) is supported.For example, set-top box 110 is usually received from various channel providers
TV programme, and the user interface for being used for selecting and check the content from cable television provider is provided (for example, interactive
Program guide).Digital video recorder (DVR) 112 can store program for checking later.
Video content can be checked on televimonitor 114.In some cases, smart phone 116 can be wirelessly
Access both television content and the service based on web.Home gateway, tablet PC, phonebooth, numerical chracter or matchmaker
It is some other possible end user devices that body streams device (not shown) again.
(media stream device and transmit content between different types of network again.For example, it is received from cable system 108a
Content and then by the local area radio current source road of such as WiFi by the contents projection to smart phone 116.Media stream again
Device usually operates the message between bearer network in the two directions.In certain embodiments, the aspect of the disclosure is by matchmaker
Body streams device to put into practice again.)
As indicated above, TV programme can be delivered to the non-traditional subscriber devices of such as smart phone 116.Should
Smart phone 116 wirelessly communicates to access public switched telephone with wireless base station (being not shown but known in the art)
The television delivery service of net, internet or other networks to access the service based on web and be provided by channel server.
User is familiar with this home environment and is familiar with the content chance that it is provided.User, which for example knows whether, starts his
Cable television services are most to be liked performing or reach some other provider.
Consider that user goes on business (lower half of Fig. 1) when being away from home now.Here, the laptop computer 118 of user can
Network 102 is delivered via cable 108b or the media for being connected wirelessly to include internet.However, home environment of the user at him
In known various Media delivery services may not be available in this remote location.For example, he may not connect
There is the cable television provider that family subscribes to it to him, and available media offer thing can be big at this remote location
Very much not it is same as the known service in his home environment.
The technology of the user is helped to Fig. 5 discussion below with reference to Fig. 3.However, before continuing there, Fig. 2 shows
Go out the primary clustering of representative access manager 106.Communication interface (being also called transceiver) 200 asks and receives media
Content information and other message.The operation of 202 control device 106 of processor, and especially, support as Fig. 3 schemes into Fig. 5
The aspect for the presently disclosed method shown.The optional support user of user interface 204 (or administrator) interacts with device 106.
The special-purpose of these components is discussed below according to situation.
Access manager 106 be substantially can almost trustship anywhere service for example, on special server,
In one on the laptop computer 118 of user, in content information source 104, in Fig. 1 in shown other devices
On any one, or far away from internet " cloud ".
The side for being used for creating the rendition list for being only included in the available items of media content in current position of user is presented in Fig. 3
Method.This method determines to start in the step 300 of the current location of user in access manager 106.It can be used herein from GPS
Positioning is derived to network clearly to inquire user he is located at any known technology where.
Although (step 300 is described in terms of the current location of user, that is not stringent necessary.For example,
In Chicago, the user of family may want to the method for application drawing 3 so that what media delivering clothes when he goes to Boston to go on business determined
Business will can use him.It that case, destination locations (Boston) rather than his current location of step 300 application user
(Chicago).For ease of this discussion, the target location of user is referred to herein as his " current " position.)
In step 302, access manager 106 is from 104 content information of first content information source.The source 104 can
It is associated with the media services subscribed to by user, the media services such as TV service, audio service, video-on-demand service,
Internet content server or game services.Information can include with from the associated any class of the available items of media content of the service
The useful metadata of type, it is (to be swum for example, baseball can have been interrupted around actual the available time to be included in those content items
Play the time period), for access information of price of awards etc..In some cases, returned by content information source 104
Message form be the rendition list or interactive program guide.
In step 304, content information of the access manager 108 from the second content information source 104 request same type.This
A second source 104 can with for example another subscription service, broadcast service, TV service, audio service, video-on-demand service, because
Special net content service or game services are associated.Second source 104 is possibly even the DVR 112 of user, access manager 106
Storage device with it, or another media storage being accessible by.Can be for multiple possible content information sources 104
Repeat step 304.For example, can repeat step 304 so as to search on by user in his family it is ordered or by
The information of each Media delivery services that he periodically uses and access by user in his family place it is ordered or by
Each Media delivery services that he periodically uses.Under normal circumstances, the content information source 104 accessed in step 304 is (can
Can be in the case of supplementary payments) from the current location of user (as definite in step 300) it is addressable those.
Access manager 106 can carry out the content information of collection step 302 and step 304 using other methods.For example,
After retrieving contents list in step 304, perhaps access manager 106 is not able to tell that whether particular media content item is available
's.(some Media delivery services provide the notoriously incomplete list of their offer thing.) in order to find out, access pipe
Reason device 106 can ask the access to particular media content item.Response to the request tells access manager 106 media content
Whether item can use from that source.
It is likely that some in the information retrieved in step 302 and step 304 are in the current position of user
It is unavailable.For example, subscription service may have the limited covering range areas for the current location that may do not extend into user, or
The subscription service can cover the current location of user but with the limitation of location-based content.Media based on internet are passed
It may be available in each place to take business, but their content may be limited by local regulation.The Netflix of user
(TM) subscribe to for example may only can (or being allowed to) some in its content are delivered to the position in the U.S..Step 306 attempts
Any information being currently unavailable is filtered out in the information retrieved from step 302 and step 304.In addition to being limited except position, when
Between limitation can be applied to filter.If for example, user will only in current location last from days, in the knot of the stop of user
The program delivered outside beam is likely to incoherent.Moreover, it can be eliminated when same items of media content is available from multiple sources
Redundancy.Because different content information sources 104 can describe same items of media content using different metadata, those are different
Metadata can be blended as the part of the step 306.
Sometimes, same items of media content can use from different sources, but accessing price may change.If subscriber wishes
In the access media content item at the long-range position of his family, then even subscription service can be to " roaming " expense (with honeycomb electricity
It is similar to talk about known expense in the world) charge.In these cases, the filtering of step 306 may keep only generally the least expensive source.
The filtering of step 306 is also based on the preference for the user for clearly illustrating or impliedly obtaining.User for example exists
Sport event may be only watched while travelling in the past, so the content of all other type is filtered off.Social activity can also be applied
Existence information (if it is known that) to filter out some contents.
Although step 306 is shown as being different from step 302 and step 304 in figure 3, in certain embodiments,
Filtering is built into content information retrieval step.Access manager 106 can for example ask only next several in step 304
It list.
(possibly filtering out) information of above-mentioned steps is integrated into the rendition list in step 308.In some embodiments
In, this list is given user and is found from his current position and his relevant total medium delivering source in total medium
Rong Xiang.When in unfamiliar (and may promptly change) environment, this makes the media consumption of user become more to increase
Effect.
, can be optional using any criterion related to user in order to become the selection course of user or even be easier
Ground is in the step 310 ranked up the rendition list.Some criterions include user preference (clear and definite or implicit again), social activity
Existence information and access pricing information.User with limited free time may want to the running length by items of media content
List is ranked up.
Finally, the rendition list is presented to user in step 312.If access manager 106 is by the on knee of user
Computer 118 (or smart phone 116) trustship, then the rendition list simply presented by the user interface 204 of the device.Managed when accessing
Reason device 106 be located at user apparatus it is long-range when, then the rendition list can be sent to the device of user in step 312, and
And it can be shown to user by user apparatus.
The rendition list can be simple list, it is preferred that being with each introduces a collection to the items of media content in list
The interactive electronic program guide of logical connection.Then, user can interact to retrieve items of media content with guide, without knowing
How road accesses the source (or even knowing that what source is) of this.
Note that there do not have anything to be intended to destruction in the method (or the Fig. 4 and the method for Fig. 5 being discussed below) of Fig. 3 to be logical
Cross the authority of the addressable various Media delivery services of list.The rendition list created is only intended to collect information and by information
User is supplied to, information is publicly available but is likely difficult to collect and arranges, and comes especially for the unfamiliar user in place
Say.
Fig. 4 presents another technology for providing location-based the rendition list.First step 400,402,404 and ginseng
Examine that Fig. 3 those described above steps are similar, except the method only one content information source of Fig. 4 in certain embodiments
104 are put into practice (but can use multiple sources 104).
In a step 406, the content information retrieved is ranked up based on the preference of user.These preferences can be by
Clearly set (for example, travelling or even travelling in the user profiles customized in this specific location) or can pass through
The observation result of behavior history to user is inferred.
Simple examples should clarify this.User lives in San Francisco, he usually watches in the afternoon 9 there:00 starts
Full-length movie.However, when he travels to New York, he only watches the short-movie section no more than 30 minutes.(probably due to he
During travelling it is too busy and cannot for full-length movie spend the time.) this behavior observation is considered as a result, when user is in New York
When, step 406 can place short-movie section close to the top of list.
Another example of same user：When in New York, he often watch due to 3 it is small when he can not be in viewing the time difference
Early stage programme televised live.Again, step 406 can utilize this behavior observation result.
Whenever user travels to east coast or even during to the position never travelled to before him, above-mentioned two observes result
Ingenious use will apply New York Behavior preference.
Step 408 and step 410 by reference to figure 3 it is discussed above in a manner of similar mode create and present through row
The rendition list of sequence.
Therefore, the method for Fig. 4 is given and will be likely in spy to provide to be given to using the location-based preference of user
The rendition list of the items of media content (being limited to certainly available at the position) of middle viewing is put in positioning.
Another technology for being used for creating location-based the rendition list is presented in Fig. 5.It is such as discussed above with reference to figure 3,
The current location of user is determined in step 500.In step 502, specific media content interested in user is identified
.Here the preference (clear and definite or implicit) of user and social existence information are probably useful, or user may ask
Seek access particular media content item.User is also possible to be observed over periodically to watch identical (or similar) content item.
For example, user always watches the news of his local when being in or usually watches Cardinals baseball teams.
Step 504 request accesses identified items of media content.If local media delivery service provides the media content
, then this is added to the rendition list (creating in step 508).On the other hand, if not providing items of media content, visit
Ask manager 106 that possible source (step 506) continues untill it have found provider again by searching for possible source.
(it is capable of providing many reasons of identified items of media content why not there are given Media delivery services：There may be this
Ground content regulations limitation, the Copyright Law may prevent from delivering in the current position of user, may be with the owner of items of media content
There are contract limitation etc..) sometimes, requested items of media content is found to can use from multiple sources, and can be according to by every
The requested price that accesses in a source is ranked up the rendition list (510).
In step 512, if having found at least one source, the rendition list quilt with requested items of media content
It is presented to user.
When user has known that the material that he wishes what is watched or has viewing same type is accustomed to but to his
When available Media delivery services are unfamiliar with current location, the technology of Fig. 5 is useful.When for serviced known to user because
When being unable to deliver desired material in his current position for the limitation of such as local content regulations, this method is also to have
.
The technology of Fig. 3 to Fig. 5 is respectively presented above, but all of which can be achieved to be created for user
Build a location-based the rendition list.In all cases, user, which presents, can be used for what is checked in his current location
Unified list (may include from it is many individually sources items of media content), and the list can present be considered as to
Family item of special interest (when this information on user is available), protrude or be in preferentially in other ways
It is existing.
In view of many possible embodiments of the principle of this discussion can be applied, it should be appreciated that on attached drawing herein
Described in embodiment be intended exclusively for it is illustrative, and should not be regarded as limitation claim scope.Therefore, such as this
