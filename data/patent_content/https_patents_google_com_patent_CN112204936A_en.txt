Disclosure of Invention
This specification describes technologies relating to reformatting digital components using probabilistic techniques such that, for a portion of the time that a digital component is provided for presentation, a particular format is provided that the digital component would otherwise not be able to provide.
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a system that includes: one or more front-end servers configured to receive requests for digital components and to provide digital components in response to the requests; and one or more back-end servers in data communication with the one or more front-end servers. One or more back-end servers may be configured to perform operations comprising: data specifying a distribution parameter limit for a given reformable digital component that is eligible for reformatting using the set of digital component extensions is obtained. Each digital component extension may include additional content that, when selected, is used to generate a reformatted version of a given reformattable digital component. For each of the plurality of digital component requests, in response to the digital component request for which a given reformable digital component is selected for distribution to the client device, the backend server can determine that a given digital component extension of the set of digital component extensions has additional selection requirements that, when combined with the basic selection requirements of the given reformable digital component, will exceed the distribution parameter limit for the given reformable digital component. The basic selection requirement is the amount required to be submitted to the digital component distributor to provide a basic version of the digital component without expansion. The back-end server may determine, using a probabilistic technique and based at least on the distribution parameter limit and the basic selection requirement, a probability that a given digital component extension will be selected for generating a reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component such that an aggregate selection requirement for distributing the given reformattable digital component over a period of time in response to the plurality of requests is within the distribution parameter limit. The back-end server may select a digital component extension for a given reformable digital component. A given digital component extension for which a combination of the basic selection requirement and the additional selection requirement exceeds a distribution parameter limit is selected for a portion of the digital component requests based on the determined probability. The back-end server generates a reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component using the selected digital component extension. The back-end server may provide a reformatted version of a given reformattable digital component to the front-end server. The front-end server sends the reformatted version of the given digital component to the client device that received the digital component request. Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding apparatus, methods, and computer programs configured to perform aspects of the methods encoded on computer storage devices.
These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. In some aspects, the operations comprise: a second probability that a second digital component extension will be selected for generating a second reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component is determined using a probability technique. The combination of the basic selection requirement and the second additional selection requirement of the second digital component extension may be smaller than the distribution parameter limit.
In some aspects, the operations include selecting a given digital component extension and a second digital component extension from the set of digital component extensions based on (i) a combination of the basic selection requirement and the additional selection requirement and (ii) a combination of the basic selection requirement and the second additional selection requirement. Selecting a given digital component extension and a second digital component extension from the set of digital component extensions may include: determining that a first combined selection requirement based on a combination of the basic selection requirement and the additional selection requirement is a lowest combined selection requirement for the set of digital component extensions that is above the distribution parameter limit, and in response, selecting the given digital component extension; and determining that a second combined selection requirement based on a combination of the base selection requirement and the second additional selection requirement is a highest combined selection requirement for the set of digital component extensions that is less than the distribution parameter limit, and in response, selecting a second digital component extension.
In some aspects, the operations comprise: a second probability that the given reformable digital component will be provided without reformatting using the digital component extension is determined using a probability technique.
In some aspects, the operations comprise: for each or two or more second digital component extensions, a respective second probability that the second digital component extension will be selected for generating a second reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component is determined. The probability that a given digital component extension will be selected and each second probability may be determined such that the aggregate selection requirement for distributing a given reformable digital component using the given digital component extension and each second digital component extension is within the distribution parameter limit.
Determining a probability that a given digital component extension will be selected for generating a reformatted version of a given reformattable digital component may include: by including a given digital component extension in a reformatted version of the reformattable digital component, a probability is determined based on an expected increase in user interaction with the reformattable digital component.
In some aspects, the basic selection requirement for a given reformable digital component is based on a combination of distribution parameter limitations and the performance of the reformable digital component.
The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular embodiments to realize one or more of the following advantages. Using the probabilistic techniques described herein, the format of the digital components that would otherwise not be provided based on their associated selection requirements is provided at a specified rate so that the distribution parameter limits of the digital components are not exceeded. Selecting an extension for reformatting the digital component with a specified probability allows the digital component to be reformatted using multiple extensions such that the aggregate selection requirement of the distributed format of the digital component is equal to or close to (e.g., within a threshold value of) the distribution parameter limit of the digital component.
Using the non-conventional digital component distribution techniques described herein, the user experience is improved over conventional techniques, which are favored by users due to the provision of digital components to users in formats with higher user interaction rates. In addition, users are provided with more interactive digital components that initiate actions for the user, since conventionally, these digital component formats often have selection requirements that exceed the distribution parameter limits of the digital components. Digital component distributors benefit from higher interaction rates because digital components are provided in formats with higher user interaction rates.
Various features and advantages of the foregoing subject matter are described below with reference to the drawings. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the subject matter described herein and from the claims.

Detailed Description
In general, the systems and techniques described herein may generate and distribute reformatted versions of digital components such that reformatted versions that are not generally eligible for distribution based on distribution parameter limits are distributed without exceeding the distribution parameter limits. For purposes of this document, a reformable digital component is a digital component that can be formatted with different content and/or different functionality, e.g., with different digital component extensions. A digital component extension is additional content or functionality that can be added to a digital component to generate a reformatted version of the digital component. For simplicity, the digital component extensions are also referred to as extensions. The described technique aims to enable digital components to be reformatted with extensions that will result in the resulting combined selection requirements exceeding the distribution parameter limits.
The digital components may be selected for distribution based on their distribution parameter limits. Typically, the distribution parameter limit is the maximum amount that a digital component publisher of the digital component is willing to provide for presenting the digital component. For example, for some selection processes, the distribution parameter limit of the digital component may be the highest bid. As a result of the selection process, the amount of submissions required per presentation of the base version of the digital component (i.e., the base selection requirement) is typically less than the distribution parameter limit. For example, the basic selection requirement for the selected digital component may be a distribution parameter limit for the digital component having the second highest distribution parameter limit. In this case, the digital component distributor may add one or more extensions to the digital component as long as the combined selection requirements based on the basic selection requirements and the additional selection requirements for each of the one or more extensions are not exceeded.
Each extension may have an associated additional selection requirement that may be added to the basic selection requirement when the digital component is reformatted to include the extension. For example, if a digital component distribution system reformats a digital component using a given extension, a publisher of the digital component may be required to submit a combined selection requirement that is equal to or based on the sum of the basic selection requirement and the additional selection requirement.
The digital component publisher can specify a distribution parameter limit that does not exceed the combined selection requirement and enable the digital component distributor to add extensions to the digital components as long as the distribution parameter limit is not exceeded. This provides flexibility in the digital component distribution system in providing digital components in various formats. However, distribution parameter limitations may also prevent utilizing extended presentations for digital components that would result in the combined selection requirement exceeding the distribution parameter limitations. The techniques described in this document enable digital components to be reformatted through extensions that will cause the combined selection requirement to exceed the distribution parameter limit while ensuring that the aggregate (e.g., average) combined selection requirement of the digital components over a period of time is equal to or less than the distribution parameter limit.
As used throughout this document, the phrase "digital component" refers to a discrete unit of digital content or digital information (e.g., a video clip, an audio clip, a multimedia clip, an image, text, or another unit of content). The digital component may be electronically stored in the physical storage device as a single file or collection of files, may take the form of a video file, audio file, multimedia file, image file, or text file, and includes advertising information, such that the advertisement is a digital component.
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an environment 100 in which an example digital component distribution system 120 generates and distributes reformatted versions of digital components. The digital component distribution system 120 includes a digital component selector 122, an expand selector 124, and a digital component formatter 126. Each of these components may be implemented in one or more servers, as described below with reference to fig. 2.
Digital component selector 122 may select one or more digital components to provide in response to a digital component request received from a client device, e.g., client device A130 or client device B132. The digital component selector 122 may select one or more digital components from the set of digital components 127 based on the distribution parameter limits of each digital component, the quality or performance of the digital components, and/or other distribution criteria of each digital component 127. As described in more detail below, the dispensing parameter limit is an amount that does not exceed the selection requirements for providing the digital components, for example in currency. The aggregate distribution parameter limit may be, for example, an amount, such as an average amount, by which selection requests, such as average selection requirements, for a number of distributions of no more than digital components are aggregated. For example, the average selection requirement of multiple distributions must not exceed the aggregate distribution parameter limit, which in this example may be equal to the distribution parameter limit. In a particular example, if the distribution parameter is limited to 10, the average selection requirement for multiple distributions of digital components should not exceed 10.
The digital component extension selector 124 may determine a selection probability for the digital component and use the selection probability to select an extension for the digital component. The selection probability of an extension defines the probability that the digital component extension selector 124 will select an extension for reformatting the digital component. For example, if the selection probability of a given extension is 10%, then the given extension 10% is selected for reformatting the digital component for a given presentation of the digital component. The extension selector 124 may select an extension from the set of digital component extensions 129. Each extension may include additional content or functionality that can be used to reformat the digital component, for example, by adding the extension to the digital component or replacing a portion of the digital component with the extension.
For example, extension 1 adds a site link to a website associated with a digital component and has an associated additional selection requirement of 5% of the basic selection requirement for the digital component. Extension 2 is the level of the entity associated with the digital component and has an associated additional selection requirement of 10% of the basic selection requirement for the digital component. Extension 3 is a click-to-call link that, when interacted with, causes a telephone call of the displayed numeric component to the telephone number of the entity associated with the numeric component, and has an associated additional selection requirement of 20% of the basic selection requirement for the numeric component. Extension 4 is the location of the entity to the digital component and has an associated additional selection requirement of 35% of the basic selection requirement for the digital component. In some implementations, the additional selection requirements for the extension may differ for different digital components.
The extended selection probabilities are defined such that extensions where the combined selection requirements (e.g., the basic selection requirements plus the extended additional selection requirements) exceed the distribution parameter limits may still be provided. For example, by providing digital components in a format that is less than the combined selection requirements of the distribution parameter limits and providing digital components in a format that exceeds the combined selection requirements of the distribution parameter limits at a specified selection probability, the aggregate selection requirement may be less than or equal to the distribution parameter limits. Example techniques for determining the selection probability are described below.
For example, for a given selection process of selecting digital component a for presentation on a client device, digital component 1 has a distribution parameter limit of 2.3, a base selection requirement of 2.0, a selection probability of extension 2 of 50%, and a selection probability of extension 3 of 50%. In this example, the combined selection requirement of extension 2 is 2.0+ (2.0 x 0.1) ═ 2.2, since the additional selection requirement of extension 2 is 0.1 (e.g., 5% of the basic selection requirement). Likewise, the combined selection requirement of extension 3 is 2.0+ (2.0 x 0.2) ═ 2.4, since the additional selection requirement of extension 3 is 0.2 (e.g., 10% of the basic selection requirement).
In this example, the combined selection requirement (2.4) of the digital component 1 with extension 3 exceeds the distribution parameter (2.3). Therefore, extension 3 must not be used with digital component 1 unless one of the parameters changes. However, if the time to use extension 3 is 50% and the time to use extension 2 is 50% with a base selection requirement of 2.0, then the aggregate selection requirement, e.g., average selection requirement, for digital component 1 presentation with a base selection requirement of 2.0 will be 2.3 for digital component 1. For example, if extension 3 is used 10 times and extension 2 is used 10 times, the total would be 24 (i.e., 2.4 x 10) plus 23 (i.e., 2.2 x 10) to 46. The average of the 20 times is 2.3 (e.g., 46/20) and is equal to the distribution parameter limit of the digital component 1. By distributing digital components with a specified probability using zero or more extensions having a combined selection requirement less than the distribution parameter limit and distributing digital components using one or more extensions having a combined selection requirement greater than the distribution limit, extensions with higher additional selection requirements can be used without exceeding the aggregate distribution parameter limit for a period of time.
The digital component extension selector 124 may use the probabilities to select an extension of a digital component and send the specified digital component and the extended data to the digital component formatter 126. The digital component formatter 126 may use the selected extension to generate a reformatted version of the digital component. For example, the digital component formatter 126 may add data or functionality defined by the selected extension to the digital component.
The digital component distribution system 120 can then send the reformatted digital component to the client device from which the digital component request was received. In the illustrated example, the digital component distribution system 120 has generated a reformatted version 140 of digital component 1 having extension 2 and sent the reformatted version 140 to client device a 130. The reformatted version 140 includes a level 141 as specified by extension 2. Similarly, the digital component distribution system 120 has generated a reformatted version 142 of the digital component 1 having extension 3 and sent the reformatted version 142 to the client device B132. Reformatted version 142 includes click-to-call link 143 as specified by extension 3.
By using selection probabilities, the digital component distribution system 120 can select extensions in real-time or near real-time after selecting digital components that are provided in response to a digital component request. Since the digital component distribution system 120 may receive millions of digital component requests per day and must respond to each request with one or more digital components within a short period of time (e.g., in milliseconds), a deterministic technique for rapid selection expansion, such as the techniques described herein, is needed.
The elements of the digital component distribution system 120 are described in more detail with reference to fig. 2, which is a block diagram of an environment 200 in which the digital component distribution system 120 generates and distributes reformatted versions of digital components.
The digital component distribution system 120 includes: one or more front-end servers 255 that receive digital component requests from client devices 230 and provide digital components to client devices 230 in response to the requests. The front end server 255 may receive the request and transmit the digital components over a data communications network 220 (e.g., a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), the internet, a mobile network, or a combination thereof). The network 120 connects the digital component distribution system 120, the resource publisher 210 (e.g., a publisher of a web page and/or application), the client device 230, and the digital component publisher 240.
The digital component distribution system 120 includes: a back-end server that selects a digital component and reformats the digital component to provide in response to a digital component request. The back-end servers include one or more digital component selection servers 260, one or more extended selection servers 262, one or more selection probability determination servers 264, and one or more digital component formatting servers 257.
The digital component selection server 260 selects one or more digital components to be provided in response to the digital component request. Digital component selection server 260 may select one or more digital components from digital components stored in digital component data storage 266, such as one or more hard disk drives, flash memory, and/or other suitable types of storage devices. The digital components stored in the digital component data store 266 may include digital components provided by the digital component publisher 240, e.g., entities that provide digital components for distribution to users. The digital components may include content, such as text, images, etc., related to the digital component publisher 240 and/or the products or services provided by the digital component publisher 240.
Digital component selection server 260 may select one or more digital components based on distribution parameter limits for the digital components, distribution criteria for the digital components, quality of the digital components, and/or performance of the digital components. For example, a digital component may have associated distribution criteria that specify the context in which the digital component is eligible for distribution, e.g., a particular web page, a particular search keyword, a resource that includes a particular keyword or points to a particular topic, and so on. In this example, digital component selection server 260 can select digital components that are eligible for presentation from the context defined by the digital component request, for example, by using distribution parameter limits, quality, and/or performance.
The dispensing parameter limit is an amount that does not exceed the selection requirements for providing the digital component, for example in currency. For example, as described above, the actual selection requirements for a particular distribution of digital components may be a combined selection requirement based on a combination of the basic selection requirement and the extended additional selection requirement for reformatting the digital components.
The digital component may have a plurality of distribution parameter limits. For example, the digital component publisher 240 may specify different distribution parameter limits for different presentation contexts. Additionally, the performance or quality of the digital component may vary based on the presentation context in which the digital component is presented. For example, a baseball-related digital component may perform better, e.g., receive user interactions at a higher rate, when presented on a baseball-related web page than when presented on a car-related web page. If the basic selection requirements are based on performance or quality and distribution parameter limitations, differences in performance or quality of different presentation contexts may affect the basic selection requirements of the digital components of the different presentation contexts.
As described above, digital component server 260 can identify digital components that are eligible for distribution in response to a request, e.g., based on a presentation context. Digital component server 260 may then select one or more digital components from the eligible digital components based on their distribution parameter limits (e.g., distribution parameter limits of the presentation context).
The digital component server 260 may use one or more types of selection processes, and the distribution parameter limits and basic selection requirements of the digital parameters may vary based on the selection processes. In one example, the digital component publisher provides distribution parameter limits for each presentation (e.g., each presentation) of the digital component. In this example, the distribution parameter limit may be a cost-per-presentation bid, and the digital component selection server 260 may select the digital component with the highest distribution parameter limit for the presentation context. The basic selection requirement of the selected digital component may be equal to the distribution parameter limit of the selected digital component, the distribution parameter limit of the digital component having the second highest distribution parameter limit (e.g., the second highest bid), or the second highest bid plus another amount (e.g., 1 cent).
In another example, the digital component publisher 240 can provide distribution parameter limits for each user action (e.g., selection of a digital component or another action after selection of a digital component). For example, the distribution parameter limit may be a cost per click ("CPC") bid or a per conversion bid. In this example, the basic selection requirement for the selected digital component may be equal to the distribution parameter limit of the selected digital component, the distribution parameter limit of the digital component having the second highest distribution parameter limit (e.g., the second highest bid), or the second highest bid plus another amount (e.g., 1 cent).
In another example, the digital component selection server 260 may select a digital component based on the effective cost of a particular number of presentations of the digital component. For example, the digital component selection server 260 can determine the effective cost of millions of presentations of the digital component based on a product of the CPC bid on the digital component and a performance (e.g., click-through rate) of the digital component. In this example, the distribution parameter limit for each digital component can be an eCPM bid for the digital component. The basic selection requirement of the selected digital component may be equal to the distribution parameter limit of the selected digital component, the distribution parameter limit of the digital component having the second highest distribution parameter limit (e.g., the second highest bid), or the second highest bid plus another amount (e.g., 1 cent).
The digital component selection server 260 may provide the selected digital component or data identifying the selected digital component to the extension selection server 262. Extension selection server 262 may determine whether an extension is to be used to reformat the selected digital component and, if so, select an extension for the digital component. As described above, an extension is additional content or functionality that can be added to a digital component to generate a reformatted version of the digital component. The extension or data used to generate the extension, such as a link, phone number, comment, etc., may be stored in an extension data storage device 268, such as one or more hard drives, flash memory, etc.
The extension selection server 262 may select an extension of the digital component based on a selection probability of each extension of the digital component. The selection probability of an extension defines the probability or other ratio that the extension selection server 262 selects the extension for reformatting the digital component. The option to not use extensions may also have a selection probability of a digital component, which defines the ratio at which the digital component is distributed without extension.
For example, a given digital component may have a selection probability of 25% for no expansion, 25% for expansion 1, 25% for expansion 2, and 25% for expansion 4. In this example, there is a 25% chance of not providing an extension to the digital component, a 25% chance of providing an extension 1 to the digital component, a 25% chance of providing an extension 2 to the digital component, and a 25% chance of providing an extension 3 to the digital component.
As described below, the probability determination server 264 may use the basic selection requirements of the digital components to determine the expanded selection probability. Since the basic selection requirements may differ based on the results of the selection process on selecting a digital component (e.g., using the second highest bid), the probability determination server 264 may determine the selection probability after the digital component has been selected. In another example, the probability determination server 264 may determine the selection probability prior to the selection process, e.g., for a number of potential base selection requirements. In this example, the selection probabilities may be stored in the selection data storage unit 270 and may be accessed after the digital components have been selected.
Digital component formatting server 257 may provide a reformatted version of the digital component to front end server 255. In turn, the front end server 255 may provide the reformatted version of the digital component to the client device 230 from which the digital component request was received.
The probability determination server 264 may determine the selection probability of the digital components and extensions. Each extension may have corresponding additional selection requirements. An additional optional requirement for the extension is the amount that needs to be submitted to the digital component distributor to use the extension when reformatting the digital component using the extension. If the digital component format server 257 reformats the given digital component using the given extension, the digital component publisher of the given digital component will be required to submit a combined selection requirement that is based on the base selection requirement of the given digital component and the amount of additional selection requirements of the given extension. For example, the combined selection requirement may be equal to the sum of the basic selection requirement and the additional selection requirement.
The extended additional selection requirement may be expressed as a percentage of the basic selection requirement. For example, an extension may have an additional selection requirement that is 10% of the basic selection of any digital component that uses the extension. In this example, if the basic selection requirement of the digital component is 10, then the additional selection requirement will be 1 and the combined selection requirement will be 11.
In some implementations, additional selection of the extension requires an increase in the user interaction rate of the digital component based on when the digital component is reformatted using the extension relative to when the extension is not used. For example, a given extension may result in a 10% increase in user interaction rate between all digital components that have used the extension. This increase is also referred to as an extended boost.
The percentage of the basic selection requirement specified by the expanded additional selection requirement may be equal to or proportional to the expanded boost. For example, the percentage may be half of the boost. In this example, if the extension provides a 10% boost, the additional selection requirement may be 5% of the basic selection requirement using the extended digital component.
In some implementations, the additional selection requirements for the extension may be different for different digital components. For example, the additional selection requirement for a given extension may be 10% of the basic selection requirement for the first digital component. For a second digital component different from the first digital component, the additional selection requirement for a given extension may be 20% of the basic selection requirement.
The probability determination server 264 can use the basic selection requirements and the extended additional selection requirements of the digital component to determine the selection probability of the digital component. The probability determination server 264 may determine the selection probabilities such that the combined selection requires that extensions that would exceed the distribution parameter limits be used to reformat the digital components, but not exceed the distribution limits of the digital components for a period of time. For example, if the distribution parameter of the digital components in a particular presentation context is limited to 10, the probability determination server 264 may determine the selection probability such that the average combined selection requirement of the digital components in the particular presentation context does not exceed 10, although some presentations of the digital components in the particular presentation context use an extension where the combined selection requirement exceeds 10.
Absent the probabilistic techniques described herein, the digital components would not be reformatted using extensions that the combinatorial selection requirements would exceed the distribution parameter limits of the digital components. For example, a first extension may provide a 10% boost to digital components, but with the additional option requirement of adding 5% to the basic option requirement. The second extension may provide a 20% boost, but with the additional option requirement of adding 15% to the basic option requirement. In this example, if the distribution parameter limit is such that only a 15% boost can be obtained without exceeding the distribution parameter limit, only a 10% boost is obtained using only the first extension and without using the probabilistic technique. Using probabilistic techniques, both extensions can be used at a specified probability, so that a 15% boost is achieved without exceeding the distribution parameter limit.
For each selection of a digital component for presentation, the probability determination server 264 can select one or more extensions and determine a selection probability for the one or more extensions such that the selection requirement using an average combination of the one or more extended digital components to account for the selection probability is equal to or within a threshold amount of the distribution parameter limit for the digital component. In a particular example, the probability determination server 264 identifies two formats of digital components. The two formats may include a format without an extension and a format with an extension, or two formats with an extension. The probability determination server 264 may select, as the two formats, the format having the highest combined selection requirement without exceeding the distribution parameter limit and the format having the lowest combined selection requirement without exceeding the distribution parameter limit.
In a particular example, consider that the distribution parameter limit is 2.3, the basic selection requirement is 2.0, the combined selection requirement of extension 1 is 2.1 (e.g., the additional selection requirement is 5% of the basic selection requirement), the combined selection requirement of extension 2 is 2.2 (e.g., the additional selection requirement is 10% of the basic selection requirement), the combined selection requirement of extension 3 is 2.4 (e.g., the additional selection requirement is 20% of the basic selection requirement), and the combined selection requirement of extension 4 is 2.6 (e.g., the additional selection requirement is 30% of the basic selection requirement). In this example, the probability distribution server 264 will select, as two formats: format with extension 2 because it is the format with the highest combined selection requirement (2.2) without exceeding the distribution parameter limit (2.3); and a format with extension 3, since it is the format with the lowest combination selection requirement (2.4) but does exceed the distribution parameter limit (2.3).
The probability determination server 264 may then determine the probabilities of the two formats such that the average selection requirement is equal to or within a threshold amount of distribution parameter limits (e.g., 1%, 5%, or another suitable amount). In this example, the probability determination server 264 may determine the selection probability using relationship 1 below. Relation 1 defines the relation between the basic selection requirements, the additional selection requirements, the selection probability and the distribution parameter limits of the two formats of the digital component.
Relation 1:
Base SR*((p1*(1+ASR1)+((1-p1)*(1+ASR2)))＝DPL
in relation 1, Base SR is the basic selection requirement for digital components, p1Is the selection probability of the first format (e.g., no expansion or expansion with the highest combined selection requirement not exceeding the distribution parameter limit), ASR1Is an additional selection requirement of the first format, ASR2Is an additional selection requirement of the second format (e.g. an extension with a lowest combined selection requirement that does exceed the distribution parameter limit) and DPL is the distribution parameter limit of the digital component. In relation 1, the additional selection requirement is expressed as a percentage of the basic selection requirement (e.g., 10% of the basic selection requirement). Probability determination server 264 may determine p1The relationship 1 is solved to obtain a selection probability of the first format. The probability determination server 264 may then use p1To determine the selection probability of the second format, i.e. 1-p1。
Continuing with the previous example, the selection probability of the first format and the selection format of the second format would both be 0.5 (i.e., 50%). That is, in this example, the relation 1 is 2.0 ((05 × 1.2) + (0.5 × 1.4)) -2.3. Thus, if extension 2 is provided 50% of the time for the digital component and extension 3 is provided 50% of the time for the digital component, then while the distribution parameter limit 2.3 would be exceeded each time extension 3 is provided to the digital component, the aggregate distribution parameter limit 2.3 would not be exceeded.
In some implementations, the probability determination server 264 selects more than two formats, e.g., more than two extensions, and determines the selection probability for each selected format such that the average combined selection requirement is equal to or within a threshold amount of distribution parameter limits. For example, the probability determination server 264 may determine the selection probability such that relationship 2 may be used to be satisfied.
Relation 2:
Base SR*((p1*(1+ASR1))+((p2)*(1+ASR2))+…+(pn*(1+ASRn))
＝DPL
in relation 2, the parameters matching relation 1 are the same. In addition, p2Is the selection probability of the second format, pnIs the selection probability of the nth format, and ASRnIs an additional selection requirement for the nth format.
In some implementations, instead of combining selection requirements, the probability determination server 264 uses another metric of the boosted or extended value of the extension to determine the selection probability. For example, the probability determination server 264 may determine the selection probability using the following relationship 3.
Relation 3: base SR ((p)1*(1+L1))+((1-p1)*(1+L2)))＝DPL
In relation 3, the parameters matching relation 1 are the same. In addition, L1Is a promotion of the first format, and L2Is a promotion of the second format. Relationship 2 may be modified in a similar manner, for example, when more than two formats are used, the selection probability is determined by replacing the combined selection requirements with boosting.
The extensions for which the probabilities are determined and considered for the digital components may vary between the various times that the digital components are selected for presentation. For example, if the basic selection requirement is very low, two more expensive extensions may be considered. If the basic choice is close to the distribution parameter limits of the digital components, two cheaper extensions can be considered.
Additional selection requirements for each extension, distribution criteria for each digital component, selection probabilities for the digital components, and/or other suitable data for selecting digital components or extensions for the digital components may be stored in selection data storage unit 270. Each server 260, 262, and 264 may access data and/or store selection data in a selection data storage unit 270.
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process 300 for generating and distributing reformatted versions of digital components. Process 300 may be implemented, for example, by digital component distribution system 120 or 220 of fig. 1 and 2. The operations of process 300 may also be implemented as instructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium, and execution of the instructions by one or more data processing apparatus may cause the one or more data processing apparatus to perform the operations of process 300.
Data specifying a distribution parameter limit for a given reformable digital component is obtained (302). The reformable digital component can be reformatted using an expanded set of digital components. As described above, the extensions may include different formats of content or functionality that may be added to the reformable digital component to generate the digital component. The dispensing parameter limit is an amount that does not exceed the selection requirements for providing the digital component, for example in currency. In some implementations, the distribution parameter limit can be the highest bid.
For each of the plurality of digital component requests for which a given reformable digital component is selected for distribution to the client device, determining that a given digital component extension of the set of digital component extensions has additional selection requirements that, when combined with the basic selection requirements of the given digital component, will exceed a distribution parameter limit for the given reformable digital component (304). As described above, during the selection process of selecting a digital component, the basic selection requirements of the digital component may be determined. In some implementations, the basic selection requirement can be an amount required for the digital component to be distributed (e.g., an amount of a next highest selection requirement (e.g., a second highest bid) for another available digital component). The basic selection requirement is a quantity submitted to the digital component distributor to provide a given digital component in a basic format without expansion. Each extension may have an associated additional selection requirement that may be added to the base selection requirement if the digital component is reformatted to include the extension.
Typically, if the combined selection requirements (e.g., basic selection requirements plus additional selection requirements) using the extensions would exceed the distribution parameter limits, the extensions would not be used to provide the reformable digital component. Using this process 300, if it is determined that the combined selection requirement for a given digital component extension will exceed the distribution parameter limit, the given digital component extension may be used to reformat the digital component with a specified probability even though the use of the given digital component extension with the specified probability for reformatting the digital component would result in the combined selection requirement exceeding the distribution parameter limit.
A selection probability that a given digital component extension will be selected for generating a reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component is determined (306). For example, a respective selection probability may be determined for a given digital component extension and one or more other digital component extensions. The selection probability of a reformable digital component version without an extension can also be determined.
The selection probabilities may be determined such that the aggregate selection requirements of the reformable digital components over a period of time do not exceed the aggregate distribution parameter limit for a given reformable digital component. The aggregate selection requirement may be an average selection requirement over a period of time and the aggregate distribution parameter may be equal to the distribution parameter limit. For example, the distribution parameter limit may be 10. The average selection requirement for the reformable digital component should be less than or equal to 10 over a period of time. The selection probability may be determined such that the average selection requirement is equal to 10 or within a threshold amount of 10. The expanded selection probability may be determined using the relationship 1, 2, or 3 above.
An extension (or no extension) is selected for a given reformable digital component (308). The extension may be selected using a selection probability. For example, if the selection probability of a given extension is 50%, then for each digital component request for which a given reformable digital component is selected, the given extension has a 50% chance of being selected.
A reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component is generated (310). The reformatted version may be generated by adding the selected extended content or functionality to the digital component. For example, if the selected extension is a rating extension, the rating of the entity associated with a given reformattable digital component may be added to the given reformattable digital component.
A reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component is sent to the client device that received the digital component request (312). For example, a reformatted version of a given reformattable digital component may be sent to a client device over a network. The reformatted version of the given reformattable digital component may then be presented by the client device.
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process 400 for determining a probability of generating a reformatted version of a digital component using the digital component. Process 400 may be implemented, for example, by digital component distribution system 120 or 220 of fig. 1 and 2. The operations of process 400 may also be implemented as instructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium, and execution of the instructions by one or more data processing apparatus may cause the one or more data processing apparatus to perform the operations of process 400.
Distribution parameter limits for reformable digital components are obtained (402). As described above, the distribution parameter limit is an amount that does not exceed the selection requirements for providing the reformattable digital component.
Basic selection requirements for the digital components are obtained (404). As described above, the basic selection requirement of a digital component is a basic amount that a publisher of the digital component needs to submit to the digital component distributor in the case that the distributor's digital component distribution system provides a basic version of the digital component to the user's client device.
Additional selection requirements are obtained for each digital component extension in the set of one or more digital component extensions (406). The additional selection requirements of the extension and digital components are quantities that are combined with the basic selection requirements, and the combined selection requirements of the digital components are determined when the extension is provided to the digital components. As described above, additional selection requirements may be based on the boost provided by the expansion.
A probability that the at least one extension will be used to generate a reformatted version of the digital component is determined (408). The selection probability may be determined for a number of extensions or for the extension and format of the digital component without extensions. The formats for which the selection probability is determined may include at least one format (e.g., with an extension) for which the combined selection requirement exceeds the distribution parameter limit and at least one format for which the combined selection requirement does not exceed the allocation parameter limit. In this way, the selection probability may be determined such that the average selection requirement using the two or more formats for which the selection requirement provides a digital component is equal to or within a threshold amount of distribution parameter limits.
The selection probability for each format can be determined using the relationships 1-3 above. For example, if two formats are selected, then either relationship 1 or relationship 3 may be used, depending on whether the boost provided by the combined selection requirement or the extension is used. If more than two formats are selected, then relationship 2 may be used to ensure that the selection probability results in the aggregate selection requirement being equal to or within a threshold amount of the aggregate distribution parameter.
