Description
This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/433,559, filed Dec. 19, 2022. U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/433,559 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
The present disclosure relates generally to machine-learned model output-leveraged search. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to obtaining user interface selections to generate a prompt input that can be processed by a machine-learned model to generate outputs that can be reviewed by a user and selected to be input into a search engine to receive search results associated with the selected output.
Searching for clothing, art, movies, and/or music can be difficult if a user does not have an example to provide to a search engine. Freeform text and/or Boolean strings provided as a text query to a search engine may provide mixed and/or unaligned search results that may be off topic and/or may include only parts of the search query. Refining those searches and/or reviewing those search results can be time intensive and may be non-intuitive. Image queries may provide more tailored results as images may include features that cannot be descriptively described via text in brevity. However, a user may not have access to an image of what they are looking for during the search, and/or the user may be basing their search on a real world example that they know of based on real world experience (e.g., a user may searching for a real world example of what they imagined).
Additionally, the utilization of artificial intelligence techniques to generate images and/or other datasets can be non-intuitive, may be open-ended, and may be time consuming. Current image generation systems utilize a prompt input box for receiving freeform text to be processed to generate one or more images. However, as a user utilizes the prompt input box, the user may struggle with which words to utilize and/or may be dissatisfied with the generated image as one or more of the input words may not be utilized in the direction the user desired (e.g., “houndstooth” may be entered by the user in association with the pattern; however, the model may generate an image with a dog's teeth).

Reference numerals that are repeated across plural figures are intended to identify the same features in various implementations.
Generally, the present disclosure is directed to generating content (e.g., images) based on a user request (e.g., a prompt input) to provide a visualization of a requested item that can then be searched to provide a visually informed and directed search. The systems and methods disclosed herein can leverage one or more dataset generation models to generate datasets that can then be utilized for querying a search engine to obtain search results. For example, a user may have an idea or concept that the user desires to find one or more real world examples of the idea or concept. Therefore, a user may generate a prompt input that can be provided to a dataset generation model to generate one or more datasets. A user may then select a particular dataset that can then be utilized to search one or more databases to obtain search results. For example, the dataset generation model (e.g., an image generation model) may generate a plurality of datasets in response to the prompt input. The plurality of model-generated datasets can be provided to a user interface, which can include a displayed list, a carousel, and/or one or more other presentation methods. A user can then review the plurality of model-generated datasets (e.g., a plurality of model-generated images) to determine one or more particular model-generated datasets that may be utilized for searching one or more databases. The one or more particular model-generated datasets can be utilized for querying one or more databases to obtain one or more search results.
Querying the one or more databases with the one or more particular model-generated datasets can include processing the one or more particular model-generated datasets with one or more machine-learned models (e.g., one or more classification models and/or one or more embedding models). For example, the one or more particular model-generated datasets can be processed by one or more embedding models to generate one or more features, which can then be utilized to query for a database for associated embeddings (e.g., one or more embedding neighbors) which may be associated with one or more candidate search results. Alternatively and/or additionally, the one or more particular model-generated datasets can be processed by one or more classification models to determine one or more classification tags that can be utilized to generate a query to query one or more databases.
In particular, articulating concepts and ideas for search can be difficult and some concepts cannot be specifically articulated, which can lead to issues in search result scope. Additional problems can include not knowing what terms to use, wanting unique content, vocabulary boundaries between user and an industry, only partial results, and/or off-topic search results.
The systems and methods disclosed herein can leverage one or more machine-learned diffusion models to generate images that can encapsulate a user request and can then be utilized as an image query to determine real world objects that are similar to the “imagined” objects of the model-generated image. Artificial intelligence (AI) generation models can be utilized to generate images that can be reviewed and selected to be utilized as a search query. In particular, images can provide a more detailed context of what a user is requesting during the search, which can allow for a more tailored search than text alone.
The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for searching with a machine-learned model-generated data query. In particular, the systems and methods disclosed herein can leverage one or more machine-learned models and one or more user-interface elements to provide an interactive graphical user interface for suggesting, generating, and/or refining search queries based on model-generated datasets. Generated images can therefore be utilized to provide accurate search results as the generated dataset can provide a more detailed jumping off point for search. For example, the systems and methods can include obtaining a prompt input. The prompt input can include one or more terms.

The systems and methods disclosed herein can be utilized to provide an interface for generating suggested datasets, that can then be utilized to query the web for pre-existing datasets that may be similar to and/or are associated with the model-generated dataset. For example, the model-generated dataset can include a model-generated image that is descriptive of instance interpolation of an object. The model-generated object can then be utilized to query one or more databases to identify a resource associated with an object that is similar to the object depicted in the model-generated image.
The systems and methods can obtain a prompt input (e.g., selection data descriptive of one or more selections received from a user computing device). The prompt input can include one or more terms (e.g., one or more words that can be descriptive of a requested instance interpolation (e.g., “jacket, feathered, brown, regal” to request a view rendering of a brown feathered jacket with a regal aesthetic).

In some implementations, obtaining the prompt input can include providing a plurality of selectable user-interface elements for display in graphical user interface. The plurality of selectable user-interface elements can be associated with a plurality of candidate prompt terms (e.g., object types, categories, descriptors for a scene or object, and/or an aesthetic). Selection data can then be obtained. The selection data can be descriptive of a first selectable user-interface element (e.g., a first interactive chip) and a second selectable user-interface element (e.g., a second interactive chip). The first selectable user-interface element can be associated with a first prompt term (e.g., a noun, a verb, an adjective, and/or an adverb associated with a requested concept), and wherein the second selectable user-interface element is associated with a second prompt term (e.g., a noun, a verb, an adjective, and/or an adverb associated with a requested concept). For example, the prompt input can include the first prompt term and the second prompt term associated with the selected first user-interface element and the selected second user-interface element. The prompt terms can be descriptive of a topic (e.g., landscape, amusement park, dress, and/or purse), a quality (e.g., Tron-like, sci-fi, made of plants, a specific video game aesthetic, baroque, cyborg, and/or covered in sequins), and/or an action (e.g., dancing, running, playing football, and/or cheering).
In some implementations, the plurality of selectable user-interface elements can be provided for display in response to obtaining a prompt selection request.

Alternatively and/or additionally, the image generation model can be trained generally. The training may include label training, and the labels can be utilized to determine and/or to generate the selectable user interface elements. For example, a particular label can be associated with a plurality of images (e.g., a “shirt” label can be associated with images for a plurality of different shirts and/or a “furry” label can be associated with a plurality of images associated with a plurality of fur for articles of clothing and/or interiors). The descriptor of the label can then be utilized to generate a selectable user interface element for the descriptor to be utilized as a prompt term.

Additionally and/or alternatively, the systems and methods disclosed herein can be utilized to find other data types (e.g., a song that fits an aesthetic and/or theme). For example, a machine-learned model can be trained to generate audio data based on one or more prompt inputs (e.g., “jazz, upbeat, saxophone solo” can be input to the machine-learned model to generate synthetic song, which can be presented to a user for selection then search.). For example, the systems and methods can include obtaining a prompt input. The prompt input can include one or more terms.

The prompts may include a vibe and/or an aesthetic associated with a content item, a time period, a genre, and/or a location. The image generation model may include a text-to-image diffusion model (e.g., the text-to-image diffusion model of Imagen, GOOGLE RESEARCH (Nov. 25, 2022, 3:40 PM), https://imagen.research.google/.). The image generation model can include a transformer model (e.g., a T5-XXL encoder).
The systems and methods can utilize the model-generated image as a query, the prompt input as a query, and/or metadata associated with the user and/or the inputs as a query. For example, the selected model-generated image and the prompt input may be processed by a search engine to determine the one or more search results. The multi-modal search query can include multi-modal embedding, feature recognition and text query generation, image based searching with text based ranking, text based searching and image based ranking, and/or conditioned processing.
Articulating concepts and ideas for search can be difficult and some concepts cannot be specifically articulated, which can lead to issues in search result scope. Additional problems can include not knowing what terms to use, wanting unique content, vocabulary boundaries between user and an industry, only partial results, and/or off-topic search results.
The systems and methods disclosed herein can leverage AI generation models to generate images that can be reviewed and selected to be utilized as a search query. In particular, the images can provide a more detailed context of what a user is requesting during the search, which can allow for a more tailored search than text alone.
Traditional searching for clothing, art, movies, and/or music can be difficult if a user does not have an example to provide to a search engine. Freeform text and/or Boolean strings provided as a text query to a search engine may provide mixed and/or unaligned search results that may be off topic and/or may include only parts of the search query. Refining those searches and/or reviewing those search results can be time intensive and may be non-intuitive. Image queries may provide more tailored results as images may include features that cannot be descriptively described via text in brevity. However, a user may not have access to an image of what they are looking for during the search, and/or the user may be basing their search on a real world example that they know of based on real world experience (e.g., a user may searching for a real world example of what they imagined).
In addition, the utilization of artificial intelligence techniques to generate images and/or other datasets can be non-intuitive, may be open-ended, and may be time consuming. Image generation systems such as DALLE (“DALL-E 2,” OPEN AI (Apr. 6, 2022), https://openai.com/dall-e-2/.) utilize a prompt input box for receiving freeform text to be processed to generate one or more images. However, as a user utilizes the prompt input box, the user may struggle with which words to utilize and/or may be dissatisfied with the generated image as one or more of the input words may not be utilized in the direction the user desired (e.g., “fisheye” may be entered by the user in association with the image capture lens to be descriptive of a desired distortion; however, the model may generate an image with a fish).
The systems and methods of the present disclosure provide a number of technical effects and benefits. As one example, the system and methods can provide an interactive user interface that can be utilized machine-learned model output leveraged search. In particular, the systems and methods disclosed herein can leverage a machine-learned model to generate an output that can then be utilized as a query to query a search engine. For example, the systems and methods can provide a prompt input to an image generation model, which can generate a plurality of model-generated images. A user can then select one or more model-generated images that are in line with a desired product or object. The selected model generated image(s) can then be input into a search engine, which can output one or more search results associated with products and/or objects that are determined to be similar to the provided image. The present disclosure can enable search and retrieval of search results in a more efficient and/or faster manner. In particular, the present disclosure can enable more versatile search and retrieval of search results based on different kinds of input. In the present disclosure, a selection of one or more images may be used to determine search results. Moreover, in the present disclosure, the one or more images may be model-generated by an image generation model. This can inherently expand the versatility of search and retrieval through expanding the range of inputs that can be provided as part of a search and retrieval process. The systems and methods can enable search and retrieval of search results based on images that may not previously have been in existence, but which may have been newly generated for this purpose. This can provide a mechanism for inputting a search query which would not be possible without the implementation of the image generation model to the overall process as described herein. The present disclosure thereby can leverage an image generation model in combination with determination of search results to provide improved search and retrieval operations.
Another technical benefit of the systems and methods of the present disclosure is the ability to leverage one or more user interface elements to provide suggested inputs for the machine-learned model. For example, a plurality of category user interface elements can be provided with each user interface element being associated with a different category for dataset generation. A plurality of descriptor user interface elements can be provided to allow for more detailed prompt generation. The plurality of descriptor user interface elements may be provided for display and/or refined based on the selection of a particular category. The different user interface elements may lead to more directed prompt generation based on terms the model may be trained on specifically. Moreover, the increased versatility of the search and retrieval process according to the present disclosure can enable faster and/or more accurate determination of requested search results. Text queries to a search engine may provide mixed and/or unaligned search results that may be off topic and/or may include only parts of the search query. Repeated iterations of updating text queries and searching may lead to high use of processor power, high use of available bandwidth, and high consumption of battery of a user device. The present disclosure can enable more versatile input to a search engine based on model-generated images. This can provide improved accuracy, tailoring or targeting of the input search query, which further enables more efficient use of processor power, available bandwidth and battery in a search and retrieval operation.
Another example of technical effect and benefit relates to improved computational efficiency and improvements in the functioning of a computing system. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein can leverage cloud computing to provide an immersive artificial intelligence leveraged capability to user devices with limited computational capabilities.
