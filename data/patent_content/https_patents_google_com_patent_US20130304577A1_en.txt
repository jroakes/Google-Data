- the disclosure relates generally to the field of online advertising systems and methods, and, in particular, relate to systems and methods for matching advertisements to user interests.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of content.
- the ability to search that content and provide intelligent search results to a user continues to be a challenge.
- providing advertisements for services or items that the user would like to purchase can be beneficial to both the users and the advertisers.
- the accessible content provides an opportunity to place advertisements. Advertisements can be placed within content, such as a web page, image, or video, or the content can trigger the display of one or more advertisements, such as presenting an advertisement in an advertisement slot and/or in a pop-up window.
- Advertisers can decide which ads are displayed within particular content using various advertising management tools. These tools may also allow an advertiser to follow the performance of various ads or ad campaigns. The parameters used to determine when to display a particular ad can also be changed using advertising management tools.
- advertisement networks provide ad inventory across web pages and provide methods to show ads that are relevant to end users (e.g., select ads based on context or placement).
- these networks contain highly heterogeneous sets of websites and, as a whole, these networks do may not perform as well for transaction-oriented advertisers (e.g., advertisers who want to sell their products online). For example, if an advertiser has a campaign directed to the keyword “SLR camera,” the advertiser's advertisement might be shown on a page reviewing SLR cameras, a page providing a guide for cleaning an SLR camera, or a forum of customer complaints about SLR cameras. Displaying advertisements on all these types of pages may not provide as good a return on investment (ROI) for the advertiser as can be obtained.

- the website 104 may be one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- a website may be a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- the resource 105 may be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- the resource 105 may be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 , such as a uniform resource locator (URL).
- the resource 105 may include web pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, programming elements, interactive content, feed sources, and/or any other type of content.

- User devices 106 may include, but are not limited to, personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- the user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the user device 106 can request the resources 105 from the website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can include data specifying a portion of the resource 105 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which advertisements or other sponsored content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource 105 or user display are referred to as advertisement slots.
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources provided on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource with which the data is associated.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in a search index (not shown).
- the user device 106 can submit search queries to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the search index to identify resources that are relevant to the search query.
- a search query includes one or more keywords.
- the search system 112 identifies the relevant resources 105 in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user device 106 in search results pages.
- a search result may be data generated by the search system 112 that identifies the resources 105 that are responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource 105 .
- a search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, a rendering of the resource, and the URL of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented.
- a search result page can be sent with a request from the search system 112 for the web browser of the user device 106 to set an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) cookie.
- a cookie can represent, for example, a particular user device 106 and a particular web browser.
- the search system 112 includes a server that replies to the query by sending the search results page in an HTTP response.
- This HTTP response includes instructions (e.g., a set cookie instruction) that cause the browser to store a cookie for the site hosted by the server or for the domain of the server. If the browser supports cookies and cookies are enabled, every subsequent page request to the same server or a server within the domain of the server will include the cookie.
- the cookie can store a variety of data, including a unique or semi-unique identifier.
- the unique or semi-unique identifiers are anonymized and are not connected with user names. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, the use of cookies allows an external service, such as the search system 112 or other system, to follow particular actions and status of a user over multiple sessions. A user may, at any time, opt out of allowing user actions to be followed, for example, by disabling cookies in the browser's settings. According to various implementations, the search system 112 does not follow user identifying information. In some implementations, a user may be required to opt in to enable user actions to be followed.

- the advertisers 108 can access the advertisement management system 110 to monitor performance of the advertisements that are distributed using the campaign parameters. For example, an advertiser can access a campaign performance report that provides a number of impressions (i.e., presentations), selections (i.e., clicks), and conversions that have been identified for the advertisements.
- the campaign performance report can also provide a total cost, a cost-per-click, and other cost measures for the advertisement over a specified period.

An advertiser may try to expand its keyword selection by selecting all synonyms, or by selecting keywords that are related, in some manner, to the products, services or content it offers on its web page. An advertiser may try to optimize its selection of keywords by monitoring how effective each keyword is. For example, the advertiser may use a tool that records the number of times a purchased keyword is entered into a search engine and the number of times that results in their web page being viewed.

Abstract
A method of managing advertisements includes obtaining, by a server, a set of keywords for an advertisement campaign of an advertisement network; performing a search using at least one of the set of keywords as a search query on one or more search engines; receiving search results based on the search query from the one or more search engines, the search results comprising a plurality of pages; identifying a set of pages that participate in the advertisement network from the plurality of pages; and associating the advertisement campaign with each page of the identified set of pages.
Description
- The disclosure relates generally to the field of online advertising systems and methods, and, in particular, relate to systems and methods for matching advertisements to user interests.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of content. The ability to search that content and provide intelligent search results to a user continues to be a challenge. Moreover, providing advertisements for services or items that the user would like to purchase can be beneficial to both the users and the advertisers.
- The accessible content provides an opportunity to place advertisements. Advertisements can be placed within content, such as a web page, image, or video, or the content can trigger the display of one or more advertisements, such as presenting an advertisement in an advertisement slot and/or in a pop-up window.
- Advertisers can decide which ads are displayed within particular content using various advertising management tools. These tools may also allow an advertiser to follow the performance of various ads or ad campaigns. The parameters used to determine when to display a particular ad can also be changed using advertising management tools.
- Generally, advertisement networks provide ad inventory across web pages and provide methods to show ads that are relevant to end users (e.g., select ads based on context or placement). However, these networks contain highly heterogeneous sets of websites and, as a whole, these networks do may not perform as well for transaction-oriented advertisers (e.g., advertisers who want to sell their products online). For example, if an advertiser has a campaign directed to the keyword “SLR camera,” the advertiser's advertisement might be shown on a page reviewing SLR cameras, a page providing a guide for cleaning an SLR camera, or a forum of customer complaints about SLR cameras. Displaying advertisements on all these types of pages may not provide as good a return on investment (ROI) for the advertiser as can be obtained.

FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate advertisement layouts according to various implementations of the disclosure. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an advertisement management process according to various implementations of the disclosure. - Many users of the Internet employ search engines to search for particular information. When a user is provided with the search results, relevant advertisements can be provided together with the search results in a convenient manner, to maximize results for the advertisers and enhance the user experience.
- Various implementations relate to an Internet advertisement providing system, method, and computer program product, which enables advertisements to be included with online search engine results. This may be performed to increase advertisement click revenue for the advertiser and to provide revenue for the provider of the online search engine. In addition, this may be performed to improve an end user's experience by providing additional relevant content to the user.
- According to various implementations, if a search engine user does not select an advertisement when displayed with search results, the advertiser may receive a second opportunity for the search engine user to select the advertisement when the search engine user visits one of the identified websites provided in the search results. As such, various implementations can identify high-performing segments of advertisement networks so advertisers can obtain a higher return on investment and so end users can be provided with the most relevant content.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an environment in which an advertisement management system manages advertising services. Theenvironment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106,advertisers 108, and anadvertisement management system 110. Theenvironment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, andadvertisers 108. - The
website 104 may be one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. For instance, a website may be a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. - The
resource 105 may be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Theresource 105 may be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105, such as a uniform resource locator (URL). Theresource 105 may include web pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, programming elements, interactive content, feed sources, and/or any other type of content. Theresource 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, images, and sounds, which may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript™ scripts). - The
user device 106 may be an electronic device that is controllable by a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources (e.g., 105) over thenetwork 102.User devices 106 may include, but are not limited to, personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Theuser device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - The
user device 106 can request theresources 105 from thewebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which advertisements or other sponsored content can be presented. These specified portions of theresource 105 or user display are referred to as advertisement slots. - To facilitate searching of the vast number of
resources 105 accessible over thenetwork 102, theenvironment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies theresources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources provided on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource with which the data is associated. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in a search index (not shown). - The
user device 106 can submit search queries to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 accesses the search index to identify resources that are relevant to the search query. In some implementations, a search query includes one or more keywords. Thesearch system 112 identifies therelevant resources 105 in the form of search results and returns the search results to theuser device 106 in search results pages. A search result may be data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies theresources 105 that are responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to theresource 105. For instance, a search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, a rendering of the resource, and the URL of the web page. Search results pages can also include one or more advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented. - A search result page can be sent with a request from the
search system 112 for the web browser of theuser device 106 to set an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) cookie. A cookie can represent, for example, aparticular user device 106 and a particular web browser. For example, thesearch system 112 includes a server that replies to the query by sending the search results page in an HTTP response. This HTTP response includes instructions (e.g., a set cookie instruction) that cause the browser to store a cookie for the site hosted by the server or for the domain of the server. If the browser supports cookies and cookies are enabled, every subsequent page request to the same server or a server within the domain of the server will include the cookie. The cookie can store a variety of data, including a unique or semi-unique identifier. The unique or semi-unique identifiers are anonymized and are not connected with user names. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, the use of cookies allows an external service, such as thesearch system 112 or other system, to follow particular actions and status of a user over multiple sessions. A user may, at any time, opt out of allowing user actions to be followed, for example, by disabling cookies in the browser's settings. According to various implementations, thesearch system 112 does not follow user identifying information. In some implementations, a user may be required to opt in to enable user actions to be followed. - When a
resource 105 or search results are requested by theuser device 106, theadvertisement management system 110 receives a request for advertisements to be provided with theresource 105 or search results. The request for advertisements can include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page and can be provided to theadvertisement management system 110. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to theresource 105 for which the advertisement slot is defined, a size of the advertisement slot, a position of the advertisement slot within the resources, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the advertisement slot can be provided to theadvertisement management system 110. Similarly, keywords (i.e., one or more words that are associated with content) associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or a search query for which search results are requested can also be provided to theadvertisement management system 110 to facilitate identification of advertisements that are relevant to theresource 105 or search query. - Using data included in the request for advertisements, the
advertisement management system 110 can select advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible advertisements” or “candidate advertisements”). For example, eligible advertisements can include advertisements having characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries. In some implementations, advertisements having keywords that match the resource keywords or the search query are selected as eligible advertisements by theadvertisement management system 110. - The
advertisement management system 110 selects an eligible advertisement for each advertisement slot of aresource 105 or of a search results page. Theresource 105 or search results page may be received by theuser device 106 for presentation to the user. In some implementations, the selected advertisement may be delivered to the user device via one or more advertisement servers 114. - The
advertisers 108 can submit, to theadvertisement management system 110, campaign parameters (e.g., matching keywords and corresponding bids) that are used to control distribution of advertisements. Theadvertisers 108 can access theadvertisement management system 110 to monitor performance of the advertisements that are distributed using the campaign parameters. For example, an advertiser can access a campaign performance report that provides a number of impressions (i.e., presentations), selections (i.e., clicks), and conversions that have been identified for the advertisements. - The campaign performance report can also provide a total cost, a cost-per-click, and other cost measures for the advertisement over a specified period. For example, an advertiser may access a performance report that specifies that advertisements distributed using the phrase match keyword “hockey” have received 1,000 impressions (i.e., have been presented 1,000 times), have been selected (e.g., clicked) 20 times, and have been credited with 5 conversions. Thus, the phrase match keyword “hockey” can be attributed with 1,000 impressions, 20 clicks, and 5 conversions.
- One example of online advertisement offers pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, cost-per-thousand (CPM) advertising, and site-specific advertising for text, banner, and rich-media advertisements. The program includes local, national, and international distribution. The text advertisements can be short, generally comprising one headline of 25 characters and two additional text lines of 35 characters each. Image advertisements can be one of several different Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) standard sizes.
- In some implementations in which the advertisement campaign comprises a PPC advertisement, advertisers select the words that should trigger their advertisements and the maximum amount they will pay per click. When a user searches on a search engine, advertisements for relevant words appear as “sponsored links” on the (right or left) side of the page, and sometimes above or below the main search results. In some implementations, advertisements can appear on any portion of a page. The ordering of the paid-for listings can depend on other advertisers' bids (PPC) and factors such as the “quality score” of all advertisements shown for a given search. In some implementations, the
advertisement management system 110 determines the factors based on historical click-through rates, predicted click-through rates, relevance of an advertiser's advertisement text and keywords, an advertiser's account history, and other relevance factors. The quality score can be also used to set the minimum bids for an advertiser's keywords. The minimum bid takes into consideration the quality of the landing page as well, which includes the relevancy and originality of content, navigability, and transparency into the nature of the business. - In some implementations, a “user” may refer to any company, organization, partnership, individual, agent, or entity that is involved in online advertising. Thus, in some implementations “user” and “advertiser” can be used interchangeable. Keyword coverage refers to the number of searches done by “search engine users” that result in a paid result—an advertisement—being displayed. For example, 50% of searches conducted on a search engine may result in a paid advertisement being displayed. Out of that, 1% of the searches may result in a specific advertiser's URL being advertised. In general, the online advertiser's goal may be to have its advertisement appear on a display page after as many relevant searches as possible. One way an advertiser can extend their keyword coverage may be by purchasing additional keywords, thus increasing the likelihood that their advertisement will appear on displays of search results. The number of paid results per keyword can vary, and where a URL ranks among the paid results can depend on several factors, including relevancy and the keyword purchase price.
- There are several ways an advertiser selects keywords to purchase. For example, an advertiser can select a group of keywords that define the products, services, or content it offers on its web page. An advertiser may try to expand its keyword selection by selecting all synonyms, or by selecting keywords that are related, in some manner, to the products, services or content it offers on its web page. An advertiser may try to optimize its selection of keywords by monitoring how effective each keyword is. For example, the advertiser may use a tool that records the number of times a purchased keyword is entered into a search engine and the number of times that results in their web page being viewed.
- Various methods may be implemented using the system from
FIG. 1 . For example,FIG. 2 is a method S200 that may be used to manage advertisements in an advertisement network. According to various implementations, an advertisement network refers to a collection of advertisements generally to be provided on the Internet or the like. - With reference to
FIGS. 1 and 2 , at block S210, a set of keywords for an advertisement campaign of the advertisement network may be obtained. An advertiser may already have an advertisement program account or may create a new account at this point. The advertiser may already have some keywords in its advertisement campaign, or the advertiser may not even have an advertisement campaign at this block. At this block, the advertiser may choose to provide its own keywords, or the advertiser may choose to have its keywords automatically generated for the advertiser or suggested to the advertiser, for instance, by theadvertisement management system 110. For instance, theadvertisement management system 110 may provide the advertiser with a list of keywords associated with the advertisement campaign of the advertiser. - In various implementations, the keywords may be used to determine which pages will be displayed when search queries corresponding to the keywords are input in a search engine. For instance, at block S220 a search query (or additional search queries) may be selected for inputting to a search engine. The search query may correspond to a keyword selected from the set of keywords for the advertisement campaign. For example, the selected keyword may be the keyword in the advertisement campaign with the highest ROI conversion, click-through rate (CTR), or otherwise meets some specified criteria or threshold. In some implementations, the search query may be selected by the advertiser. For instance, in some implementations, the advertiser may select one (or more) of the keywords from the set of keywords for use as the search query. In other implementations, the search query may be selected by the
advertisement management system 110. For instance, theadvertisement management system 110 may select one (or more) of the keywords (e.g., keyword with highest conversion or click-through rate) from the set of keywords for use as the search query. - At block S230, search results based on the search query are determined for one or more search engines (e.g., Google). For instance, the search results may be determined by inputting the search query into the one or more search engines to perform a search. Accordingly, search results may be received based on the search query. The search results can include, for example, one or more pages (websites) or links thereto or other metadata about pages. One or more servers corresponding to the search engine can identify, from a search index, content that corresponds to the received search terms.
- At block S240, relevance of each of the pages may be determined with respect to the search query. For instance, in some implementations, the top N (e.g., 100) pages may be identified. Accordingly, these N pages may be deemed relevant, whereas other pages may be deemed not relevant (or not as relevant). In particular implementations, the value of N may be based on some specified criteria, such as Google Page Rank, Google +1, and/or the like.
- In some cases, one or more of the search result pages may be associated with the advertisement network, and to which the
advertisement management system 110 can provide content for presentation. At block S250, theadvertisement management system 110 determines which pages of the relevant pages participate in the advertisement network. For instance, theadvertisement management system 110 may compare the relevant pages to a catalog of pages participating in the advertisement network. At block S260, theadvertisement management system 110 associates the advertisement campaign with each identified page such that advertisements from the advertisement campaign may be provided (e.g., displayed) on one or more of these pages. - As a result, an advertisement associated with the advertisement campaign can be provided to the user device. In particular, the advertisement can be provided both with search results that include links to one or more of the identified pages, as well as with one or more of the identified pages when the pages are accessed by the user device (e.g., in response to receiving a selection of a search results link). As such, various implementations identify high-performing segments of advertisement networks so advertisers can obtain a higher return on investment so end users can be provided with the most relevant content.
- As described in
FIG. 2 , theadvertisement management system 110 may match (associate) advertisement campaigns with relevant pages in advance of requesting an advertisement from the advertisement campaign. The requesting may occur, for instance, when an end user performs a search using a search query that provides results along with the advertisement. In addition (or in the alternative), the requesting may occur, for instance, when the end user accesses one or more of the relevant pages, for example as selected from the search results, on which the advertisement is to be provided. Furthermore, by associating the advertisement campaigns to the relevant pages, advertisements from the advertisement campaigns may be provided on one of the relevant pages if accessed inorganically (i.e., not accessed from a link in search results) or if accessed from a link in search results obtained on a search engine (e.g., the second search engine) that was different from the search engine used above. - The
advertisement management system 110 may serve content from advertisement campaigns with relevant pages based on previously defined associations of advertisement campaigns and pages. Accordingly, advertisements from the advertisement campaign may be provided along with the search results for the search and with certain pages selected from the search results. - For instance, with reference to
FIGS. 1-4 , at block S410, a search query on a search engine may be received as input. For example, an end user (e.g., via an end user device, such as a mobile device, computer, or the like) may input the search query into the search engine to perform a search. Accordingly, at block S420, search results, which contain several pages (websites) or links thereto or other metadata about the pages, may be identified to be provided to the end user based on the search query. - In some cases, one or more of the search result pages may be associated with the advertisement network. At block S430, the
advertisement management system 110 may identify advertisement campaigns associated with the search results. For example, thesystem 110 may identify advertisement campaigns previously associated with web pages based on search engine results for queries corresponding to keywords of the advertisement campaigns. - At block S440, a first advertisement associated with the identified advertisement campaign (e.g., identified at block S430) may be provided to the end user (end user device) along with the search results that include links to one or more of the identified pages (e.g., as shown in
FIG. 3A ). At block S450, a selection of a page that is a search result may be received. Accordingly at block S460, an advertisement, which may be same or different as the previously served advertisement, associated with the advertisement campaign may be served on the selected page (e.g., as shown inFIG. 3B ). - Different interfaces can be used to provide content to a user device across a search results page and a page accessed from the search results page.
FIG. 3A illustrates ascreen 300 that may be presented to an end user (e.g., user of a search engine), which for instance may occur at block S420 ofFIG. 4 . With reference toFIGS. 3A and 4 , as shown, a search query entered into asearch field 310 by the end user may cause search results 330 (e.g., “Page 1,” “Page 2,” and “Page 3”) to be displayed along with paid search advertisements 320 (e.g., “Ad 1,” “Ad 2,” and “Ad 3”). IfPage 1 participates in the advertisement network, when the end user selects (e.g., clicking on, tapping, etc.) a link toPage 1,Page 1 may be displayed along withAd 1, as shown inillustrative screen 350 ofFIG. 3B . Thus, if the end user does not selectAd 1 when displayed with the search results 330 and the other paidsearch advertisements 320, the advertiser may receive a second opportunity for the end user to selectAd 1 when the end user visits one of the identified websites provided in the search results. - With reference to
FIGS. 2-4 , in some implementations,Ad 1 may be displayed onPage 1 if an enduser visits Page 1 directly without selecting the page from search results (organically). This is because the page is already associated with the advertisement campaign (e.g., block S260 inFIG. 2 ). In some implementations,Ad 1 may be displayed onPage 1 if an end user selects the page from search results on a first search engine (e.g., a first search engine) that corresponds to one of the one or more search engines for which search results were determined (e.g., block S230). Likewise,Ad 1 may be displayed onPage 1 if the end user (or different end user) selects the page from search results on a second search engine (which may be different from the first search engine) of the one or more search engines. - Those of skill in the art would understand that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques.
