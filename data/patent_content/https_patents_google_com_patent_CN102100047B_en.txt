Description
Technical field
Present invention relates in general to mobile communication system, and relate in particular to the method and system for detecting the adjacent-channel interference (ACI) in the BWA based on OFDM (OFDM)/OFDMA.
Background technology
For two communication systems operated in nearby frequency bands, the unwanted transmitting that the adjacent-channel interference (ACI) in nearby frequency bands is caused by the imperfection because of emission filter usually causes.Fig. 1 is the figure of the frequency spectrum 100 representing two conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems using nearby frequency bands.The up link (UL) of " FDDA " system is adjacent to the UL of " FDDB " system.Equally, the down link (DL) of FDDA system is adjacent to the DL of " FDDB " system.The starting position that duplex separation gap is shown as the frequency of the UL from FDDA system extends to the starting position of the DL of FDDA system.If only have little frequency gap between the DL of UL and the FDDA system of FDDB system, then there will be ACI between the travelling carriage (MS) near identical base station (BS), two positions and two.
Fig. 2 represents the block diagram using the FDD system of nearby frequency bands and the frequency spectrum 200 of time division duplex (TDD) system.The UL of FDDA system has the frequency adjacent to " TDDB " frequency band.The DL of FDDA system is adjacent to the 2nd TDDB frequency band.When involved two systems are two nonsynchronous TDD or TDD and FDD, between the MS near identical BS and two in two positions, ACI can be there is.Due to the mobility that is associated with MS with to the size of mobile phone and the restriction of cost, MS and MS interference is the most problematic ACI type.Specifically, when the size of MS reduces to obtain maximum portability, the size of the RF filter used in MS is very limited.Under current wave filter technology, challenging, set up the RF filter of the decay required for can realizing with very little frequency shift (FS), alleviate MS and MS interference to use such finite size.On the other hand, the RF filtering performance improving MS also requires additional manufacturing cost.In the high user density region in such as railway station and cafe, two MS can (several meters) closer to each other, and short distance therebetween may cause serious degradation or ensure that large frequency guard band is to alleviate ACI.BS and BS interference also may require to install additional channel filter (one or more) in BS.
As much as possiblely being wasted as the frequency spectrum of boundary belt to save, having carried out several trial to alleviate ACI.The example that ACI alleviates method uses system coordination, and system coordination needs the information whether existed about ACI.In system coordination example, system uses the channel skirt band pass filter being used for code division multiple access (CDMA) system to detect ACI existence.Substantially, method and ACI testing process are alleviated for cdma system design ACI, and need to be designed specifically to matching chip waveform and receiver filtering for the filter of cdma system.
If use the ACI removing method based on signal transacting, then need the existence determining ACI, because such method causes unnecessary computation burden usually when ACI does not exist.
In another example, if two systems are all TDD, then when a system works in uplink periods and another is operated in downlink period time, synchronously can reduce timing service time overlapping.But such method is not suitable for a system and is FDD and another is the situation of TDD and has as shown in Figure 1 the situation of two FDD system of little frequency gap between the DL block and the UL block of system B of system A.And in order to intactly eliminate MS and MS interference, two TDD system need to have identical downlink/uplink and divide and frame duration.
In another example, a kind of technology for carrying out MS and the MS interference between minimization system via the coordination between system by tracking at the signal disturbing of MS and noise ratio (SINR) changes and signal energy detects the existence of ACI.But this technology does not adopt the spectrum signature of ACI, the spectrum signature of ACI has higher energy usually at channel skirt place.Therefore, detection method does not provide reliable result.

Fig. 3 is for standard World Interoperability for Microwave Access, WiMax (WiMax) OFDM (OFDMA) sub-carrier structure 300 in an embodiment described herein.For OFDM/OFDMA system, be the subcarrier of given number by channel distribution.Usually, subcarrier can be divided into data subcarrier, pilot sub-carrier, DC subcarrier and null subcarrier (protection subcarrier).Wherein, the modulation symbol by loading null creates null subcarrier.Therefore, null subcarrier do not have signal energy.Null subcarrier is also referred to as protection and substitutes virtual subnet carrier wave or untapped subcarrier.
OFDM/OFDMA system can distribute the null subcarrier of given number at channel skirt, decline to allow signal spectrum and meet bandwidth requirement.Such as, for 10MHzWiMAX system, inverse fast fourier transform (IFFT)/fast fourier transform (FFT) size is 1024 subcarriers, and wherein, 184 are used as null subcarrier.At receiver side, the FFT of those null subcarrier exports and is dropped, and does not further process, because null subcarrier does not comprise information.But, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, FFT can be used to export and to derive ACI.
Fig. 4 is the curve chart 400 of the frequency response of wideband OFDM/OFDMA signal.Owing to launching the imperfection of filtering, signal energy leaks into outside its channel span be assigned usually.The frequency spectrum of OFDM/OFDMA modulation signal declines with the order of magnitude of 1/f usually, and wherein, f is the frequency at channel skirt.Therefore, as shown in the figure, the ACI signal experienced by the equipment operated in adjacent channel has high-energy at channel skirt usually, and the energy that existence is relatively low for the frequency away from channel skirt.
Fig. 5 illustrates the drawing 500 of the sub-carrier positions of two 10MHzWiMAX systems of launching in adjacent channel.Arrange according to the WiMAX system based on OFDMA, the frequency of the subcarrier used takies the channel width being less than restriction, and the frequency of all subcarriers takies and is greater than channel width.Such as, the WiMAX system with 10MHz channel size has 840 subcarriers and 184 null subcarrier used, and sub-carrier frequencies interval is 10.94KHz.The frequency span that this means whole 1024 subcarriers is 10.94x1024=11.2MHz, and the subcarrier used takies the frequency of 9.189MHz.Therefore, can find out, as can in Figure 5 shown in, during when the WiMAX system of two 10MHz being placed in adjacent channel without any additional external boundary belt, in fact a part for the null subcarrier of a system is positioned at the channel of another system.
As the result of the combination of the frequency span of the expansion outside 10MHz and the frequency response (see Fig. 4) of ACI, when system experiences strong ACI source on high frequency side or lower frequency side, the power of system experience on outermost null subcarrier.Therefore, according to embodiments of the invention, the FFT of those null subcarrier exports the existence that may be used for detecting ACI.
